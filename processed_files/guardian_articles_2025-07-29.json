Last Tuesday,Keir Starmerbatted away all invitations to recognise the state of Palestine. It wasn’t happening. Keir was committed to being appalled by the situation in Gaza but not appalled enough to do anything about it.He then received a letter from more than 250 MPs, including some cabinet ministers, later in the week begging him to recognise the state of Palestine. He still stonewalled. The time was not yet right.Not even the opinion polls that showed most of the UK population supported the recognition of Palestine could move him. Keir knew best. Safety first. Don’t do anything to rock the boat.Few were expecting that much of the emergency cabinet meeting to discussGaza. Some slightly stronger words to reflect the level of feeling among some cabinet ministers maybe. But still leaving himself some wriggle room. A balancing act that was sure to leave almost everyone feeling unhappy.But then the readout. The message was unequivocal. The UK was going to recognise the state of Palestine before the next meeting of the UN general assembly in September unless the Israelis got their act together and committed to a ceasefire, allowed substantial aid into Gaza, got serious about a long-term peace plan, withdrew from the West Bank and accepted a two-state solution.Moments later, Starmer popped up in the Downing Street media room for a brief, five-minute statement to confirm the government’s position. The time for action had come. No more equivocation or delay. It could be sooner, it could be later, but there was no way of blocking a Palestinian state. Hamas had to release the hostages and step aside. Benjamin Netanyahu had to act in good faith or accept the inevitable. The UK could no longer stand to one side and watch a humanitarian disaster unfold.In a neat piece of timing, no sooner had Keir finished addressing the UK than David Lammy came on stage at the UN to repeat the message. The UK was done with pleading with both sides to act responsibly. The UN had passed resolution after resolution, demanding that the war in the Middle East come to an end and aid got through to a starving civilian population.Enough was enough. Britain had played a unique role in the history of the area with the Balfour declaration and the creation of a Jewish homeland. But the UK had also made a promise to the Palestinian people that they should have the right to their own land and to live in peace. Now was the time to no longer pay lip service to the idea of a two-state solution and right the historical injustice.“I feel the hand of history on our shoulders,” Lammy said in a deliberate echo of Tony Blair’s words on the Northern Ireland peace process. The chamber broke out in spontaneous applause as he left the stage after confirming that the UK would recognise the state of Palestine in just over a month’s time.It was also a sign that Keir had played a blinder during his meeting with President Trump in Scotland the day before. That hadn’t been the easiest day out for the prime minister. But Starmer has proved himself to be one of the best wranglers of The Donald on the world stage. Knowing when to keep his mouth shut and let Agent Orange just ramble.A narcissist is always going to be greedy for attention and Keir had been happy to sit back and let Trump be Trump. Let him boast about having ended six wars – though weirdly The Donald had reined that back to just five in a media appearance on Tuesday. Almost certainly still five too many, but no one was counting. Let him indulge his own vanity. Give him the Nobel peace prize if he really wants it. There were bigger prizes on offer. And the biggest of them all had been Gaza.There will still be some who think the UK could have reached this position weeks ago. But Keir was not bothered about them. He’s a man who operates at his own pace and to his own lawyerly methods. Everything must be squared away. No surprises left.This had been a good day for Starmer and the UK. A better day for the starving Palestinians. A day when a world leader had shown some leadership.

Here too, almost, is Battle of Hastings belter King & Conqueror (BBC, August). And Spartacus: House of Ashur (Starz, this winter). Also in the period-specific pipeline are second series for Disney+’s brilliant Shogun and Amazon Prime’s terrible House of David.Historical epics, it would not be unreasonable to say, are everywhere.But which are the best and which should be catapulted, screaming, across a poorly rendered CGI battlefield? Given their abundance, some arbitrary judging criteria are clearly in order. Hence: no “fantasy” nonsense (ie Game of Thrones) and nothing set after the early 1800s, the latter on the grounds that a) there are too many of the sods and b) Julian “Downton Bloody Abbey” Fellowes has effectively tucked the era under his top hat and run off with it while honking like an overprivileged goose.Let battle commenceth…The BestChief of War (2025)View image in fullscreenHeartfelt storytelling … (from left) Te Kohe Tuhaka, Jason Momoa and Siua Ikale’o in Chief of War.Photograph: Nicola Dove/APA barrel-chested wodge of Big History in which mountainous creator and co-writer Jason Momoa thunders through the based-on-true-events that led to the late 18thcentury unification and, ultimately, colonisation of his native Hawaii. And it’s brilliant; from its predominantly Polynesian cast to the sense of doom that swirls perpetually around the scenic foothills of Mount Momoa. It may lean a touch too heavily on extended, subtitled brawls in which there is much [grunting], but this is heartfelt storytelling; as muscular and sincere as its loinclothed protagonist.Vikings (2013-20)Startlingly brutal middle ages od(in)yssey in which mud-caked peasants duck from the flailing mace of progress/death and Norsemen with calves like bowling balls stagger across fjords, their complexions suggesting they may not be getting their five a day. There are the obligatory fireside frottageings, but this is clever stuff, with complex characters, an atmosphere of thunderously oppressive gloom and dialogue that does not make one long to inter oneself, sobbing, in a flaming longship.Shōgun (2024-)View image in fullscreenTadanobu Asano as Kashigi Yabushige in Shogun.Photograph: Katie Yu/APThe second adaptation of James Clavell’s 1,100-page clomp through the late Sengoku period of feudal Japan, this US-produced saga leaves its beloved 1980 predecessor spluttering in its backwash, the latter’s once sacrosanct USP (Richard Chamberlain blinking expressionlessly in a kimono) unable to compete with the former’s rich, knotty script, riveting characterisation and steadfast attention to historical detail. Cue stoic samurai, scurvy-ridden sailors and preoccupied warlords in a succession of exquisitely indifferent terrains and everyone else sprinting for cover as the whole shebang is (justly) pelted with Emmys.I, Claudius (1976)Yes, the pace is slow, the sets perfunctory and the wigs apparently assembled from the contents of a vacuum cleaner. But still, 50 years on, the BBC’s adaptation of Robert Graves’ novels on the bastardry of the early Roman empire remains one of TV’s finest achievements, with an unapologetically adult script and magnificent, pillar-rattling performances from John Hurt, Siân Phillips and Derek Jacobi, the last assisted by prosthetic makeup and a false nose that could dislodge the cobwebs from a triumphal arch.Wolf Hall(2015 and 2024)View image in fullscreenPrestige drama … Mark Rylance and Ellie de Lange in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light.Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/Playground EntertainmentAn object lesson, here, in how to deliver prestige historical drama without recourse to bums or bombast. Instead, there are exquisitely layered performances (Damian Lewis, Jonathan Pryce), quiet, adult explorations of difficult, adult things (grief, ageing) and many, many candlelit silences into which Mark Rylance’s Thomas Cromwell glides, his expression, as always, that of a ferret saddened by developments in France. A monumental achievement, obviously, and in director Peter Kosminsksy and scriptwriter Peter Straughan’s hands, a near-perfect adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s three-piece masterpiece.The WorstThe Borgias (2011-13)View image in fullscreenPlot? What plot? … Lotte Verbeek and Jeremy Irons in season 2 of The Borgias.Photograph: c Showtime/Everett/Rex FeaturesRome, 1492, and the Vatican is besieged by filth as director/co-creator Neil Jordan takes a stiff quill to non-secular skulduggery. Cue: tumescent priests, pouting strumpets and a never-wearier Jeremy Irons as Pope Shagger VI. Here, historical integrity is something to be bent over and humped, unconvincingly, behind a net curtain. The script? Pfft. The acting? Tsk. The plot? Possibly, although it’s tricky to concentrate on the dynastic machinations of 15th century Italy when Irons in a mitre keeps shouting “WHORE”.The Cleopatras (1983)A catastrophic attempt by the BBC to replicate the success of I, Claudius by squeezing Grade II-listed hams into togas and forcing them to SHOUT at punishing length about the PTOLEMAIC DYNASTY in what appears to be an abandoned REGIONAL LEISURE CENTRE. The upshot? Tedium. Plus? Bald caps, flagrant boobery, Richard Griffiths “working” a “smoky eye”, the line “Let’s get out of Egypt!”and trembling extras gulping in horror as the plot catapults yet another flaming ball of exposition at the studio floor.Spartacus (2010-13)Manacled jocks go loincloth to loincloth in a US production comprised almost entirely of buttocks. There is, occasionally, other stuff: blood, knockers, airborne viscera, Americans in sandals decapitating other Americans while shouting “ass”, some “plot” or other involving revenge, John Hannah (as dastardly slave trader Batiatus) bellowing “BY JUPITER’S COCK!” at 30-second intervals etc. But it is mainly buttocks. Watch it on fast-forward and it’s like being shot in the face by a pump-action bum-gun.The Musketeers (2014-16)One, two, swashbuckle my shoe: abject “international co-production” tosh here from the Beeb as Alexandre Dumas’s novels are reimagined for whichever generation it is that is supposed to be interested in this sort of thing. And lo, much adolescent tomfoolery doth ensue, with PG-rated punch-ups, tiresome hunks smirking in pleather and dialogue of the “Things just got complicated!” genus. The result? Hollycloaks. Peter Capaldi does his best as Cardinal Richelieu but it would take more than thigh boots and nostril-flaring to lighten this particular load.The Tudors (2007-10)View image in fullscreenDancing a merry jig on historical accuracy … Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Joss Stone in The Tudors.Photograph: Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockVerily, my liege, this idiot Canadian-Irish co-production does dance a merry jig upon the very concept of historical accuracy, with its Irish Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), its ripped courtiers and Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves. There is the occasional grudging nod to Actual Historical Stuff (the Reformation, wives etc). But it’s mostly just Henry banging his way around Tudor England, his bum cheeks jack-hammering with such ferocity that they are little more than a meaty blur, like a deli counter viewed from the top deck of a speeding bus in the rain.Chief of War is on Apple TV+ from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPeriod drama (TV)featuresShareReuse this content"

The groundwork is already being doneTue 29 Jul 2025 09.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 13.46 EDTShareRoll up! Roll up! TheGhislaine MaxwellRehabilitation Tour is coming to town. You may think Jeffrey Epstein’s associate and former girlfriend is now behind bars for good reason but, according to some big brains in the Maga-sphere, poor old Maxwell may have suffered a terrible miscarriage of justice.Maxwell “just might be a victim”, Newsmax anchor Greg Kellymused on air recently. “She just might be. There was a rush to judgment … All right, granted, she hung out with Jeffrey Epstein, and I know that’s apparently not good, but she’s in jail. For how long now? Twenty years.”To discuss this further, Kelly brought on Alan Dershowitz, whom he introduced as “one of the greatest attorneys who ever lived”. Which certainly isn’t how I’d describe the retired Harvard professor.Dershowitz, who helped procure alenient plea dealfor Epstein in 2008, alsowrote an op-ed for the LA Timesin 1997 headlined Statutory Rape Is an Outdated Concept, in which he argued 15 seems “appropriate” for the age of consent. Dershowitz suggested some “reasonable people” might even favour 14 – which happens to be the age of some ofEpstein’s victims. When that op-ed resurfaced in 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Dershowitzdefended it, saying he stood by “the constitutional (not moral) argument” offered.Dershowitz now reckons Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on five counts of aiding Epstein in his abuse of underage girls andsentenced to 20 yearsin federal prison in 2022, has suffered enough. “She shouldn’t have been in jail for five years for what she is alleged to have done,” Dershowitztold Newsmax on Sunday. “She served more time than anybody has ever served for any comparable offence.”I’m sure I don’t need to spell out why others seem to be attempting to rebrand Maxwell as the victim of a stitch-up. The Epstein files have turned into a disaster of Trump’s own making. He hasn’t been able to distract people from the story, so now there is speculation that he is trying to make some sort of deal with Maxwell. Who, by the way, had secretive conversations with Trump’s department of justice last week and, on Monday, asked thesupreme court to overturn her conviction, saying she was unjustly prosecuted. One can imagine a scenario in which Maxwell releases a few select details about Epstein that absolve Trump and make his enemies look bad in exchange for a pardon. (“I’m allowed to give her a pardon but nobody’s approached me with it,” Trump said on Monday.) However, for that hypothetical strategy to be successful, Maxwell’s reputation needs to be rehabilitated. She would need to look like a victim rather than a monster.Which is where Newsmax, and its sudden interest in Maxwell, might help. The cable news channel, which is to the right of Fox News, is essentially a pro-Trumppropaganda outletwith strong financial ties to the president. Earlier this month the outlet announced that it hadstruck a dealfor the Trump Media and Technology Group Corp to stream Newsmax on its platform. Which obviously raises a lot of conflict-of-interest questions. “This is now the Trump network,” one Newsmax insider complained tothe Independent last week. “Even the most conservative people at Newsmax think it’s a terrible look and they feel like state-run media.” Also raising questions is the fact that Alex Acosta, the prosecutor who gave Epsteinthat plea dealin 2008, happens to be onthe board of Newsmax.I don’t know what will happen next with Maxwell, but I can tell you that I absolutely believe the women Epstein abused over anchors on Trump’s propaganda channel. And I believe those women over Maxwell herself. Epstein’s accusershave repeatedly been clearthat Maxwell was no victim. “She didn’t just procure girls for Epstein – she participated in their abuse,” accuser Annie Farmertold ABC News on Monday. Now it’s looking increasingly likely that, instead of releasing the Epstein files, Trump will release Maxwell instead.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For her new film, Swiss director Petra Volpe imagined the consequences of just one missed shift on a busy night at a hospital, and found herself making a disaster movie.With Late Shift, Volpe aimed to shine a light on the frontlines of the looming healthcare catastrophe through the eyes of the dedicated, exhausted Floria. Played by German actor Leonie Benesch, the young nurse shows an initially acrobatic grace in her workday, whose first half resembles a particularly hectic episode of the restaurant kitchen series The Bear, but with life-and-death stakes.Arriving for her shift cheery and energetic and taking the time to ask about her colleague’s recent holiday, Floria soon hears that another nurse has called in sick. The looming workload suddenly grows exponentially, compounding the stress and driving up the likelihood she will make a fateful mistake.The Swiss-born Volpe says she chose the film’s German titleHeldin(Heroine) because it took a mythic term often reserved for warriors and applied it to the bravery and self-sacrifice of care work.View image in fullscreen‘The work is extremely complex and emotionally charged’ … Leonie Benesch in Late Shift.Photograph: Salvatore Vinci“This work, which is extremely complex and emotionally charged, is completely devalued in our societies,” Volpe says. “I find it very symptomatic because it’s women’s work – 80% of the people [in many countries] who do this work are female.”Volpe was inspired by a longtime roommate who worked as a nurse, and by the autobiographical novel Our Profession Is Not the Problem – It’s the Circumstances by German former care worker Madeline Calvelage, who advised her on the script.“My heart was pounding from the first chapter and I thought to myself – this reads like a thriller,” Volpe says. “But within that stress you find the most tender, human moments.”The film revolves around the escalating and competing needs of patients on a hospital ward, with a different set of medical and emotional demands lurking behind each door, signalled to the staff by a shrieking call bell.Benesch’s turbo-driven career has already included roles on The Crown and Babylon Berlin as well as film parts in Michael Haneke’s The White Ribbon, Munich Olympics attacks drama September 5 and German Oscar nominee The Teachers’ Lounge. She says a common thread in her most recent characters is “people who burn for what they do”. But she notes it was rare in TV medical dramas to see nurses and their everyday feats front and centre.View image in fullscreenNursing staff from various hospitals in Berlin demonstrate in front of the Zoo Palast on the fringes of the premiere of Heldin in February.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy“You’re used to getting the physicians as the heroes and then in the backdrop a nurse might hang an infusion bag or drink a coffee or have an affair with the senior doctor,” Benesch says. “Before this it wasn’t clear to me how much of the actual medical responsibility rests on nurses’ shoulders.”Benesch, who trained at London’s Guildhall School of Music & Drama, said she spent several shifts trailing real nurses at a Swiss hospital to learn the “choreography” of interactions between staff and patients, and the manual skills of prepping a syringe or taking blood pressure. “I wanted real nurses not to be able to tell the difference between me and a professional,” she says. “I just hope people aren’t scared off by a film with subtitles because the story is absolutely universal.”Late Shift has stoked heated policy reform debates and proved a critical and box office success in German-speaking Europe, even besting the latest Bridget Jones movie in Swiss cinemas.At the world premiere at theBerlin film festivalin February, several nurses were invited to appear in their uniforms on the red carpet and take the stage after the screening for a round of applause. Days beforeGermany’s general election, some held #wirsindfloria (We Are Floria) signs.One of those guests was Ingo Böing, 47, who worked in hospitals for a quarter century and is now on staff at the German Association ofNursingProfessionals, which lobbies for better conditions for care workers. “It was incredibly moving,” he says of the film gala. “Watching several of the scenes I thought ‘Wow, that’s really how it is.’”Böing says Late Shift does a convincing job depicting the “vicious circle” of nursing, in which people working at the absolute limits of their strength call in sick at short notice, leaving those who show up for duty with an even more daunting task. “It’s that feeling of trying to meet so many needs at once and not managing,” he adds.He says waiting lists like those used by the NHS in Britain, although frustrating for patients, would help hospitals in Germany better prioritise while keeping medical staff from getting overstretched.Franziska Aurich, 28, who works on a cancer ward at Berlin’s Charité hospital, also found the film “very close to reality”. Asked what she’d advise Floria, Aurich says: “I would say go back to work tomorrow because like her I can’t imagine doing anything else with my life. But join a union, so you don’t have as many shifts like this one.”Late Shift review – pressure is on in badly understaffed hospital as compassion shines throughRead moreVolpe, who divides her time between Berlin and New York, says she was gratified to see nurses going in groups to see the film, and hopes it will make the rest of the audience into better patients. “Nurses should be at the very top of our social hierarchy but we live in a world where it’s just the opposite,” she says. “This film is a love letter to the profession.”While the film is set in Europe’s creaking but still intact social infrastructure, Volpe said she saw in the US whereDonald Trump’s swingeing cuts to Medicaid,which mainly serves poor and disabled people, threatened to hurt the most vulnerable. “You see a great cruelty in all these measures,” she says.“Elon Musk said he saw empathy as the biggest problem of our timewhich is of course completely monstrous. The least an artist can do is to push back against that. Sooner or later we’re all going to be dependent on that person standing by the bed.”Late Shift will be released in the UK and Ireland on 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmNursingHealthWorld cinemaSwitzerlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They scribble over each other’s drawings, scrawl in each other’s notebooks, push each other, inspire each other. Their work has been on every Radiohead album cover since 1995’s The Bends, every Yorke solo record, every poster and every T-shirt. Nothing is farmed out to designers or agencies – Radiohead’s visual identity has been fully overseen by Donwood and Yorke.And now, in a homecoming of sorts for local hero Yorke, their artistic output is being celebrated at Oxford’sAshmolean Museum. There’s no doubt that Donwood and Yorke, who met while studying at the University of Exeter, have created some of the most recognisable, ubiquitous and maybe even iconic album covers of their generation. But do they make sense in a huge, historic gallery such as the Ashmolean? Does any of it make for good art? Does it stand up to scrutiny when removed from the context of the records and merchandise it was designed for? It’s a nice dream, but nope.It feels as though you are in a very hip but dour record shopThe exhibition starts with LPs, CDs, posters and T-shirts arranged as though you are in a very hip but dour record shop. The gasping, deathly resuscitation dummy of The Bends; the ghostly schematics and angry doodles of OK Computer; the weeping little fella of Amnesiac; the mountains of Kid A; the multicoloured poetry of Hail to the Thief; the woodcuts of Yorke’s The Eraser. This is how the work was meant to be seen, this is the context it works best in: arranged as if in racks, as if you could pull a record off the wall and play it.View image in fullscreenRadiohead’s visual identity has been fully overseen by Yorke and Donwood.Photograph: Julian Broad, courtesy of Tin Man ArtDonwood clearly has an issue with art galleries. “They’re just intimidating – it’s not very democratic,” says a quote of his on the wall. “Whereas you go into a record shop and it’s full of all kinds of oiks.” I’m not sure I buy into this. Record shops can have exactly the same atmosphere of sneering exclusivity as galleries. There’s a touchiness here that makes the show feel a little bitter. Guys, you’re in the Ashmolean. You’re not kicking against the establishment, you’re in it.The exhibition goes album by album, with sketchbooks and paintings displayed to lay bare their creative process. Everything is jointly attributed, positioning Yorke and Donwood as equals.View image in fullscreenUntitled poster, 1997.OK Computer sets an unfairly high bar early on in the show. The 1997 album captured the era’s zeitgeist with its anxious teardown of corporate facelessness, technological paranoia and capitalist excess. It still resonates, as does its sense of isolation and loneliness in a world where you’re constantly surrounded by people. The artwork looked like nothing else of its era: featuring a motorway overlaid with airplane safety manuals and the ghosts of people rushing by, the cover image looks how the music sounds – cold, frustrated, isolated, desperate. A brilliant meeting of music and album artwork.But it works infinitely better as a CD insert. You gain almost nothing by seeing these digital images enlarged, framed and plonked on a gallery wall.Radiohead would struggle to capture the moment again in quite the way they did with OK Computer. The same goes for the art. Donwood and Yorke made vast, bleak acrylic paintings for the covers of Kid A and Amnesiac. Eight canvases are displayed here and they are an unbelievable mess: badly composed, poorly executed, smudgy, splodgy, confused landscapes that even the RA Summer Exhibition would reject. The paintings of spiders and trees for 2011’s King of Limbs are even worse; sub-A Level attempts at Max Ernst that almost make me embarrassed for them.View image in fullscreenInoffensive … London Views (6 of 14), lino cut print block.Photograph: Ellie AtkinsThe woodcuts for Yorke’s solo albums are less visually offensive, and the ultra-colourful paintings of rivers and forests for the most recent albums by his other band the Smile work better as artworks, but are still quite a distance from anything you’d call brilliant.The art of Radiohead sleeve designer Stanley Donwood – in picturesRead morePlenty of the work here, especially from the 90s and early 2000s, has entered the wider public consciousness in a way that proves album artwork has cultural heft. It matters. It has an impact. But that doesn’t mean any of it is especially good, or even interesting, as art.If you’re a Radiohead fan, there is tons of insight and detail here to keep you happy, but from an art perspective it is a succession of bad paintings. Donwood and Yorke probably shouldn’t have put themselves in this position, but they did it to themselves, and that’s what really hurts.This Is What You Get: Stanley Donwood, Radiohead, Thom Yorke is at theAshmolean Museum, Oxford, from 6 August to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtRadioheadPaintingExhibitionsAshmolean MuseumThom YorkereviewsShareReuse this content"

The right pair will marry practicality with aesthetics.For this guide, I scoured the market high and low, and spoke to friends with different needs, styles, budgets and face shapes (read the guidance below for more on choosing the right pair for your face shape) to find the best sunglasses for men and women. Having lost or broken all my existing pairs, I also went on an odyssey for the perfect replacement.

The brand makes simple but effective frames in fun colours – these are particularly lovely inhoney yellow.What you need to look forThe right shape for your faceWhen it comes to finding the right sunglasses, face shape is important. “For a square face, we’d say to go for an oval or a softly rounded frame with soft edges,” says Katie Jennings, senior brand and PR manager at Jimmy Fairly. “Choose a frame that’s slightly narrower than your face.”For rounded faces, Jennings suggests “slim frames with pronounced angles, such as the cat-eye, to elongate and add definition”. And “if you’ve got more of a triangular or pear face, we’d recommend oversized square or round frames – bigger frame choices to balance out your features”. For oval faces, “most frames work really well”, although “rectangular frames or rounded frames will add softness”, while “more rectangular [ones] have a more confident look”.Features are important, too. Jennings has a general rule: if you have softer features, you should generally pick a more angular shape, and vice versa. “You basically choose glasses of the opposite shape.” Perhaps it is why for people like me and John Lennon, of the pointy nose gang, round styles work better.Helpfully, many sunglasses brands offer their own guides online, such asthis onefrom Izipizi. But there is no better way to tell than by putting them on your face for real. So if you can, always try before you buy.Ellie Violet Bramley is a writer who has been delving into style and what it means for nearly a decade – mostly for the Guardian’s fashion deskExplore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterAccessoriesMen's fashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The US president said the issue had not come up, but that he did “not mind” the UK taking a position, even if he would not.Why is UK preparing to recognise Palestinian statehood?Read moreStarmer told his ministers that, because of the catastrophic situation on the ground inGazaand the diminishing prospect of reaching a two-state solution, now was the right time to finally move.“Ultimately, the only way to bring this humanitarian crisis to an end is through a long-term settlement,” he told reporters. “Our goal remains a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state, but right now, that goal is under pressure like never before.”He added: “I have always said that we will recognise a Palestinian state as a contribution to a proper peace process, at the moment of maximum impact for the two-state solution. With that solution now under threat, this is the moment to act.”UN-backed experts said a “worst-case scenario of famine” was playing out in Gaza as the World Food Programme (WFP) described the hunger crisis in the territory as the worst seen this century, comparing it to previous famines in Ethiopia and Biafra. Israel has denied its actions in Gaza have caused famine.It came as the death toll from Israeli attacks in the war passed 60,000 people according to Gaza health ministry figures, almost half of them women and children.Israel has repeatedly limited aid trucks reaching Gaza during 22 months of war, and halted shipments entirely for six weeks at the start of the war, and between March and mid-May this year.Shipments are below levels needed to cover basic needs and the WFP says only about half of the aid it has requested to enter Gaza is reaching the territory after Israel eased restrictions over the weekend.In a significant shift in the UK’s approach, Starmer said that recognition would take place before the UN general assembly in New York this September, unless Israel agreed to a series of conditions set out in the UK-led eight-point peace plan, and backed by allies.These were for Israel to take “substantive steps” to end the situation in Gaza, reach a ceasefire, commit to no annexation in the West Bank, as well as a long-term peace process. Starmer spoke to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, before the announcement.Israel’s foreign ministry last night told Starmer it “rejects” his statement, which it said on social media site X amounted to a “reward for Hamas”.“The shift in the British government’s position at this time, following the French move and internal political pressures, constitutes a reward for Hamas and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages,” it added.Netanyahu posted on X that Starmer had rewarded “Hamas’s monstrous terrorism”.“A jihadist state on Israel’s border today will threaten Britain tomorrow,” he added.The UK government also repeated its existing demands of Hamas, which it said must release all hostages immediately, disarm, sign up to a ceasefire and accept it would play no role in the government of Gaza.“We’ll make an assessment in September on how far the parties have met these steps, but no one should have a veto over our decision,” the prime minister added.However, there was some domestic pushback from the Liberal Democrats and the Greens against the government using the prospect of statehood as a “bargaining chip”. They both argued the UK should recognise Palestine immediately.The UK roadmap follows an agreement to work towards “lasting peace” in the region with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, at the weekend. Starmer spent Tuesday evening on calls to allies.After their talks in Scotland on Monday, Trump removed a key obstacle to the UK recognising a Palestinian state, signalling the US – one of Israel’s strongest backers – would not object to such a move. He alsoexpressed concernat images of children starving in the territory.However, a spokesperson for the US state department on Tuesday evening called Starmer’s remarks a “slap in the face for the victims of October 7”.“It gives one group hope, and that’s Hamas. It is a rewarding of that kind of behaviour,” Tammy Bruce said, adding: “There’s one group that benefits from the images, the reality of the horribleness, and that’s Hamas. And so there’s a reason why they don’t cooperate and stop.”Downing Street had insisted that formal recognition of Palestine was a matter of “when, not if”, with the Labour government facing calls to take further action as UK public opinion hardened over horrific scenes on the ground.Britons are in favour of recognition by more than three to one, according to polling by Survation, which shows 49% of people in favour, and only 13% opposed. It also suggested that, by a margin of almost five to one, people wanted the government to be more critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza.Starmer told reporters the humanitarian situation, which was “getting worse by the day”, was behind the timing of the UK’s decision, along with concerns that the possibility of a two-state solution was receding. The UK has worked with Jordan to drop 20 tonnes of aid by air in recent days.“We’ve been saying for some considerable time now we need to get more aid in at volume and at speed, and the situation now is absolutely catastrophic, which is why I’ve taken this decision today in relation to the two-state solution and the recognition of Palestine,” he said.The Guardianrevealed last weekthat Starmer was under pressure from cabinet ministers for the UK to immediately recognise Palestine as a state, joining almost 140 other countries, as global outcry grew over Israel’s killing of starving civilians in Gaza.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister,Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, are understood to have been among them, while more than a third of Labour MPs signed a letter backing recognition.Announcing the move at the UN, foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK hoped it could affect the situation on the ground in Gaza over the next eight weeks.He added the UK, which first supported the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine in 1917, bore a “special burden of responsibility” to back a two-state solution.“The Netanyahu government’s rejection of a two-state solution is wrong; it’s wrong morally; and it’s wrong strategically. It harms the interests of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace,” he said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

The president said on Monday that he had kicked Epstein out of his club “because he did something that was inappropriate” – specifically, that “he stole people that worked for me”.Ghislaine Maxwell is not a victim. And if she is pardoned, it won’t be for the sake of justice | Arwa MahdawiRead moreSenior White House aides have repeatedly suggested in recent weeks that Trump broke with Epstein in about 2004 and expelled him from the Mar-a-Lago club for inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature. In a statement last week, spokesperson Steven CheungsaidTrump “kicked him out of his club for being a creep”.The president’s account of the break being motivated by pique at having his employees poached by his friend cast the break in a different light.On Tuesday,a reporter asked Trump: “The workers that were taken from you – were some of them young women?”Trump replied: “The answer is yes, they were. People that worked in the spa.”Another reporter then asked Trump if one of the people he was referring to was Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers who said ina lawsuitthat she was hired away from the Mar-a-Lago spa by Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000, when she was 16.Giuffre,who died this year, alleged in her complaint that she was first abused by Epstein and Maxwell together, and then “lent out to other powerful men”, including Prince Andrew.“I think she worked at the spa,” Trump replied. “I think so. I think that was one of the people, yeah. He stole her. And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know. None whatsoever.”The president and his administration are working desperately to change the subject away from Epstein – an issue that has lately roiled his base. But his latest claim that one of those employees was the 16-year-old Giuffre also complicates the timeline. Giuffre was hired away fromMar-a-Lagoin 2000, but two years later, Trump spoke highly of Epstein to a reporter.“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump toldNew York magazinein late 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”Sarah Blaskey, a Miami Herald investigative reporter, alsopointed outin her 2020 book on Mar-a-Lago that Epstein remained on the membership rolls of Mar-a-Lago until October 2007, more than a year after he was first arrested and charged with soliciting prostitution from a minor.Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for conspiring with Epstein to sexually traffic minors, has offered to testify before Congress but has asked lawmakers to give her immunity, along with other major conditions, according to a list of demands sent to the House oversight committee by her attorneys,seen by CNN.Lauren Gambino contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJeffrey EpsteinMar-a-LagoFloridaGhislaine MaxwellnewsShareReuse this content"

But this is a safe community.”Coyle urged any witness to contact the police, adding: “My message to the community is this: if you saw anything, please come forward. And if you didn’t, but you’re worried, know that this remains a safe area.”Police were called to reports of stabbings inside a commercial address in Long Lane, Southwark, at 1pm on Monday. The Metropolitan police said the attack was not being treated as terror-related and detectives from its specialist crime command were leading the investigation.Officers said the next of kin of the victims had been informed, and were being supported by specialist officers.DCS Emma Bond, who leads policing for the area, said: “Our thoughts are, first and foremost, with the family and friends of the victims of this tragic incident. Our investigation continues at pace and we are working hard to understand the full circumstances.“I understand there may be concern in the local community and there will be an increased police presence in the area over the coming days. I would also encourage anyone who may be worried to speak to an officer.”Scotland Yard said the incident took place in a “business premises”, and added: “A crime scene is in place at a nearby hotel where the arrested man went into. We are aware of speculation the man was staying at the hotel – this is not the case.”The stabbings are understood to have taken place near the property development firm the Trademark Group, where the victims worked.A resident, who asked not to be named, told the PA news agency: “It’s terrifying. I walk past there all the time – it makes you feel really uneasy. You just don’t expect something like this to happen on a normal weekday.”Natasha Ennin, Southwark council’s cabinet member for community safety and neighbourhoods, said on Monday: “I’m horrified and deeply saddened by the deaths of two men in our borough. My heartfelt condolences go to their families and friends.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

It is designed to ensure continuity of service while the company is stabilised and restructured.There is a bespoke special administration regime (SAR) for the water industry, which was created in 1991 and is designed to prioritise customers and services while putting financial interests second.Reed has saidthat the government is stepping up preparations to take Thames Water into special administration, indicating he will reject pleas from the company’s creditors for leniency from fines and penalties.Thames Water’s largest creditors control the utility and have made efforts tocut some of its debts and have offered to provide £5.3bnin new funding to try to turn it around.But River Action’s head of legal, Emma Dearnaley, said the time to use the SAR process was now. “Enough is enough,” she said. “Why hasn’t the secretary of state used special administration to fix the water sector, starting with ThamesWater?“The government has the power but won’t use it, or even explain when it might trigger this process. Apparently, the government has no policy at all. That’s a fundamental failure of transparency and accountability, and it’s unlawful.”River Action has lodged an application for a judicial review against the secretary of state.The claim argues that the government has failed to publish its policy on when it would use the SAR process, breaching core public law duties, and that ministers have failed to develop a policy at all, breaching obligations under habitats regulations and other planning and environmental laws.Under section 24 of the Water Industry Act 1991, special administration can be triggered by a water company’s failure to meet performance standards, including environmental pollution, and a breach of its statutory or licence duties in ways that are “serious enough to make it inappropriate for the company to continue to hold its licence”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Teenage boys withEnglandflags painted on their faces, little girls in their Saturday morning club kits, veteran fans of the women’s game, new fans who just wanted to savour the moment.A total of 65,000 jubilant England fans lined the Mall in central London on Tuesday to welcome home the victorious Lionesses after theirEuro 2025 victoryon Sunday.“I just wanted to be part of history,” said Joanne Rumsby, 58, an England flag over her shoulders and a red and white flower garland wrapped around her head. “I saw them win at Wembley three years ago, but to see them win again was everything.

They could not fail to.From the top of the “champions”-branded open-top bus they danced, waved and appeared to be having the time of their lives, before taking to the stage in front of the Queen Victoria Memorial outside Buckingham Palace.It’s staying home: England’s road to Euro 2025 glory – in picturesRead more“I’ve been crying all the way down the Mall,” said the team captain,Leah Williamson, when handed a microphone by the former England player turned broadcaster Alex Scott. “This is unbelievable.”Williamson acknowledged that the team’s second major tournament trophy had been won “the hard way” – with last-minute equalisers, three consecutive spells of extra time and a series of nail-biting penalty shootouts.“Everything we do, obviously we do it for the team, but we do it for you, we do it for the country, we do it for young girls,” she said. “Thank you so much for being with us. Stay with us. This story is not done yet.”Listening to the team bask in accolades with a broad grin on her face was 49-year-old Beth Magee. She said she had scaled a wall separating VIPs from the crowds below, aided by her three teenage daughters Ella, Martha and Rosie.“I’ve never broken a rule in my life, but I made an exception to see this today,” she said. “When the police tried to move us I said to my daughters: ‘I’ll speak to them, girls, but we won’t be moving.’”0:49'it's unbelievable': Alexandra Topping from the Lioness parade through London – videoPointing to the team on stage, she added: “These women are such incredible role models – they are strong, healthy and smart and we are so proud of them.”The Lionesses have been vocal about their desire to inspire the next generation of players, and the influence of their first Euros victory in 2022 was everywhere during the victory parade. In the season following that trophy,1,500 new teams were registeredin England, with the number of girls and women playing the game increasing by more than 50%.Among them was 55-year-old Vivienne Avery. “I literally started the week after they won,” she said. “I saw a course and I thought it’s now or never.

The impact will be huge.”Just what it meant for the European champions was clear as they requested more songs after the end of the homecoming event.View image in fullscreenSome of the celebrating fans on the Mall.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDuring the slightly unhinged, but entirely jubilant show – at one point Chloe Kelly caused an instant headache for live broadcasters by yelling “It’s so fucking special!” – the usually uber-controlled England manager,Sarina Wiegman, danced with her favourite singer Burna Boy, who joined the squad on stage to sing For My Hand.Asked what she thought of fans singing Tequila by the Champs, with her name replacing Mexico’s most-famous export, the Lionesses head coach gave a wry smile.“Very innovative and funny, the English,” she said. “It’s in my head all the time now so thank you.”Asked how the victory was different than in 2022, she said: “We kept having hope. It starts with talent, the bonding in this team made the absolute difference. Everybody was ready to support each other.”Looking out across the vast swathes of fans, England’s talisman Lucy Bronze said the response to the victory had been amazing.“This moment is unbelievable,” she said, wearing her trademark skiing sunglasses and an England scarf wrapped around her head. “Obviously we did it three years ago but to come back to this is incredible.”Asked how the party was after the final – which the England defender had played, she later revealed,with a fractured left tibia– she deadpanned: “I don’t remember.”View image in fullscreenThe singer Burna Boy performs with Sarina Wiegman on stage.Photograph: Adam Davy/ReutersWith the show over and the final dances done, the fans started to leave past Buckingham Palace, the strains of Sweet Caroline and Daft Punk’s One More Time – played as the team raised their trophy in a shower of ticker tape and red and white pyrotechnics – still ringing in their ears.“It has made me want to play a lot more,” said nine-year-old Eva Mummery, who had travelled from Gloucestershire with her friends from the Gotherington Jaguars under-11s. “I want to get up to a higher level of football to hopefully bring home that trophy one day with all my amazing teammates.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballWomen’s Euro 2025LondonLeah WilliamsonSarina WiegmanEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The likelihood may have increased since then given that vaping and smoking rates among teenagers have both risen in the past seven years.VapingThe academics wrote that although the research did not establish a causal link, their findings were “especially concerning” given the rising popularity of vaping, “despite some initial assurances that e-cigarettes would have little appeal to [adolescents]”.“The success of previous tobacco control efforts and broad shifts in intergenerational risk factors in reducing risk of cigarette smoking may be mitigated when adolescents use e-cigarettes,” they wrote.Figures compiled by Action on Smoking and Healththis year show that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain have tried vaping, an estimated 1.1 million children. This was the same level as in 2023, after the number of children using vapes in the previous three years had tripled. Smoking among youths also increased from 14% in 2023 to 21% in 2025.The research, led by the University of Michigan andpublishedin the Tobacco Control journal, drew on intergenerational data from three nationally representative birth cohorts of UK teens born in 1958, 1970 and 2001.The overall likelihood of cigarette smoking for an average teen (aged 16 or 17) was calculated as 30% for those born in 1958, 22% for those born in 1970, and 9.5% for those born in 2001.Number of vape shops in England rises by almost 1,200% in a decadeRead moreThe odds of smoking among 16- and 17-year-olds were estimated based on a common set of childhood risk factors, which included teen vaping for the youngest cohort. Some sociodemographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity, were unaccounted for due to insufficient sample sizes in the earlier cohorts.Risk factors included whether they had ever drunk alcohol by age 16 or 17; how engaged they were with education at school; poor impulse control reported by the main caregiver at ages 10 or 11; and parental occupation, education and smoking behaviour – including during pregnancy. The researchers found these risks remained broadly similar across the three cohorts.Analysis showed a steep decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking among teens, falling from 33% in 1974 to 25% in 1986 and 12% in 2018.The researchers suggested the decline in the prevalence of teen smoking was the result of tobacco control laws, better public understanding of the health impacts of smoking and a shift away from the perception of smoking as socially acceptable.The study showed that other behaviours that contributed to the risk of smoking have changed over time.For example, the percentage of teens who had started drinking by the age of 16 or 17 fell from 94% for the oldest cohort to 83% in the youngest.The average age at which mothers left education rose from 15.5 in the oldest cohort to 17 in the youngest, the prevalence of parental smoking fell from above 70% in the oldest to 27% in the youngest cohort, and fewer mothers continued smoking while pregnant.Steve Turner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the research was “incredibly concerning”.“A major concern about children and young people vaping is that this age group is particularly sensitive to developing a lifelong addiction to the nicotine contained in the vapes. We know that nicotine addiction is harmful,” he said.“We have all worked so hard to stop young people from smoking and vaping may have undone decades of work.“Smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the UK. We all must take urgent steps to prevent young people from being drawn into smoking by vaping.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleVapingSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

And in the US Congress, only two Republicansvotedfor a recent amendment that would have pulled funding for missile defense systems for Israel. One of them, Marjorie Taylor Greene, on Monday became the first Republicanto callIsrael’s war a “genocide”.Yet the war’s duration and human cost, as well as recent Israeli strikes on Christian targets, have spurred modest signs of discontent on the US right. Some conservative commentators have walked back their support for Israel’s war; the US’s famously Zionist ambassador toIsraelrebuked the actions of Jewish settlers in the West Bank; and an unresolved rift over foreign intervention continues to plague the Maga world.To some extent this mirrors trends in US sentiment overall. A recent CNN pollfounda steep decline in US support for Israel since the war started. That drop was most dramatic among respondents who identified as Democrats or independents, but the poll also found that since 2023 the percentage of surveyed Republicans who believe that Israel’s actions are justified fell from 68% to 52%.It’s highly likely that depictions of starvation in the territory – where 147 people havereportedlystarved to death, including 88 children, and nearly one in three people are going multiple days without eating,accordingto the United Nations – have played a role. On Monday, Donald Trump partly contradicted the claim of the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, that there is no starvation in Gaza,tellingreporters: “That’s real starvation … I see it, and you can’t fake that. So, we’re going to be even more involved.” Trump made the statement while visiting Britain, where the Daily Express, considered the country’s most rightwing mainstream tabloid, recentlyrana headline decrying hunger in Gaza: “FOR PITY’S SAKE STOP THIS NOW.”A recent spate of Israeli attacks on Christian targets in Gaza and the West Bank have also angered some American conservatives. Last Thursday, after an Israeli tank fired on the sole Catholic church in Gaza – killing three people and wounding nine, including a priest – a reportedly upset Trump called Netanyahu tocomplain.A few days after the church shelling, the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, visited Taybeh, a Palestinian Christian town in the West Bank that has been repeatedly attacked by Israeli settlers, who earlier this month set a fire near a fifth-century church. In astatement, Huckabee described the attack as “an absolute travesty” and “an act of terror” and called for the perpetrators to be prosecuted. (He did not directly implicate the Israeli government or settlers.)View image in fullscreenMike Huckabee tours the fifth-century Church of St George in the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank.Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP via Getty ImagesAlthough there have long been isolationist and populist elements on the right skeptical of the close US alliance with Israel, their point of view has been eclipsed in recent history by the pro-Israel camp, which enjoys strong support among American evangelical Christians.Huckabee is an evangelical Christian who hasdescribedhimself as an “unapologetic, unreformed Zionist”. Like many evangelicals, he believes that Israel has a divine claim to the West Bank, and has memorablydeclaredthat “there is no such thing as a Palestinian”.That Huckabee issued such a strong statement on Taybeh “was surprising”, Todd Deatherage said. Deatherage is the co-founder of Telos, a non-profit that works to give US policymakers and religious groups a more nuanced understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Huckabee’s gesture, he said, seems to indicate “some complexity in a movement that didn’t have complexity around this before”.Sohrab Ahmari, a conservative journalist and commentator, described Huckabee’s statement as remarkable, “given how much of a kind of boomer evangelical Huckabee is”.Huckabee also recentlycalledfor Israel to “aggressively investigate” the murder of Sayfollah “Saif” Musallet, a Palestinian American man who was recently beaten to death by settlers in the West Bank, according to his family.The events abroad also seem to have made ripples in the US conservative media sphere.The Israeli government said the church strike was a battlefield mistake, but in a recent episode of his talkshow, Michael Knowles, a rightwing American pundit,expressedskepticism. “I’ve been broadly supportive of the state of Israel,” Knowles, who is Catholic, said in the segment. “And you’re losing me.” The Israeli government “isreallyscrewing up, isreallynot playing its cards right”, he argued. “The war needs to come to an end. How long is the war gonna go on?”He added: “America is the only friend that Israel has on planet Earth. I do not get what the Israeli government is doing here, but I suspect there will be political consequences – as there should be.” Some critics in the comments section of Knowles’s video accused him of only noticing deaths in Gaza once the victims were conspicuously Christian.The Free Press, the online publication founded by Bari Weiss to challenge what she describes as an establishment liberal media, recentlypublishedan article arguing that although past claims about hunger in Gaza were “lies”, the territory was now rapidly entering a “real hunger crisis”. The Free Press has generally taken a fervently pro-Israel stance.Similarly, Joe Rogan, the everyman podcaster who threw his support to Trump in the last election, has refused to host Netanyahu on his podcast, the premier’s son, Yair Netanyahu,claimedon Friday. And Ross Douthat, the conservative New York Times columnist, published an op-ed on Saturdayarguingthat Israel’s military operation has crossed into being “unjust”.Although the US right is perceived today as staunchly pro-Israel, recent history is more complicated, Deatherage noted; George HW Bush’s Republican administrationundertooka political fight with Israel about Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The right’s pro-Israel stance really hardened after 9/11, he said, when Christian conservatives and defense hawks embraced the view that the US and Israel were allies against Islamic terror.View image in fullscreenA man tidies the graves of Palestinian-American Sayfollah Musallet, left, and Mohammed al-Shalabi, both of whom were killed by Israeli settlers.Photograph: Maya Alleruzzo/APThe modern iteration of Christians United for Israel (CUFI) was founded in 2006 to facilitate US evangelical support for Israel. The organization’s membership is significantly larger than Aipac, the pro-Israel organization founded by Jewish Americans. Trump’s alliance with the religious right during his first term intensified the political power of Christian Zionism.“That part of the evangelical movement really gained unprecedented access to being heard,” Deatherage said.Some Christian Zionists, particularly evangelicals, believe there are biblical justifications for the US supporting Israel. A small subset believe that a showdown between Israel and enemy states could presage the End of Days, Daniel Hummel, a historian of Christian Zionism, said. The recent strike on Iran sparked apocalypticspeculationin some Christian circles, he noted.Netanyahu flies home without a Gaza peace deal but still keeps Trump onsideRead moreYet polling data suggests a generational divide. Younger evangelicals, like younger Americans broadly, are more skeptical of Zionism, and the gap seems to be growing.A 2021 survey by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Pembrokefoundthat only 33.6% of American evangelicals between the ages of 18 and 29 supported Israel, down from 69% surveyed in a similar poll in 2018. Research by the University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll hasfoundsimilar shifts among younger evangelicals.“Younger evangelicals in particular are kind of renegotiating what it means to be a Christian in the public square,” Deatherage said. “And they’re not thrilled by the bargain that the older generation maybe made with politics.”The topic of Christian Zionismcame upduring a heated episode of Tucker Carlson’s talkshow, this June, featuring Senator Ted Cruz. Carlson is one of themajor facesof an America First camp in the Maga movement that views the American alliance with Israel with increasing suspicion. During the conversation, Cruz cited a Bible verse as one of the reasons that he supports Israel. Carlson responded by testily mocking the notion that foreign policy objectives should be determined by biblical exegesis.On the fringes, criticisms of Israel have sometimes been intertwined with outright antisemitism. The far-right pundit Candace Owens, for example, has oftendisparagedIsrael in conspiratorial terms.Yet skepticism of Israel has also gained some credible intellectual traction on the more mainstream Maga right, particularly among a group of mostly younger conservative activists, political staffers and policy wonks sometimes known in Washington DC as the “restrainers”. These are generally pro-Trump conservatives who, while not necessarily outright isolationists,believethat the US should protect its own national interests even if this means scaling back – or “restraining” – allies such as Israel.The term is subjective andcontentious, but the Pentagon’s policy chief, Elbridge Colby; the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, Mike DiMino; and JD Vance himself are sometimesconsideredexamples.Pro-Israel Republicans and hawks still mostly hold the whip hand, but Deatherage believes a political window for rethinking the US’s relationship for Israel may be opening on the right. “There’s a lot of pressure on [Trump] to support whatever the Israeli government is doing. But there’s now some really dissenting voices on the other side of that.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationUS politicsIsraelanalysisShareReuse this content"

She found it in pursuing “barely legal” sex – traditionally one of the most searched-for terms in porn – with the twist that instead of men searching for videos of other men having sex with teenage (or teenage-looking, depending on how many internet layers you’re prepared to sift through for your purposes) girls, Billinger offered herself to young men.She had sex with them for free on condition that they gave permission for her to upload the footage to her OnlyFans account, where her subscribers pay to access her content. “She is a marketing genius,” says one of the team she has gathered round her to help administrate her growing empire. She has, in essence, introduced an entirely new way of doing porn-business. If she were working in any other field – if she had stayed in her previous job as a finance recruiter for the NHS, perhaps – and innovated to the same extent, she would probably be hailed as an extraordinary entrepreneur.She also specialises in gang bangs, putting calls out on her social media channels for volunteers (“I’m in London, on my back, and I’d like your load”), with no shortage of willing participants. 1000 Men and Me: the Bonnie Blue Story is a documentary by Victoria Silver, who became aware of Billinger’s existence through what the algorithm was serving up to Silver’s 15-year-old daughter on her social media feeds. It follows Bonnie/Tia as she prepares for (“1,600 condoms, 50 balaclavas, numbing lube”) and executes her most infamous endeavour – having sex with 1,000 (1,057, it turns out – “barely legal or barely breathing … come and rearrange my insides”) men in 12 hours. It proved too extreme for OnlyFans – or at least for Visa, who processes its online payments – and she has since had to move elsewhere to continue her campaign for lucrative online-world domination.Naturally, the media – online, legacy and everything in between – has had a field day with all this. They’ve labelled her everything from predator to victim (she denies both, saying she has no “daddy issues”, no trauma in her past and none induced by her work since). She has been accused of being a traitor (“you’re giving into the patriarchy”), and has received multitudinous insults (“disgusting, deplorable slapper” is one we hear from an online commenter).Although Silver’s six months in Billinger’s company doesn’t provide much in the way of decisive evidence or insight, it does show the star to be as steely in her approach to her career as she is Stakhanovite in her labours. When she needs to court attention, the easiest way is often to insult the wives and girlfriends of the men who watch her and come to her events. “I just loved … knowing I was doing something their wives should have done.” She recommends bringing their partners’ underwear along. “I’ll make them smell MUCH nicer”. And just remember, she confides to camera, “that if a girl says she’s on her period, there’s nothing wrong with her throat.”But, Silver remains essentially unconfrontational in her approach, and no match for one as robust and unfazed by other people’s opinions as Billinger. The latter claims that her career is what feminism has fought for “for years and years”. So, if young girls are seeing her content and fearing that this is what they should be offering boys? Then it’s up to their parents to teach them that it’s not for everyone. The idea of a collective or social responsibility, any considerations beyond the purely individual and/or financial gain no traction. Silver rarely pushes back, even when Billinger recruits visibly nervous, deliberately young-looking female content creators for a video in a “sex education lesson” where performers roleplay students– she asks nothing about possible harms to them or in encouraging male fantasies around girls too young to consent. The basilisk Blue stare seems to hold her in its thrall.There are only perhaps two moments that, for me, come close to revealing anything about Billinger, and even these are only a measure of – maybe – how deep the traits she has already willingly shown us run. The first is her comment: “Everyone says my brain works different. I’m just not emotional … If I don’t want to get upset, I won’t get upset.” It reminds me of the statistics that show a high proportion of CEOs and the like – and what is Billinger if not her own CEO – are technically sociopaths. And the second is that when she computes the risk of being insulted in the street she says: “At least they’re getting off the sofa.” This 26-year-old woman who spurned university as unnecessary, was driving a Mercedes C-class by the age of 19, and bought a house shortly thereafter. Hard graft seems to be a high calling, laziness the only sin.Do I admire her work ethic and facility for business? Yes. Do I wish we lived in a world where the best option for realising those talents as a young woman was not through making online porn? Yes. Do I see where we go from here? Yes, I do. And Billinger will be fine. Beyond that individual? Not so much. Not so much.1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Story is available on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewPornographyDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Whether you’re on a quick weekend jaunt or a multi-week tour of Europe, there are some things to consider: did you pack sunscreen? A phone charger? And how are you going to take care of your stomach?“Patients have troubles with stomach issues when they travel because they are exposed to unfamiliar food and water sources, differences in local hygiene and sanitation and changes in routine,” says Dr Franjo Vladic, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic.Many of these problems arise as the result of travelers “not taking logical precautions”, says Dr Michael Camilleri, gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic.So how do you protect yourself and your gut when you travel? We asked experts.Wait … can you get a hernia from wearing tight pants?Read moreWhat are the most common travel-related gastrointestinal problems?Traveler’s diarrheaAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most predictable travel-related illness istravelers’ diarrhea, which affects anywhere from “30% to 70% of travelers during a two-week period, depending on the season of travel”. It is most often the result of consuming food or water that is contaminated with bacteria or viruses.It can come on suddenly and last three to five days, according to the health center atIndiana University Bloomington. In addition, people may experience cramps, nausea, vomiting and fever.ConstipationAnother common digestive ailment when traveling isconstipation. This is often the result of changing one’s routine, “particularly diet (including fiber and fluid intake)”, as well as “altered mobility due to the constraints associated with prolonged travel”, explains Camilleri. When traveling, one might try to suppress a bowel movement because of inaccessible toilets, but this only exacerbates the issue.OtherOther common stomach issues travelers face include changes in bowel habits, gas, bloating and indigestion, says Dr Aditi Stanton, a board-certified gastroenterologist with GastroHealthin Ohio. She adds that travel can also exacerbate underlying conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).How can you avoid gastrointestinal distress when traveling?ConsistencyTravel tends to upend regular schedules and habits, which can wreak havoc on the digestive system. Maintaining some dietary routine can help mitigate this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hydrate and aim for well-balanced meals, she says, and “be mindful of how much alcohol and caffeine you’re having”.Plan aheadIf you often suffer from stomach upset when you travel, prepare a toolkit beforehand. “Bring along anything you might need to stick to your usual routine, plus a few ‘just in case’ items,” Stanton says. In addition to your regular prescriptions, consider fiber supplements, probiotics, anti-reflux medications, anti-diarrheal medication or oral rehydration or electrolyte solutions.Additionally, if you have a chronic gastrointestinal condition like Crohn’s, IBS, ulcerative colitis or gastroesophagal reflux disease (Gerd), it’s best to check with your doctor before traveling “to see if any special prep is needed”, says Stanton.Watch what you eatSteer clear of food and water that may be contaminated with bacteria or viruses. This may sound obvious, but spotting contaminated food isn’t always straightforward.According to Vladic, some of the worst culprits are raw or undercooked meats, seafood, pre-peeled fruits and vegetables, untreated tap water and ice made from untreated water.In order to avoid potentially contaminated food and beverages, Camilleri suggests eating food that is well cooked and hot, avoiding tap water unless advised otherwise by a “reliable source”, not buying food that has been exposed to the environment for hours instead of refrigerated and washing your hands every time you go to the bathroom and before every meal (ideally, you’redoing thisat home too).Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a trove of Guthrie tracks resurfaces, his daughter Nora remembers the penner of ‘hard-hitting songs for hard-hit people’Dave SimpsonTue 29 Jul 2025 10.53 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 13.46 EDTShareWith mass deportations of migrants across America – not to mention reports of people being put in shackles or made to kneel and eat “like dogs” – Nora Guthrie is disappointed there hasn’t been more noise from musicians about the issue.“I’ve been out protesting every weekend,” says the 75-year-old daughter of singer-songwriterWoody Guthrie, and founder of the Woody Guthrie Archive. “And I’ve found myself asking, ‘Where are the songs for us to sing about this?’”He’d write on gift-wrapping paper. He’d write on the couch with kids jumping on his headIn need of a track that meets the moment, she turned to Deportee, a song her father wrote in 1948 in response to a plane crash in California that killed four Americans and 28 Mexican migrant workers, who were being deported. “A few days later, only the Americans were named and the rest were called ‘deportees’,” explains Nora’s daughter Anna Canoni, who recently succeeded her mother as president of Woody Guthrie Publications, over a joint video call from New York. “Woody read about it in the New York Times and the same day penned the lyric.”Originally a poem, the song (often subtitled Plane Wreck at Los Gatos) was first popularised by folk singers Martin Hoffman and Pete Seeger and has since been covered by the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Joni Mitchell. Now, though, leaps in AI audio restoration technology mean we can finally hear Guthrie’s own long-lost, home-recorded version, and it’s striking how powerfully it speaks to the way migrant workers are demonised today. They “fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil”, he sings, “and be called by no name except ‘deportees’”. Singer Billy Bragg argues that “When the ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] are rounding people up in fields, the song could hardly be more relevant.”View image in fullscreen‘I slammed the door on Bob Dylan’ … Nora Guthrie.Photograph: Reuters Staff/ReutersInitially a single, Deportee also appears on Woody at Home, Vol 1 and 2, a new 22-track treasure trove of Guthrie’s final recordings (including 13 previously unheard songs), made at home in 1951 and 1952, just months before he was first hospitalised with the neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease that led to his death aged 55 in 1967.“He’d been blacklisted [during the McCarthy era, for activism], so he couldn’t perform as much and couldn’t get on the radio,” says Nora. “Huntington’s was seeping into his body and his mind. The tapes are a last push to get the songs out, because he senses something is wrong.”Guthrie’s advocacy for migrant workers and social justice was informed by lived experience. Born into a middle-class family in Okemah, Oklahoma, he was just 14 when the family lost their home and he subsequently lived through the dust bowl, the Great Depression, the second world war and the rise of fascism. “He had to migrate from Oklahoma to California,” says Bragg. “He knew what it was like to lose your home, to be dispossessed, to go on the road. The Okies were really no different to those Mexican workers and were just as reviled.”Performing with the slogan “This machine kills fascists” written on his guitar, Guthrie packed his seminal 1940 debut Dust Bowl Ballads with what Anna calls “hard-hitting songs for hard-hit people”.He penned his most famous anthem, This Land Is Your Land – a new version of which opens Woody At Home with extra verses – after a road trip, as the lyric says, “from California to the New York island”.“Woody wrote it because he was really pissed off with hearing Irving Berlin’s God Bless America on every jukebox,” says Bragg. “It annoyed the shit out of him. I’ve actually seen the original manuscript for the song and crossed out at the top is Woody’s original title, God Blessed America for You and Me, which I think gives him claim to be an alternative songwriter, the archetypal punk rocker.”Between the early 1930s and the 1950s, Guthrie penned an astonishing 3,000 songs, recording more than 700 of them. The Woody at Home recordings were made at his family’s rented apartment in Beach Haven, Brooklyn, on a primitive machine given to him by his publisher with a view to selling the songs to other artists. With his wife out working, the increasingly poorly singer somehow managed to record 32 reels of tape while minding three kids. Sounds of knocks on doors, and even Nora as a toddler, appear on the tapes along with conversational messages.View image in fullscreen‘Everything was coming out so quickly’ … Guthrie in McSorley’s bar, New York.Photograph: Eric Schaal/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock“He’d write on the couch with the kids jumping on his head,” Anna says. “He’d write on gift wrappers or paper towels. We’ve found some of Woody’s most beautiful quotes in correspondence, like in a 1948 letter to [folk music champion] Alan Lomax, ‘A folk song is what’s wrong and how to fix it.’ Sometimes he only had time for a title. Everything was coming out so quickly he had to get it down.”Woody at Home contains previously unheard songs about racism (Buoy Bells From Trenton), fascism (I’m a Child Ta Fight) and corruption (Innocent Man) but also showcases the breadth of Guthrie’s canon. There are songs about love, Jesus Christ, atoms … even Albert Einstein, whom he once met and took a train with. It tickles Nora that her father wrote “no less than five songs about washing dishes”.Guthrie wrote Old Man Trump, also known as Beach Haven Race Hate, about their landlord, Fred Trump – father of Donald – and his segregative housing policies. Woody at Home premieres another song about him, Backdoor Bum and the Big Landlord. “It’s really the story of how the guy who has everything gives nothing and the guy who has nothing gives everything,” says Nora. “My favourite bit is when the landlord gets to heaven laden with gold. They send him to hell and he goes, ‘Let me see your manager. I’m gonna buy this place and kick you out.’ The arrogance and entitlement are astonishing, but it clearly defines someone we all know. We lived in Trump buildings. We know who they are.”View image in fullscreenThis one’s called Old Man Trump … Donald and Fred Trump, subject of a song.Photograph: Bill Truran/AlamyThe family moved to Queens where, when Nora was 11, she answered the door to an inquisitive 19-year-old singer-songwriter called Robert Zimmerman. The future Bob Dylan had read Guthrie’s autobiography, Bound for Glory. “I was a little upset because I was watching American Bandstand and had to answer the door,” she chuckles. “There was this guy standing there who looked dusty and weird. I slammed the door and ran back to American Bandstand. But he kept on knocking.”View image in fullscreenThe cover artwork for Woody at Home.Photograph: undefined/Shamus RecordsThe 2024 Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown dramatises the iconic 1961 meetings between the teenage future legend and his hospitalised, dying idol. Nora loves the film, but points out: “My father wasn’t in a room on his own like in the movie. Woody was on a ward with 40 patients, in a psychiatric hospital because there were no wards for people with Huntington’s at the time. There was a sunroom to the side where Bob would meet him, take him pens and cigarettes. My memory is that Bob would not only sing his songs for Woody” – Dylan subsequently recorded a heartfelt tribute, Song to Woody – “but that he’d also sing my father’s own songs to him. I can’t emphasise enough how kind Bob was, but he understood that Woody needed to hear what he’d achieved.”By then, Guthrie was very ill. “Because of Huntington’s I didn’t have a dad in the traditional sense people talk about,” Nora says with a sigh. “He couldn’t really talk or have long conversations like we’re having now. We couldn’t have physical contact because with Huntington’s your body’s always moving. You’d have to hold his arms back so you could hug him. If we ever went out to a restaurant people would look at us like he was drunk and that hurt.” Nora became Woody’s carer and, in her tireless curation of his legacy, has been caring for her father ever since.“That happened accidentally,” she says, explaining how she’d spent 10 years as a professional dancer when – in 1991 – Guthrie’s retiring manager called her in to sort through boxes of his stuff. “One of the first things I pulled out was a letter from John Lennon,” she says, fetching the framed letter, sent to the family in 1975, for me to see. It reads: “Woody lives and I’m glad.” The next find was the original lyrics for This Land Is Your Land. “It was a treasure trove.”From which there is more to come. His descendants hope to spark today’s young songwriters – and protesters – in the way Guthrie did for Dylan, Springsteen and countless others. “I see us as the coal holders,” says Anna. “We keep Woody’s ember burning so that whenever someone wants to ignite the fire in them, Woody is hot and ready.”Deportee (Woody’s Home Tape) is available now on streaming services.

Of these, Hollinghurst is one eyebrow-raising exclusion, for his elegiac and beautifully composed panorama of gay life in Britain over the past seven decades,Our Evenings. But it’s no surprise that the list is headed by Desai’s epicThe Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, a novel in the works since her Booker win two decades ago and due out this September.Clocking in at nearly 700 pages, this is a love story about two people pulled between India and the US, family inheritance and personal ambition, intimacy and solitude. Immersive and gently funny, her vast canvas painted with an exquisitely fine brush, it looks like a leading contender on a canon-building list – nine of the authors are making their first Booker appearance. There is an emphasis on family stories; sometimes intimate and direct, as in Claire Adam’s account of a woman forced to give up her baby as a teenager,Love Forms, or Ben Markovits’s rueful study of a father contemplating life once the kids have left home,The Rest of Our Lives, but more often as a lens through which to examine the forces of history.Quick GuideThe Booker prize 2025 longlistShowLove Formsby Claire Adam (Faber)The Southby Tash Aw (4th Estate)Universalityby Natasha Brown (Faber)One Boat by Jonathan Buckley (Fitzcarraldo Editions)Flashlightby Susan Choi (Jonathan Cape)The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny by Kiran Desai (Hamish Hamilton)Auditionby Katie Kitamura (Fern Press)The Rest of Our Livesby Ben Markovits (Faber)The Land in Winterby Andrew Miller (Sceptre)Endlingby Maria Reva (Virago)Fleshby David Szalay (Jonathan Cape)Seascraper by Benjamin Wood (Viking)Misinterpretation by Ledia Xhoga (Daunt Books Originals)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Desai’s novel is an intricate portrait of an interconnected world, while Tash Aw’sThe South, the first in a proposed quartet, looks at two farming families in 1990s Malaysia against a backdrop of tumultuous change and ominous signs of climate crisis. Susan Choi’s previous novel, 2019’s Trust Exercise, was a standout in American fiction;Flashlightis straighter and less playful, but scales up her ambition and breaks new ground in its examination of one family with roots in Korea, Japan and the US, illuminating the seismic effects of political upheaval on individual lives.The two debut novelists on the list respond to the forces of history with formal invention. Canadian-Ukrainian author Maria Reva beginsEndlingas a comic caper through Ukraine’s marriage industry, from the perspective of a cash-strapped scientist with a passion for endangered snails; Russia’s full-scale invasion blows the book wide open, calling into question the role of the writer and the purpose of fiction – and offering answers that are full of energy. Albanian-American author Ledia Xhoga toys subtly with realism.Misinterpretation, her portrait of an Albanian interpreter in New York, caught between two cultures and struggling with compassion fatigue and her own traumas as she tries to help others, is full of misunderstandings and missed connections that echo the faults and gaps of translation.Two slim, slippery books revel in formal disruption. Katie Kitamura’s enigmaticAudition, focusing on an American actor and a man young enough to be her son, offers contradictory narratives in order to explore identity, performance, and what we are to one another: this is a book to ponder and argue over. InUniversality, Natasha Brown is also interested in the power dynamics of storytelling: she constructs a merciless satire of the current media landscape, with its meretricious culture wars, through the jigsaw-puzzle chronicle of a long read that goes viral.The four remaining books are all by men, an answer perhaps to claims that male writing in the UK is in crisis, and they all do fascinating things with interiority. Jonathan Buckley writes spare, slightly Cuskian philosophical novels; in his 13th,One Boat, a woman’s sorties to Greece to work through her bereavements lead into reflections on ethics, memory and the processes of thought. In Benjamin Wood’s quiet but immensely atmosphericSeascraper, a young man plies his grandfather’s trade of “shanking”, scraping the seashore for shrimp in an England that is moving on without him. Muted but precise prose burrows into his hopes and dreams for a tale that resonates far beyond the telling.Andrew Miller’sThe Land in Winteris also situated in a postwar England on the brink of change, here the “Big Freeze” of 1962-3, and travels deep into the hearts of its characters, two young married couples in the West Country. This novel has had my heart since it was published last November, and I’m delighted to see it on the list: I think it’s the best book yet from a stellar writer who’s been publishing for three decades. (By contrast, this year’s Booker blow for me is the exclusion of Sarah Hall; I’ve been telling everyone that her magisterial, millennia-spanning Helm, out at the end of August, was a likely winner.)The final title, also a favourite of mine this year, creates powerful effects through an unusual tactic: utterly refusing interiority.Fleshby David Szalay is a very modern everyman story, with his central character at the mercy of forces beyond his control, a rise and fall playing out across a depressed childhood in Hungary, life in the army and an upwardly mobile stint in on-the-make London. By keeping his antihero a mystery to the reader, Szalay opens up the biggest questions about what we can and cannot know. It feels like something that hasn’t been done before in quite this way – and that only fiction could do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In Israel’s globalised economy, here’s what will shift public opinionTue 29 Jul 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 08.58 EDTShareAfter months of complete blockade or extremely limited supplies, and with thousands of famished children in Gaza at risk of death, Israel finally relented last week to allow increasedlevels of aid, as well as electricity and water, into the territory. Yet given Israel’s systematic destruction of Gaza’s medical infrastructure, the aid will not prevent irreversible damage to many severely malnourished children. And even in the best scenario,this is but a hiatus.For many months now, Israel’s far-right government has been unambiguous in its words and actions. It has made Gaza uninhabitable through the destruction of the built environment and infrastructure. The plan, repeatedly stated by Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers, is the ethnic cleansing (“voluntary emigration”) of the bulk of Gaza’s population. It is now clear that the Israeli government is willing to slow down this campaign temporarily, but it will not stop unless it is forced to, by international pressure. Such pressure has been entirely inadequate.The UK hasscaled up its rhetoric, to words such as “appalled” and “horrified”. It has also limited arms shipments to Israel, andplaced sanctionson ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir. Yet surely a G7 member, the world’s sixth largest economy and a close ally of Israel can do more. “Netanyahu only listens to Trump, and even then only sometimes,”says Emily Thornberry, implying there’s little to do beyond pleading with the US president.This is a profound misunderstanding ofIsrael, and an underestimation of the UK’s options. Indeed, Netanyahu and his ministers would not listen to the UK. But Netanyahu is not an all-powerful dictator like VladimirPutin, and Israel is no North Korea. Its economy is highly globalised, and its society cherishes its ties to the world. It has deep material and emotional investments in those connections, including to the UK. From the banking system to defence cooperation, from trade to tourism and academia, the UK is connected to Israel in myriad ways. By continuing business as usual, Israel’s international partners are allowing the Israeli government to continue with its genocidal campaign with no consequences beyond symbolic gestures of disapproval and statements.After 7 October 2023, the horror of Hamas’s massacre prompted western governments to support Israel as it launched its retaliation against Gaza, effectively giving the far-right government carte blanche. Despite unprecedentedinternational criminal court arrest warrantsagainst Netanyahu for the crime of starvation, international sanctions on Israel remain extremely limited. The Israeli government is banking on this. “We can kill 100 Palestinians every night in Gaza and no one in the world cares,”said one member of the coalition recently. Sadly, so far he has not been proved wrong.Over the past 21 months, tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to demand a ceasefire and hostage release deal. While polls showoverwhelming supportfor ending the war, the fragmented and demoralised opposition has not been able to bring the government down. This is partly because, despite pleas from the hostages’ families and activists, Israel’s key economic powerbrokers in the finance and IT industries and trade unions have been reluctant to take an active stand against the government, even if many of them are deeply opposed to it.This reluctance stems, at least in part, from the fact that Israel’s economy has proved surprisingly resilient. True, Israel’s credit ratingwas downgradedand the government deficit has ballooned. But at the same time, since July 2024, the Tel Aviv stock exchange hasrisen by close to 30%. Growth in 2026 isexpected at 4.6%, and unemployment is extremely low. The war has even benefited key economic sectors: Israel’s defence exports are booming, and the UK is one of those export destinations. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, between 2020 and 2024 Israel was thesecond largest supplierof arms to the UK.In the UK and Europe, there are new mobilisations of Israelis against the genocide, calling for sanctions. In December 2024, more than500 Israelisin the UK called on the government to sanction Ben Gvir and Smotrich. In the past couple of months, a new group of Israelis in the UK, Mi-Neged – with which I am involved – called on Keir Starmer and David Lammy to imposefar-reachingsanctionson Israel, not only on a few “bad apples” but systemically. Such measures would include suspending the Trade and Partnership Agreement (TPA) and halting military cooperation.For many of us, this is a deeply painful moment. Calling on our government to sanction the state where we grew up, to which we are closely attached and where our families and friends live is not an easy step. But we are horrified not only by what has happened but also by what is likely to happen if we do not take such steps.UK suspension of Israel’s preferential trade access could push the EU in the same direction. As a trading bloc, the EU is Israel’slargest export destination, accounting for a third of Israeli exports. Proposalsto suspend articlesin Israel’s EU association agreement are on the table.For now, there is an Israeli middle and upper-middle class receptive to external pressure. That constituency has sufficient power and influence to translate this into political action. Israeli civil society is still able to mobilise and challenge the government. Yet Netanyahu’s clampdown on protesters and the press is intensifying: the government’s power grab is rapid and far-reaching. There areserious fearsthat the next Knesset elections would not be free or fair. The less democratic and the more messianic Israel becomes, the less effective sanctions would be.

People want real transformative politics – we will give it to themJeremy CorbynMore than 500,000 people have signed up to our new party to help build a genuine alternative to poverty, inequality and warTue 29 Jul 2025 12.14 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShare“Make no mistake: this is just the beginning.”That is what we saidafter our election victory in Islington North last summer – and we meant it. For many people, the past year in politics is easy to define: Labour has failed to deliver the change the British people deserved. Refusing to scrap the two-child benefit cap. Taking support away from disabled people. Providing political and military support to Israel as starving Palestinians are shot in the street. From the moment this government was elected, it has inflicted suffering and injustice at home and abroad.There is another definition of the past year in politics: up and down the country, communities have been organising for something different, something new, something better. Trade unions and tenants’ unions are fighting back against corporations, bosses and rogue landlords profiting from the cost of living crisis. Disability justice campaigners are mobilising in their thousands to resist cruel welfare cuts, anti-racism campaigners are resisting the prime minister’s attack on migrants and climate activists are bringing into focus the single greatest threat facing humanity. A movement for Palestine is still coming out to demonstrate in unprecedented numbersagainst the government’s support for Israel’s assault on Gaza.These movements are united by a similar conviction: our political system is broken. Over the past 40 years in parliament, I have witnessed first-hand the reasons why. Politics should be about empowerment. Instead, people are shut out of the decisions that affect their daily lives. For too long, top-down political parties have patronised their members and disempowered the communities they claim to represent. When highly centralised political parties answer to nobody but themselves, you get policies that nobody asked for. You get privatisation of our public services. You get austerity. You get4.5 million children living in povertyin the sixth-richest country in the world.For too long, people have been denied a real political choice. Not any more. Last Thursday, we announced that we were building anew kind of political party– one that belongs to you. In just three days, more than 500,000 people signed up to yourparty.uk to help build a real alternative to poverty, inequality and war. This was not just a rejection of the establishment. It was a rallying cry for a new way of doing politics – one that is open, inclusive and democratic.Only a truly democratic party can provide the space for the policies that are needed to transform society. Up and down the country, there is huge appetite for an economic reset. One that brings water, energy, rail and mail into public ownership. One that invests in welfare, not warfare. One that ends this government’s complicity in genocide and brings about justice for the Palestinian people. One that makes the wealthiest in society pay a bit more in tax to ensure that everyone can live in dignity.This is the political vision that can inspire hope, not fear. The great dividers want you to think that migrants and minorities are responsible for the problems in our society. They’re not. Those problems are caused by a rigged economic system that protects the interests of billionaires and corporations. By scapegoating migrants and minorities for its own domestic failures,Labourhas paved the path for Reform UK. This Labour government is here to appease Reform. We are here to defeat Reform. We are at a critical juncture, and we need an alternative, now.No fear or favours: how Corbyn and Sultana’s party could blow up British politicsRead moreOne of the biggest mistakes we can make is thinking we must choose between parliament and our communities as battlegrounds for change. We want to build power everywhere. That is how you transform a moment into a movement that grows for generations to come. That is how we can take on the establishment, inside and outside parliament, to win a better society for us all.And that is why a democratic party is necessary: to link up campaigns across society, and help people win power in their localities, workplaces and neighbourhoods. As I said, the past year is not just about Labour’s failure. It’s about the extraordinary fightback from trade unions, tenants’ unions, disability justice campaigners, anti-racist campaigners, climate activists and a global movement for peace. These groups can only achieve so much on their own. Think of what we could achieve together.The future we deserve is no pipe dream. Look around you, and you will find proof that a better world is possible. We are not fighting for crumbs. We are fighting for real change – and we are never, ever going away.Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North.

It will be bad for them and for the desperate people seeking helpTue 29 Jul 2025 11.19 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 11.26 EDTShareIn the darkness, a light. It shines on the corner of a modest row of houses in a nondescript street. The night may feel oppressive and empty, but still the light shines. And it illuminates a word that says there is still hope. That word is: Samaritans.That light was fixed to a building where I spent many extraordinary hours. I had the privilege of volunteering for the charity for three years; the experience changed my life. And there are many other such lights, in cities and towns and villages across the country: you may sometimes glimpse them from a window of a train, and they remind you there is desperate suffering everywhere, but also that, everywhere, there is someone to help.Samaritans has more than 200 branches. But, according to its managers,that is too many. They said last week that they want to close 100 of them. Volunteers will be moved to “regional hubs”, and some volunteers will take calls at home. This news has alarmed many of those who give up their free time for the charity, and I share their fears. Both parts of the plan carry wider significance, too: the first as an example of a trend towards making charities more like corporations, the second in the questions it raises about working from home.One of the first things that struck me about Samaritans was its amateurism. I mean that in the best possible way. Its standards are professional and its training is rigorous, but it runs on love. We operated not from a shiny call centre, but from a converted mid-20th-century semi, a homely place. Although the branch had dozens of volunteers, there would be only two or three of us on duty at any given time.Chad Varah, who founded Samaritans in 1953.It was intimate, humble and human. You would gradually get to know the other volunteers, and the relationships forged would be crucial in getting you through tough calls. A lot was done with pen and paper. In contrast to a digital world that can seem so alienating, it all felt warmly analogue.This culture is what makes Samaritans so distinctive. There are no scripts or prompts – just you, your ears and your humanity. Samaritans are not automatons. Yes, you could theoretically operate in the same way from a “regional hub”, but the feel of the thing would surely be different: less grounded, less rooted, less like somewhere a caller might call from.The “localness”, too, is important. You might receive a call from anywhere in the country, but your branch is a symbol to its community. What the charity’s managers call “bricks and mortar” are real buildings in real places. And a branch is embedded in its place: its volunteers may help out at nearby schools, or spread the message of Samaritans at local fetes.Of course, running a charity is difficult, and the demands on Samaritans are intense. What was once regarded as the last resort for those on the brink of suicide is now, for too many, the only way to get through to a human who will listen. The charity is having to fill huge gaps left by underfunded public services, a problemcompounded recently by economic problems and the crisis in the cost of living. If you’re running Samaritans, and you need to balance resources with demand, you may well look at your budget and see the sense in shutting half your branches. But efficiency can bring its own costs, and so much of what makes Samaritans special will never show up on any spreadsheet.And there are surely risks too in taking calls “remotely”. Remotely – the word suggests a kind of isolation. But rarely in my life have I wanted more to be close to someone else than when taking a Samaritans call. If a mother is telling you that she wants to end her life and has the means to do so there and then, you may well want someone with you. That person may just sit with you silently, or may write the occasional note of support. Afterwards, that person may talk with you over a cup of tea. The idea that a volunteer may have to take such a call alone, “remotely”, is troubling indeed.Samaritans to close at least 100 branches across UK and IrelandRead moreAnd those are far from the only difficult calls you may take. Far more frequent are calls from men seeking sexual gratification. These can feel invasive enough as it is, and surely would feel even more so in the privacy of your own home. Indeed, perhaps this whole exercise shows us where we might draw a line between work that can be done at home and work that must be done elsewhere. We have tended to see the issue in terms of what is physically possible, rather than what is emotionally wise: the charity may be doing us an indirect favour by making us consider the importance of both.As a charity, Samaritans has to deal with many of the symptoms of deepening societal malaise. But it must beware the hazards of succumbing to those same dread forces. Humanity and connection are what callers crave, and what Samaritans provides. Yet it is in danger of becoming more like the wider world, and less like itself. Up and down the country, those lights still shine.

So, possibly, I have no right to pass judgment on Jonathan Baker, the bishop of Fulham, forunceremoniously stopping a concertin his church in mid-flow the other night – and it really was unceremonious in that he was barefoot and in his dressing gown. Perhaps the audience would have taken him more seriously if he’d been wearing his cope and mitre rather than heckling him as they did.But I do sympathise with my senior colleague. I too have a very low tolerance for noise when I’m trying to sleep – or just relax. I am constantly asking my now adult children, who still live with us in the vicarage, to keep the noise down. On a good day, I do this in the manner of Ross from Friends, with apassive-aggressive hand gesture. On a not-so-good day, I might be a bit snappier. My longsuffering wife calls me Victor Meldrew and refuses to go to the cinema with me unless I promise not to turn round and tut at talkers – or, worse, “politely” ask them to stop talking, which is potentially dangerous in this day and age.View image in fullscreenBaker outside 10 Downing Street, 1 December 2021.Photograph: PjrNews/AlamyHowever, I’m not “in role” in either of those contexts. I’m just Dad or a random grumpy old man. Whereas part of the deal of being an official representative of God is that you have to be nicer than nice all the time. In the filmIn the Loop,Tom Hollander’s politician character moans that holding a surgery for his constituents is “like being Simon Cowell, only without the ability to say, ‘Eff off, you’re mental’.” But in that respect, being a vicar is even harder. People expect you to turn the other cheek, smile and say “Bless you, my son” even in the face of extreme provocation. And failure to do that doesn’t just reflect badly on you, it could undermine someone’s very faith.That’s quite a lot to live up to, which is whySaint James saidpeople should think twice before becoming church leaders (I’m paraphrasing somewhat) and, of course, we’re all only human. I know that I’ve fallen short of this high standard many times. Nonetheless, I accept that that is the nature of my calling and I try, as much as possible, to be a good ambassador for Christ – particularly at weddings.There’s a long history of conflict, for example, between wedding photographers and grumpy vicars and often, when I arrive at the church on a Saturday afternoon, I see the photographer take a deep breath and force their face into a smile before nervously asking: “So, what are your rules?” When I say: “I don’t have any. Just do whatever the bride wants”, they look like I’ve offered to pay off their mortgage.0:55Bishop of Fulham interrupts choir and tells them to leave – videoThe other classic grumpy vicar move is not allowing the local yoga class to meet in the church hall – because yoga is, as they see it, tantamount to witchcraft. Well, aside from the fact that most such classes have no spiritual or religious component and are just harmless – and, indeed, healthy – exercise, I think it’s an own goal to ban them in any case. If it gets into the press, it’s not going to advance the mission of God and will just make the church look ridiculous. And so we return to the bishop of Fulham.When I first saw the story on my Facebook feed, I assumed it was a spoof fromthe Babylon Bee(“your trusted source for Christian news satire”)and it seems that those who were present felt the same. The choir director, Leigh Stanford Thompson, said he thought, for a moment, that it was some form of performance art. The bishop’s dressing gown would have heightened that impression. But slowly the awful truth became clear. And most awful, surely, was that the bishop rudely referred to the choir’s performance as a “terrible racket”, which brings to mind another excruciating episcopal gaffe.Mervyn Stockwood discusses Monty Python’s Life of Brian with John Cleese and Michael Palin on Friday Night, Saturday Morning in 1979.I’m told by people who knew him that the lateMervyn Stockwood, who rose to be bishop of Southwark, was generally charm incarnate, but he let himself and the church down when he joined its ill-considered pushback against The Life of Brian in the famous BBC debate with John Cleese and Michael Palin, dismissing the film as “undergraduate humour” and suitable for the mentally deficient. For me – and most clergy I know, including the former archbishop Rowan Williams – it’s first-rate and theologically astute; but the point here is, we should always play the ball not the man.Baker has, to his credit, now apologised, but while he and I are required to forgive others their sins by virtue of our office, those whom he offended that night might be less willing to do so. As the saying goes, reputation is like virginity: once you lose it, it’s impossible to get it back. But fortunately, I believe in miracles. So, I’ll be praying for my fellow Vicar Meldrew – and remembering that there but for the grace of God go I.Ravi Holy is the vicar of Wye in Kent and a standup comedianExplore more on these topicsChristianityOpinionReligionLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

Does he want to move the company’s stock market listing to the US,as reported by the Timesa few weeks ago? He declined to answer. Then he did something else: he turned his press conference after Tuesday’s half-year numbers into a declaration of love, more or less, for all things American.“The US is the country in our industry where innovation is taking place,”he said, noting that half the group’s sales will be in the US by 2030. The new multibillion-dollar manufacturing facility in Virginia –part of a $50bn investment in the US over the next five years– had progressed to signoff in 33 days. The US administration is considering AstraZeneca’s proposals for reducing medicine prices for Americans. “We are a very American company,” said the French-Australian Soriot at one point, name-checking his various American senior colleagues.True, he also saidAstraZenecais “committed” to the UK, but he was referring directly to sites such as the £1bn research and development in Cambridge, rather than the stock market listing. An analysis followed on the failings of Europe, the UK included, versus the US and China in terms of backing pharmaceutical innovation. The US invests 0.8% of its GDP in the sector, he said, versus 0.3% in Europe. He wished the UK could aim for 0.5%, and then 0.6%, to provide a bit of competition.What to make of this (clearly) preplanned response? One could shrug and say any chief executive of a globally active pharmaceutical company would be foolish not to sing the praises of the US at a moment when its president is throwing tariffs around and has steep local drug prices in his sights. Shifting investment to the US makes sense in that context. Also, Soriot’s grumbles about Europe are not new. The specific frustrations with the UK flow from the price the NHS pays for prescription medicines plus the value-for-money rules that are applied to new drugs. Most pharma companies make similar noises on that score.Yet the stock market listing – the bit Soriot left hanging in the air – is the new angle here. It would have been a simple matter for him to say, as many other large FTSE 100 companies with large US operations do, that there is no tension between a London listing and an increased operational focus state-side. But he didn’t.The government should take note. A relisting would be expensive for AstraZeneca if it included a redomicile (and, otherwise, what’s the point?), but ministers cannot rule it out, or just assume Soriot is making a power-play as part of the industry-wide negotiations on medicine prices. The stakes here are too high for complacency. A defection by the UK’s largest quoted companywould blow a hole in two government missions: firstly to inject life into the London stock market, and secondlyto make the UK a “life sciences superpower”.Unfortunately, the government is also starting on the back foot with AstraZeneca after the fiasco withthe £450m Speke vaccine plant in Liverpool.Accounts are disputed but the most plausible reading is that the company lost patience after the Treasury tried to shave a few million quid off the support package agreed under the last government. Whatever the details, the result was fora terrible own-goal for a “pro-growth” government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here are eight reasons to be hopefulAlthough the trends can be hard to perceive, we are making incredible progress on global poverty, health, longevity and climate changeJohn D BoswellTue 29 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Seba Cestaro/GuardianDon’t fret the future.A lot of people do, and for powerful reasons – we are facing enormous challenges unprecedented in human history, from climate change and nuclear war to engineered pandemics and malicious artificial intelligence. A 2017 survey showed that nearly four in 10 Americans think that climate change alone has a good chance of triggering humanity’s extinction. But we seem largely blind to the many profound reasons for hope – and it’s not entirely our fault.Humans are wired with a “negativity bias” that triggers a stronger emotional response to bad news than good news – evident in the journalism maxim “if it bleeds, it leads”. This loss-aversion behavior served a purpose in our evolutionary past, when information and resources were scarce, but in the age of endless information access, it can lead to pessimism, anxiety and a distorted vision of what humanity is capable of.In reality, we are making incredible progress in global poverty, health, longevity, climate change and much more, but these trends are harder to perceive because they accumulate gradually and quietly. As the Wired magazine founder Kevin Kelly points out, progress is often about what doesn’t happen – the children who won’t die of smallpox, or the farmers whose crops won’t get raided.The world is still an awful place in many ways, and the crises we face are daunting. But looking past the dark headlines, we can see bright trendlines that give us profound reasons to be optimistic for our future.View image in fullscreen1 We’regetting agrip onclimatechangeJust a decade ago or so, it appeared that civilization was on a course to cause a disastrous 4C-5C of warming above pre-industrial levels. But since then, major nations and markets have responded with surprising force and urgency; global carbon dioxide emissions have significantly slowed, and in many countries, per capita emissions are falling even while per capita GDP and energy use are going up.We are still not doing enough – there is a lingering risk of runaway carbon cycle feedback loops that could push us over 4C – but nations are making ambitious net-zero commitments that, if realized, could feasibly keep warming below 2C.The pathway for avoiding the absolute worst outcomes – humanity’s extinction, for one – is increasingly clear and doable, and involves a combination of decarbonization, renewable energy breakthroughs, responsible geoengineering and carbon dioxide removal.The central reason for optimism, however, remains the coming age of radically cheaprenewable energy, primarily from solar photovoltaics.2 EnergyabundanceiswithinreachThe exponential growth insolar energyhas stunned even expert forecasters. In 2015, the International Energy Agency predicted that the world would add about 35 gigawatts of solar energy capacity by 2023.Their estimate was off by a factor of 10. The costs of solar have fallen below the cost of coal, a tipping point that will financially incentivize markets to go green even in the absence of policy pressures. There are strong reasons to believe this exponential progress will continue; soon it could become cheaper to create fuel out of thin air and water using solar energy than to drill for it underground.More signs of an energy revolution are all around: The same expert-defying growth is happening in the adoption of electric vehicles, and global investment in clean energy now far outstrips that offossil fuels. With worldwide access to radically cheap renewable energy and carbon-neutral fuels, underdeveloped countries can achieve first-world standards of living without a corresponding increase in carbon emissions. Already wealthy nations will see new waves of growth as energy abundance triggers new economic possibilities, including affordable desalination, which could address water shortages in many parts of the world. We may be on the verge of a new industrial revolution and a new era of human prosperity.3 WeareeradicatingpovertyAs the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker points out, you’ve never seen a newspaper run the headline “137,000 people escaped from extremepovertyyesterday” – yet this incredible statistic has been accurate every day for decades now. Since 1990, more than a billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty, with the impoverished share falling from 38% of the global population down to 9.1% today.That still leaves more than 600 million people living below the international poverty line of $2.15 a day, making it clear that the fight is far from over. But with energy abundance driving new growth and economic modalities, we can expect to see the downward trend continue; ultimately, we should strive for no less than a 0% rate of poverty globally. Further progress is there for the taking.View image in fullscreen4 Wearelivinglonger thaneverIt might be the most feelgood statistic of all time: an average person born today can expect to live more than twice as long as someone born around 1900. In South Korea, life expectancy has more than tripled, surging from just 23.5 years in 1908 to more than 83 years today.This dramatic increase is thanks to huge advances in medicine, public health and living standards, but also by a stunning fall in child mortality: for most of human history, about half of all children died before their 15th birthday; today the figure is less than 5% globally and as low as 0.4% in some wealthy nations. We can, and probably will, save millions of children’s lives by driving the global rate this low – a feasible and morally urgent goal for the 21st century.On top of all this progress, advances inageingbiology are leading to breakthroughs in slowing the ageing process and keeping laboratory animals healthier for longer. We now have numerous ways of accomplishing this with mice and primates; what is needed is an injection of funding to bring these experiments to human trials. Ageing is responsible for about two-thirds of all deaths; channeling our resources to lessen its tragic effects will have enormous and immediate benefits to human society. If the funding does come, the next few decades could get very interesting.5 Medicalbreakthroughs areacceleratingConverging advancements inAIand biotechnology are pointing toward a radical enhancement of human health and wellbeing. Already, projects like Google’s AlphaFold are discovering structures of pathogens and potential treatments for cancer much faster than humans could. New gene-editing tools like Crispr have the potential to cure many of the more than 10,000 diseases that are caused by single-gene mutations.Barney Graham, an immunologist who played a pivotal role in developing mRNA vaccines, puts it thusly: “You cannot imagine what you’re going to see over the next 30 years. The pace of advancement is in an exponential phase right now.” In the coming decades, we could potentially gain the power to regenerate limbs, engineer designer life forms, eliminate all disease and possibly extend our life spans indefinitely.View image in fullscreen6 Robotswilltakeourjobs (andthat’s agoodthing)If you’ve ever watched two-legged robots navigating obstacle courses and landing synchronized backflips, you are familiar with the incredible developments in robotics over the past decade. But the real reason to get excited now is not the leaps in physical capabilities (save for the potential of a future robot Olympics), but in intellectual abilities.OpenAI, creators of ChatGPT, has partnered with Figure, a robotics startup, to incorporate multimodal artificial intelligence into a humanoid form factor. Their walking, talking full-body robots are learning tasks merely by watching videos – no manual training required. Tesla’s Optimus bot is a direct competitor that its CEO,Elon Musk, believes will eventually be more valuable than the company’s electric car business.It’s not hard to see the value: humanoid robots could address acute labor shortages and replace labor-intensive and dangerous jobs, taking on roles in disaster response, healthcare, manufacturing, space exploration and much more – freeing real people to pursue more desirable jobs, elevating quality of life and boosting economic growth.Of course, humanity will only benefit if we can address the risks of job displacement and human safety. Half of the battle will be controlling these risks and ensuring we reap the benefits, rather than be overcome by armies of terminators.7 Anewspaceage isdawningFor decades, the final frontier was only accessible to a handful of major nations with mainly geopolitical interests. But in the past 10-15 years, launch costs have fallen drastically thanks to the advent of reusable rockets and innovative fuel types, enabling a new generation of space technologies and opening up the final frontier to a wave of commercial and scientific interests. Satellite broadband is starting to bring internet access to rural and underdeveloped parts of the world, which will bolster agriculture, education, health, economic opportunity and participation in democracy. Low-gravity environments are uniquely ideal for cell research, where scientists are growing miniature organs for study, and could lead to pharmaceutical breakthroughs. Eventually, bolder prospects like asteroid mining could supply trillions of dollars’ worth of rare materials without compromising environments back on Earth.You can almost feel the pace quickening: this decade has already seen twice as many moon missions as the 2010s. Plans for commercial space stations like Orbital Reef and Starlab are under way and slated to be operational before 2030. Nasa has plans to put humans on the moon again as soon as 2026. To top it all off, the recently launched James Webb space telescope is already discovering new secrets of the universe only two years into its mission. It’s finding water vapor on alien planets and holds the promise of detecting signatures of alien life. We may be on the verge of the most significant scientific discovery of all time. It’s safe to say that a new space age has arrived.View image in fullscreen8 Humans areincrediblyresilientIt’s not far-fetched to speculate that a major disaster may await us in the coming centuries. But humans have a long history of rebounding from catastrophic collapse. Our ancestors have survived asteroid impacts, ice ages, supervolcano eruptions and deadly plagues – each time eventually bouncing back to new heights.The Black Death of 1347 killed up to half the population of Europe and one out of every 10 people globally. But even this did not derail human progress in the long term, and it was followed by the scientific revolution just 200 years later. The upward march of humanity has never been and will never be perfectly smooth, but progress is unmistakable over the long term. It will take a truly apocalyptic sequence of events to stop us.Conclusion:optimism is aweaponThe modern world was built and shaped by optimists. We owe it to them to carry the torch. Optimism for the future is not only justified – it’s a weapon in the fight for a higher future, and a moral obligation to ourselves and to future generations.No future is guaranteed; there will be injustices and suffering in every path forward, just as there have been forever. A utopia will never be achievable, but in striving to reach it, we can create the best possible world for us and our descendants.The larger the problems we face, the greater the opportunity for progress; the immense challenges of the 21st century can be the catalyst for a new leap in the human condition to heights we cannot yet imagine.We have everything we need to thrive. Our resiliency will protect us; our intelligence will propel us. If there is one lesson our history can teach us, it’s to never underestimate the human race.View image in fullscreenIllustrations by Seba CestaroJohn D Boswell is a film-maker, composer, visual effects artist and editor"

But I’m not sure I’m ready to be Old ZoeTue 29 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 06.13 EDTShareIt’s weird that it should happen for the first time so late in life, but next week I’m going on holiday with someone else called Zoe. I wasn’t particularly worried about it, since it’s generally easy enough to distinguish who is meant by the context, even when two people are the same age and do exactly the same things, as you will know if your name is Ben.In this case, the other Zoe is a teenager, so it will immediately be obvious who’s who, as our activities will scarcely overlap. Any Zoe who has made a serious error – lost someone else’s passport, backed into a tree – will be me and any Zoe who has forgotten her swimming costume or wantsto go paddleboardingwill be her.“You haven’t thought this through,” said my friend J. “You’re obviously going to be Big Zoe. You should start getting used to it now. By day four, you’ll probably just be Big ’Un.”I did not like this idea. I also think the other Zoe is taller than me, especially since my height has cascaded, via the march of time and some lying when I was young, from 5ft 10in (178cm) to 5ft 8in. Young people are much, much taller than this now. “Would you rather be Old Zoe?” asked J.There is no right answer to this, because if I insisted upon being the default, so we were Zoe and Young Zoe, that would still make me old. The director ofthe Vagina Museumin London has the whole same name as me; when I need to disambiguate from her, I go with “non-vagina Zoe Williams”, but this would take a bit of unpacking. I wouldn’t mind Wise Zoe, but I don’t think I’d get away with it (see passports, trees).“Could I be Woke Zoe?” I suggested. J mocked me for ages, because I don’t even know the meaning of the word compared with a woke teen, which puts me – surprisingly – in the same bracket as the rest of society.I may just go without a name for the week. It’s surprising how much you can do without on holiday. I almost never remember a swimming costume.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This summer, intending to dominate the news agenda during the long Westminster recess, Nigel Farage has decided to ramp up the dystopian rhetoric. “Broken” has morphed into “lawless”, as Mr Farage tours the country deploying language reminiscent of the “American carnage”speechdelivered by Donald Trump at his first inauguration in 2017.Unfounded claims of a hugerisein crime have been breezily tossed out to bolster the assertion that Britain is “facing nothing short of societal collapse”. The crisis of lawlessness on the streets,wroteMr Farage in a recent article for the Daily Mail, was being compounded by the government-sponsored arrival of “droves of unvetted men into our towns and cities”. Commenting on recent protests outside an Epping hotel accommodating asylum seekers, after a resident was charged with sexually assaulting a local teenage girl, he remarked that the country was close to “civil disobedience on a vast scale”.Accordingto the Crime Survey for England and Wales – which Mr Farage chooses to ignore but which is the most robust source of relevant evidence – incidents of theft, criminal damage and violence have been in long‑term decline since the 1990s. But Reform’s leader is more interested in sinister mood music than data, as he seeks to foment a feelbad factor.His aim is to portray a country in which disinterested elites preside over a law and order crisis intimately connected to immigration, and where there is a yearning for an authoritarian response along thelinessuggested by Mr Farage. Reform’spledgeto repeal the Online Safety Act, made on Monday at a “Britain is lawless” press conference, underlined its willingness to risk the further pollution of public discourse by disinformation and hate speech.As the chief constable of EssexremindedMr Farage last week, after he falsely alleged that police had driven counter-protesters to the site of the Epping hotel, inflammatory talk has real‑life consequences. In an echo of last summer’s riots after the appalling murder of three young girls in Southport, asylum seekers havereportedbeing chased and attacked in the town. Having in many cases fled violent and unstable situations elsewhere, they now fear for their safety again. In Essex, and elsewhere in the country, far-right groups areseekingto create the conditions for another conflagration.These are worrying developments. But Britain’s social fabric is not unravelling and the country is not on the verge of widespread civil conflict. A year ago, the vast majority of citizensbackeda hardline response to the scenes of disorder that took place. Nevertheless, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, was right toarguelast week that much more needs to be done to enhance social cohesion in places buffeted by change and starved of resources.The problem with Mr Farage is that his hyperbolic claims are designed to heighten and sharpen tensions rather than truly address them. For a party that aspires to govern and claims to be in the mainstream, fuelling a sense of insecurity and anger in this way is deeply irresponsible. Britain is still a long way from being Mr Trump’s America, and Reform’s cynical opportunism may fail to yield the political dividends hoped for. But we have been served with another reminder of the darkness at the heart of Mr Farage’s politics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So it was reassuring to hearSir Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, resist the momentum behind cryptocurrencies. In his July Mansion House speech, hereiteratedhisscepticismover the need for a “Britcoin” central bank digital currency or a UK stablecoin, with tokens issued by finance houses and backed by their sterling reserves. As Donald Trump signsstablecoinsinto US law and rebrands private dollars with political colours, Sir Andrew’s caution isn’t just prudent, it’s essential.The governor’sviewis that UK banks should not be allowed to issue their own stablecoins. Nor should the Bank effectively runBritcoinbank accounts without clear public benefit. These are not the views of a luddite, but of a regulator worried, correctly, about creating a new class of imprudent assets. The key question is not whether new technologies can be adopted in finance, but whether they should be – especially when the consequences of failure could affect the wider economy.George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who advises alarge cryptocurrency exchange, argued that Mr Trump’s embrace of stablecoins, which are privately issued digital money, means Britain must sign up to remain relevant. The former Labour cabinet minister Ed Ballsconsideredthis naive, given recent history. He was right.Stablecoins are not, despite the branding, stable. These private digital tokens purport to be backed one for one by real money, often US dollars. But the peg is only astrustworthyas the institution making the promise. When a commercial bank issues a stablecoin, it is effectively minting its own currency – without, as theBank for International Settlementsnoted, the backing, oversight or “lender of last resort” guarantees of a central bank. This creates a parallel financial market, one prone to runs, crashes and contagion – just as happened in19th-century America’s free banking era, when half the new banks collapsed, many unable to honour the notes they had issued.Yet Mr Trump is pressing ahead by letting banks and even non-banks issue dollar-pegged crypto assets. He is alsoleveragingthe power of his office for personal gain in plain sight. One of the Trump family’s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320m since January, while another received a $2bn investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550m in tokens. Steven Levitsky of Harvard University spoke for many when he told theGuardianthis summer that he had “never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere”.Cyber-libertariansviewcryptocurrencies as a tool to evade state control, regulation and taxation, aligning with radical rightwing ideas about government as a problem. This seems to be the view ofPaul Marshall, the UK hedge fund tycoon andmedia baron, who sees a Manichean world of central bank fiat versus free-market cash. Such ideological takes don’t help with stable capital markets or effective consumer protection. Britain’sfinancial sectorshould besmallerfor the country’s long-term health, but it must still remain competitive – on regulatory terms that preserve stability, not simply to keep pace with Trump-era financial populism orpetro-stateopportunism. Crypto is a gamble not just on technology, but on the very meaning of money and who gets to control it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Any aid is welcome, but theydropped 25 tonnes in one day, about 11 grams per Palestinian, barely a couple of teaspoonfuls. That’s not going to keep people alive, and neither are a few truckloads delivered over a limited period.In 1984-85, I served with Operation Bushel, the RAF detachment in Ethiopia that flew aid into areas of famine. The operation was approved by Margaret Thatcher, despite Ethiopia’s government being a brutal regime propped up by the Soviet Union. Delivering aid by air is difficult, risky and expensive; it’s appropriate only when there is no other option.In Gaza, the so-called safe area of al-Mawasi is only 10 miles by road from the Rafah crossing; just north of Gaza is a major Israeli port, with road access into Gaza just a few miles away. This is one of the worst aspects of the famine in Gaza: unlike in Ethiopia, where access was extremely difficult, in Gaza there is a mountain of aid sitting close by, but kept inaccessible by Israel’s actions.ThatBenjamin Netanyahuis allowing a trickle of aid into Gaza is a sign that international pressure has an effect. Most of the pressure here is coming from the public while our government spouts platitudes. Mrs Thatcher might have had the compassion and guts to take difficult decisions. Sir Keir Starmer clearly hasn’t.Doug MaughanDunblane, PerthshireI agree with Nesrine Malik (Protesting over Gaza’s starvation feels like screaming into a void – but we mustn’t stop, 28 July), but unfortunately we have allowed pro-Israel pressure groups to redefine criticism of Israel as antisemitism, and the government to redefine expressing support for Palestine as terrorism. The former can be brushed away, but an arrest under anti-terrorism laws, even if no charges are brought, can have serious affects on someone’s employment prospects and freedom to travel for the rest of their lives. If the proscription of Palestine Action is ever reversed, we must demand that any related arrests, charges and convictions are expunged from people’s records.Mike PerryIckenham,LondonNesrine Malik powerfully expressed the true nature of the catastrophe, the true horror of its outcomes and the true failure of governments to halt Israel’s wanton destruction of Palestine and its people.But her words, and these few, are wasted unless governments come together to halt military and trade relations, and institute sanctions that will force Israel to end military action, withdraw fromGaza, allow meaningful aid to reach its people, restore infrastructure and agree to a two-state solution.I have been a passive, if horrified, observer. I am now an active protester.Teresa BoohanLondonMy country can’t single-handedly stop what’s happening, but we could at a stroke cut off every atom of support, every shred of legitimacy to the perpetrators. And by choosing not to, my government is making me and all my fellow citizens accessories to an atrocity. How can I make it clear that I do not consent to this? Being ignored is what drives desperate law-abiding citizens first to be paint-sprayers and eventually to more violent forms of screaming.Katy JennisonWitney, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They risked their lives for one girl; I honour them beyond words.So how can it be that a country that has an institution specifically to research the past to honour those who saved those such as Roza 80 years ago can now treat other innocent civilians as so utterly worthless as to be condemned to slow death? And at such a short distance from where food aid is stockpiled, and beyond that a few more miles, where their own population is as well fed as any western country?

It was also the first match, no doubt of many over the coming years, that made a hero of Michelle Agyemang.Nick AmesThe final betweenEngland and Spainwas exactly what I expected from two heavyweights of the game. It was a gladiatorial tactical battle between Spain’s possession-loving football and England’s defensive diligence. A fitting ending to a brilliant tournament.Sophie DowneyFrance and Germany’s quarter-finalin Basel, which the Germans won 6-5 ina high-quality penalty shootout, provided compelling drama from start to finish and it was a game that had it all; a mindless red card, disallowed goals, VAR drama and the best save I can ever recall seeing live as Ann-Katrin Berger seemed to defy physics to claw the ball off the line. Ultimately it was a match that saw Germany doggedly progress despite playing 107 minutes of the game with 10 players. It was a remarkable knockout tie.Tom GarryAnn-Katrin BergerSweden 2-2 England. That game had just about everything. The prospect of an England comeback felt almost impossible approaching the 80th minute, but within a matter of seconds you just knew that they were going to do it. The drama!Emillia HawkinsSweden 2-2 England.Everyone will remember the stirring England comeback and the dramatic penalty shootout but this is a game that also deserves to be remembered for Sweden’s devastating opening burst, a standard of pulsating attacking football that stands with any produced at this tournament.Jonathan LiewFrance v Germany.This game had everything. A red card, a penalty, resolute German defending, THAT Ann-Katrin Berger save and a penalty shootout. The fact Germany were the first team at a women’s Euros to progress after going down to 10 players showed just how hard they worked. Berger also put in some great saves during the shootout – goalkeeper of the tournament for me.Sarah RendellIt has to be the final doesn’t it? England’s rollercoaster ride of a tournamentconcluded in a thrilling showpiecebetween magical world champions Spain and the Euro holders. It was the final everyone wanted and it delivered. England were battlers, tactically astute and disciplined, Spain were Spain, master technicians on the ball.Suzanne WrackPlayer of the tournamentHannah Hamptonwas little known to the wider public a month ago and had replaced a national treasure in Mary Earps between the posts. She left Switzerland having earned the same status by producing exceptional performances of which multiple penalty saves were only part. Calm, composed on the ball and with cat-like reflexes, Hampton deserves every credit.NAMichelle Agyemang.What a player. The 19-year-old was given an opportunity and seized it with both hands. The way she impacted games caught the eye but equally the way she came on in high pressure situations and handled them without panic. Will surely be a star for England for years to come.SDChloe Kellymade a gamechanging impact in all three of England’s knockout ties and therefore has to win this, in my eyes, although the best technical footballer was Aitana Bonmatí. Kelly came up clutch in the big moments, whether it was with her two lethal crosses to create England’s two quickfire goals in their comeback against Sweden, or her lively performance and late winner against Italy, or her assist for England’s equaliser in the final followed by her nerveless, title-clinching penalty.TGAitana Bonmatí.It’s crazy to think that she was hospitalised with viral meningitis just days before Euro 2025 started. Another great tournament for the midfielder despite the penalty miss at the end.EHPatri Guijarrohas been the standout player for Spain at this tournament, the one who makes everything work: absorbing pressure, providing an outlet in buildup, creating space, creating angles and snuffing out counterattacks.JLHonourable mentions must go to Klara Bühl and Iman Beney who were incredible but for me it has to beLucy Bronze. The defender started every game and played 598 minutes for England in total and the performances, particularly her leadership and skill against Sweden, were crucial to the Lionesses retaining the trophy. The fact she did all that with a fractured tibia is unbelievable and she once again lived up to one of her middle names: “Tough”.SRView image in fullscreenLucy Bronze was crucial to the Lionesses’ title defence and she played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia.Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images/AllstarAitana Bonmatí may have scooped player of the tournament but, for me, it was her midfield companionPatri Guijarrothat deserves all the plaudits. She became the second player on record, since the 2011 World Cup, to have completed 100-plus passes and won possession more than 10 times in a knockout stage game at a major tournament – after the Denmark great Katrine Pedersen.SWGoal of the tournamentWe can quibble over Ann-Katrin Berger’s positioning all we like, but for sheer did-she-really-try-that at such a knife-edge point in Spain’s semi-final against Germany, the winner fromAitana Bonmatístands above them all.NACristiana Girelli’s wonder strike against Portugal. The 35-year-old always delivers for Italy and did so in spectacular fashion on this occasion.SDClàudia Pina’s curler into the top corner against Belgium takes this for me, although her near-identical finish against Switzerland in the quarter-final was almost equally worthy. We should also throw more praise at Vivianne Miedema’s strike against Wales and Lauren James’ superb first-half goal against the Netherlands.TGLauren James v Netherlands.Not necessarily just because of the strike – which was great in itself – but also because of the buildup. That long pass from Hannah Hampton through to Alessia Russo in attack was absolutely exquisite.EHVivianne Miedema v Wales.Not just the screaming finish into the top corner from distance, but the quick feet and clever body feints to create the space for herself.JLClàudia PinaClàudia Pinahad a fine tournament and her goal against Belgium was an absolute stunner. It was similar to the rocket she scored against Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final. A sensational strike from outside the box.SRThere may have been prettier goals this tournament but the context ofMichelle Agyemang’s equaliser against Italy made it all the more remarkable. At just 19 years old, with less than a minute left of added time and with England 1-0 down and facing an exit from the tournament, the coolness with which the Arsenal forward scored through the legs of both a defender and the keeper was stunning. The celebrations also birthed one of the photos of the tournament, Girls on the Ball’s Rachel O’Sullivan’s renaissance-painting-esque shotcapturing the celebrationsof the bench and players’ families.SWView image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang’s goal against Italy kept the Lionesses in the tournament.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockPersonal highlightI loved being present in Geneva, where the best and loudest atmospheres materialised, forSwitzerland’s dramatic draw with Finland. The roof blew off when Riola Xhemaili equalised, sending the hosts through to the last eight, and it felt like a genuinely transformational moment in the country’s relationship with women’s football.NAObviously, England lifting the trophy but I feel incredibly lucky to get to work major tournaments with some of the best in the business. The way we all pulled together to help each other this last month is what it is all about.SDWhen Riola Xhemaili scored a 92nd-minute goal to send Switzerland into the knockout stages, I was watching the action on a screen that evidently had around a 10-second delay compared to other televisions, and therefore hearing the roar – before actually seeing the goal myself – of noise and cheers echoing all around the streets of Zurich, as an entire city was glued to the game and celebrating joyously, was a sound I’ll never forget. That was the moment I fully appreciated how emotionally-invested the host nation had become into their women’s football team, which was really heartening.TGMichelle Agyemang’s goal v Italy. From the verge of heartbreak to absolute ecstasy. The fact a 19-year-old kept England’s hopes alive on just her fourth appearance for the senior team, four years after she was a ball girl, is incredible.EHGetting recognised by Ellen White’s husband at half-time during the final. Happy to report Ellen and Callum are both avid Guardian readers.JLMichelle Agyemang became a star overnight with her equaliser against Sweden but the fact she did it again against Italy was quite something. The roar when she was shown on the big screen getting ready to come on in the final shows what she already means to England fans. A special summer for a special player.SRView image in fullscreenRiola Xhemaili’s goal for Switzerland against Finland was a huge moment for the host nation.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/APThe interaction with the players. Many of them know that some of us have been on this journey with them for a very long time. It’s been an incredible privilege to tell their stories and this tournament had stories in abundance. The jokes, the looks, the interviews. They are a very likeable group.SWWhat next for women’s football?Resource and attention need to be concentrated on countries that risk being left behind. England, Germany, France and Spain – for all their specific local issues – are going to be just fine. It is time to make sure clubs and national teams outside the leading pack are equipped to develop in both sporting and economic terms: “The head must not leave the body”, as a number of top Uefa executives are fond of saying.NAJust more of everything. More investment, more coverage, more fans, more viewership. The sky is the limit at the moment.SDThe next Euros in 2029 needs to feature larger stadiums to try to surpass a million spectators, and there are some strong contenders with Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and a joint Denmark-Sweden bid all in the running. In England, the challenge now has to be to improve the grassroots facilities for girls and women across the country and make sure the huge influx of young girls who have taken up the sport in the past few years can be retained within the sport into their teenage years and adult lives, for a long-lasting legacy. Lastly, the Women’s Super League needs to capitalise on the national team’s success by reversing last season’s decline in average attendances.TGIt’s been fantastic to see how Switzerland as a nation has embraced women’s football this summer. Hopefully we see the same with other nations. Given the success of the Lionesses once again this year it would also be great to see a steady increase in TV viewing figures and attendances across England.EHThis is a thornier question than it appears. Huge levels of interest at big events do not necessarily translate to mass appeal at domestic or grassroots level. But as long as the funding is there (and fairly distributed), and as long as the institutional will to grow the game remains (looking at you,Jim Ratcliffe and Daniel Levy), we can anticipate another few years of cautious, optimistic growth.JLHopefully this Euros win will see attendances in the WSL rise again and for other leagues across Europe to reap the same reward with most teams impressing one way or another at the tournament. But the next step now is to focus on and celebrate the football and the players. This Euros win for the Lionesses felt like it was all about the football rather than having to prove something to others.SRThe sky’s the limit. The impact of the win in 2022 was evident in the support for England this time round. That will be elevated again. This team has changed the face of women’s football and society for the better. Their platform is bigger than ever and there can be little doubt that they will take full advantage of that increased authority to challenge things and fight for more for women and girls.SWExplore more on these topicsFootballEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But if they have decided to focus on winning games and entertaining the public, and chosen not to play for draws or focus on individual milestones, it does not mean everyone else has. Centuries are still important to players. Sometimes a draw is a positive result.What we saw from England when India initially refused to accept the draw on Sunday was a combination of natural disappointment – they had dominated the game, played so much good cricket, wanted to force home the advantage and make the final Test a dead rubber – genuine tiredness and a bit of cultural insensitivity. Certain situations are viewed differently around the world.India’s head coach clashes with Oval staff before fifth Test as tempers flareRead moreRemember theJonny Bairstow incident at Lord’sduring the 2023 Ashes, orRavi Ashwin running out Jos Buttlerat the non-striker’s end in the 2019 Indian Premier League? The way those things were viewed in the UK and abroad was very different. I know from my time in county cricket that most teams would have walked off, even if they had a couple of batters approaching centuries, but in international cricket it is different – centuries mean more.In 2008, I was playing for Surrey against Somerset in the County Championship at Taunton. The wicket was very flat, one day was completely rained off and at the point the game was petering into a draw I was on about 190. The players started shaking hands but Justin Langer, the Australia opener who was the Somerset captain at the time, stopped everyone and said: “We’re staying on – either we get Mark out or he gets a double hundred.”The game ended a few minutes later when I reached 200. Justin had recognised, even though I was playing for the opposition, there was a milestone a batter had worked hard to earn.It is not as if the English completely ignore individual achievements. In the same Test we had been happy to celebrate Joe Root’s, when he becamethe second-highest Test run-scorer. Graham Gooch, Alastair Cook and Jimmy Anderson have spoken of their pride at achieving milestones. I would hope and expect that if a young England player in search of their maiden Test century were 90 not out, their captain would be aware of that moment. To achieve that is a huge thing in someone’s life, there is no guarantee they will be in that situation again, and the confidence it gives them can be huge.View image in fullscreenJoe Root passing Ricky Ponting in the list of Test run-scorers was rightly celebrated.Photograph: George Franks/ProSports/ShutterstockSome of the comments captured on the stump microphone did not reflect well on England. They played some magnificent cricket and dominated the game, butthat petulanceseems to have overshadowed it. I hope the ending will have taught them a couple of important lessons, about respecting other teams’ cultures and other players’ ambitions and the real value of a draw.McCullum and Stokes may have no interest in them, but in a five-Test series between two evenly matched teams there are likely to be times when one of them has to fight to save a game and a draw becomes a result to be celebrated. It takes me back to England and South Africa in 1998, when Angus Fraser blocked out Allan Donald in the last over for a draw when we had been completely outplayed to keep the score at 0-1. We were massively buoyed up by that result and went on to win the last two Tests to take the series.For the final game starting on Thursday the contest is still alive. All the pitches have been pretty flat, but the signature at the Oval, certainly at domestic level, is a good wicket with some grass still on it. Gus Atkinson has not played a lot recently but there is a strong argument for bringing him in. He should get a bit of extra movement on his home ground.Sheepishness may follow sour grapes in handshakes row as England near end of brutal series | Ali MartinRead moreEngland will need to decide the makeup of their attack not just based on the quality of their bowlers, but on their fragility and how they are dealing with fatigue. People of my generation struggle to understand why, if someone is fit to play, you would not play him. This is a huge game, against huge opponents, with the series on the line. The idea of resting and rotating fit players is puzzling to me: they have bowled a lot of overs, but there is a game to win. The big question is the captain because England cannot afford for Stokes to go bust. So their three seamers have to be bankers who can be relied on to bowl a lot of overs.At Old Trafford, the lack of penetration from Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse, particularly when the ball was hard and there was a bit of uneven bounce, was surprising. Liam Dawson was tidy, but I thought he would create a few more problems.Beyond Stokes and Root, the two to emerge with credit were Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley. India never recovered from the way the openers took the attack to them. They are a pair who live by the sword and die by the sword, but we saw how hard it was to bowl to them and how even very good teams struggle to stop them scoring once they slip into gear. People are very quick to leap upon their failures, but we should also savour their successes.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

Whether the Turnberry owner was Donald Trump or Donald Duck, its lack of adjacent infrastructure makes it unfit for the Open. The Ayrshire venue, lauded again by its owner, Trump,during a visit in recent days, is simply incapable of hosting the Open in its present form.This need not be an uncomfortable reality for the US president, who can secure at least a portion of the profile and kudos he desires for Turnberry – one of the world’s most outstanding golf courses – from an alternative source. It would, in fact, now be a surprise if Turnberry does not appear on the Scottish Open’s rota at some point soon. Mutual convenience is staring us all in the face if Trump can even temporarily accept a prize which sits in the shadow of the championship he has craved since buying Turnberry in 2014.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump takes the inaugural tee shot on the first hole at Trump International.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockTheEuropean TourGroup has proved adept at navigating choppy sporting waters. Or, perhaps, merely dealing with the same away from prying eyes. It was the DP World Tour, formerly European, which eased Saudi Arabia into the golf mainstream and it is the same tour which allows Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton to pursue Ryder Cup ambitions while technically in dispute over fines issued for participation in LIV competitions.As eyes fix on Royal Porthcawl and the Women’s Open this week, where Lottie Woad will look to continue her vertiginous rise, the Legends Tour – Europe’s domain for senior citizens – will stop off at Trump Aberdeen. Only days later, the DP World Tour’s Nexo Championship is to be contested at the same venue. The European Tour Group has continued its trick of hiding in plain sight by arranging these events with no backlash whatsoever. Not so much as a raised eyebrow; a scenario that will inevitably continue as the tournaments take place.Depending on one’s viewpoint, this is either a tremendous example of public relations or an ominous sign that few people care about the European Tour Group’s approach to business. This is not at all to suggest protest or hand-wringing is essential, rather that Trump has quietly and already increased his golfing footprint in a land far from home. The Scottish government has even contributed £180,000 of public money to the Nexo Championship.The stakes look set to be raised. Doonbeg, now Trump Ireland, is known to be under consideration to stage the Irish Open. Reports suggest that could happen as quickly as 2026. Doonbeg and the Irish Open looks a strong alliance; a stunning location which also boasts hotel accommodation. Ireland, like Scotland, should have links venues for its national open.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump lauded Turnberry on his latest trip to the course.Photograph: Hugo Philpott/UPI/ShutterstockGuy Kinnings, the European Tour Group’s chief executive, attended a function in Trump’s company in Aberdeenshire on Monday evening before being present for the opening of the president’s New Course on the Menie Estate. As Trump cut the ribbon on the New Course, Kinnings was one of just four people standing behind him; two were the president’s sons.TheScottish Open’s present baseat the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is convenient. Leading players can stay on or close to the venue. Renaissance’s American owners want the Scottish Open to stay there in perpetuity. The tournament offers a form of seaside preparation immediately before the Open. Last month’s edition, though, bore witness to audible grumbles from golfers about the nature of that test. It is impossible to shake the feeling that Scotland has too many exceptional, true links courses for this competition to remain at its current home. Chief among them? Turnberry.There may be a necessary break to Renaissance’s run. The R&A will give the Open an overdue return to Muirfield at some point, meaning it would be logistically impossible to stage the previous week’s Scottish equivalent at a course which is basically next door. A switch to the west coast would make perfect sense at that point. Any suggestion Turnberry would be banned from future Open duties by hosting the DP World Tour is undermined by the fact professionals and amateurs crash around St Andrews and Carnoustie every year at the Dunhill Links Championship. Turnberry could not only handle a Scottish Open but would be a celebrated venue.“We love Scotland,” Trump announced before boarding Air Force One on Tuesday.

He was a special horse’Greg Woodat GoodwoodTue 29 Jul 2025 12.35 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 16.57 EDTShareThe result seemed immaterial after the Group One Goodwood Cup on Tuesday as confirmation arrived that Trueshan, one of the most popular horses in training thanks to a hugely successful partnership with his regular jockey, Hollie Doyle, had sustained a fatal injury in the two-mile feature event on the opening day ofGlorious Goodwood.Trueshan sustained a fracture of his left-hind pastern while galloping uphill on the far side of the track and was immediately attended by the track’s veterinary team. Alan King’s nine-year-old gelding had set off as a 22-1 chance for a repeat of his win in this race in 2021, which was Trueshan’s first success – and Doyle’s second – at Group One level.Trainers’ chief backs radical alternative to government’s gambling tax planRead more“I’m just devastated,” Doyle said later. “It couldn’t be any worse. He was a special, special horse, I can’t think of anything else to say. I am gutted. He’s been amazing for me, a star, and those memories we have together are some of my very best.”The race on Tuesday was the 35th start of Trueshan’s career, during which he was a last-minute scratch from several major races because of concerns over fast ground.In addition to his Goodwood Cup success four years ago, he recorded two wins in the Group One Prix du Cadran at Longchamp in October, one in the Group Two Doncaster Cup and three in the Long Distance Cup at Ascot on Champions Day in October. Trueshan also put up one of the most impressive handicap performances of recent decades in the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle in 2022, when he won the famous two-mile race under 10st 8lb off an official mark of 120.James Given, the British Horseracing Authority’s director of equine welfare, told Racing TV that “like all the horses running here today, Trueshan was examined by my team this morning and gave us no concerns””Given said: “What has happened unfortunately is just an accident, mid-race, in a straight line going up a hill. His left-hind pastern broke and left him in a situation that wasn’t recoverable from.“He would have been immediately sedated and given pain relief while vets examined the extent of the injury. Alan was able to get down there and assess him with the vets, and they felt there was no option really but to put him down.”View image in fullscreenScandinavia ridden by Wayne Lordan (centre) wins the Goodwood Cup.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAScandinavia, the eventual winner of the race on Tuesday, was the first three-year-old to secure the prize since Stradivarius, who went on to win the Ascot Gold Cup three times, in 2017.Aidan O’Brien’s colt got the better of a sustained struggle with his stable companion and favourite, Illinois, and is now likely to set off as the market leader for the St Leger at Doncaster next month.“They were head-to-head all the way down the straight and it was exactly what you like to watch,” O’Brien said. “He’s by Justify and he showed what we see in Justifys all the time, they will not lie down. No matter how tired they get, the strides keeps going and the head keeps down.”Take Gold to shine in SussexField Of Gold’s three-year-old career to date has been an near-facsimile of his sire Kingman’s second season on the track, even including a second-place finish in a 2,000 Guineas that he probably should have won, and the pattern is likely to continue at Goodwood on Wednesday when John & Thady Gosden’s colt lines up for the Group One Sussex Stakes.Field Of Gold(3.05)will probably set off at a similar price to Kingman too, as his sire was a 2-5 shot to beat three rivals in this race 11 years ago and Field Of Gold is also odds-on for his first start in all-aged company.Field Of Gold confirmed his status as the season’s best three-year-old miler with an emphatic three-and-a-half-length defeat of Aidan O’Brien’s Henri Matisse in the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot last month.Henri Matisse is again among his half-dozen rivals on Wednesday and Goodwood’s sharp downland circuit is a different test, but even a master tactician such as O’Brien will struggle to hatch a plan to overturn his Ascot deficit and Rosallion, the St James’s Palace Stakes winner last year, is a more credible rival for the favourite.Richard Hannon’s colt was a late scratch from the Sussex 12 months ago because of an infection and missed the rest of the campaign, and has just one more start on his career record than Field Of Gold. Even his best form to date gives him something to find with the Gosdens’ runner, though, and the Classic generation’s recent dominance in this race – with four wins in the past six years – should continue.Goodwood 1.20A slow start from a wide draw leftSing Us A Songwith a mountain to climb in the King George V Handicap at Royal Ascot last time and he did well to finish within seven lengths of the winner in the circumstances.

Since his side took an unbeatable 2-0 series lead against the Wallabies he has even had a congratulatory message from the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, who was in Melbourne forthe game last Saturday. Was he asking Itoje to consider dipping his toes into politics? “No, no … he has some world issues to try and sort out before that.”Ask Itoje about his future vision for the Lions, however, and his manifesto is crystal clear. This tour has been the England captain’s third in a red jersey and with every passing year his personal appreciation of the Lions continues to grow. “It’s been without a shadow of a doubt one of the highlights of my career. When I am old and grey these occasions and these tours are going to be one of the experiences I look back on with extreme fondness.”The Breakdown | Absorbing Lions tour of Australia shows why best-of-three Test format worksRead moreHe also firmly believes that, for every top player, representing the Lions is a light that will never go out. “I would be surprised if you can find a British and Irish rugby player who says they don’t want to be a Lion. This is something the players will continue to want for decades and for as long as rugby is being played. It’s something I know provides a huge sense of excitement in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. And it adds an extra bit of spice and intrigue to the Six Nations when it’s a Lions year. So I am struggling to see the negatives. It is a great event and long may it continue.”Coming from a man who is now one of just six living individualsto have captained a series-winning Lions squad– the others being Willie John McBride (1974), Finlay Calder (1989), Martin Johnson (1997) and Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones (2013) – it is a significant rallying cry. There are occasional moments, particularly in the ever-more detailed modern game, when the Lions can feel like an anachronism but nothing gives the concept more of a boost than an enjoyable series win.Interestingly, Itoje is also of the opinion that the quadrennial Lions tour rota should not be casually altered, amid increasing support in high places for a potential tour to France one day. “I thought about this at the beginning of the tour. There’s a strong sense of history and tradition … part of me is keen for it to continue to rotate among the three countries it does. Also it wouldn’t feel the same if we took a short-haul flight. It needs a long‑haul flight!”With a simply stunning view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge as the backdrop to the Lions’ first fitness session since clocking back on after 48 hours of celebrations, Itoje’s logic was easy to follow. There are many worse places to spend a week with a major series already in the bag but, as their captain was swift to reiterate, the Lions are still over here on business.View image in fullscreen‘You build bonds’: Maro Itoje celebrates with his Lions teammates, including Jamie Osborne and Jac Morgan, in Melbourne.Photograph: Billy Stickland/Inpho/Shutterstock“We want to be part of something very special,” Itoje said, brushing aside any notion that he might wish to sit out the final Test. “Winning a Lions Test series is obviously extremely special but what would be an absolute dream would be to go out, perform to the level to which we think we can perform and win the third game.“While the first two games have been great, there’s still a feeling that we haven’t put it together in a way we know we can. We want to chase down the performance we’ve been searching for. The Wallabies will be hungry and up for it but we also want to make some history this weekend.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As recently as last month, for instance, he would never have guessed he would be spending time with Ireland’s Jamie Osborne, let alone greeting the latter by his nickname. Itoje said: “I now know that whenever I play against him in the future I can call him ‘Showbiz’ and he will have that little smirk on his face.“I also have a lot of admiration for Jac Morgan, who is a very, very talented player. I’ve respected him from afar and being alongside him has been amazing. Finlay Bealham is another one. I never thought we would have a good relationship, but he’s absolutely hilarious and a very endearing person. I can go through so many others.”Even at the end of a marathon season, consequently, Itoje sounds like a captain who doesn’t want the tour to end. “It has been said before but, in many ways, it shouldn’t really work. You have four different nations, four different ideologies, several different ways of how to play the game and how to think. It is not a homogenous group but people buy in, you forge great relationships and you build bonds. That’s what makes it special.”Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025Maro ItojeBritish & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

This is unbelievable. Thank you for coming out.“My message is, everything we do, obviously we do it for us and our team, but we do it for the country, and we do it for young girls. This job never existed 30, 40 years ago and we’re making history every single step. Thank you so much for being with us. Stay with us, this story is not done yet.”Williamson, who also led England to glory at home in 2022, was asked how this victory felt different to their first piece of silverware three years ago. The defender said: “There are lots of ways to win a football match and we repeatedly did it the hard way, but I think you can see how much we care about playing for England and how much we love it.“I don’t know, 2022 was a fairytale but this feels really hard‑earned. We’re very proud of ourselves and we hope you are, too.”View image in fullscreenThe England team are greeted by thousands of fans.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe Lionesses lost their first match of the campaign, against France, but defeated the Netherlands, Wales, Sweden and Italy on their route to the final on Sunday against Spain, which was won 3-1 in a penalty shootout.Williamson said: “The first game maybe rocked us a little bit, but they’re just special people and we love each other, and we’ve got each other’s backs. We had tough moments and nasty things to deal with and still we rise.”The team’s next challenge will be to win a first Women’s World Cup, when that event is staged in Brazil in the summer of 2027, a gauntlet that was thrown down to them by King Charles when – in his congratulatory message on Sunday – asked the team to “bring home the World Cup in 2027 if you possibly can”.In the meantime, the team’s celebrations will continue. Among the other star performers of their run to glory in Switzerland was Hannah Hampton, playing in a tournament as the No 1 goalkeeper for the first time. She saved two penalties in the final and told the presenter Alex Scott on stage on Tuesday: “They [her teammates] got me through the whole tournament, when it didn’t start off the way I wanted [it] to and they just kept me going.View image in fullscreenEngland’s players celebrate with fans during a ceremony in front of Buckingham Palace.Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP“To be standing here with this group of girls is amazing.

I got told many times that I’m not good enough, that I shouldn’t be playing football from the start, so just keep doing it and, if it makes you happy, go follow that smile.”The award for young player of the tournament was given to Michelle Agyemang, the 19-year-old striker who scored two crucial equalisers for England in the quarter- and semi-finals. Given a rapturous reception by the central London crowds, the Arsenal player said: “I’m so grateful to be here. It’s still surreal. It doesn’t even seem real seeing people down there, it seems fake!

Under Sarina Wiegman, the Lionesses became the first England team to win a trophy on foreign soil. Here are our favourite pictures coupled with excerpts from our match reports and blogs.GAME 1: GROUP D5 JULY, STADION LETZIGRUNDFrance 2 (Katoto 36, Baltimore 39)England 1(Walsh 87)View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton (right) fails to save a shot by France’s Sandy Baltimore as England stumbled in their opening game of the tournament. Photograph above: Michael Buholzer/AP.Click on the images below to reveal further captions.The hour was approaching when Sarina Wiegman rolled the dice or, perhaps more accurately, reached for the comfort blanket. A salvage operation of this scale had not been part of anyone’s masterplan, but at least Ella Toone and Chloe Kelly knew exactly how to move the dial at a European Championship. They were the history makers at Wembley in England’s most recent appearance on this stage; if it was going to be anyone, it surely had to be them. There were to be no heroics this time, even if Selma Bacha’s late clearance was ultimately all that came between Wiegman’s players and a draw. That statement is, in itself, illusory because the manager must face questions about her selection here. She had plumped for Lauren James’s explosive gifts in the No 10 position, sticking to the claim that the Chelsea forward was ready to ramp up her recovery from injury, but the call backfired badly. England were misshapen and leggy where it mattered; the game simply got away from them and so, with another ill-conceived step against the Netherlands, could their Euro 2025 campaign. A positive reading might be that England were sharpened up here: given the jolt reigning champions sometimes need.Nick AmesView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGAME 2: GROUP D9 JULY, STADION LETZIGRUNDEngland 4(James 22 60, Stanway 45, Toone 67)Netherlands 0View image in fullscreenEngland’s Georgia Stanway celebrates scoring their second goal with Ella Toone in a resounding performance against fellow heavyweights the Netherlands. Photograph above: Annegret Hilse/Reuters.Click on the images below to reveal further captions.From shambolic to sublime, England brushed off fears of a group-stage exit with a thrilling and clinical defeat of the Netherlands. England know how to win knockout matches and that was the territory they had entered a little earlier than planned. They also know how to shake off a defeat against top-level teams, their 2-1 Nations League loss to France in May 2024 followed by a 2-1 win over the same opposition in Saint-Étienne four days later. They also knew they had lost opening games and gone far at the World Cup in 2015 and the Euros in 2009. Messages came in from former Lionesses to remind them of those things, the Euro 2022 group chat still active. The difference between the sloppy and slightly shellshocked play against France and the focused and aggressive football played against the Netherlands in a sunny Stadion Letzigrund was night and day. The threat of an exit had sharpened the minds and the passing significantly, and Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone dictated play from the middle and increased the potency of Lauren Hemp and Lauren James out wide as Andries Jonker’s side got narrower and narrower. England’s title defence is well and truly alive, but they will be cautious.Suzanne WrackView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGAME 3: GROUP D13 JULY, ARENA ST GALLENEngland 6(Stanway 13pen, Toone 22, Hemp 30, Russo 44, Mead 72, Beever-Jones 89Wales 1Cain 76View image in fullscreenElla Toone scores England’s second goal against Wales in a widely expected demolition job that sealed their place in the knockout stages. Photograph above: Annegret Hilse/Reuters.Click on the images below to reveal further captions.Sarina Wiegman said her Lionesses side found a sense of “urgency” to book their place in the quarter-finals of the European Championship with a comfortable 6-1 victory over Wales. “This urgency comes [after the France defeat],” the England head coach said. “You could see the togetherness of our team. We knew today would be a different game because we knew we would have the ball a lot. I’m very happy with the performance. We knew that Wales really wanted to fight and we tried to stay out of it. I think in most of the moments we did but in the beginning we were sloppy.” A key part of England’s improved form during a tough Group D was a shift in gameplan from Wiegman and the coaching staff. One change has been the introduction of Ella Toone back into the No 10 role against the Netherlands with the ever-creative Lauren James moving out to the right. Keira Walsh, the Uefa player of the match, credited Toone for England’s change in fortunes. “She’s come in and done an incredible job,” she said. “People speak about her offensively, but the defensive work she does for me and Georgia [Stanway] when she’s in [the No 10 role] is incredible. She covers a lot of spaces that we can’t.”Sophie DowneyView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGAME 4: QUARTER-FINAL17 JULY, STADION LETZIGRUNDSweden 2(Asllani 2, Blackstenius 25)England 2(Bronze 79, Agyemang 81)AET England won 3-2 on penaltiesView image in fullscreenEngland’s Lucy Bronze scores a penalty past the Sweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk during the shootout after an epic comeback from two goals down.

The noise washes over the athletics track where Carl Lewis and Asafa Powell once broke the world record, and where Sweden are now flying out of the blocks and leaving England trailing in their dust. We do not yet know that in many ways this is simply the prologue, that this devastating early two-goal flurry is actually relatively benign in comparison with the carnage that will follow. We do not yet know that Lauren James will end up playing almost an hour in a double pivot. We do not yet know that Lucy Bronze will end up wearing the captain’s armband on her wrist and kicking a giant credit card advert. Hannah Hampton, nose still unbloodied, has not the faintest inkling that this will end up being the greatest night of her career. But they all know something. Even if they’re not entirely conscious of it. Even as an utterly shambolic England trail Sweden 2-0 and the obituaries for their campaign are being scribbled, there is a little knot of refusal there, a team with an entirely unwarranted calmness at its core, a team that against all the available visual evidence still trusts that everything is going to work out. Perhaps the hallmark of certain great teams is in sensing almost subconsciously when they are allowed to play badly and when they are not, when the level needs to be raised, when the stakes are at their sharpest.Jonathan LiewView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGAME 5: SEMI-FINAL22 JULY, STADE DE GENÈVEEngland 2(Agyemang 90+5, Kelly 120)Italy 1(Bonansea 33)England won in extra timeView image in fullscreenChloe Kelly celebrates with Michelle Agyemang after scoring the winning goal late in extra-time.

England’s remarkably late comeback, with Agyemang scoring in the sixth minute of second-half stoppage time before Kelly’s winner in the penultimate minute of extra time, booked the Lionesses a place in their third consecutive major tournament final. “Big Mich at it again!” Kelly said to ITV Sport, discussing Agyemang’s third goal in four senior international games since her April debut. “She’s unbelievable and she should have scored again: that one that hit the crossbar. She’s an unbelievable player and she’s got the world at her feet, a young player with a bright future and I’m absolutely buzzing for her.” The match was played two days after Jess Carter revealed she had received what the England team described as poisonous racist abuse on social media. The Lionesses said they were not going to take the knee before the game. Instead, the substitutes stood arm in arm on the touchline before kick-off, including Kelly, who said: “I’m so proud to stand side by side with the girls in this team; Jess Carter and every single player in this team.”Tom GarryView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGAME 6: FINAL27 JULY, ST JAKOB-PARKEngland 1(Russo 57)Spain 1(Caldentey 25)AET England won 3-1 on penaltiesView image in fullscreenChloe Kelly of England celebrates after scoring the team’s winning penalty in the final against Spain.

England are European champions. Again. Writing a new chapter in the history book of English football. Leah Williamson, the first England captain to lift two major trophies. Michelle Agyemang, the 19-year-old wonderkid. Jess Carter and her remarkable performanceamid the most difficult of times. Hannah Hampton, defying the odds to become England’s saviour on penalties, twice. Chloe Kelly almost quitting football in January and becoming a European champion for club and country by the end of July. Lucy Bronzeplaying with a leg fracture.Each one of the 23 has a tale to tell. The people are remarkable and their stories are remarkable.Though they were the reigning champions, this tournament was in many ways a harder European Championship to win than in 2022. Then, they had home advantage and their first-choice starting XI avoided injury and Covid at the crucial time. At the home tournament the support around the side stepped up a gear and aligned with a playing group that was a mix of the best of the preceding generation and the cream of the new crop of young professionals coming through, who had benefited from the investment in the Women’s Super League and national team pathways.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang and her teammates celebrate in confetti after the final in Basel.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockThe water has been choppier since, as England’s record became pockmarked with defeats and draws. There were setbacks for Williamson and Beth Mead, who both suffered anterior cruciate ligament injuries that ruled them out of the 2023 World Cup. On the eve of that tournament came news the players were frustrated that talks over bonuses had broken down. Still, they battled on, reaching a second major final in 12 months, which they lost against Spain.‘Proper England’: perfect unity that shows how Lionesses triumphed over the odds | Jonathan LiewRead moreThe following two years would be similarly fraught, England failing to secure qualification for a Team GB side at the 2024 Olympic Games before Nations League defeats by Belgium and Spain led to many questioning the viability of their European title defence in Switzerland.The decisions this year of Mary Earps and Fran Kirby to retire from international football, and of Millie Bright to withdraw herself from selection in the space of a few days, only further fuelled the doubts.The landscape was very different going into this tournament compared to the last. Time moves fast in women’s football and, as federations increasingly see the growth potential in the women’s game, the rest of Europe is catching up.The English FA responded with extra investment, seen in the finer details. No expense was spared in ensuring the players were supported. That included their barista James and his dog Reggie accompanying them to Switzerland, and everything from games consoles to basketball hoops and Lioness-branded Yorkshire tea. They were also able to bring their own home comforts, Agyemang having her piano and Lauren Hemp a Lego castle. It’s these fine margins that continue to be a key aspect in keeping England’s noses ahead, but there are other important factors that contributed to this win.Critically, the togetherness of the team has been a feature of interviews with the players and the head coach, Sarina Wiegman. That has not been automatic, it has been carefully crafted, the players encouraged to share stories of their personal journeys for that purpose. Many of those have been publicly shared too, players keen to be ambassadors and people who fans can empathise with and connect to: Bronze spoke about her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism diagnoses,Hampton discussed an eye conditionthat affects her depth perception and had doctors doubting whether she’d be able to play, Williamson and Mead talked candidly about their anterior cruciate ligament recovery journeys.View image in fullscreenAllowing players to take home comforts, such as Lauren Hemp’s Lego model of the castle in Disney’s Beauty and the Beast, was key in building harmony.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThey bonded further through their shared anger and frustration at the racist abuse meted out to Carter online and their collective public condemnation of it. They have also been united in personal grief, with Mead and Ella Toone being consoled by teammates amid the celebrations, a poignant reminder that sometimes good times don’t feel so good.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These were 23 players ready to fight for each other until they had nothing left to give, Bronze – playing with a fractured tibia in one leg and picking up a knee injury on the other and still trying to stay on – epitomising that. That is a big part of why, with the pressure on following a humbling defeat by France in the opening game, England didn’t collapse. Every game from then on in was a final, win or bust. A thrilling 4-0 victory against the Netherlands made it seem like the tide had turned, and the 6-1 win against Wales suggested that the Lionesses had settled into their tournament rhythm.They finished second in the group to France, opening up the kinder side of the draw, on paper. Sweden, though, have been tricky opponents for England over the years and it was no different in Zurich, the similarities in style of play between the two sides evident. A terrible first half was followed by a thrilling second as England fought back from two goals down, forced extra time, then won a ludicrous shootout, their ability to dig deep, that unity and their belief tested to the maximum.View image in fullscreenHead coach Sarina Wiegman’s wry sense of humour has been an important cog in the winning machine.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThey had to come from behind in all three of their knockout games, Agyemang’s late goal against Italy forcing extra time before Kelly scored the winner. In the final, Alessia Russo cancelled out Mariona Caldentey’s goal before the game ended in another shootout in which Hampton saved two and Kelly scored the decisive penalty. England led for only 4min 52sec across the quarter-final, semi-final and the final. They were aided by the depth they have in the squad, forged from investment in the WSL and in the England youth teams. And there is the flexibility in that depth, illustrated by Mead playing as a deep-lying midfielder against Sweden and then Italy, as England hurled the attacking equivalent of the kitchen sink at them.In the final they had the gameplan too, the blueprint set out by their defeat of Spain at Wembley in February and inArsenal’s underdog victoryagainst Barcelona in the Champions League final. Near-perfect and perfect defensive displays were, respectively, required in those matches. Tellingly, neither England nor Arsenal tried to outplay Spain and Barcelona, letting them do what they do, while staying disciplined defensively and attacking their weaknesses out wide. That was what England did in Basel.Wiegman has been a significant cog. As the FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said, many teams have great players but none have a manager of her quality. She is loved by her players. Her message to her 23 before the Italy game and then the final was a simple one, that spoke to her wry sense of humour and the battling spirit of the team. She brought out a “little toiletry bag that said: ‘Bitches get shit done,’ and bitches got shit done today”, Mead said after the final. “That is it, drop the mic.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

The morning coffees were still taking hold as officials from clubs, federations and other stakeholders settled down for a forum designed partly to debrief the previous month. There was no mistaking the congratulatory mood and Marchetti was determined to see it last. The tournament would not be “like a butterfly, over in 24 hours”, he said; instead its reverberations would be felt far into a burgeoning sport’s future.There was certainly little sign of any effects dulling as afterparties swung long into the nightfollowing England’s heist against Spain. The overwhelming sense was of euphoria, sprinkled with relief, that host and governing body had pulled off what some viewed as a high‑wire act. Switzerland’s relatively modest football infrastructure, not to mention its muted appreciation of the women’s game, had raised eyebrows but it staged an event that delivered to the last.Singing, dancing and a cavapoo called Reggie: how England celebrated Euro 2025 gloryRead more“It’s a very strong image of Switzerland that has been shared with the whole world,” the Swiss football association president, Dominique Blanc, said on Monday. “It has exceeded our expectations as organiser and also the expectation of Uefa.”All parties can reel off a string of convincing figures. If Switzerland needed the money it can bask in 200 million francs (£186m) brought in through tourism by the European Championship. That is a direct consequence of the numbers that make Uefa particularly proud: a record attendance of more than 657,000; all bar two of the 31 games being recorded as sellouts; the number of visiting supporters far exceeding those at previous editions.Then came the sensory evidence that it remains worth granting host status to grow football in countries that are not autocracies, petrostates or both. Switzerland rose cautiously but, in the end, entirely to the challenge of presenting a spectacle. The country has never experienced scenes such as the fan walk in Berne before their historicquarter-final against Spain, when a sea of red flowed over Nydeggbrücke bridge and snaked up the hill towards Stadion Wankdorf. Those fan marches, replicated by several nations’ fanbases across the month, were evidence of a women’s football supporter culture that has grown in shape and identity here. Uefa wanted to learn more about the sport’s audience, its habits and its mores, at Euro 2025 and has been presented with compelling answers.View image in fullscreenBerne was turned into a sea of red as Swiss fans marched across the Nydeggbrücke bridge before the quarter-final against Spain.Photograph: Priscila Bütler/SPP/ShutterstockNor has Switzerland experienced many noises like the commotion that erupted in Geneva when theNatidramaticallyequalised against Finland. Crucially it learned to embrace and cherish a young, multicultural team with none of the cynicism previously unloaded on some of their male counterparts. Opportunity knocks in the marketable, vastly talented forms of Sydney Schertenleib and Iman Beney.The country now has a platform to do more than flap its wings. Can it harness that momentum between now and the next Nations League campaign in February? Uefa will hope so as it looks to bolster the suite of credible, high-level contenders for its competitions.England’s win at leastgave the lie to any idea that Spain could not be toppled but, among some observers, there was quiet disappointment about the level shown by some big guns.Neither France nor Germany convinced, while the Netherlands flopped; Sweden had looked the best prepared team to take onLa Rojabutblew their quarter-final againstan England side propelled by its own destiny. It felt instructive when Emma Hayes, a speaker at Uefa’s forum on Sunday, suggested England’s transitions had not been as slick as those at Euro 2022. That proved not to matter and there is a sense the standard of play at the top end did not kick on this year, even if there was evidence of a hugely welcome rise in level lower down.Sydney SchertenleibQuality, though, is not always the most important measure of a tournament. Short-term endorphin kicks engender the buzz, especially among remote viewers, and it did little harm to the competition’s role in hearts and minds that so many of the decisive tussles staggered towards penalty shootouts or dramatic extra‑time resolutions. Those moments, much more than the cruises and cakewalks, cement an event in new supporters’ consciousnesses. Euro 2025 achieved that in greater concentration than any of its past equivalent tournaments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Switzerland’s success has given a green light to choose a more outwardly ambitious host for Euro 2029 from five candidates. Germany appears the early favourite and would also be large enough to sustain an expanded tournament, an eventuality that has not entirely been extinguished.The women’s European Championship will inevitably join other showpieces in swelling to 24 teams some day although 2033 is a more likely target.View image in fullscreenAitana Bonmatí’s semi-final flourish was another defining moment during the tournament.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APBreaking even and demonstrating that progress can also be measured in sound business terms is – as the Uefa director of women’s football Nadine Kessler,recently told the Guardian– a more concrete priority. There would be clear risks in overreaching when the present model has suggested a path to viability.For the audience who will define its future, though, pictures matter more than pound signs. The images that will linger include Ann‑Katrin Berger’s extraordinary save against France, Aitana Bonmatí’s semi‑final flourish and the pandemonium that unfolded when Chloe Kelly battered the final penalty past Cata Coll. Euro 2025 built firmly on existing foundations and, for all the challenges that await, set out Marchetti’s vision for a far more durable beast.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025UefaFootball politicsWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

She has also won five Giro stages between from 2021-2025.Tour de France Femmes 2025: Lorena Wiebes holds off Vos in stage four sprint – as it happenedRead more“I have tried to have more of a free mindset, like I had in the Giro,” Wiebes, of Team SD Worx-Protime, said. “This season has already been really good, even if I hadn’t won in theTour de France. It doesn’t feel like we have a lot of pressure from the team.”While Wiebes celebrated another sprint success, the pre-race favourite Demi Vollering was just happy to get through the day after aheavy crash close to the finish of stage threealmost ended her race.Vollering,winner of the 2023Tour de France Femmes, finished the stage in the main group, a feat which had looked unlikely before the start in Saumur, when she winced her way through a pre-race warm-up and was visibly in pain.“It was a big relief to feel good and that I was able to ride and to keep my head up,” she said.“That’s the biggest relief. From now on we will see, day by day. I was a bit anxious for the final because it was kind of similar to yesterday, so you feel tension. A crash like that takes its toll on you. Again, no time loss, and now I think the shock is over.”Vollering admitted she had ridden at the front of the peloton “mostly to stay safe … It’s better to spend energy in the front of the peloton than be behind. My team did a very good job with keeping me in front of the bunch. When I was a bit anxious they were always next to me”.The Dutch professional is the most high-value rider in the women’s peloton and her €1m transfer to the French team FDJ-Suez was built around her winning this year’s Tour.However, some rival teams were dismissive of comments by the FDJ-Suez team manager, Stephen Delcourt, about a lack of respect shown towards Vollering by others in the peloton, in the aftermath of her crash.View image in fullscreenDemi Vollering credited her FDJ-Suez team with helping her through the stage.Photograph: Szymon Gruchalski/Getty Images“What he’s saying is ridiculous,” Jos van Emden, the team director at Visma-Lease a bike, told Dutch media. “Apparently he wants a peloton of eight riders, with Demi in it, to ride in a gilded cage. He’s simply been influenced by Demi, by Demi’s posturing.”This was Vollering’s second high‑speed crash in the Tour, following her verysimilar fall in the race last year, six kilometres from the finish of stage four to Amnéville, while wearing the yellow jersey.“When I was on the ground I had some throwback of last year,” she said, “but luckily this time it was in the five-kilometre rule [meaning she did not lose any time].”However, she still blames her rivals for not honouring the tradition of waiting for the race leader when they are down, and her former teammates at SD Worx for racing ahead and abandoning her to her fate.This time, though, with Vollering’s committed FDJ-Suez team around her, things were different. But it will still be a tall order for her to be fully recovered from what she described as a “hard impact” for Wednesday’s longest stage of the race, from Chasseneuil-du-Poitou Futuroscope to Guéret, which includes three categorised climbs in the final 35km.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The goalkeeper has signed a five-year deal, with the option of a sixth, at the Etihad Stadium where he will battle with Ederson and Stefan Ortega to be first choice.It was anticipated that Trafford would move to Newcastle, who have been tracking him over the past 12 months. City, however, used their matching rights clause, inserted when the goalkeeper left the club in 2023, to secure his services. The fee has been confirmed as a club-record sale by the Clarets.Chelsea close to £35m deal for Ajax’s Jorrel Hato and want RB Leipzig’s Xavi SimonsRead more“Rejoining City is such a special and proud moment both for me and my family,” Trafford said. “I always dreamed that one day I would be able to come back to Manchester City. This is the place I call home – it’s a truly special football club with fantastic people who make it such a unique place to work and play.“I am also very excited and honoured to have been given the opportunity to work under Pep [Guardiola] and with such a world-class group of players. I am still very young and hungry to keep learning and improving – and I know there is no better environment than Manchester City to help make me become the best goalkeeper I can be.”The 22-year-old Cumbrian joined City aged 12 from Carlisle and went on to have eight years in ­Manchester before joiningBurnleyin 2023 for £14m. Prior to moving to Turf Moor, Trafford impressed during loan spells at Accrington and Bolton but never made a first-team appearance for City, although he did work with the first-team goalkeepers.“When he [Ederson] first joined, he was extremely talented,” Trafford said. “He is one of a kind with the ball at his feet. He was someone that I looked up to a lot when I first trained with him when I was 17. I tried to take small bits of his game and try to put them into my game and improve.”Vincent Kompany made Trafford his first choice at Burnley, giving him a first taste of Premier League football. But in a struggling side he was dropped eventually in favour of ­Arijanet Muric as Burnley went down. Trafford recovered his form and confidence last season, helping the Clarets to reach the top flight, conceding 16 goals in 45 appearances, with 29 clean sheets.Trafford was an integral member of the England Under-21 squad that won the European Championship in 2023,saving a penalty in the final, and has been named in numerous senior squads but is yet to make his full international debut.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having just won the FA Cup for the first time in 1896, the club then forgot to apply for the following season’s competition, missing the deadline entirely, which meant that most of their cup-winning side were rather cheesed off, threatened to leave and start their own professional club, Sheffield Rovers, where players would be paid for their performances. The next few months for Wednesday were something of a shambles and in scenes that will be familiar to anyone that has played Sunday League, the club struggled to find enough players to put out a proper side, culminating in a 16-0 defeat to Bolton-based Halliwell FC in January 1887, a match in which Wednesday could only field 10 players. A few months later, an emergency meeting was held between players and president John Holmes, after which the club turned professional. The players were paid and The Wednesday were saved.It won’t be the tiniest crumb of comfort to Sheffield Wednesday fans that the hat-trick of suffering existential crises due to poor admin, not paying players and staff properly and failing to have enough players for a full team is well ingrained into the club’s history. In case you hadn’t seen, the Owls are again in trouble. After a chaotic summer dominated by financial issues (failing to pay all the squad’s wagesfor the third time in four months in June) manager Danny Röhl has now left the club by mutual consent, 12 days before the start of the Championship season, with first-team coaches Sascha Lense, Chris Powell, Neil Thompson and Sal Bibbo all following through the door marked Doing One. They aren’t the only departures. While Djeidi Gassama was sold for actual money to Rangers, Josh Windass, Michael Smith and Callum Paterson have all departed for free, with the club unable to bring in any new senior arrivals owing to theirtransfer ban until January 2027, enforced after the repeated failure to pay players’ wages. Wednesday could face further disciplinary action from the EFL, a possible player walkout, longer transfer embargo, plus a fine and a points deduction if the situation continues.Despite his exit, Röhl had been generally beloved by Wednesday supporters, having rescued the club from relegation to League One in his first campaign and leading Wednesday on an unlikely playoff push last season. “This summer has been difficult and, in the end, the club and I came to the mutual decision to part ways,” posted Röhl on various Social Media Disgraces. “Even during the difficult moments and setbacks, I have always continued to feel the support from everyone. We achieved a miracle together and that will always be something truly exceptional. I wish everyone associated with Wednesday my very best. I will never forget you.”Wednesday currently have just 16 first-team players listed on their website, although to what extent those players are actually contracted to the club, including captain Barry Bannan, remains unclear. Wednesday’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri, is willing to sell and has received offers from at least two US consortiums, but neither has met his valuation. The Thai businessman’s tenurehas been littered with problems: from the late payment of tax bills to points deductions, to a broken boiler unable to provide hot showers for the players at Hillsborough and even a threat to ban anyone who attended the stadium in a fake shirt. It’s fair to say Chansiri is not flavour of the month. With pay day for July due this week, it remains to be seen if any of the remaining players and staff will stick around for the opener against Leicester City, recently relegated from the Premier League of course – a match which now feels as daunting as Wednesday’s 10-man trip to Halliwell in 1887. Just like they did nearly 140 years ago, here hoping one of England’s grand old clubs can somehow navigate this latest mess and spread their wings again.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Sarina’s got rhythm. She absolutely loves Burna Boy. I can’t believe it. Her facewhen they brought him outwas a picture. She was busting out some moves and singing away so that was a special moment” – England defender Esme Morgan on Sarina Wiegman’s unlikely duet, one of many magic moments from the Lionesses’ Euro 2025 homecoming party in central London.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman x Burna Boy.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSI was intrigued by Lucy Bronze’s quote inyesterday’s Football Daily– ‘I’ve been through a lot of pain, but that’s what it takes to play for England.’ Does this mean that all us fans who have watched the England men’s team play in a tournament are therefore eligible to be capped?” – John Kyle.I was interested to hear that Morgan Gibbs-White’s contract extension ‘underlines the ambition of Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis, whose vision for European success and sustained Premier League progress continues to shape the club’s future’ (yesterday’s Football Daily,full email edition).

Despite this, two wins over Tunisia and Botswana and a draw against Algeria saw Nigeria top their group without conceding a single goal.Madugu acknowledged that his team “was a work in progress”, but remained confident that his team was on course to achieve what Nigerians call “Mission X” – to win their 10th Wafcon title. Saturday was a testimony to his unbending faith in his team and his coaching methods.View image in fullscreenNigeria’s players celebrate with the trophy on the podium in Rabat.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty Images“I have always believed that we take each game as it comes and play according to the opponent,” the 61-year-old said. “Where we make errors, we will make the needed corrections to get the result we want.”Nigeria are way out in front when it comes to Wafcon titles – Equatorial Guinea (twice) and SouthAfricaare the only other sides to win it. Back in 2016, the women’s team had won seven Afcon crowns, level with Egypt’s men’s team. A 1-0 win over Cameroon’s Indomitable Lionesses, in front of a hostile crowd at Yaoundé’s Stade Omnisport, saw them edge ahead in the pantheon of African champions.“That final against Cameroon, on their soil, was a very exciting moment for me, scoring that winning goal that led to the trophy,” says the former Nigeria captain, Desire Oparanozie, who worked as a TV co-commentator and match analyst at this year’s tournament in Morocco. “When you have to play against the home crowd [in a final] and you come out on top, at the end of it, it is always special. You are playing against the fans as well.“There is no better way to describe how formidable the Super Falcons are. They have proven their worth over the years and they continue to shine,” Oparanozie adds. “One thing that continues to motivate them is that they are hungry for success. They want to win, they have a strong mentality, and they want to keep on dominating African football. It’s the driver for the performance put up each time they are in the final.”View image in fullscreenFolashade Florence Ijamilusi celebrates after scoring for Nigeria in the final.Photograph: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty ImagesMaintaining Nigeria’s perfect 10-out-of-10 record in Wafcon finals was an arduous task for Madugu as he was up against the former Spain coach, Jorge Vilda, who is now in charge of the Atlas Lionesses.When Morocco went 2-0 up inside 24 minutes through goals from their captain, Ghizlane Chebbak, and Sanaa Mssoudy, Madugu was wearing his emotions on his sleeve, screaming at Nigeria’s players to hold on to the ball and create transitions that would put the hosts under pressure.It took the second-half introduction of PSG’s Jennifer Echegini and Roma’s Rinsola Babajide to give the Falcons the attacking verve to win the game. “We knew we could do it [win the match],” Madugu told us. “When we were two goals down, we kept encouraging the players not to lose their belief. If they didn’t have mental resilience they would have given up. We did a lot of talking at half-time.”Esther Okoronkwo, arguably the outstanding player for Nigeria at the tournament, and voted the player of the final, said the Falcons had to dig deep into their courage reservoir, to pull themselves back from the brink. “The first half goals were unfortunate,” she said. “It happens in football. When we went to the dressing room, we gathered the fighting spirit, because it was all or nothing … the Moroccan team has chemistry, they were a tough team.”View image in fullscreenRasheedat Ajibade brings the trophy home.Photograph: Olamikan Gbemiga/APSaturday’s dramatic final was a fitting end to a successful tournament on the field but as Desiree Ellis, coach of South Africa’s Banyana-Banyana for 11 years, points out, there is still room for improvement when it comes to the organisation.“I think there needs to be better spacing of games, so that teams can travel and players can recover in good time,” she said. “The travel was a bit hard at this tournament and it is something that CAF needs to look at.”The good news is that the chance to make improvements will come quickly – the next Wafcon finals are being played next year, again in Morocco.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.

Yet Labour’s record over the past year has been curiously mixedByDaniel TrillingTue 29 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTShareThe international human rights system – the rules, principles and practices intended to ensure that states do not abuse people – is under greater threat now than at any other point since 1945. Fortunately, we in the UK couldn’t wish for a better-qualified prime minister to face this challenge. Keir Starmer is a distinguished former human rights lawyer and prosecutor, with a 30-year career behind him, who expresses a deep personal commitment to defending ordinary people against injustice. He knows human rights law inside out – in fact, he literallywrote the bookon its European incarnation – and has acted as a lawyer at more or less every level of the system. (Starmer is the only British prime minister, and probably the only world leader, to haveargued a caseunder the genocide convention – against Serbia on behalf of Croatia in 2014 – at the international court of justice.) He is also an experienced administrator, through his time as director of public prosecutions (DPP), which means he knows how to operate the machinery of state better than most politicians do.Unfortunately, there’s someone standing in Starmer’s way: a powerful man who critics say is helping to weaken the international human rights system. He fawns over authoritarian demagogues abroad and is seeking to diminish the protections the UK offers to some vulnerable minorities. He conflates peaceful, if disruptive, protest with deadly terrorism and calls for musicians whose views and language he dislikes to be dropped from festival bills. At times, he uses his public platform to criticise courts, whose independence is vital to maintaining the human rights system. At others, he uses legal sophistry to avoid openly stating and defending his own political position, including on matters of life and death. He is, even some of his admirers admit, a ruthless careerist prepared to jettison his stated principles when politically expedient. That person is also calledKeir Starmer.Since the 2024 general election, much ink has been spilled on whatLabouris getting wrong in government. But I’ve been puzzled by a slightly different question: why is Labour’s record to date on human rights – the one thing you might expect a Starmer-led government to be rock solid on – so mixed? Over the past six months, I have spoken to more than two dozen sources, including current and former Labour insiders, former legal colleagues of Starmer’s and leading human rights advocates, to try to understand how Starmer the lawyer might be shaping Starmer the prime minister.Some human rights experts are delighted that, after the scorched-earth years of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, there has been a shift in tone and content. “It is a major achievement,” says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics and long-term acquaintance of Starmer, “to have stabilised Britain’s commitment to law at a time when the current is flowing the other way internationally.” For the author, barrister and academic Philippe Sands, a prominent critic of the 2003 Iraq war, the UK is belatedly restoring a reputation it shredded two decades ago. “When I’ve gone to meetings in the UN, when I’ve gone to meetings in the Council of Europe, I’ve seen that Britain is once more taken seriously in relation to building a more positive agenda on human rights.” Sands is particularly encouraged by Labour’s commitment tosetting up a special tribunalfor Russian war crimes in Ukraine, despite the US’s wavering support. Such achievements, Sands and Gearty believe, are in no small part down to Starmer himself. “He does well in a crisis,” says a senior barrister who worked on several cases with Starmer in the 2000s. “That’s what litigators do: they enter the fray at the moment of complete crisis and shitshow.”Others, to put it mildly, aren’t so keen. Before the election, Starmertold a meetingof Iranian women activists that a Labour government would put human rights at the heart of everything it did. “That’s the biggest load of crap I’ve ever heard,” says a campaigner at a UK charity who regularly meets with ministers and officials. The campaigner reeled off a list of complaints, from policies on migration, policing and protest, to disability benefit cuts and a failure to push harder for an end to Israel’s war in Gaza. Some former colleagues are shocked that Starmer presides over all this. “Given he made his career off a woman who constantly scaled the fences of US bases,” says the criminal defence solicitor Matt Foot, referring to Lindis Percy,a veteran peace activistStarmer represented several times in the 1990s and 00s, “what he’s doing on protest is particularly sickening.”Staff at several human rights NGOs described encountering a brittle, defensive attitude from ministers in private meetings. “They think the human rights community should put up and shut up,” said one. “There’s a tone as if our agenda is against the interests of UK citizens,” said another, who focuses on international issues. “The line that comes back is that this is irrelevant to ordinary people’s concerns.” All said that this attitude emanated most strongly from officials working for the prime minister, an interpretation echoed by two people familiar with cabinet-level conversations. Several human rights advocates described being made to feel they should just be grateful it was Labour and not the Tories in charge.View image in fullscreenLindis Percy in 2002. Starmer defended the peace activist after her repeated incursions into US military bases.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHow to explain, then, what Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, described to me as this “split personality approach”? Some government insiders complain about a lack of overall strategy and an insular, macho “boys’ club” surrounding Starmer – frequent criticisms of Labour in recent months – while the human rights advocates I spoke to say some officials are inexperienced. Much of the answer, however, surely resides with Starmer himself, and his own ambiguous politics.There are three Starmer biographies to date, each with a very different perspective. One is a critique from the left, one from the right and one, with his input, very positive. Yet all three books tell roughly the same story. Starmer started off on the radical left, as a talented young barrister, but tacked towards the centre as his career progressed and his political ambitions grew, becoming DPP – helping run what a former colleague described to me as “the really nasty parts of the state” – before entering politics.As an MP, he ran for Labour leader on a leftwing platform and then moved sharply rightwards; depending on your political preference, either a smart strategic move, or what Simon Fletcher, who was a senior adviser to Starmer in his first year as leader of the opposition, told me he now views as a “massive, massive con”. He eschews ideology – “there’s no such thing as Starmerism and there never will be. I will make decisions one after the other,” Starmerreportedly told colleagueswhile leader of the opposition – and his detail-focused lawyer’s mind leads him to make effective, short-term tactical choices, but also blinds him to the wider consequences of his actions.“He can be very tunnel-visioned,” concedes the senior barrister who praised his skills in a crisis, adding that on occasion it leads Starmer the politician to make statements that any lawyer would find “frankly, weird”. (Starmer’s assertionduring an interviewin October 2023 that Israel “has the right” to cut off water and electricity to Gaza – acts that are clearly war crimes – and his subsequent backtracking is the notorious example.) This pattern has continued into government. “He keeps blindsiding people,” says the head of one UK charity, pointing to the sudden decision in February to cut international aid. (“That really was a case of, ‘Oh shit, we need to find £2bn for defence,’” one government official told me.)This isn’t just about Starmer, though.Human rightsrepresent an idea with revolutionary implications: that we all have the right to freedom and dignity, wherever we live, and that it is everyone’s business to make sure of it. This goal is yet to be fully realised and the project to achieve it is riven with contradictions – the same contradictions, in fact, that we find in the two faces of Starmer. “Is he the man to save the system?” asks another former colleague. “That depends on what you think the system is.”In 2020, Starmer told Desert Island Discs what had attracted him to human rights as a law student in the 1980s. “I became absolutely fascinated with the idea that at the end of the second world war, and the atrocities of the second world war, the countries around the world came together and made commitments to each other to honour human rights,” he said. “It’s not so much the individual rights, but it’s the human dignity that sits behind [them].”Now, is that a radical sentiment, or a conservative one? In a way, it’s both. A tension within the human rights project is that it cuts across traditional political distinctions of left and right. The founding principles, outlined in the1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, stress both individual freedomandsocioeconomic equality. What’s more, human rights have an ambiguous relationship to the state. On the one hand, the claim that rights exist due to our common humanity, no matter who’s in charge, implies a challenge to established power. On the other, it reinforces existing power structures – since the human rights system only works if national governments agree to respect the rules. And to make those rules work in practice, you need laws, courts and an elite group of technicians who know how to work the levers: in other words, lawyers.Traditionally, the British left was sceptical of the postwar human rights project, seeing it as a distraction from class struggle – and a tool the right could use to prevent any socialist government from redistributing wealth, on the grounds of individual liberty. When Starmer was starting out as a lawyer, co-founding the progressive Doughty Street barristers’ chambers in 1990, he expressed a similar scepticism. In a 1991 article for the radical Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers – of which he was a prominent member – Starmer warned that relying on legal institutions to bring about social change was “putting the cart before the horse”.The collapse of communism abroad and Thatcher’s victory over organised labour at home prompted a change in attitudes. After the 1992 election, the Labour party committed to introducing a bill that would incorporate human rights protections into UK law. Writing in 1995, Starmer welcomed the prospect. “Our task, as socialist lawyers,” he argued, was to begin drafting a document that would bring about “an equal … distribution not only of political power, but also of economic power.” The following year, Starmer co-authored an audit of the UK’s compliance with international human rights standards, an influential book in Labour circles as Blair’s team drew up their plans for government.By the time of the 1997 election, Starmer was a rising legal star. His rightwing biographer Michael Ashcroft places him at the centre of the elite professional milieu that rose along with New Labour. Many progressive lawyers welcomed the arrival of the Human Rights Act, passed in 1998, amid the modernising first flush of Blairism. Phillippa Kaufmann, a leading human rights barrister and an ex-partner of Starmer’s, told Starmer’s favoured biographer, Tom Baldwin, that it felt as if they were “driving forward the vehicle of change”. Starmer, who in 2002 was made queen’s counsel, or QC – the highest rank of barrister, now KC – added the act to his already formidable arsenal of expertise. In 2003, he represented a group of asylum-seekers whosuccessfully challengedthe government’s attempt to deny them housing and benefit payments; a few years later, hehelped overturn control orders(restrictions on the movement and liberty of terrorism suspects, introduced by Blair) that had been placed on two men. Both sets of cases were won on human rights grounds.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer in 2002, the year he became a QC.Photograph: UppaIt’s not possible to read a barrister’s list of cases as an index of their political opinions, since barristers – whose job is to argue in court on behalf of their clients – operate by the “cab rank” rule, where they must offer their services on a first come, first served basis. But by the areas of law in which they choose to specialise, it is possible to see where their interests lie. Starmer’s interest clearly lay in protecting individuals from being harmed by the state and other powerful institutions. (One of his longest-running cases, for which he provided free legal advice, was that ofthe McLibel duo, environmentalist campaigners sued by McDonald’s.) What that meant politically changed over time, however.In the early 00s, Starmer chose to advise the Northern Ireland Policing Board on how to make the Police Service of Northern Ireland, established after the Good Friday agreement, compliant with human rights standards. That work seemed to represent a shift in his view of the state. Rather than seeing it as an adversary that serves mainly to protect wealth and privilege, as a radical leftist might put it, according to Baldwin he was coming to believe that a human rights lawyer could work most effectively on the inside. By making the state’s coercive functions compliant with human rights standards, they could be exercised more efficiently, and thus fairly.As DPP from 2008 to 2013, Starmer brought a fundamentally bureaucratic approach to the role, say his biographers. One of his proudest achievements, he has said, was overseeing his agency’s transition from paper to digital record-keeping. Even Starmer’s critics acknowledge that making top-down tweaks to the rules had some benefits. The criminal defence solicitor Matt Foot, for instance, told me that Starmer’s guidance to prosecutors advising a light touch on assisted dying cases averted a lot of unnecessary suffering. “I had several clients at police stations who weren’t charged as a result,” he said.At other times, notably during the 2011 riots, Starmer was comfortable using the full force of the state – a fact that his leftwing biographer, Oliver Eagleton, takes him to task for. Whether Starmer was right or wrong to do so is another matter. But it’s consistent with a particular interpretation of what human rights are there for. “I don’t think there’s a hidden emancipatory human rights fanatic inside Keir Starmer,” Gearty told me. Starmer decided to work within the state “because he understood the importance of the rules”.Asecond tension within the human rights system is that it requires the cooperation of national governments, yet asks them to sign up to agreements that restrain their power. In the UK, that tension expresses itself most strongly in the political battle over the European convention on human rights and, by extension, theHuman Rights Act, which incorporates the ECHR into UK law. Together, they are intended to restrain the government and other public bodies from arbitrarily mistreating us.A vocal section of the British right has long sought to weaken or remove these protections. But in the last few years it has become a totemic issue akin to Britain’s membership of the EU before Brexit: withdrawing from the ECHR would, they say, take back control from a set of rules – and the liberal elite that upholds them – that are undermining national sovereignty. In particular, the right’s opprobrium is directed at article 8, the right to a private and family life, which it claims forces the British state to let unwanted migrants live in the UK.Given Starmer’s background, you would expect his government to be solidly opposed to this assault on human rights – and in a way, it has been. Among the first things Starmer did as prime minister was to state publicly that his government would never withdraw from the ECHR, one of several gestures intended to signal the incoming government’s commitment to international treaties and the rule of law.Human rights NGOs agree that the shift in approach has changed things, up to a point. “There’s a marked difference in the way I engage with this government compared with the last one,” says Yasmine Ahmed of Human Rights Watch, who regularly meets with ministers and officials to discuss international and domestic policy. “They’re willing to sit down and have thoughtful conversations about human rights issues.” The trouble, says Ahmed, is that this generally only extends to subjects the government sees as politically safe, such as the humanitarian crisis prompted by the war in Sudan. When her organisation raises more politically risky topics, such as migration or the Gaza war, then the government’s response, especially at higher levels, is much more limited.In March, under pressure from the right, Starmer’s government announced a review of how article 8 is used in immigration cases. Several human rights experts told me they believed this lent weight to a damaging myth that would, in the words of one campaigner at a human rights NGO, “pour fuel on the fire”. Jamie Burton, a senior barrister and a former colleague of Starmer’s at Doughty Street, told me that ceding ground on article 8 – which also protects British citizens, for example, from unwanted media intrusion – would be a “lose-lose scenario”. Ina recent article, Burton argued that the use of article 8 has already been so heavily restricted in immigration cases that any further tweaks would be useless and only encourage demands for the UK to drop it entirely. Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative attorney general, told me that in his view, attention would be better focused on delays in the courts system rather than article 8 itself. The delays, he said, were “not helpful to maintaining public confidence in the ECHR”.Grieve, who as attorney general oversaw Starmer as DPP, told me he was confident in the prime minister’s commitment to human rights. For many lawyers, however – regardless of their personal views on policy – it is Starmer’s own rhetoric that has been most upsetting. Notably, at a session of prime minister’s questions in February 2025, Starmer said that a court had made the“wrong decision” to allowa family of six trying to flee Gaza to join their brother in the UK, based on a “legal loophole”. Whether the decision was based on any kind of loophole is questionable: a judge found that while they had applied under the Ukraine resettlement scheme, for which they were ineligible, they nonetheless had the right to reunite with their brother under article 8. But many lawyers were appalled that Starmer, of all people, would criticise the decision of an independent court. “For him to criticise a judge as prime minister with his background was extraordinary,” another KC who worked with Starmer in the 00s told me. (At the time, in response to the criticism – including from Lady Carr, the most senior judge in England and Wales – a spokesperson for Starmer said he had full respect for the independence of the judiciary.)Starmer’s rhetoric can be explained as the government’s response to the rise of Reform UK. “They’re expecting a further Tory wipeout, so the next election will be Starmer v Farage,” one person familiar with cabinet-level discussions told me. “That’s the explicit strategy. But what’s not explicit is what that means for the postwar settlement and human rights, all these knock-on effects.” The source continued: “If you’re more on the left of that debate, if you’reDavid Lammyor Angela Rayner or Lisa Nandy, you don’t want to stick your hand up in cabinet and say, have we thought about where this is heading – because you’ll get a combination of Morgan McSweeney, John Healey and Pat McFadden [respectively, Starmer’s chief of staff and two cabinet ministers] saying, ‘What the fuck are you talking about?’” Both the source and another person familiar with cabinet-level discussions said that ministers whose views differ also fear being anonymously briefed against in the media.View image in fullscreenReform party leader Nigel Farage speaking during a press conference in Westminster.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThe real problem, both added, is that you never know where Starmer himself sits. As if to illustrate the point, in May the current attorney general,Richard Hermer– appointed by Starmer last July – gave a major speech on the government’s commitment to the rule of law. For the most part, it was a strongly worded critique of the “pseudo-realists” in Westminster who argue that the old global order is dead and that Britain should withdraw from the ECHR and other treaties it finds inconvenient. It was a notable intervention, since Hermer, another former human rights barrister, has become a lightning rod for the right’s critique of the Starmer government.In an echo of the attacks once deployed against Starmer when he was leader of the opposition, Hermer’s critics have been dredging up his old cases to cast aspersions on his politics. (The most lurid stunt so far involves a video in which the Conservative shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, parades in front of easels showing pictures of Hermer’s former clients, including Shamima Begum and Gerry Adams.) Hermer has been briefed against from within Labour, too, by officials who believe his professional background and insistence that ministers follow legal advice closely are damaging the party’s image. But Starmer has, for now, kept his attorney general in post. “Starmer has put Hermer there to keep himself honest,” suggested one Labour strategist I spoke to.In that context, it was tempting to see Hermer’s speech as a sign of Starmer’s own worldview. Within hours, however, Hermer found himself at the centre of yet more criticism, for suggesting the “pseudo-realists” were borrowing their ideas from the 20th-century German jurist Carl Schmitt. In scholarly circles, Schmitt’s conservative ideas are widely discussed – but he’s better known for being the Nazis’ favourite legal theorist. A day later, Downing Street ordered Hermer to apologise.For some people I spoke to, this showed one of Starmer’s wider weaknesses: he is committed to following the letter of the law, but unwilling to take the risk of arguing for the underlying principles. “Over the last 10 to 15 years, human rights have almost become dirty words,” said Karla McLaren, political relations manager for Amnesty International’s UK branch. “We were hoping the new government would come in and try to change that. But that’s not what we’ve seen. If you look at what cabinet ministers say, even when they’re talking about human rights issues, they very rarely use human rights language.”One person familiar with cabinet-level conversations made a similar point, in reference to the ECHR. “We’ve allowed the right to define the issue. It does seem baffling to me that we keep attacking a bunch of laws that are very much in our interest, and probably more in our interest than for some other countries.”Athird tension in the human rights system is that it requires powerful states to enforce it, yet is undermined by an unequal global distribution of power. If states can pick and choose who is held accountable for human rights abuses, then it makes a mockery of the claim these rights are universal – and gives other states less of an incentive to participate. Nowhere has this become more apparent than in the west’s response to the war in Gaza, an issue that, as one official put it to me, “people have lots of very strong views about”.To date, in its response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel has killedat least 59,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch – NGOs whose reports are regularly cited by lawyers in Starmer’s former specialism – are among those who say Israel is committing genocide. (Both also say that Hamas committed war crimes on 7 October, including hostage-taking and the murder of civilians.) Yet Israel has been able to pursue its military action relatively unhindered thanks to support from its allies: the UK, certainly, but most of all the US, its principal military, financial and political backer.As the dominant global power since 1945, the US played a significant role in shaping the human rights system (Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady, was a driving force behind the Universal Declaration) but its commitment to that system has been patchy. “You didn’t have to be super radical to think that the international legal order was designed for the west,” Gearty told me, but in years gone by “you could slightly pretend it wasn’t”. The west’s support of Israel’s war, he believes, has made the imbalance impossible to ignore.View image in fullscreenThe UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and Starmer, on their way to Washington in September 2024.Photograph: Stefan RousseauSince taking office, Labour has tried to tread a fine line on Israel, between being seen to abide by international law, and continuing to support an ally it says has the right to defend itself from Hamas and hostile states such as Iran. At the same time, it has been keen not to upset the US, particularly since Trump took office. According to the two people familiar with cabinet-level discussions, there are disagreements in government about how best to approach this, analogous to the divisions over how to deal with Reform UK – a “dog-eat-dog” worldview, as one put it, versus a more humanitarian-minded one. Both positions are generally supportive of Israel, said the other source, but differ on people’s “relative strength of support for Netanyahu”.As ever, it’s not clear exactly where the prime minister sits. But as Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire report intheir recent bookon Labour’s return to power, Starmer has exerted tight control over Labour’s position on Israel since 7 October, in contrast to issues where he has been happy to delegate. His behaviour, they write, has been driven by several motivations: horror at the Hamas attacks; a desire, at least in the early days, to show that Labour had moved on from the Corbyn years by signalling strong support for Israel; and a belief that any significant departure from the US position would be futile.In opposition, this involved saying as little as possible except that Israel had a right to defend itself and that international law should be respected. In government, Labour has criticised aspects of Israel’s military campaign and has affirmed the UK’s support for the international criminal court’s jurisdiction. (It has said that the UK wouldfulfil its “legal obligations”if the Israeli prime minister, for whom the ICC has issued an arrest warrant, visits the UK – implying, but not directly confirming, that it would carry out an arrest.) On the occasions it has broken with US policy – for instance, when the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway recently placed individual sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers – it has tried to do so only in concert with other states.This is accompanied by a studied (some might say lawyerly) refusal to say in public whether or not the Israeli government as a whole is breaking international law. Doing so would have big implications, since Britain may then be obliged to follow its own human rights laws and impose wider-reaching sanctions, potentially suspending its substantial trade, military cooperation and intelligence-sharing agreements with Israel. Officials may have to reveal what they knew when; among other things, it is a criminal offence for public servants to knowingly assist in war crimes overseas.It has led to some erratic gestures. Most prominently, in March, Downing Street forced the foreign secretary, David Lammy, to walk back comments that by blocking aid from reaching Gaza – an act now causing mass starvation – Israel had definitely broken international law. (The official line was that Israel was only “at risk” of doing so.) In public, ministers have said, once again, that it is for the courts to determine whether Israel is committing genocide. But Starmer has also invoked his own legal credentials to deflect criticism. “I’m well aware of the definition of genocide,” he snapped in a testy exchange at prime minister’s questions last November, “and that is why I’ve never described this as […] genocide”. (The international court of justice, which is considering an accusation of genocide made against Israel by South Africa, isnot expected to deliver a rulinguntil 2027.)The most delicate footwork, however, relates to weapons sales. On taking office last year, Labour announced a review of UK arms exports to Israel. Britain is one of the world’s largest arms producers, with export orders worth about £10bn a year, and in theory a system exists to stop them being used for human rights abuses. Manufacturers can only export weapons if the government gives them a licence to do so – although, according to a recent whistleblower, the system istoo easy to manipulate.At the end of August 2024, according to documents recently disclosed to the high court, Starmer personally phoned Netanyahu to warn him that the UK would be suspending 30 of 350 arms export licences. Civil servants had assessed there was a risk Israel would use these weapons to violate international law, but there was an exception. Essential parts produced by British companies for F-35 planes – the world’s deadliest fighter jets, designed and made mostly in the US – would continue to be shared among the UK’s allies, including Israel, since they were necessary for “global peace and security”.This summer, a long-running legal challenge to that decision came to a head in the high court. Lawyers for the Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq argued it contravened the genocide convention, the Geneva conventions, the UN arms trade treaty and the UK’s own export licensing rules. In its defence, part of the evidence for which was presented in secret, the government argued that continuing to supply the parts – which contribute to a joint programme between the UK, the US and several other Nato members, as well as favoured partners such as Israel and Saudi Arabia – was necessary to maintain a deterrent against Russia. Moreover,said the government, it was impossible for the UK to determine where the parts are distributed, since the US arms company Lockheed Martin controls many of the warehouses in which they are stored. As with so many other things, it was ultimately the US calling the shots – or, as the government’s lawyers put it in more opaque language, “the US is primarily responsible for contracting with contractors”.On 30 June, the high court ruled in the government’s favour, saying that decisions about security were a matter for the executive, not the courts. For some people I spoke to, this is just the unpleasant reality of politics. “National security interests sometimes mean that you have to do things or tolerate things that you might not otherwise be very happy about,” Grieve told me. Others are less forgiving. Yasmine Ahmed of Human Rights Watch, which intervened in the case in support of Al-Haq, told me that the government’s position that it can opt out of the rules risks undermining the effectiveness of key human rights treaties.Even more alarming, Ahmed said, was the government’s reasoning over why it was not bound to act by the genocide convention, which says states have a duty to prevent genocide if there is a serious risk of it occurring. Government lawyers argued that a state could only be said to have breached that duty if it could be definitively proven that an act of genocide had taken place – “a very difficult exercise, which could take many years”, said the government – in other words, only after the event, when it would be too late to stop it. “That’s just a shocking position to take,” Ahmed told me. “It’s morally repugnant but also legally and factually wrong.”View image in fullscreenPolice arrest protesters for supporting Palestine Action – a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act – in Manchester, 12 July 2025.Photograph: Milo Chandler/AlamyEven supportive observers are critical of the decision to keep supplying F-35 parts, seeing it as emblematic of a wider lack of action to defend human rights in Gaza. “What happened on 7 October [2023] was a terrible crime, but there is no justification for what is going on today in Gaza, none whatsoever,” Philippe Sands told me. “The fact that it wasn’t stopped long ago and that the British government has not gone further makes me extremely unhappy. Even if Britain is a friend of Israel, the role of friends is to speak truth to power.”Sands’s fellow human rights expert Conor Gearty sympathises with the pressures Labour are under, but is critical nonetheless. “Starmer, Hermer, Lammy – they’re all lawyers. [Lammy is also a qualified barrister and practised law before entering politics.] They’re committed to law, but they can’t bear the full consequences of committing to law.” A former senior diplomat who worked in Washington DC during the past decade told me that while the pressure from Trump was real, blaming the US was also an excuse British politicians often used when they wanted to avoid owning their decisions. “It’s quite convenient, saying, ‘Oh don’t do that, the Americans won’t like it,’” said the former diplomat.This approach has also upset many civil servants representing the UK overseas. Earlier this year, more than 300 Foreign Office staff sent an open letter to Lammy raising fears they had become complicit in war crimes committed by Israel; in response, the department’s chief civil servant told them to consider resigning. “It’s quite humiliating for a lot of people,” says a former civil servant who recently worked at the Foreign Office. “People working on Russia and Ukraine are saying, how can we be demanding accountability for human rights abuses here when we’re ignoring them in Gaza? We look like hypocrites.”The former civil servant said that when Labour took power, they were “hopeful that Labour would realise the value of the rule of law and work to uphold it. This didn’t last. If anything, Lammy’s response to the letter was more ‘corporate computer says no’ than David Cameron [his Conservative predecessor as foreign secretary]. Cameron would at least read the letter and think about a response rather than ‘HR’ it.”We’ve been here before. New Labour took office in 1997 promising great things on human rights – incorporating the ECHR into law at home and promising an “ethical foreign policy” abroad. It did the legal, procedural part, introducing the Human Rights Act and lending British support to global initiatives such as the international criminal court. But it backed away from the wider project. As the Human Rights Act came into force, it was attacked by the rightwing press. Under pressure – as the human rights expert Francesca Klug writesin her 2015 bookon the subject – the Blair government abandoned a public awareness campaign extolling the benefits of the act. It also dropped plans to extend its reach to the economic sphere, which would have made issues such as a decent standard of living a matter of human rights, too, as the Universal Declaration originally envisioned. Meanwhile, Blair’s enthusiastic participation in the “war on terror” helped undermine the UN and led him to restrict civil liberties at home.Carne Ross, a senior diplomat under the Blair government who resigned in protest at the Iraq war, told me that the travails of the Starmer government remind him of this period. “There’s a sense that human rights is a luxury parties give themselves in opposition, but in government national security takes over,” said Ross. “It’s a false choice, though, because prioritising human rights is a greater contribution to long-term stability and ultimately security.”Human rights advocates have plenty of specific policy demands. But is there more the UK could do to defend the system as a whole? For Gearty, Labour’s contortions reflect “the weakness that is at the core of Britain’s standing in the world, which voters can never be told about, because British voters continue to believe that this country is a world power”. The trouble, according to Gearty, is that these contortions only make the problem worse. “Britain has little credibility for three reasons,” he said. “One, it is seen as the child of America, with no independent engagement. Two, Britain is an imperial nation that has not yet addressed what imperialism meant; it still largely believes that it granted independence to grateful global south entities. And three, having left Europe, it has no strategic vision of anything.”Sands is slightly more optimistic. “We live in a world of double standards. So what’s new? My entire life with international law, we’ve lived with these kinds of situations,” he says. Sands believes the threat to the postwar human rights system is real, because the world’s three greatest powers – the US, Russia and China – are now all actively hostile to the project. “But in that context,” he says, “the Starmer government is going against the grain. I think it’s courageous.” In particular, Sands adds, countries in the global south that do not want to be bullied by their larger neighbours are still strongly invested in the human rights system – and the UK has the power to support their struggle.For the barrister Jamie Burton, the dual meaning of equality – economic as well as political – is key. “It’s a real mistake to think about human rights as just being about technical rules, the courts and litigation,” he says. “They’re a description of what society is supposed to look like.” For Burton, a renewed focus on economic equality would help take the sting out of the right’s claims that human rights are for “other” people only and disadvantage ordinary British citizens. At one point, at least, Starmer was known to be sympathetic to this argument. In opposition, according to Pogrund and Maguire, he would frequently brandish a copy of the Marmot review, a landmark decade-long study on health and inequality in Britain, as an example of where Labour’s attention should lie. Now? It’s less clear.Are we witnessing the death of international law?Read moreWhen writing this piece, one story I heard kept coming back to mind. Earlier this year, a delegation of British Palestinians met with Starmer to ask for more aid to reach Gaza and for refugees to be allowed to join their relatives in the UK. As one of the Palestinians there described it to me, Starmer listened patiently and sensitively to their concerns, but did not propose anything new. Towards the end of the meeting, a teenage member of the group spoke up. “She said, ‘My ambition in life is to be a human rights lawyer like you. And I was very disappointed to hear what you just said. We were expecting more.’”The Palestinian campaigner continued: “I thought, that’s very brave of her,” he told me, adding that he was worried, at first, that she had offended their host. But he was surprised by the prime minister’s reaction – or lack of it. “He looked a bit shocked, but he didn’t say anything.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readKeir StarmerHuman Rights ActLabourHuman rightsPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Vietnam, Cambodia and several other south-east Asian countries are also lobbying for extensions to talks to head off a rise in US tariffs.Negotiations between White House representatives and trading partners threatened with high tariffs have often proved to be drawn out. The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, spent more than 100 hours negotiating before the US agreed to reduce a planned 30% tariffto 15% on EU exports to the USin a deal announced on Sunday.Pascal Lamy, a former director general of the World Trade Organization, said many of the trade agreements announced by the White House were light on detail and needed further negotiation, leading to further uncertainty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But despite widespread speculation, the Sphere will not be hosting the event due to a scheduling conflict.Sourcestold ESPNthat Las Vegas was chosen over candidate cities in Canada and Mexico, though Fifa has not yet confirmed either the date or location. The draw will assign the 48 participating nations into 12 groups of four, reflecting the first time the men’s tournament will feature an expanded 48-team field and span three host countries: the United States, Canada and Mexico.Las Vegas previously hosted the World Cup draw in 1994, the last time the tournament was held in the United States. That year’s ceremony was staged at theLas VegasConvention Center, a venue that is unavailable this time around. Allegiant Stadium, home to the NFL’s Raiders, was also passed over as a World Cup match site during the host city selection process.The 11 US cities selected for 2026 are divided into three geographic regions. New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami and Atlanta comprise the East; Kansas City, Dallas and Houston make up the Central region; and Los Angeles, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area represent the West. Mexico’s venues include Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City, while Toronto and Vancouver will host matches in Canada.Mexico, Canada and the United States have already been placed in Groups A, B and D respectively. The tournament will conclude on 19 July 2026, with the final set to be played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.While early reports pointed to the Sphere – a state-of-the-art, 17,500-seat venue boasting a 54,000-square-meter wraparound LED screen – as the frontrunner to host the draw, sources close to the venue confirmed to the Guardian it is unavailable due to a previously scheduled concert. That, along with the Convention Center being booked, leaves the final venue for the draw still unannounced.Pedro Cedillo, a Pachuca executive involved in World Cup preparations, told ESPN: “I understand it will be in Las Vegas, and that’s where we need to be present.”Fifa has yet to comment on the venue or timing of the event.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Las VegasWorld CupUS sportsShareReuse this content"

In the video, the word “genes” gets crossed out and is replaced with the word “jeans”.Another videofrom the campaign features Sweeney saying: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color. My jeans are blue.”The campaign has drawn mixed reactions online.Some social media users have dubbed the campaign as “tone deaf” andaccused itof echoing rhetoric associated witheugenicsandwhite supremacy.On X, oneuser wrotethat “getting a blue eyed, blonde, white women and focusing your campaign around her having perfect genetics feels weird, especially considering the current state of America,” where one of the dominant political stories has been the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion – or DEI – initiatives.One user on TikTokarguedthat “the words we use are never unintentional” and that “for American Eagle to say Sydney Sweeney has good genes is not an accident”.“This is a dog whistle to the rise of conservatism in this country,” they said.Meanwhile, others, including some on the US political right have praised the actor and the campaign for delivering ablow to “wokeness” and “woke” advertising.“Woke advertising is dead, Sydney Sweeney killed it,”one X user wrote, invoking a term that some conservatives use to criticize DEI measures.And some observers have described the backlash to the campaign as overblown and anexaggeration.One TikTokusersaid: “I personally don’t see why it’s causing all this controversy – to me, it’s just an ad for jeans.”As of Tuesday morning, neither Sweeney nor American Eagle had publicly addressed the criticism and backlash.Neither American Eagle nor a representative for Sweeney immediately responded to a request for comment from the Guardian.As part of the campaign, American Eagle isreleasing“The Sydney Jean” made in collaboration with Sweeney, which features a butterfly motif on the back pocket.In theannouncementfrom the company, the brand said that the motif “represents domestic violence awareness, which Sydney is passionate about”. The brand also said that “100% of the purchase price from The Sydney Jean will be donated to Crisis Text Line,a nonprofit offering free, 24/7, confidential mental health support to anyone in need.”In thepress release,American Eagle described the “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” campaign as a “return to essential denim dressing and a celebration of what the beloved brand does best: making customers look and feel good in AE Jeans”.The company added that “Sweeney’s girl next door charm and main character energy – paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously – is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.”The American Eagle campaign is not the first time that Sweeney has been involved in political controversy. In 2022, she faced criticism after she was photographed at her mother’s birthday partywhere several of the guests were seen wearinghats that called to mind those which bear Trump’s Make America great again (Maga) slogan.Meanwhile, in May, she achieved internet virality by having a hand in selling soap made with her bath water, which virtually sold out immediately after it was released on the Dr Squatch website.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTelevisionThe White LotusAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

And I reply that while it’s obviously much cooler than it would be in Spain, the sea does warm up from May, when the temperature rises from about 9C to as high as 12-15C by August and September.I go snorkelling in Scotland all year round. I work for the ScottishWildlifeTrust, developing snorkel trails on the Scottish coast and creating guides to the places you can go to enjoy snorkelling in a particular area. But even so, the Wildlife Trust always recommends wearing a wetsuit.View image in fullscreenKelp forest off Shetland: swimming over one of these, you can see an incredible number of small fish, colourful starfish and brittle stars.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyIn the UK, we sometimes think that to connect with nature you have to go to really exotic, faraway places and spend a lot of money. But actually, it can be more effective to connect with the local marine life on your doorstep.Snorkelling doesn’t cost much money or require a great deal of training. It’s one of the most accessible sports to enjoy in the sea: some of the best snorkelling I’ve ever done has been in water I could stand up in. It’s also a very sociable activity because you should never snorkel alone. You should always have a buddy (and ideally a mug of hot chocolate waiting for you afterwards).View image in fullscreenAnemones living within a kelp forest in the Outer Hebrides.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyOne of my favourite snorkelling experiences is swimming over a kelp forest, which are prevalent around Scotland. You see these beautiful, golden fronds of kelp undulating with the waves, which are home to an incredible amount of small fish, colourful beadlet and dahlia anemones, starfish andbrittle stars. Sometimes, you can even see them catching prey.Another time, I saw a huge show of sand eels beneath me. Then I put my head up and saw some seals on the beach and a pod of dolphins in the sea, coming over to say hello – right at that moment, some sea eagles flew low over our heads.View image in fullscreenSeals relaxing on the Isle of Skye.Photograph: grafxart8888/Getty Images/iStockphotoWhen I talk to my colleagues in other European countries about snorkelling, they often talk about the overcrowding caused by tourism and how that is a hugely challenging part of their job. I feel very fortunate that in Scotland, we don’t have that same strain on many of our natural places.I’m obsessed with cave diving. This is the closest environment we have to spaceRead moreHaving said that, I’ve noticed snorkelling in Scotland has increased a lot in popularity since the pandemic, and coastal communities are leading the way in championing that. I think people are realising that it’s an amazing thing to do for yourself for health reasons – mental and physical – but also for society, because it can remind you that the sea is an extraordinary place where nature is in decline. Hopefully that inspires more people to protect it.View image in fullscreenElouise Dalziel snorkels all year round, developing snorkel trails in Scotland.Photograph: Scottish Wildlife TrustResearch also suggests thatcold water immersion can have physiological and emotionalbenefits. I find, when I get into the water, the coolness takes away all my worries and anything that was niggling away at me in my mind.Finally, there’s so much cultural history in Scotland tied to the sea and coastal communities. Sometimes, you might be snorkelling below a castle or through sea caves or a harbour – you gain an understanding of the connection between people and the sea over time.The Scottish Wildlife Trust’s latest project,Sea the connection, aims to reduce barriers somepeople face when connecting with the sea.

A total of 31 key environmental rules on topics from clean air to clean water and climate change would be rolled back or repealed under Zeldin’s plan.He singled out the endangerment finding as “the holy grail of the climate change religion” and said he was thrilled to end it “as the EPA does its part to usher in the Golden Age of American success”.The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell moreelectric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US.Three former EPA leaders have criticized Zeldin, saying his March proposal wouldendanger the lives of millions of Americansand abandon the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.“If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,” Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under the Republican president George W Bush, said after Zeldin’s plan was made public.The EPA proposal follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report “on the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding.Conservatives and some congressional Republicans hailed the initial plan, calling it a way to undo economically damaging rules to regulate greenhouse gases.But environmental groups, legal experts and Democrats said any attempt to repeal or roll back the endangerment finding would be an uphill task with slim chance of success. The finding came two years after a 2007 supreme court ruling holding that the EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said it was virtually “impossible to think that the EPA could develop a contradictory finding [to the 2009 standard] that would stand up in court”.Doniger and other critics accused Trump’s Republican administration of using potential repeal of the endangerment finding as a “kill shot’’ that would allow him to make all climate regulations invalid. If finalized, repeal of the endangerment finding would erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to tackle climate change.“The endangerment finding is the legal foundation that underpins vital protections for millions of people from the severe threats of climate change, and the Clean Car and Truck Standards are among the most important and effective protections to address the largest US source of climate-causing pollution,” said Peter Zalzal, associate vice-president of the Environmental Defense Fund.“Attacking these safeguards is manifestly inconsistent with EPA’s responsibility to protect Americans’ health and wellbeing,” he said. “It is callous, dangerous and a breach of our government’s responsibility to protect the American people from this devastating pollution.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClimate crisisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers would have to work with local landowners to gain permission for the riverbanks to be used by the public, and the research by Devon campaigners shows how difficult this can be.Aristocrats own large swathes of the Dart. The Duchy of Cornwall owns the largest slice of riverbank at 28 miles (45km). The Dart is 47 miles long, so has nearly 100 miles of bank altogether. The next largest owner, the Spitchwick estate, owns 12 miles, and the Duke of Somerset has about 1.25 miles. The research also found that 11.6 miles is owned via offshore companies.Right to roam campaigners have long asked for aristocrats to open up their land for the public to walk across. In 2022,dozens of campaignersdescended upon the Duke of Somerset’s estate to picnic and play music, ignoring the “keep out” signs. In Scotland, there is a right to walk across the entirety of the countryside as long as ramblers are respectful and leave no trace behind.Research by British Canoeinghas previously found that fewer than 4% of English rivers are open to the public. A patchwork of landowners have rights over tiny lengths of river, which makes it almost impossible to create routes for swimming and boating without land reform, campaigners have said.Lewis Winks, who compiled the River Dart research, said: “The River Dart is rightly a much-celebrated part of the Devon landscape, yet the rights to the river – and those who own them – largely remain a mystery. The more time I spend with the Dart, the more urgent the question becomes: who gets to decide whether we are able to know and love this river?”He said he embarked on the daunting task of mapping land ownership along the Dart “to understand who holds power over access here”. He added that “what quickly became clear was how little transparency exists – even those working closely with the river often don’t know who owns the banks”.The Dart rises high on Dartmoor and flows to the sea at Dartmouth. Though it is a significant river in the area, it is relatively short compared with others in the UK. For example, the Severn is 220 miles long, and the Thames is 215 miles long.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Achieving increased access to rivers based on a permissive approach would present a logistical nightmare. Each stretch would require time-consuming negotiations with dozens – if not hundreds – of large landowners and corporate bodies, many of whom are difficult to identify.“That’s why we’re calling for a rights-based approach to river access – similar to the system in Scotland, where the public has the right to responsibly walk, swim, paddle and canoe along most rivers and lochs, with sensible exceptions.”A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “Britain is a proud nation of nature lovers, and this government is committed to turning the tide on its decline after years of neglect.

But former Department of Energy officials are alarmed thatDonald Trumpis fumbling its potential.Compared with other clean energy sources such as solar and wind, geothermal enjoys rare bipartisan support. The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, haspraisedthe technology, calling it “an awesome resource that’s under our feet”. And Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Actpreserved tax creditsfor geothermal.But the administration’sslashingof Department of Energy staff, delays in issuing low-interest loans, andtariffsare together creating uncertainty for the industry and investors.The US has an advantage on geothermal over China and must move urgently, said David Turk, who served as the deputy secretary of energy under former president Joe Biden. “Anything that stops our ability to execute on a plan – staffing, other funding – I think, is shooting ourselves in the foot,” Turk said.The White House and Department ofEnergydid not respond to questions about how their policies are affecting enhanced geothermal.US renewable energy has tripled in a decade – but almost $8bn in projects now face cutsRead moreThe potential of geothermalGeothermal energyuses the heat from the Earth’s crust to transform water into steam that turns turbines and generates electricity. It has been used formore than a century, but has been limited to places where hot water reached the Earth’s surface, including hot springs.Now there’s a new technique that can generate energy anywhere, known as enhanced geothermal. The same horizontal drilling approach used in fracking can reach hot rock deep below the surface. “It opens up enhanced geothermal all over the country, all over the world,” Turk said. “That’s just tremendous.”So far, enhanced geothermal systems are located in the Western US. One of the most promisinggeothermal projectsby Fervo Energy can be found in Utah. But the technology can also work in the east.The US is ahead of other countries on enhanced geothermal because of its shale gas boom over the past 15 years, said Eva Schill, a staff scientist who leads the Geothermal Systems Program at Berkeley Lab. “The reason is that we have a lot of experience here from oil and gas fracking,” she said.The enhanced geothermal industry is nascent, generating only1%of the US’s electricity. And it’s still too expensive to compete with coal and natural gas.View image in fullscreenVisitors to Yellowstone national park in Wyoming can see geothermal energy in action at the Castle Geyser.Photograph: lucky-photographer/AlamyBut under the right conditions, it could evolve into a cheap source of power. AJanuary articlein the journal Nature Reviews found that it could be cost competitive with the national average cost of electricity generation by 2030.The US is the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, and although US emissions have trended downward for the past two decades, the country is still not on track to meet its climate targets. The rapidgrowth of AI datacentresis further threatening those targets by fueling rising energy demand; datacentres need to run 24/7, so they tend to rely on fossil fuels.We have the technology, we have the tools … and I think now what we really need to do is establish the confidenceJigar Shah, clean energy entrepreneurGeothermal can potentially solve that problem. It could create 80,000 megawatts of new power, according to a liftoff report published by the Department of Energy.“To put that in perspective, that could meet 100% of all of the AI datacenter load growth for the next 10 years,” saidJigar Shah, a clean energy entrepreneur who served as the director of the loan programs office at the Department of Energy under Joe Biden. “That’s pretty impressive.”Already, Google and Meta havesigneddealsthat would see geothermal companies power their datacentres.How the Trump administration is fumbling geothermalEnhanced geothermalacceleratedunder Biden-era policies. But several former energy department officials say the Trump administration is failing to provide the business certainty needed to get the fledgling industry off the ground.“The whole ball game right now is bringing down those costs, proving it for investors,” Turk said.“This is really about feelings,” Shah said. “Do the investors feel like this administration really has their back when it comes to investing in these new technologies? They felt like we actually had their back when I was running the loan programs office, and when secretary [Jennifer] Granholm was running energy. They’re unsure whether this administration has their back on these technologies.”View image in fullscreenThe then deputy energy secretary, David Turk, testifies in May 2023.Photograph: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty ImagesUnder the Biden administration, the loan programs office was working on closing a low-interest loan for geothermal. Similar loans previously boosted Tesla and utility-scale solar. However, theTrump administrationhas yet to close a low-interest loan for geothermal, Shah said.The gutting of energy department staff has lowered its capacity to support geothermal, several former energy department officials said.Thousandsof scientists, analysts, engineers and procurement officers took deferred resignation offers or were fired. Politico reported that the administration was considering cutting loan programs office staffby half.The Department of Energy has lost “absolutely indispensable” experts on geothermal and loans, Turk said. “So I would worry about, have we lost some of that capacity to actually execute?”Trump’s zeal for tariffs is adding to the industry’s anxiety. Steel tariffs,now at 50%, are hurting companies that use steel in wells. Enhanced geothermal wells require installing miles of steel pipes.Behind the scenes, geothermal companies are “freaking out” about the steel tariffs, Shah said. “They don’t want to say anything negative, lest the Eye of Sauron find them,” he added.The survival of the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for geothermal provides some certainty. Geothermal can stillaccess the full tax credit, as long as they begin construction by 2033, when the value of the credit will begin phasing down.But geothermal projects now face strict restrictions on the involvement of “foreign entities of concern,” such as Chinese companies and individuals, known as FEOC requirements. Geothermal projects use rare earth elements in their drill bits, and China dominates the rare earth minerals market, said a former energy department official who requested anonymity.What Trump officials can do to boost geothermal“This is a good enough market opportunity that somewhere in the world is going to come true, and we are really well set up for it, if we’re not stupid,” the official said, talking generally about the industry. “But we’ve unfortunately been pretty stupid, and we’re making it harder on ourselves to win in an area that should be pretty easy to win.”There are actions the Trump administration can take immediately to bring down costs and boost the industry.The government can speed things along by “doing a lot of mapping of resources to make it cheaper and less risky for drilling in this area versus that area”, Turk said.“Close a loan,” Shah said, explaining that it would send a strong signal to investors.“We have the technology, we have the tools – the loan programs office and other tools – and I think now what we really need to do is establish the confidence,” Shah said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationGeothermal energyEnergyDonald TrumpUS politicsRenewable energyFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is being developed as a film by Parker’s company Pretty Matches Productions and MA Productions.Sarah Jessica Parker gets a ‘golden ticket’ to the judging panel of 2025 Booker prizeRead more“It is not uncommon for judges to have a connection to authors whose work has been submitted, so all judges have to declare any conflicts of interest at the outset,” said Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation.“AsSarah Jessica Parkerpublished Claire Adam’s first novel, Golden Child, under her US imprint SJP for Hogarth, she declared the potential conflict to ensure transparency and only gave her view on the book after the other judges had shared theirs. No book can go through if it is supported by one judge alone, and Love Forms has earned its place on the Booker prize 2025 longlist through the active support of other judges on the panel.”In an interview with thethe Irish Timespublished in June, Adam said that the film option “was bought by a small production company in LA (MA Productions), and we’re all so thrilled that SJP’s Pretty Matches Productions is on board as well. Film stuff moves slowly, there are a zillion obstacles, and her supporting the project is fantastic.”Pretty Matches Productions, founded in 2005, is also behind the Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That … and the HBO series Divorce, which Parker executive produced and starred in.In aninterview with the Timesin June, Adam said that Parker “reads loads and so it was really fun to hang out with her. She’s so lovely and sincere. She read the book cover to cover and got up at 5am to travel to meet me.” Golden Child is published in the UK by Faber, and in 2019 won the Desmond Elliott prize.In June 2023, Parker launched SJP Lit, in partnership with the independent publisher Zando, which has published titles including These Days by Lucy Caldwell and The Story of the Forest by Linda Grant. Parker also shares book recommendations on her Instagram account.Parker wasannounced as a judgeof this year’s Booker prize in December, with Wood saying at the time that she had “enjoyed sharing book recommendations with Sarah Jessica, who has passionately supported contemporary fiction for many years”.The 2025 judging panel is chaired by Roddy Doyle, and Parker’s co-judges are Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀, Kiley Reid and Chris Power.Adam was named as one of 13 longlisted authors, which include the former winner Kiran Desai, Tash Aw and David Szalay.

Annual attendance data from the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva) released in March showed that Tate Modern andTate Britainhad a 27% decline in attendance since 2019 – a drop of 2.2 million visitors.Tate’s attendances were particularly poor compared with other cultural attractions in London: the National Portrait Gallery only had a 3% dip over the same period, while the British Museum had 4%.Balshaw highlighted internal research that showed domestic visitor numbers are at 95% of pre-Covid levels, but international numbers are only at 61%.“The figures speak for themselves,” she toldthe Art Newspaper. “Tate Modern alone welcomed 609,000 visitors from Europe, between ages 16 to 24, in 2019-20 but then 357,000 in 2023-24.“And if you think about that age of person: they are profoundly affected by the combination of Brexit changing their educational and work opportunities and then Covid profoundly affecting the end of their studies and the way they choose to live their lives. They are, in general, also travelling less.”Critics of Tate and Balshawblamed “woke” curatorial choicesfor the disappointing attendance figures – with some suggesting free entrymight need to be abolished.The attendance figures came just after Tate announced it would be cutting 7% of its workforce in order to address a funding deficit left over from the pandemic.A Tate spokesperson said at the time: “Such changes ensure we have the stability we need to continue being as ambitious and innovative as ever”.The Guardian understands there are no specific plans to attract young Europeans, though the institution has recently announced a series of late openings that oftenattract younger audiences.Tate Modern, which celebrated its25th anniversary this year, welcomed more than 76,000 people during its birthday weekend – a turnout insiders hope could signal a rebound in 2025.Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTate BritainArtnewsShareReuse this content"

The role was created after the prime minister voiced concerns about the government’s communications last year.The Guardian understands senior Labour figures also have concerns over the appointment, which has yet to be confirmed by the government.In a letter to Starmer, Hillsborough families – and others affected by “scandal and state-endorsed abuse” – claim Dinsmore is “manifestly unsuitable for public appointment” because of his long association with the Sun, citing its coverage of the disaster, for which the paper has since apologised.“After theHillsborough disaster, in the midst of unimaginable suffering among the bereaved and the survivors, the Sun newspaper published vicious lies about the conduct of fans. Graphic and false allegations cast the deceased and those who survived as barbaric, feckless and inhumane,” the letter states.View image in fullscreenDavid Dinsmore in 2014. He edited the Sun from 2013 to 2015 and has since become chief operating officer of News UK.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe signatories warn that the Sun “has not changed”, saying it has opted against independent regulation and “has continued to demonise ordinary people and marginalised communities”.“For these reasons, we are deeply concerned by the proposed appointment of David Dinsmore to the role of permanent secretary for communications,” the letter states.Charlotte Hennessy, who lost her father, Jimmy Hennessy, at Hillsborough when she was six years old, said: “Dinsmore suggested the only mistake the Sun made regarding Hillsboroughwas the headline. Not the lies, not the smears.“If Keir Starmer really wants to deliver change he needs to get on with delivering the Hillsborough law he promised and backtrack on appointing someone so unsuitable for public office.”The letter also highlights that Dinsmore wasconvicted of breaching the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Actafter the tabloid printed a pixelated photograph of the victim of the disgraced footballer Adam Johnson.The judge in the case was satisfied Dinsmore did not know he was committing an offence and ordered that he pay £1,300 costs and offer to pay £1,000 in compensation to the girl for any distress caused.The letter states: “As a senior executive of News UK, [Dinsmore] has been involved in the company’s false denials of the Sun’s commissioning of illegal activity throughout the 2000s.” The title has now admitted that“incidents of unlawful activities”were carried out by private investigators working for it between 1996 and 2011.Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor of the Liverpool city region, also raised concern about the appointment this week.“For many people in our city, particularly those who fought for justice for the Hillsborough families, this appointment will be seen as a deeply insensitive choice, given the hurt caused to our communities unjustly targeted by that ‘newspaper’, Rupert Murdoch and his acolytes,” he wrote.“I fully support the government’s ambition to rebuild trust in politics. But appointments like this could risk undermining that effort. Trust can’t be restored by drawing from the same networks that helped erode it.”Dinsmore started his career in journalism as a reporter for the Scottish Sun in 1990, becoming the title’s editor in 2006. He has held a number of senior roles at the Sun including managing editor and helped to oversee the launch of its Sunday edition.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said no appointment had yet been made, so they would not comment on Dinsmore.News UKdid not wish to comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He claimed it was not unreasonable to call for the repeal of theOnline Safety Actthat came into force last week.Kyle doubled down, saying the act forced providers to “detect and remove horrific child sexual abuse material, usinghash matching[technology], [which] prevents grooming and stops strange adults messaging kids, keeps children’s profiles and locations hidden, and stops kids seeing porn”.Reform UK said on Monday it wouldrepeal the act, arguing that measures intended to push social media companies to limit false and potentially harmful content would make the UK “a borderline dystopian state”.Farage and Zia Yusuf, his government efficiency chief, told a press conference that a Reform government would repeal the legislation immediately and seek other ways to replicate its efforts to protect children from harmful content, for example about suicide. They said they did not yet know how this would be done.Responding on Sky News, Kyle said Farage was on the side of “extreme pornographers” and of people such as the late children’s TV presenter Savile, who preyed on about500 vulnerable victimsas young as two years old.Kyle said: “I see that Nigel Farage is already saying that he’s going to overturn these laws. So you know, we have people out there who are extreme pornographers, peddling hate, peddling violence. Nigel Farage is on their side.“Make no mistake about it, if people like Jimmy Savile were alive today, he’d be perpetrating his crimes online. And Nigel Farage is saying that he’s on their side.”Asked to clarify his comments, Kyle said: “Nigel Farage is on the side of turning the clock back to the time when strange adults, strangers, can get in touch via messaging apps with children.”View image in fullscreenNigel Farage held a livestream broadcast in which he called for an apology from Kyle, saying his comments were ‘so below the belt’.Photograph: Reform UK/PAFarage posted on X: “Peter Kyle’s comments on Sky News are disgusting. He should do the right thing and apologise.”He also gave a livestream broadcast saying: “Just how low can theLabourgovernment sink in their desperation?“Yes, of course they’re in trouble. They’re well behind us in the opinion polls. But frankly, to say that I would do anything that would in any way aid and abet people like Jimmy Savile, it’s so below the belt.”Yusuf, a former Reform chair, claimed it was “the most disgusting thing I’ve heard a politician say about another politician in the political arena, that I can remember in my lifetime”.He said parts of the act intended to shield children from harmful content, such as a requirement on age verification, were pointless because people could simply use VPN proxy servers to access sites as if they were outside the UK.Asked how Reform would protect children, Farage has said he did not know but claimed his party had expertise not available to the government.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In the video several individuals direct verbal abuse at the pair, including “Go back to your country, murderers”, “This isn’t Gaza, this is Milan, this is Italy”, and “You’ll end up in hell sooner or later”.He reported that more and more people inside the service station joined in the verbal abuse as he and his son made their way to the restroom. At least three individuals began pushing him, apparently trying to force him out of the rest area.‘‘I ended up on the ground, and they took advantage of that like animals, kicking me in the stomach,’’ Elie told Il Corriere della Sera newspaper. ‘‘Then one of them tried to pull me up and aimed a blow at my face, but I managed to block it. Amid the chaos of the scuffle, I caught a glimpse of my son, who – thankfully – a woman had taken aside and was holding safely in a corner.“I started shouting ‘Police! Police! Police!’ he added, ‘‘and only then did they stop and go back upstairs.”Police have launched an investigation into the attack, which has been condemned by politicians and Jewish associations.Commenting on the incident, Noemi Di Segni, the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, said: “If simply being visibly Jewish is enough to provoke such a violent attack – if a family cannot safely move through public spaces in this country – then the legitimisation of hatred and antisemitism has become viral. This is about everyone’s freedom being at risk. Holding on to respect and dignity for every person is the only path that protects us all.”Elie told Il Corriere that ‘‘given the climate of hatred that has developed across Europe toward the Jewish community, I expected it. But I never thought it would happen to me, especially not in Italy, which I had always considered a tolerant country, a place where one could feel safe.“These kinds of incidents are becoming more and more frequent,,” he added.Antisemitic incidents have risen across countries with the largest Jewish communities outside Israel, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s J7 taskforce report published in May.The report states that attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, alongside individuals, have increased significantly, in some cases more than doubling in 2023 compared with the previous year.Antisemitic incidents increased in Germany by 75% from 2021 to 2023, 185% in France and 82% in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 1,600 Israeli passengers onboard the Crown Iris were prevented from disembarking amid safety concerns when more than 300 demonstrators on the Cycladic isle made clear they were unwelcome over Israel’s conduct during the war in Gaza and its treatment of Palestinians.Marina Rosenberg, the senior vice-president of international affairs at the Anti-Defamation League, said that because people are being harassed just for being Jewish, “many Jews around the world are hiding their Jewish symbols”, such as the Star of David.On Tuesday federal prosecutors in Germany filed terrorism charges against a Syrian man accused of stabbing a Spanish tourist at Berlin’s Holocaust memorial in February – an attack that the authorities say was intended to demonstrate allegiance to Islamic State.In France in May 2024 police shot dead an Algerian man who had set fire to a synagogue in Rouen and threatened officers with a knife.Explore more on these topicsItalyAntisemitismEuropeIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

A Guardiansurvey of academic integrity violationsin the UK found almost 7,000 proven cases of cheating using AI tools in 2023-24, equivalent to 5.1 for every 1,000 students. That compared with 1.6 cases per 1,000 in 2022-23.More than a third ofcollege-age young adults in the USuse ChatGPT,according to OpenAI, with about a quarter of their chatbot messages referring to learning, tutoring and schoolwork.The study mode is designed to avoid simply serving up a complete essay or exam answer, withOpenAIsaying it “doesn’t just offer solutions without helping students make sense of them”. However, students will still be able to take an academic shortcut if they ignore the study mode option.Jayna Devani, the international education lead at ChatGPT’s US-based developer, OpenAI, said the company did not want ChatGPT to be misused by students and the tool was a “step toward” encouraging constructive academic use of ChatGPT.“How do we take that step forward in showing that there are responsible ways to engage with ChatGPT – to engage with ChatGPT to actually support a learning process? We definitely don’t believe that these tools should be misused and this is one step toward that,” she said.Devani acknowledged that tackling academic cheating would require a “whole industry conversation” about changing assessments and drawing up “very unambiguous guidelines about what constitutes responsible AI use”.OpenAI said study mode – billed as “study and learn” in the chatbot’s tools options – was especially useful for homework help, exam preparation and learning new topics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was placed under sanctions by the UK government in March 2022 as part of measures to target Russia-linked oligarchs and officials after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion ofUkraine.Shvidler, who was born in the USSR in 1964, grew up in Moscow but is now a British citizen, had challenged his designation at the high court in 2023 and then appealed against that decision last year. He argued the measures caused disproportionate hardship and discriminated against him as a Russian-born person, while also claiming he was not closely associated enough to Abramovich to justify the Foreign Office’s move.On Tuesday, a majority decision of four supreme court justices to one dismissed the businessman’s appeal, saying that sanctions had to be tough to be effective.The judgment stated: “Sanctions often have to be severe and open-ended if they are to be effective. The object of the designation in relation to Mr Shvidler is that he should so far as possible be disabled from enjoying his assets and pursuing his wealthy lifestyle.”The judges added: “We accept that [the government’s] evidence establishes that there is a rational connection between the designation of Mr Shvidler and the aim of this sanction … as the courts … correctly recognised in Mr Shvidler’s case, the effectiveness of a sanctions regime depends on the cumulative effect of the measures imposed under that regime. The imposition of sanctions in relation to Mr Shvidler contributes to that cumulative effect.”However, in a 20-page dissenting judgment, Lord Leggatt said he disagreed with the majority’s decision that the sanctions were lawful, describing it as “Orwellian” and arguing he did not consider the government had shown a rational connection between the freezing of Shvidler’s assets and the objective of sanctions.“I do not consider that the reasons relied on by the government come close to justifying such a drastic curtailment of his liberty,” he wrote.Shvidler said: “This supreme court judgment brings me back to the USSR, which I left as a stateless refugee 36 years ago, seeking sanctuary in the US. Back then, individuals could be stripped of their rights with little or no protections and that is how I feel about this judgment.”The UK government imposed sanctions on Shvidler on grounds including that he was associated with Abramovich, who in turn had obtained a benefit from or supported the government ofRussia. The Foreign Office argued the men were associated because Shvidler was a long-serving director of Evraz, a steel and mining company in which Abramovich was a leading shareholder. It said he had also served as chair of Millhouse LLC, the Moscow-based arm of the UK company that managed assets for Abramovich and Shvidler himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, the leading international authority on food crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, saidthe “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out”in Gaza.More than 20 member states expressed “serious concerns” about the current situation inGazaat the EU ambassadors meeting on Tuesday to discuss the proposal.Some gave immediate support, with a few expressing concern that a suspension from Horizon would “hamper the dialogue” withIsrael, a diplomat said. The member states agreed to work quickly with the commission to clarify technical details before reviewing the proposal again.HorizonEuropeis among the most prestigious science research programmes in the world and has never suspended a country before. Officials believe, however, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is so extreme that it now has a legal basis for suspension.In its proposal to member states the commission reports that “90% of households face severe water insecurity and malnutrition rates are rising sharply” with “severe shortages of medicine” and “virtually the entire Gaza population … at risk of famine”.The IPC said “humanitarian aid is largely insufficient”, citing Israel’s “drastic restrictions” on aid shipments into Gaza, and a lack of security for humanitarian organisations inside Gaza.Israel has blamed food shortages on distribution failures by the UN and Hamas diverting aid. Those claims have been repeatedly undermined.Israel said on Tuesday that “over 200 trucks were collected and distributed yesterday by the UN and international organisations” with an additional 260 awaiting collection and distribution.Clouds on horizon as EU members meet to discuss relationship with UKRead moreThat volume of aid is, however, still below the levels needed. An average of 500 trucks a day entered Gaza before the war, at time when people had not endured months of malnutrition, most had shelter and access to clean water and there was a functioning agriculture sector.EU officials described the current aid increases as an improvement but said they had been denied access to Gaza to verify the delivery of humanitarian aid and that there needed to be more entry points and distribution centres.Their proposal, if approved, would deny Israel access to one of the critical research areas within the Horizon programme, called the European Innovation Council (EIC), which specialises in disruptive technologies.Israel is one of the most successful member countries in the programme, receiving about €200m (£173m) of the €900m allocated since 2021, withabout €135m in grants and €65m in equity investment.There are 46 Israeli companies in the EIC programme, the EU said.The commission said in a statement: “While Israel has announced a daily humanitarian pause in Gaza fighting and has met some of its commitments under the common understanding on humanitarian aid and access, the situation remains severe.”It added that the suspension would flow from its review of the trade association agreement with Israel, prompted by calls for a review of the agreement by the Netherlands backed by 17 countries in May.Officials said the partial suspension would be given legal effect through article 79 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement if the action was deemed “proportionate”.A seven-page proposal was put to ambassadors from member states gathering in Brussels to discuss the EU-US trade deal.According to the rules the EU would need a qualified majority, which means votes from about 15 member states, to carry it through as long as they represent 65% of the bloc’s population.This would almost certainly mean Germany would have to support the move.Senior EU officials said the mood at the ambassadors’ meeting last week on the matter of humanitarian aid was “heated” and there seemed to be a “special urgency” about putting this proposal on the table.The UK was blocked from Horizon for three years after Brexit,rejoining in 2024, but officials said this was different from a suspension.Explore more on these topicsEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaEuropeResearch fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

(In case you need a reminder: this was the $66 jade egg Paltrow sold via her lifestyle brand Goop that promised various health benefits upon insertion.) Amy Odell’s book, billed as delivering “insight and behind-the-scenes details of Paltrow’s relationships, family, friendships, iconic films”, as well as her creation of Goop, takes no particular stand on this, nor on many of Paltrow’s more divisive episodes, instead offering us what feels like an earnest jog back through the actor and wellness guru’s years of fame. The author writes in the acknowledgments that she spoke to 220 people for the book, in which case we have to assume that a great many of them had little to say.To be fair to Odell, whose previous biography was of Anna Wintour, another difficult and controlling subject – although Wintour did give Odell some access – Paltrow’s world is notoriously hard to break into if she’s not on board with a project; the author quotes numerous hacks tasked with profiling Paltrow for magazines who found themselves iced out of her networks, and the same happens to her in the early stages of research. Odell’s task only gets harder in the second half of the book, which tackles the Goop years. Since, she claims, many of its staff signed NDAs, those sections lack even the modest stream of gossip that enlivens the first half.Which, by the way, is perfectly enjoyable. I ripped through Odell’s account of Paltrow’s youth as the simultaneously indulged and benignly neglected daughter of two showbusiness big guns, the actor Blythe Danner and the producer and director Bruce Paltrow. Danner is prim and unemotional; Bruce Paltrow is more demonstrative but still emotionally evasive, and Odell reheats some well-documented episodes between father and daughter, such as the trip they made to Paris when Paltrow was around 10, during which Bruce told her: “I wanted you to see Paris for the first time with a man who will always love you, no matter what.” (Paltrow, in interviews, has always offered up this story as a moving tribute to her dad’s love for her.) Odell also tells us the (I think) new detail that, when Paltrow was older, “her dad once gave her lace underwear as a gift”. It’s a small addition but it stands out against what feels like the book’s trove of reconstituted material.In 1984, when Paltrow was 12, the family moved from LA to New York. We learn that she felt out-classed at Spence, the Upper East Side private school where the money is older and the blood bluer than in the Danner-Paltrow household. We also learn that, in spite of this, Paltrow – whose biggest nightmare is listed in the senior school yearbook as “obesity” – manages to form a clique around herself that may or may not have been involved in the drawing of a penis on the library wall. It’s small potatoes but we’ll take it.Odell goes into great depth about the Williamstown theatre festival – presumably because the old theatre lags actually agreed to talk to her – a storied annual event in rural Massachusetts where Danner takes her daughter every summer, first to watch her mother on stage, and later, to act herself. I liked these passages, in which you get a real sense of asummer stockscene that has always attracted top actors and their nepo babies. At one point, a barely teenage Paltrow takes the assistant director’s seat and the head of the festival fails to ask her to move. Paltrow is entitled, wan, sometimes foul-mouthed, intensely focused and in these scenes, really comes alive. By studying her mother on stage, she learns how to be an actor.The story is less about how Paltrow became this figure in the culture than why on earth she was elevated in the first placeAnd so on to the Hollywood years, where everything becomes less fresh and more familiar. We slog through the background to productions of Emma, Shallow Hal and Shakespeare in Love and then we get to Harvey Weinstein, who during the first flush of #MeToo, Paltrow accused of making a pass at her. Odell quotes from Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey’s book, She Said, but there’s not much more to be harvested on a story broken and pursued by such good reporters. What’s left is a trawl through a lot of things we already know – although there is one very funny motif from those years, which involves Paltrow miming throwing up behind the backs of people she dislikes, one of whom is Minnie Driver. (Team Driver all the way, here, obviously.) Also an old friend of Paltrow’s claims “she invented ghosting”, which sounds about right.Finally, Goop: this was a story I hadn’t been paying much attention to lately, and so a genuine surprise of the book is to learn that the company founded by Paltrow in 2008 has been a much shakier business than advertised. We know that Goop paid to settle a lawsuit brought by the California Food, Drug and Medical Device Task Force over false claims about the health benefits of the vaginal eggs. And we also know it accepted judgments by the National Advertising Division about other false claims. But, as Odell puts it, Paltrow’s “middling run as the CEO of Goop” has ensured that the company “hasn’t experienced sustained profitability … and has lacked a clear business strategy as it ping-pongs from one of Gwyneth’s ideas to the next”.Here’s a reveal: that Paltrow is such a massive cheapskate she used Goop’sfood editors to cook for her. “In the office,” writes Odell, “it was common knowledge that the food editors would go to Gwyneth’s house after work and make her dinner under the guise of ‘recipe testing’. When she and Brad Falchuk were living apart, the food editor would bring dinner to his house, too, which wasn’t a light lift in LA traffic.” She also asked vendors to donate their services to her and Falchuk’s wedding in return for advertising.The difficulty with all this is that Paltrow is a charmless subject who never rises to the level of monstrous. She’s an OK actor, a so-so businesswoman – Kim Kardashian, as Odell points out, has had much greater success with her company, Skims. The story, then, is less about how Paltrow became this figure in the culture than why on earth she was elevated in the first place. Odell doesn’t have the time or the inclination to get into this, instead offering pat lines such as, “love her or hate her, for over 30 years, we haven’t been able to look away”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Then she made The Philadelphia StoryAs a stuck-up socialite tangled in a love triangle, Hepburn delivers one of the most memorable screwball heroines – and we can’t help but love herJamie TramTue 29 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 19.00 EDTShareThese days, Katharine Hepburn is revered as a progressive icon of Hollywood’s golden age, an androgynous (andpossibly queer) fashion rebel whosefour best actress awardshave yet to be topped at the Oscars. But back in 1938, only six years into her illustrious career, she was branded as “box office poison”.She was a star ahead of her time, her domineering screen presence registering as shrill and petulant by the tail end of the 1930s. After the box office disappointments of Bringing up Baby and Holiday – both now canonised romcom classics – she retreated from Hollywood and signed on to a new play penned by her friend Philip Barry: The Philadelphia Story.Like its film adaptation, Barry’s script centres on Tracy Lord, a stuck-up socialite (easily read as a stand-in for Hepburn herself) set to marry a wealthy politician, only for the wedding to be upended by the arrival of two competing romantic prospects: her ex-husband, CK Dexter Haven, and tabloid reporter Mike Connor.The production was a runaway success on Broadway, and Hepburn soon took the reins of a film version, for which she brought on her trusted collaborator George Cukor (A Star is Born, My Fair Lady and countless more) as director. Her initial choice of co-leads – Clark Gable (Gone with the Wind) and Spencer Tracy (Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner) were vetoed. But it’s hard to imagine a more dazzling collision of stars than the eventual casting of Cary Grant (Charade) and James Stewart (It’s a Wonderful Life) as Dexter and Mike respectively.View image in fullscreen‘One of the finest pairings in romcom history’ … Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn.Photograph: Ronald GrantAcross their four collaborations, which culminated in The Philadelphia Story, Hepburn and Grant would continually redefine one of the finest pairings in romcom history. The former’s strong-willed, fast-talking women bulldozed over lesser leading men, but were perfectly parried by the slinky yet similarly imposing Grant. As embittered, sniping exes, they effortlessly locate each other’s pressure points – Dexter’s alcoholism, Tracy’s performance of invulnerability – but they share a private camaraderie.It’s James Stewart’s Mike, though, who guides the film’s sweeping romantic moments (and sets the benchmark fordrunk acting). The night before the wedding, he shares a poolside flirtation with the bride-to-be that evolves into an exhilarating declaration of love, powered by Stewart’s earnest intensity. “You’re lit from within, Tracy. You’ve got fires banked down in you, hearth fires and holocausts,” he beseeches. Cukor’s rapturous direction presses into both actors until they’re framed in glazed, moonlit closeups, Hepburn’s eyes and beaded gown twinkling irresistibly. She’s every bit the goddess that he sees.View image in fullscreen‘Under Hepburn’s command, you can’t help but fall in love.’Photograph: Snap/Rex FeaturesBut the film doesn’t allow her to bask in the image for long. The Philadelphia Story’s success hinges on Tracy’s humbling. She lowers herself from her own lofty esteem to eventually find love among other mere mortals, catering to the public’s desire to see Hepburn taken down a peg. There’s maybe some truth to Kazuo Ishiguro’s dismissal of the film as “a really nasty piece of work”, especially considering how the screwball comedy traditionally revolved around stories of men being cut down to size.To Kill a Mockingbird: a call to compassion that’s more urgent than everRead moreI think the screenplay deserves more credit for its intricacies: at each corner of the love triangle is a deeply fallible character who hides behind various defence mechanisms. Tracy’s eventual happiness is entirely her own choice; she only submits to love upon finding the one person who can recognise and accept her faults.In a subgenre defined by its memorable female leads, Tracy Lord offers one of the more nuanced takes on the screwball heroine. She’s a spoilt brat, an arrogant intellectual, an impervious fortress – and under Hepburn’s command, you can’t help but fall in love.The Philadelphia Story is available to stream on HBO Max in Australia and available to rent in the UK and US.

This powerful documentary tells the story of these shocking missionsJack SealeTue 29 Jul 2025 04.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 04.06 EDTShareGoing by the raw numbers, Japan’s use of kamikaze pilots in the dying days of the second world war was an effective military action. While the country lost almost 4,000 of its men by asking them to fly planes laden with explosives into enemy ships – a task that entailed certain death – the losses on the other side were closer to 7,000. But it was a bewildering act of collective desperation that still has the ability to shock, and tells us a lot about the futility of modern warfare and the power of mass hysteria in times of conflict.Kamikaze: An UntoldHistoryis a documentary by the Japanese public broadcaster NHK that could have been a very powerful film at 60 minutes but is still impactful at an exhaustive hour and a half. It starts with the first suicide pilots who flew in October 1944, as the Americans advanced inexorably across the Pacific towards mainland Japan. The programme is determined to commemorate individuals who perished, beginning with 20-year-old Hirota Yukinobu. There is clear footage of his plane hitting an aircraft carrier and creating a large explosion on deck, having taken a hit to the wing on its descent: we can well imagine the last moments of a young man’s life being filled with fear of failure and perhaps the physical pain of fire in the cockpit, followed by a final split-second of realisation that his mission had been accomplished.What is even more extraordinary was what happened once the first wave of kamikaze pilots had flown. Newsreel propaganda, shown in cinemas nationwide, lauded the men as something beyond heroic: “With your departure,” said one proud announcer, “you have joined the gods.” It was thought that a nation that was willing to resort to such measures could not possibly lose, and that if Emperor Hirohito were forced to negotiate for peace, this show of strength would enable a more favourable deal.The men became superstars. The home village of 19-year-old Terashima Tadamasa erected a stone monument to his memory, and local dignitaries attended his funeral. In one of several interviews recorded in the 2000s and 2010s with first-hand witnesses, who have since died, the sister of 23-year-old Ishii Mitoshi recalls how hordes of well-wishing strangers made it hard for her family to grieve for him. Pilots had their final written statements read out on national radio (“Mother, are you well? I will not squander the 21 years of life you have given me!”). As the slogan “100 million kamikaze” became popular, schoolchildren wore headbands expressing support for the men, while adults who were not physically fit to serve often proved to be particularly fervent amateur agitators, urging the kamikaze on.The film is a straightforward historical account, so it doesn’t debate the spiky moral and philosophical conundrums the kamikaze phenomenon raises. War requires the mass sacrifice of human life, often in the form of strategies that will certainly lead to heavy losses for your own side. The emotional pull of last year’s American-made second world wardrama Masters of the Air, for example, was provided largely by the idea of men being sent on missions from which many would not return. What is the logic in feeling inspired by the selflessness of soldiers who had a tiny chance of survival, but horrified by those who had none? Clear answers are not to be found here but, as we gaze at photographs of squadrons of men under the age of 25, whose whole adult lives were rehearsals for their death, we have to ask why.The slightly baggy back half of the film does give us more to chew on, as it looks at those who weren’t selected, or who volunteered with some reluctance. Documents are found that suggest the Japanese navy rejected some men’s applications if they had scored top marks in aptitude tests: at a time when few Japanese families could afford higher education, university graduates saw their peers become kamikaze pilots and wondered whether the country really wanted to turn its brightest minds into ammunition.More distressing than the tales of those whose privilege didn’t protect them are reports of kamikaze mania driving men of all backgrounds to sign up unwillingly. We hear how they felt that the political climate gave them no choice: the dynamic that is always in place during conflicts, where it is treasonous to criticise the war effort, crushed any dissent. The kamikaze strategy gave Japanese citizens hope. The film ends by glimpsing the atomic bombs hitting Hiroshima and Nagasaki, brutal events that showed that hope to be false. Whether that made the gestures of the kamikaze pilots more or less noble than any other war death is a question that can’t ever be answered, but this film shines new light on it.Kamikaze: An Untold History aired on BBC Four and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVJapanHistorySecond world warreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, he has beenlobbying for the kept animals billthat would legislate further against cruel practices against animals, but that stalled in parliament under the last government.After a potted history of all that, the film follows Abraham as he travels to the US where animal welfare is governed mostly by state and local regulations. But in states such as Pennsylvania, interest groups representing pet stores and others pour money into thwarting legislation similar to Lucy’s law that would ban puppy mills. In order to illustrate the scale of the problem, Abraham gets in a van with animal welfare charity worker Grace, who goes around the Amish-run puppy mills in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, collecting animals that have been worn out by years of breeding, most of them locked in small cages while they pump out puppies. Her courteous offer to take unwanted and no longer profitable animals off the hands of the puppy mill owners enables the film-makers to shoot footage inside a few of the facilities and expose the conditions. Turns out even the best quality ones look pretty brutal, with no enrichment for the animals inside antiseptic pens where the yelping and whimpering dogs spend their entire lives.Along for the ride with Grace and Marc is Republican state senator and avid dog lover Tracy Pennycuick who does sterling work here rehabilitating the image of her party by projecting empathy and dedication to animal welfare. But even Pennycuick’s efforts to pass a bipartisan bill in Pennsylvania like Lucy’s law, in this case called Victoria’s law, flounder in the face of Big Pet Store’s conspiracy to maintain the cruel status quo. You could critique the film for not going a little broader in its analysis, for example, the way it shies away from really underscoring how cruelty to dogs barely differs from the cruelty experienced by other animals farmed for food, but maybe that would have diluted the documentary’s appeal and impact. Strictly as a film, Dogspiracy grates a bit with its syrupy musical bed, like one of those heart-tugging animal welfare adverts that lasts 98 minutes. But Abraham is a personable anchoring figure and the sincerity of the activists is palpable throughout.Dogspiracy is in UK cinemas from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDogsPetsAnimalsdocumentariesShareReuse this content"

His followup is a likable, admirably intentioned if slightly more predictable entertainment, in which the good guys and the bad guys are more obvious. Again it is a stop-motion animation, now set in Borneo’s rainforest, threatened by commercial exploitation and destruction.Kéria (voiced by Babette De Coster) is a teenage girl living on the edge of this rich and beautiful wilderness, with her widower dad (Benoît Poelvoorde), who is glumly employed by one of the palm-oil plantations that is eroding it. Kéria is partly ofindigenous Penan heritage, and is irritated when her Penan cousin Selaï (Martin Verset) comes to stay after his home village is wiped out. Together they get lost in the forest with a baby orangutan called Oshi which Kéria and her dad rescued when the evil planters shot its mother. Their adventures take them to the truth about Kéria’s dad and her late mother, to her Penan heritage and to a fateful confrontation with the plantation officials, who are swaggering, gun-toting bullies.Kéria and the tribespeople courageously face down these people with their blow-pipes containing unpoisoned darts (the cringing company cowards, fearing for their lives, soon lose their nerve). However, the campaign website about the Borneo rainforest which accompanies this film notably does not actually advocate direct action of this sort.Savages is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmIndigenous peoplesFamily filmsDeforestationConservationreviewsShareReuse this content"

Chances are, you’re not thrilled about it, given that anthropogenic climate change is already battering us and your morning commute is like being in a hot, jiggling sardine-tin.Yet according to Dean Spears and Michael Geruso, academics at the University of Texas, what we really need to be worried about is depopulation. The number of children being born has been declining worldwide for a couple of hundred years. More than half of countries, including India, the most populous nation in the world, now have birthrates below replacement levels. While overall population has been rising due to declining (mainly infant) mortality, we’ll hit a peak soon before falling precipitously. This apex and the rollercoaster drop that follows it is the eponymous “spike”.Most people’s lives today are better than they ever were in human history, thanks to the progress, prosperity and brilliant ideas that have come with all those people. The more of us there are, the more human ingenuity there is – “the ultimate renewable resource”. Spears and Geruso argue that future people who live alongside only a couple of billion others will have significantly worse lives than we have today. Stabilisation, not depopulation, they argue, is the right path for humanity. For that to happen, we need to be having more babies.Climate change is such an urgent issue that the upcoming turn towards depopulation will kick in far too late to make any serious impactAfter the Spike knocks down assumptions like skittles. Population fearmongers from Malthus to Paul Ehrlich are refuted, and evidence laid out to show what worldwide fertility isnotlinked to: changes in wealth, the invention of contraception or women’s rights. Nor can government policies that force people to have, or not have, children do much to change long-term trends. This is as true for China’s one-child policy as it is for Ceaușescu’s banning of abortion in Romania, which only had short-term effects. Even when non-coercive governments support parents with childcare and comparatively generous parental leave, as in Sweden, these policies have not shifted the needle. Sweden will start to shrink in 2051.The strongest commonsense belief the authors tackle is the idea that lower birthrates are a good thing because the planet is burning and more people means worse climate change. In fact, climate change is such an urgent issue that depopulation will kick in far too late to make any serious impact. Not only that, but the difference between the contribution to climate change made by the current population versus the population at the top of the spike is not significant. Depopulation won’t help the climate, then, but it will mean that there are far fewer of us left to deal with part two of cleaning up humanity’s mess on Earth: removing excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Creating a good life – whether that’s finding cures for disease or ways to reverse environmental damage – relies on the ideas, work and progress produced by large, interconnected societies.Why, then, are we increasingly choosing to have fewer children? The answer is likely to be a combination of cultural, biological, economic and social factors, but the best unifying theory in After the Spike is to be found in a satirical headlinefrom the Onion: “Study Finds American Women Delaying Motherhood Because the Whole Thing Blows”. As life on Earth has come to offer more and more rich and interesting options for how to spend our time, the opportunity cost of parenting has become increasingly less attractive. There are now more ways to make a meaningful life with fewer or no kids, even if you did want them, as gen Z is well aware.If we agree that we ought to make life good for our descendants, and that this means supporting a stable, sizeable human population, how can we achieve this? The solution proposed by Spears and Geruso is no less than a total restructuring of society around care, in which parenting is so well supported socially, culturally, economically and medically that it is seen as a joy, not a relentless struggle. Were this to have been my reality a decade ago, I might have had the football team of tumbling, laughing babies I sometimes feel a pang for. Whether humanity can achieve anything like it in time to avert depopulation seems doubtful, but if there’s one thing After the Spikeleaves us with, it’s the impulse to back ourselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Jada is a petty criminal who lives hand to mouth in a cramped 60s tower block and can’t remember how many children he has. Dan is a TV producer with a Tesla outside his mansion and who – after five years of trying and six rounds of IVF – is about to meet his first child.The pair encounter each other outside the sliding doors of Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University hospital, where Dan takes sips of cold air while he comes to terms with the wonder and terror of first-time parenthood and Jada sneaks a quick fag. Dan examines Jada’s vigilant eyes and seasonally inappropriate sportswear; Jada clocks Dan’s Rolex and works out how quickly he could take him in a fight. They bump into each other again in the lift a few days later, laying the seeds for a relationship that will reveal what divides them and what they share, building to a climax of kinship and betrayal.Since leaving his job as an A&R manager in 2002, John Niven has written novels and screenplays that mix industry satire (pop, publishing, film) with sometimes eye-popping hedonism; presumably both will feature in his next project, a 2026 play about Blur and Oasis calledThe Battle. Yet while there’s a fair bit of hard living in The Fathers, Niven’s latest also shows his softer side, as the two fortysomething Glaswegian protagonists manage domesticity. Dan obsessively childproofs his house, buying expensive baby accessories and doing his best to be the perfect dad to Tom, while Jada tries to be more present with his girlfriend Nicola and new son Jayden than he has been for his other children – for which read “not very”.For all Dan’s efforts, the mums take on the greatest share of child rearing, giving the dads space to transform their careers. Dan, bored with his wildly popular TV series McCallister (think Taggart meets Hamish MacBeth), aims to kill off the main character and write a novel. Jada, meanwhile, has a contact at Prestwick airport who can siphon off military surplus meant for Ukraine – a gig he thinks could set him up for life.Classic Scottish literary themes of duality, sentiment and booze are rarely far from the surfaceClassic Scottish literary themes of duality, sentiment and booze are rarely far from the surface, most of them viewed through the prism of class. In the hospital, Dan’s wife, Grace, has a private room and a smoothie that “cost more than wine and tasted like cut grass”. On Nicola’s bedside are a pack of cigarettes, a giant Toblerone and a bottle of Irn-Bru. In the months that come, Jayden’s sippy cup is filled with the fizzy nectar, while Nicola and Jada enjoy the occasional blow-out with beer from “PriceBeaster”, plus ecstasy and heroin. Down the road, the West End’s gentrified stretches do a steady trade in “macchiatos, pastel de natas and designer knitwear”.There’s plenty of inequality, hypocrisy and self-destruction on show, but Niven is also here for the laughs in a book that is sometimes very funny, but also happy to lean into cliche. You yearn to hear from someone who’s neither an upper-middle-class twit nor a feckless chancer, or to hear a man articulate his feelings without the spurs of alcohol or desperation. Yet Niven never forgets his characters’ humanity, and there’s some fine detail on the way, whether comic (brushing a baby’s teeth is like trying to “draw a moustache on a live eel with a felt-tip pen”) or poetic (in a brighter moment, Nicola marvels at the city, “aw golden and peach and the river was dead flat and calm and there wiznae a soul around”).As The Fathers gets going, Niven tightens his narrative like a noose. By a third of the way in, the book is veering between unputdownable and put-it-down-quick-before-something-bad-happens. Jada’s airport connection unearths a crate of pistols, which he aims to sell to a Northern Irish terrorist group, while Dan suffers a shocking disaster that flings him out of his herringbone-floored home into Jada’s world of dodgy deals, sporadic violence and daytime pints.The result is a comic melodrama that’s never dull, and a satire that hits most of its targets. After the darkness Niven lets in, the ending feels a touch glib, but the slow comradeship that grows between the two leads is charming nonetheless. The Fathers is a fine choice for anyone who likes a little grit in their holiday read.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Sure, the Shire has a hazy comfort to it, and there’s plenty of unique food to gorge on and friendly faces to meet. But once the saccharine novelty begins to wear off, this bucolic wonderland is actually a fairly dull place to live.Tales of the Shire is set in the Third Age of Middle-earth, years before the events of The Lord of the Rings. As such, there are no Nazgûls or Uruk-hai – instead the “action” centres on the quaint town of Bywater, whose most pressing issue is its municipal status. Here, you play as a recent transplant from the nearby hamlet of Bree, who gets swept up in the process of turning the town into an official village by building infrastructure and befriending locals one odd job and home-cooked meal at a time.View image in fullscreenHazy comfort … Tales of the Shire.Photograph: Private DivisionNaturally this high-fantasy life simulator houses plenty of Tolkienian paraphernalia. You can find the Three-Farthing Stone nestled atop a hillside, and walk through the homely Green Dragon Inn. Plus, there are plenty of familiar surnames bobbing around, from Tooks to Cottons and Brandybucks – heck, even Gandalf pops his head in every so often. A chunky art style frames these iconic spaces and characters, coating the world with an appropriately twee veneer. It’s not a huge map to explore, but what’s there is tenderly dressed, with hanging washing swaying in the breeze, dinky lanterns, and roaming wildlife aplenty.As an upstart Hobbit, your primary goal is to feed and be fed, with all aspects of day-to-day life revolving around this all-important activity. In the wild you can find veggies, nuts and fruits to forage, and the rivers are home to plenty of fishing spots where you earn your catch of the day. There are also seasonal seedlings to purchase and plant, as well as artisanal shop stalls offering speciality items such as flour. With each day running on a timer, the major source of friction is in how efficiently you can dash about and hoover up the goods before bedtime.View image in fullscreenFishing spots aplenty … Tales of the ShireIt’s a well-trodden loop familiar to anyone who has played rural life sims such as Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon. But here, the steady flow of button clicks and undemanding chores operates more successfully as a sleep-inducing mental message than any form of compelling challenge.If you can brave the repetition and invest in your relationships with others, the game begins to open up, providing a slew of formulaic but appetising skill paths to rank up. Collecting ingredients is only half the story; you’ll also need to cook them up into satisfying bundles to serve at extravagant Breakfasts, Second Breakfasts, Elevenses, and so on. Combining elements of Cooking Mama and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tales of the Shire asks you to balance culinary profiles and textures to curate the perfect plate. To do this, you’ll chop, mix and sauté ingredients while consulting a flavour compass in the bottom corner of your screen to ensure your food is as delicious as possible. Eventually, by feeding the right folks, your kitchen expands and there are more opportunities available to get you into the Middle-earth Michelin Guide.But beyond its overly familiar mechanics, Tales of the Shire’s most pressing problem is how naive and placid it all feels. When vague interpersonal issues arise between your new friends, they’re always resolved in a swift, often mundane manner. Much of your time is spent running between frustrated halflings as they burden you with their petty dissatisfactions.Not all cosy games need to evoke hard emotions. However, it does feel like a disservice to the emotionally complex source material not to explore the richness of the world at large – especially when dry humour, tragedy and finely drawn social structures are what make Tolkien’s writing so powerful. Without any challenging quandaries to pull at your heartstrings, the promising atmosphere in Tales of the Shire is overwhelmed by endless fetch quests. Diehard Tolkienites and Stardew Valley lifers may be better off looking elsewhere for their cosy thrills.Tales of the Shire is out now, £34.99.Explore more on these topicsGamesPCNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5XboxreviewsShareReuse this content"

Why has this happened and where will it lead?Rick LaneTue 29 Jul 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 06.35 EDTShareIn the last two weeks, thousands of “adult only” and “not safe for work” games have disappeared fromSteamanditch.io– two of the most prominent distribution platforms for PC video games – as they scrambled to comply with stricter rules mandated by payment processors such as MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal.These rules were established after a campaign by the organisationCollective Shout, which urged payment processors to stop facilitating payments to platforms hosting “rape, incest and child sexual abuse-themed games”. But the new rules have affected a far broader range of games – including some award-winning titles.How did this start?On 16 July, Valve, the developer of Steam, updated itsrules and guidelinesregarding the games and software that can be distributed on the platform. The rules, which already prohibited “nude or sexually explicit images of real people” and “adult content that isn’t appropriately labelled or age gated” were expanded to include “content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors” including “certain kinds of adult content”.In a statement to PC Gameron 18 July, Valve confirmed it was “retiring” several games from the Steam store due to these new rules. It did not clarify which games were being removed, nor what “kinds of adult content” are now deemed unsuitable.A week later, itch.ioissued a statementexplaining it had also come under “scrutiny” from payment processors, and as such was “deindexing” (removing from search results) all games labelled “NFSW” as it undertook a “comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors.” Unlike Valve, itch.io specifically referenced Collective Shout as the cause of the renewed scrutiny.What is Collective Shout?Collective Shout is an Australian organisation thatdescribes itselfas “a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls”.In April, itsuccessfully petitionedto have the gameNo Mercy– which featured depictions of “incest”, “blackmail” and “unavoidable non-consensual sex” – removed from Steam and itch.io. After this, the grouppublished an open letterto payment processors claiming to have “discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse on both Steam and itch.io”, and requesting payment processors “demonstrate corporate social responsibility and immediately cease processing payments on Steam and itch.io”.After Steam altered its rules, Collective Shoutclaimed credit for the change, stating that more than 1,000 of its supporters had called or emailed payment processors to demand they “stop facilitating payments and profiting from these games”.Why payment processors?Like many online retailers,Steamand itch.io rely on payment processors to enable users to make purchases on their platforms. As such, these companies hold considerable power and can influence what products – regardless of their legality – are bought, sold or published.In recent years, payment processors have become increasingly strict about transactions relating to adult content. In 2021, the subscription-based video platform OnlyFans, widely used by adult content creators,announced it would ban adult materialfrom the site after pressure from payment processors – though this plan wassubsequently abandoned. Later that year, Mastercard imposed a new policy regulating adult content sellers – one criticised by theAmerican Civil Liberties Unionas being restrictive to free speech and potentially harmful to sex workers – and an example of what is known asfinancial censorship.View image in fullscreenThe award-winning Consume Me is among the games affected.Photograph: HexecutableWhich games have been affected?It isn’t clear how many games have been “retired” from Steam due to the new rules, but multiple games thatdepicted incest fantasieshave been removed. Itch.io, as mentioned, has deindexed most games labelled NSFW. According to the games industry newsletterGame File, more than 20,000 games have been removed from itch.io’s NSFW category since 16 July.But these include games that explore queer identity and sexuality, such as Radiator 2 by Robert Yang, a former teacher at New York University’s Game Center. And the rules have also hit games that do not depict sex in any way at all. These includeLast Call, a game about surviving domestic violence by award-winning game designerNina Freeman, andConsume Me, a game about disordered eating which has alsowon numerous industry awards.How has the games industry responded?Many developers have decried the power that payment processors wield over what games are bought and sold, and how that power can be exerted indirectly by campaign groups such as Collective Shout.In a Bluesky post, Yang described Collective Shout and payment processors as “waging culture war against LGBTQ people and sexual expression”, while Consume Me’s developers toldWiredthat it is “completely unacceptable that payment processors are conducting censorship-by-fiat and systematically locking adult content creators out of platforms”.Achange.orgpetition calling for payment processors and activist groups to “stop controlling what we can watch, read, or play” was launched on 17 July. The petition claims “MasterCard and Visa are interfering with legal entertainment”, and demands “the right to choose the stories we enjoy without moral policing”. So far it has accrued more than 150,000 signatures. Meanwhile, gamers and developers are sharing the phone numbers of major payment companies and encouraging people to call and complain.What happens next?It is hard to know for sure. With sustained consumer pressure, payment processors may reconsider their position, but it may also be challenging for anti-censorship voices to muster political support due to prevailing legislative winds surrounding online adult content. The UK this monthenacted stricter regulations regarding age verificationfor internet users wanting to access adult content, while the EU hasdrafted guidelinesfor similar systems.Consequently, it is likely that the new rules will remain in place at Steam and itch.io, at least for the immediate future. But the fallout has drawn attention to the power that payment processors wield, and the lack of clarity surrounding their rules. Because of this, they may tread more cautiously when responding to pressure from advocacy groups in the future.Explore more on these topicsGamesSteamPCexplainersShareReuse this content"

It is an against-the-odds story of the first all-female crew to attempt an ocean race – the Round the World Whitbread race of 1989-1990 – even as a sexist press scoffs at them.Skipper, Tracy (based on Tracy Edwards, played by Chelsea Halfpenny), leads the eight-strong team, singing all the while. The production’s sails are raised in an opening scene featuring a projection of waves (good work by video designer Jack Baxter), the set itself the boat’s helm.But the endeavour quickly runs aground. The problems are multifold: the songs composed by Carmel Dean contain plenty of harmonising but they are hollering in volume, blandly hymnal, often unmelodious bar the odd, tuneful number such as Approaching Australia. Lyrics by Mindi Dickstein are strained and expositional, as is her book. Characters speak in unconvincing ways. “I really need a scoop,” a journalist tells the team as he interviews them. “We’ve been at this for six months and no one wants to back a female team,” Tracy tells her friend, Jo (Naomi Alade), as if she doesn’t know this fact.The songs repeatedly, needlessly, remind us that these arewomenat sea. Alade is a strong singer but some others wobble.View image in fullscreen‘I really need a scoop’ … Maiden Voyage.Photograph: Pamela RaithUnder the direction of Tara Overfield Wilkinson, the action on the yacht feels beached, from interpersonal tensions, too briefly brushed across, to the drama of the competition. At the team’s most treacherous flashpoints in the water, the ensemble do little more than sway or pull at rigging. It’s way too tame, you never feel the danger.Characters remain frustratingly unknown and actors appear wooden, perhaps as a result.The team is differentiated by little more than their accents and nationalities (nine in total, we are told). Even Tracy seems barely coloured in, with Halfpenny wearing a one-size-fits-all look of concern through the show.Her friendship with King Hussein of Jordan (Shahaf Ifhar) and his patronage is under-explained too. He bestows a Yoda-like wisdom but what does he know about competitive yachting? There is reductiveness in his portrayal: thickly accented, he speaks of “my people” and compares Tracy’s endeavour to Bedouin life.Meanwhile, the cartoonishly drawn all-male press who brand the team as “tarts” and “cows”, sound like they have had elocution lessons from the Artful Dodger – and borrowed some of his wardrobe too.The cast changes into swimming costumes to celebrate the team’s triumphant moment in the contest. It is based in fact but rather than emanating empowerment, it is discomforting, with sexist newspaper headlines projected behind them.All of it is off-kilter, over-simplified, and rather too premature a production to stage.AtSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, until 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageMusicalsTheatreSailingreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the album turns 50, does the musician – who went on to tour with Sting and Eric Clapton – have any regrets?Tue 29 Jul 2025 07.31 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 10.26 EDTShareIt was a late spring night in 1971 and David Sancious had walked from his home on E Street in Belmar, New Jersey to the Upstage club in Asbury Park. He was 17 and he had been playing piano and guitar with local bands for four years. “I had walked to the Upstage because I wanted to play,” he says, “and as I’m coming in I see Garry Tallent, a bass player who I already knew from other gigs.” Tallent was with a fellow New Jersey musician, a 21-year-old guitarist calledBruce Springsteen, “the local guitar hero”, says Sancious, “very famous locally.” Springsteen told Sancious he was having a jam session and invited him to play. “I said: ‘Absolutely.’”The band played until 5am. As they were walking out of the club, Springsteen told Sancious he was breaking up his current band Steel Mill to form a new one: would he be interested in joining? Sancious said yes. He went on to record with Springsteen on his first three albums, but left the group before Born to Run transformed Springsteen and his bandmates into superstars. As that album approaches its 50th anniversary next month, I have wondered whether Sancious regrets walking away.View image in fullscreenDavid Sancious with Sting at the 1993 MTV video music awards in Los Angeles.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, IncHe was five years old when his family moved into 1105 E Street in Belmar. The previous owners had left their piano in the house. “The day we moved in, my mum sat down and started playing Chopin and Beethoven,” he says. “It blew my mind.” Sancious started playing piano and later guitar and was in local bands in his early teens, giving illegal underage performances at local bars. “The police used to raid these places and card everyone,” he says. “One night I’m on stage with Bruce and the cops are hanging out at the front door.” The band hatched a plan to get Sancious off stage, sandwiched between Springsteen, saxophonist Clarence Clemons and two others. “I was in the middle moving slowly, trying not to draw any attention.”Sancious and his bandmates sometimes rehearsed in his mother’s garage, but mostly in a surfboard factory owned by an early manager of Springsteen’s. “You don’t know enough to be self-conscious because you haven’t had that much experience yet,” he says about those early days. Sancious contributed keyboards, piano and delicate jazz textures that enriched the early E Street sound on songs such as New York City Serenade and Incident on 57th Street. “The thing about Bruce is that musically he was always open to a good idea. If I came up with a certain chord or inversion, he was very open to that.”Around 1974, Sancious and Springsteen were back in Belmar, by Sancious’s childhood home. “We were coming home from somewhere,” he says, “turning on to E Street from 12th Avenue. There were these white obelisks with the street names painted on them. Bruce saw it and just said, ‘E Street … E Street Band.’” How did it feel to have his address inspire this iconic band name? “Pretty cool – quite an honour.”I looked at Springsteen and thought: as soon as everybody finds out about this guy, he’s going to blow up. It’s going to go crazySancious worked on Springsteen’s debut Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ and its followup The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, and also toured with the band. “We didn’t have private planes back then,” he says. “We had a station wagon, three of the guys in the front and three in the back. You’re doing everything with these people. Eating, laughing, crying with them if something really bad happens. It’s a great life.”He was the first Black member of what became the E Street Band – Clemons joined shortly after. “You are constantly, completely, 100% aware of being Black – full stop – in any situation,” he says. He recalls one incident. “I was at the beach and there were two guys making threatening gestures and saying inappropriate racial stuff. Clarence comes along and sees what’s going on. He sat down right next to me and then Bruce comes walking by. Bruce found a piece of driftwood and he kept hitting it in his hand like he was saying: ‘I’m not going to let you hurt our friend.’”View image in fullscreenDavid Sancious (second from right) on stage with Peter Gabriel (second from left) on Gabriel’s This Way Up Tour, Ahoy, Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1987.Photograph: Rob Verhorst/RedfernsSancious continued playing with Springsteen but during breaks from touring he was working on his own music. When CBS heard his demo they offered him a three-year contract that would launch his solo career. It was an offer he couldn’t refuse, and shortly after playing on a song for Springsteen’s third album – a little number called Born to Run – Sancious left the E Street Band.How did it feel, I ask, to see Born to Run become a massive hit album, and Springsteen on the covers of Time and Newsweek simultaneously? “I felt very happy for him, honestly,” he says. “I knew it was going to happen for him.” How did he know? “We did shows in Texas in 1974 and the crowd went nuts. We finished the show and the audience wouldn’t leave. Bruce used to end the set with a song called For You that he would play by himself on piano and we would go off stage and watch. I remember standing there looking at him and thinking as soon as everybody finds out about this guy he’s going to blow up. It’s going to go crazy.”In 1975 came the release not only of Born to Run but also Sancious’s first solo album Forest of Feelings – a fusion of jazz, rock, funk and classical that suggested he had travelled far from E Street. Of the numerous albums that followed, both solo and with his band Tone, the most successful “got to No 78 in the Top 100 for one week. But my sense of self as an artist isn’t diminished because I didn’t sell a million records. That’s a narrow definition of success and I don’t resonate with that.”View image in fullscreenDavid Sancious performs at the Sellersville Theater in Pennsylvania on his Open Secret tour, May 2025.Photograph: Avraham BankIn the early 80s, Sancious paused making his own music. “The phone kept ringing with artists asking me to go on tour,” he says. “I toured with Peter Gabriel and then Sting and later Eric Clapton and Santana. They have more in common than you might think: none of them had a plan B, they all did it out of a love for music.” Sancious got to play the lead guitar riff to Clapton’s Layla as well as the song’s final piano coda when he toured with him – “such a thrill because I love that song and I love his playing”.Sancious didn’t return to the studio until 2000; he continues to record and tour today. He always remained in contact with Springsteen – he joined him on stage during the Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and played on 1992’s Human Touch album and 2019’s Western Stars. He was part of the live band that backed Springsteen when he performed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in November 2022. “We love each other,” he says. “We love working together and whenever the situation allows we do it and we get fantastic results to this day.”On the night I speak to Sancious, Springsteen and the E Street Band are on stage in front of 60,000 people in Berlin. It feels appropriate to ask: with hindsight, would he have still walked away? “There is a whole life I would have missed out on,” he says. “Working with all these other artists and making my own music. If I had to do it again would I do the same thing? Absolutely. Because I didn’t walk away from anything – I walked towards something.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockBruce SpringsteenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He played on the football and wrestling teams in high school, nursed ambitions to be a plastic surgeon,modelled for J Crew, became a leading avant-garde artist, spent more than a decade in a relationship with the Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk and set up a giant clock outside his studio to count down the first Donald Trump US presidency.‘Stress and failure’: Matthew Barney on his film about the sports accident that traumatised AmericaRead moreNo one explores the violence in America’s source code quite like Barney, who since the 1990s has mounteda series of epic projectsexploring the subject via references to classical mythology, modern history, sport, human anatomy and popular culture.On 30 July he is headlining the Aspen Art Museum’s inauguralAir 2025 festivalin Colorado with TACTICAL parallax, a live performance in a riding arena repurposed from the former drill hall of the 10th Mountain Division infantry.Barney describes it as his western. The website of the festivalwarns patrons: “The Performance will involve the use of animals and loud sounds and may involve, but is not limited to bright lights, unexpected visuals and occurrences. The Performance may include the shooting of blanks from a firearm.”Barney is best known forThe Cremaster Cycle (1994–2002), a series of five feature-length films and related sculptures and drawings that blend references to the human reproductive cycle with mythology and surrealism.More recently, in 2018, he deliveredRedoubt, a two-hour, dialogue-free film set in Idaho’s rugged Sawtooth Mountains that loosely adapts the myth of Diana, goddess of the hunt, and her ritualistic pursuit of a wolf.His 2023 workSecondaryis a five-channel video installation that explores the spectacle of violence in American football, centring on a traumatic 1978 NFL preseason game incident in which the Oakland Raiders defensive back Jack Tatum’s hit left the New England Patriots receiver Darryl Stingley paralysed for life. The collision was replayed frequently on TV, impressing itself on the then 11-year-old Barney.“Redoubt is more to do with the so-called wilderness in America and the violence that lives in the landscape and how that plays out in wildlife and landscape management, especially in the mountain states,” Barney, 58, says in a phone interview from central Idaho. “Secondary is more about structural violence within American football and the pageantry of violence in American contact sports.”View image in fullscreenRehearsal at McCabe Ranch for TACTICAL parallax by Matthew Barney.Photograph: Photo: Maria Baranova-Suzuki. Courtesy the artist and the Aspen Art MuseumBoth films were rooted in Barney’s biography. He spent his formative years in Idaho, a conservative state of rugged landscapes in the north-western US, and regards it as an important influence on his art. “The reintroduction of wolves in central America happened throughout my adolescence. It was a political drama that played out in Idaho and Wyoming during those years.“It’s something that I carried with me for a number of years and wanted to approach in an artwork in a more personal way. They are both very personal narratives and they’re histories that have played out publicly with quite a lot of media coverage.”No less important was Barney’s time as a young player of American football, absorbing the ethos of the nation’s most popular sport, a symphony of helmets-and-pads and high-impact collisions that can result in head trauma and spinal injuries.“A lot of the art that I’ve made has been influenced by my experiences as an athlete and particularly in the blood sports,” he reflects. “My choice of the history ofJack TatumandDarryl Stingleyin Secondary was both about looking at a very specific memory that I had as a child, playing and seeing that event occur, and to experience the aftermath of that in the American media. But there’s also a way in which I wanted to look at my own legacy through a different lens.”In TACTICAL parallax Barney combines Redoubt and Secondary in new and tantalising ways, blending characters, stories, movement and music from the two films or running them side by side. Players, referees, hunters and hunted are thrown together to draw a line between American football and western expansionism.He explains: “TACTICAL parallax, by combining these two narratives, is very much about trying to locate ways in which that violence is baked into the national identity, which I think has to do with the initial settling of the United States.“In that sense TACTICAL parallax is a western and, though it’s combining these vocabularies of American football and contemporary hunting, it is also about the histories of westward expansion and the settling of America and the violence that lives in the landscape from that.”He adds: “Football is a reification of war. It structurally is like a medieval war and it’s fetishised in that way in the culture. The American mythologies of war include that initial colonising of the west.”The piece will be performed in a historic drill hall that was originally part of Camp Hale, a second world war military training facility at 9,000ft elevation where soldiers trained in deep snow. The drill hall was later disassembled and moved to its current location as a barn on a working cattle ranch.View image in fullscreenRehearsal at McCabe Ranch for TACTICAL parallax by Matthew Barney.Photograph: Photo: Maria Baranova-Suzuki. Courtesy the artist and the Aspen Art Museum“It was a starting point for the development of TACTICAL parallax: the history of the structure within the alpine landscape and the way that it is both an athletic facility and a military facility started the development of the work of combining the vocabularies from Secondary and Redoubt.“One of the things that’s unique about this project is its specificity to its environment, the way that it’s situated within this historic structure and the Rocky Mountain landscape. It has the opportunity to have a more visceral relationship to its content than the films have had. Beyond the eccentric combination of visual vocabulary, the site specificity is quite special.”Barney’s father worked in catering atBoise State Universityand his mother, an abstract painter, introduced him to contemporary art during visits to New York after their divorce when he was 12. He attendedYale Universityon a football scholarship, initially studying pre-med before switching to art and graduating in 1989.He reflects: “When you grow up around art, it normalises it. Particularly in America, art isn’t part of normal culture the way that it can be in other parts of the world where it’s been part of the cultural dialogue for a much longer time. I definitely feel like I benefited from having it normalised in my life at an early age.”As a multidisciplinary artist, Barney blurs the lines between sculpture, installation, film, performance and drawing. The Guardian critic Jonathan Jones described the Cremaster Cycle as “one of the most imaginative and brilliant achievements in the history of avant-garde cinema”. Others find his work harder to digest.“There’s definitely been a lot of division in the reception and that always seems right to me. There are deliberate provocations in the work and the work isn’t being made as a form of entertainment. I’m not interested in participating in consensus culture. The way I understand art to function and the function that it carries out in culture is about provoking something that’s harder to understand.”Would he describe his work as political? “All art has a politic and sometimes it’s more legible and sometimes it’s less legible. I’ve made work that has a more legible politic and then I’ve made work that that’s much more about an internal set of dynamics. I’m interested in both of those approaches.“It probably means it has a smaller ‘p’ for me; it’s more intrinsic in the work and less explicit. But that said, these last two projects, Readout and Secondary, do connect to a more legible politic and they are also very much about my own personal experience with those set of histories and events.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Barney in 2006.Photograph: The Weinstein Company/Sportsphoto/AllstarOne of Barney’s more legible acts was to place agiant digital clockabove New York’s East River that counted down the days and hours until the end of Trump’s first term in the White House. The clock was then reprogrammed to become part of Secondary as a stadium clock ticking off the minutes of the quarter and final seconds of the game.“That was my studio and that’s where Secondary was filmed and exhibited for the first time. It was right on the East River, directly opposite the United Nations. In Trump’s first term – however I felt myself – it felt like a civic service that needed to be performed, given the location of the studio and the way that the city felt.”Is Barney now counting down the days and hours until the end of Trump’s second term? “Mentally, yes,” he replies, leaving it at that.Trump 2.0 is different in many ways from the first version. One of them is a late life blossoming of interest in arts and culture. He fired the bosses of theJohn F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, installing himself as chairman and a loyalist as president, then took in a performance of the musical Les Miserables. He ordered theSmithsonian Institutionto purge “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” from its museums and forced out the director of the National Portrait Gallery.Robert De Niro, Pedro Pascal andBruce Springsteenhave been outspoken in their opposition to Trump, though Hollywood awards ceremonies were notably low on political content this year. Barney believes that artists should take a stand. “That means something different to every artist but, yes, for whatever that means to them, yes,” he says. “We should all be doing that. I certainly don’t have any answers for how this is going to play out in the next couple of years. It’s a scary time.”Air 2025: Life as No One Knows It takes place at AspenArtMuseum from 29 July to 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsMatthew BarneyPerformance artArtinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He was an enigma. The songs that made him famous were mostly written and recorded before 1960, after which he returned to teaching mathematics and tried to behave as though no one had heard of him.His songs were by turns gloriously vulgar, ludicrously macabre or ferociously political:I Got It from Agnes– “it” being a sexually transmitted disease;I Hold Your Hand in Mine, in which the held hand is no longer attached to a body; andWe Will All Go Together When We Go, perhaps the best anti-nuclear weapons song ever written, praising “Universal bereavement / An inspiring achievement”.Others were wonderfully clever games with words and music, including The Elements (1959), which names all the chemical elements, set to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan’s I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General.He began writing songs as a graduate student at Harvard, where he had enrolled at 15 and had taken a first-class maths degree at 18. He sang them to his friends and soon people started asking him to perform at parties. “My songs spread slowly,” he said. “Like herpes, rather than Ebola.”The politics and rudeness of his material put off the record companies, so in 1953 he paid for 400 discs to be cut of a record called Songs of Tom Lehrer, having worked out that if he sold them all, he would break even. He sold many more than that: he had to keep getting them cut.View image in fullscreenTom Lehrer performing in California in 1965.Photograph: Ted Streshinsky photographic archive/Getty ImagesHis university idyll was broken by a period with the Atomic Energy Commission at Los Alamos, and two years in the army. “I dodged the draft for as long as anybody was shooting at anybody,” he said. “I waited until everything was calm and then surrendered to the draft board.”Afterwards he wrote the songIt Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier, about strange and disturbing army folk: “Now Fred’s an intellectual, brings a book to every meal. / He likes the deep philosophers, like Norman Vincent Peale.” Peale was a famous evangelical Christian of even more than usual banality and intolerance, and alsothe Trump family pastor, who gave the US president his ethical base.After the army, Lehrer returned to studying and singing in night clubs in New York and other cities, while his reputation grew in a samizdat sort of way – record companies ignored him and newspapers sneered, but his growing army of fans loved him. He undertook a series of concert tours, including in the UK, and produced another album, More of Tom Lehrer, in 1959, with a live concert version, An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer, also released.Then, in 1960, he stopped, and that was almost that, except that in 1964 he was lured back to write some songs for the American version of That Was the Week That Was. During the 1970s he contributed songs to the children’s educational television programme The Electric Company and, two years later, appeared in episodes of the Frost Report at the BBC.There were occasional songs after that –(I’m Spending) Hanukkah in Santa Monicain 1990 is probably the best known (“Amid the California flora / I’ll be lighting my menorah, /Like a baby in his cradle / I’ll be playing with my dreidl”). In 1980, the British producer Cameron Mackintosh persuaded him to agree to a revue of his songs called Tomfoolery, which started life at the Criterion theatre in London. But Lehrer neither appeared in it nor wrote new material for it. He was done with performing.Born in New York, Tom was the elder son of James Lehrer, a prosperous necktie manufacturer, and his wife, Anna (nee Waller). He learned to play the piano, fell in love with the Broadway of Danny Kaye and Cole Porter, and attended private schools, which discovered they had a mathematics prodigy on their hands.So he went to Harvard, and took a master’s in 1947, the year after his degree, before settling down to the life of a graduate student, which he enjoyed. He registered for a doctorate but never finished it.Over the years he gave various reasons for stopping song-writing and performing. “What’s the point of having laurels if you can’t rest on them?” he asked. He said he never supposed he might be doing some good, and quoted Peter Cook, who talked about the satirical Berlin kabaretts of the 30s, “which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the second world war”.Things that were once funny now scared him. “I’m not tempted to write a song about George W Bush,” he said of the then US president. “I don’t want to satirise George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporise them.” He said that satire died when they gaveHenry Kissingerthe Nobel peace prize, but that was not his reason for giving it up.However, if you listen to his students, you come away thinking the biggest factor was that he loved teaching and wanted to spend his life doing it. He taught on the US east coast until 1972, when he moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz, where for almost 30 years he taught two classes: The American Musical and The Nature of Math.The American fiction writer Greg Neri wrote: “He was very humble, his fame meant nothing to him, the past he’d fob off as nothing more than messing around with satire. But get him talking about the American musical and he was off and running … He was truly delighted to see a play get on its feet and the day we performed it, he was all grins … He was extremely kind and patient with students.”Other former students reported that you did not mention his career as a performer, or ask about his personal life: it was an unspoken rule in his class.There is a video he recorded in 1997 called The Professor’s Song.One of the songs, to another Gilbert and Sullivan tune, begins “If you give me your attention I will tell you what I am. / I’m a brilliant mathematician, also something of a ham.” But these were private songs for his students. He had turned his back on fame and fortune. And the most dramatic illustration of that came in 2020 when he announced that his lyrics and sheet music were now available for anyone to use or perform without paying royalties.I benefited from this when writing a play called Tom Lehrer isTeachingMath and Doesn’t Want to Talk to You, and including many of his greatest songs. It was performed last year at Upstairs at the Gatehouse in Highgate, north London, and is due to return this November at the OSO Arts Centre, south of the river in Barnes. “Help yourselves, and don’t send me any money,” he wrote on his website. So I did.Thomas Andrew Lehrer, singer, songwriter, satirist and mathematician, born 9 April 1928; died 26 July 2025Explore more on these topicsMusicComedyTeachingMathematicsobituariesShareReuse this content"

Three years and 53 countries later, he has more than rebuilt itTue 29 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShareOn the eve of his 30th birthday, Bobby Bolton found himself living in a mouldy caravan on a derelict farm in Hertfordshire. His relationship of 11 years had just ended, the construction business he had spent five years building was collapsing and he only had a few hundred pounds left in the bank. “I had moved out of the flat I shared with my ex, borrowed money from her to buy this caravan and had such low self-esteem about the direction my life and career was headed that I isolated myself,” he says. “I couldn’t socialise and I was stooping so much when I walked that I felt myself getting back issues. My mum thought I was suicidal.”She pleaded with him to come home and live with her in Wigan, but Bolton refused. “It felt like the ultimate defeat.” He compromised on a weekend visit instead. Driving the 200 miles north, Bolton soon ended up in the pub with old school friends. Several pints in, he saw something that would change his life.“This battered old Land Rover Defender filled with kit pulled up outside the pub and a couple got out. The man had a big shaggy beard and the woman had wild hair and they both had this look of adventure in their eyes,” he says. “The Land Rover had a bumper sticker on it that read ‘Family Expedition’, and I suddenly realised what I needed was to get out on the road like them. I wanted to rediscover my purpose, and that boiled down to three questions: working out where I wanted to live, who I wanted to live with and what I wanted to do.”View image in fullscreenHigh life … Bolton with dogs Red and Rubia in Kyrgyzstan.Photograph: Courtesy of Bobby Bolton and Marie DelevalThree years later, Bolton has travelled through three continents, 53 countries and more than 42,000 miles in an adapted four-wheeler MAN truck. Along the way he has amassed more than 380,000 followers onhis Instagram account– and fallen in love again. He and his fiancee, Marie Deleval, are now back in Wigan to plan their wedding and next adventure: a journey through Mongolia and Siberia in a converted eight-wheel-drive military truck. “I ended up answering all those questions: I want to live in the truck, I want to live with Marie and I want to be an overlander, exploring the world,” Bolton says. “Throughout this journey I came up with a kind of mantra that sums it all up: ‘Don’t let who you are today stop you from being who you could be tomorrow.’”That platitude, crafted to be overlaid on a dramaticInstagramimage of a sunset, is typical of Bolton’s attitude to life: no matter how tough things might be, you can always change. It was an impulse that set him on his journey and it is seat-of-the-pants impulsiveness that has seen him through to the other side. “We approach everything with a big smile and plucky British attitude,” he says. “Whether it’s policemen, border guards or even terrorists stopping you on the road, you give a big thumbs-up and that’s how you talk your way out.”Speaking from his mum’s front room, Bolton has lost the layer of dirt that he often sports on Instagram. He has a dark tan, a trimmed beard and eyes that look more tired than full of adventure. Next to him on the sofa is Deleval, the 30-year-old French woman he met in the second week of his travels and who agreed to travel the world with him on their third date. Her bleached blond hair is tied into a messy bun and she sports the same tan and somewhat glazed look. The couple have been off the road for all of 72 hours and even over video call you can sense their eagerness to get moving again. “It’s amazing to be able to do laundry and have home-cooked food – we both smell good and look cleaner,” Bolton laughs. “But we will get itchy feet. We have a taste for it now and we’re looking forward to the next trip.”Bolton describes himself as an “overlander” rather than “traveller” or “backpacker” – the distinction being the independent, uncurated nature of the experience. “Rather than a backpacker who is constrained by a hostel or a traveller who might be going to tourist spots, we go on dirt tracks and back roads, travelling through society,” he says. “We get an insight into people’s lives and might reach places where they’ve never seen a foreigner before. You have interactions.”View image in fullscreenBolton in Cumbria.Photograph: Jack Boniface/The GuardianThose “interactions” form the basis of Bolton’s new book, Truck It! In a fast-paced conversational style, full of that “plucky British attitude”, Bolton recounts his journey from relationship and business breakdowns to selling all his possessions to buy his truck, meeting Deleval in France, then driving together with their dogs through eastern Europe, central Asia, Russia and south Asia to end up in Thailand.Along the way, the couple encounter regular setbacks, from being shaken down by Russian police, to fighting with an Azerbaijani man at a border crossing and being held at gunpoint by the Taliban inAfghanistan. Each time, Bolton faces his problems with relentless optimism and a naivety that will be read as either charming or irritating. He has to research the history of Russian-occupied territories in Georgia on his phone while wondering why the locals seem suspicious at the sight of trucking tourists, for instance; in Afghanistan he fires off a pistol round with a group of young men who turn out to be Islamists, before being questioned by the Taliban.“People had repeatedly told us that we were taking unnecessary risk by going through Afghanistan. Our conversations had always concluded with ‘We’ll be all right,’” he writes. And miraculously they are. At times Truck It! reads like Top Gear without the introspection.Was the reality more messy? “Nothing will top those lads coming up to us with a pistol when we were parked in Afghanistan, firing off a round into the distance and then adding me on Facebook, which made me realise they’re part of a terrorist group,” he says, shaking his head. “Then, when the Taliban arrived, we thought we might get our heads chopped off.”Deleval adds that Afghanistan did have other challenges. “I couldn’t do anything; you don’t talk to people if you’re a woman there,” she says. “I was completely ignored. We had two separate experiences.”View image in fullscreen‘You can reinvent yourself’ … Bolton maps out his next steps.Photograph: Jack Boniface/The GuardianMoney is another issue that is more complex than it might seem on the surface of Bolton’s travelogue. He left the UK with “just £600”, he writes, and it was an impromptu decision to start filming his travels on Instagram that financed the rest of the trip. Once his first two videos explaining his plans to truck the world went viral, sponsors offered to pay for his Eurotunnel trip or provide him with free gear and cash to produce branded content. “I never really had any social media before and it’s actually been one of the hardest bits of the trip because it can invade our privacy,” Bolton says. “Me and Marie met as an organic couple but then it was a shock to realise that she had to be on camera and be part of capturing this journey. I never plan the content, so it’s on from the first thing in the morning to the last thing at night, and it can be hard to keep things just for us. Still, without it we wouldn’t be able to keep going. It’s a necessary evil.”Bolton’s romance with Deleval is one of the more miraculous and charming episodes of the journey. While sitting with his dog, Red, on a hill just outside Saint-Tropez only weeks into his travels, Bolton saw Deleval running with her dog, Rubia, and was captivated. He plucked up the courage to say hello, and later Deleval found his Instagram and messaged asking to meet up. After two more dates, during which she revealed she had a boyfriend who needed dumping, she agreed to join him on his odyssey.“Often you hear about couples going travelling and it breaks down because it’s so intense – but it just worked,” Bolton says. “Our 4 metre by 4 metre cab was our home and it really felt easy because we like the same adventures. It supercharged the relationship and the hardest thing is actually being back staying with the in-laws because home is in the truck.”Aside from the couple he saw outside the pub, Bolton describes his parents as his biggest inspirations for the nomadic lifestyle he has now built. His dad was a truck driver and taught him from an early age how to tinker with engines and make repairs, while his maternal grandfather was in the merchant navy and used to regale the grandkids with his travels. “Both my parents are baby boomers and all they did was work,” he says. “They just want us to enjoy our lives and see the world. The hardest part was saying goodbye to them at the beginning but they’re really proud of what we’ve done.”View image in fullscreenBolton and Deleval in Pakistan.Photograph: Courtesy of Bobby Bolton and Marie DelevalDeleval, meanwhile, says that it was her mother who convinced her to go off with Bolton despite barely knowing him. “I had backpacked in South America for a year and a half and my parents knew that I loved travelling,” she says. “I told my mum and she said: ‘You have to go.’ That was that.”While Bolton’s parents have visited the couple on their journey, his dad even driving the truck for a while, there have been downsides to being away for so long. “The last time I went to see my nan, dementia had fully taken hold and she didn’t recognise me, which was tough,” he says. “But my grandparents on the other side of the family have gotten an iPad to follow us on Instagram and it’s given them a new lease of life. I think it’s brought a lot of the family together.”That iPad will be in frequent use as Bolton and Deleval are planning another trip, this time to the US via Saudi Arabia and Siberia – with a stop in October to tie the knot on the Saint-Tropez hill where they first met. “I began thinking I would drive to Australia and that’s still the finish line, but we have a longer-term plan to reach there now,” Bolton says, smiling. “We’ve even talked about starting a family on the road. I just want to inspire people to go after life like we have, whether that means travelling or something else. You don’t have to go from stacking shelves to climbing Everest, but you can reinvent yourself.”Truck It!: The Drive Around the World That Saved My Life, by Bobby Bolton, is published by Macmillan (£20).

They speak about the joys – and burdens – of caring for their grandkids at a time when they could be taking it easierEllie Violet BramleyTue 29 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 04.26 EDTShareWhen I first call Rita Labiche-Robinson, a 59-year-old retired project manager, she can’t chat because she is with her nine-year-old granddaughter. Rita looks after Nia two days a week – Thursdays and Fridays. Today is a Tuesday, but they live together, along with Nia’s mum, and Labiche-Robinson is too in the thick of it to talk.The three of them have been in the same home since March last year, when Labiche-Robinson’s daughter and granddaughter moved back from Canada. “While they’re waiting to be housed, they’re staying with me,” she says. On her designated days, she gets Nia up and takes her to school – a 10-minute walk from her home in Hackney, east London. At the end of the day, she picks Nia up, prepares her dinner and reads to her before bed.“It keeps me active,” she says. Nia teaches her grandma about TikTok. Plus, as she sees it, if someone else is being paid to look after Nia, “then I’m missing out on my granddaughter growing up”.Labiche-Robinson is one of millions of grandparents in the UK who, because of extended life expectancy, shifts in the nature of family life and cripplingly expensive childcare, are taking on a level of grandparenting that looks a lot more like parenting.A report from 2017estimated that 9 million British grandparents – the “grey army” – spent an average of eight hours a week helping to care for their grandchildren.A 2023 surveyfound that more than half of UK grandparents provide some sort of childcare during the working week, doing more than four hours a day on average.Of course, that still leaves nearly half who don’t; I know many parents whose own parents don’t lift a finger, let alone wipe a bum. And why should they? They have done their parenting years – and the northern lights aren’t going to see themselves.But go to any stay-and-play or music class and there will be at least one grandparent rolling play‑dough or bashing a tambourine. Push a swing and you won’t be more than a metre from one of the older generation pushing another. While I am writing this article, there is a grandparent downstairs in my own home, pretending to be a monster, so I can work. My daughter’s grandparents, on both sides, have provided scheduled and ad hoc care since she was a baby. My partner and I couldn’t have coped – financially or psychologically – without them.Via community groups and charities, word of mouth anda Guardian callout, I have heard from scores of grandparents who look after their offspring’s offspring, doing school runs, sleepovers, film nights and baking. Several have moved house to be nearer their grandchildren, or had their children move closer to them off the back of the promise of childcare. So why do they do it?Anita Pollack has an ‘overwhelming bond of love’ for her granddaughters.Photograph: Courtesy of Anita PollackThe main reason for many is simple: they enjoy it. Anita Pollack and Phil Bradbury moved out of Newham, east London, after 50 years to be near their grandchildren in Essex. “Though we had both looked forward to grandchildren, neither of us anticipated the quite overwhelming bond of love grandparents have for the grandchildren,” Pollack says.Others take pleasure in being able to help their adult children. Having never known either of his grandfathers, Alan Foster, 75, from Bognor Regis, West Sussex, spent a month living with his daughter when his grandson was born, “so she could ease back into work gradually and I could get to know my grandson before he started nursery”. He did it again when his second grandchild was born.There is also a recognition of the challenges facing parents today. “We are in awe of the responsibilities our children have to juggle with working, plus the cost of childcare, so we are happy to give any help,” says Martin Roach, who is retired. Along with his wife, he has looked after various grandchildren every Wednesday – from 7am to 7pm – for six years.View image in fullscreenMartin Roach says he’s ‘in awe’ of his children’s responsibilities and is happy to help with childcare.Photograph: Courtesy of Martin RoachSome grandparents I speak to say that being around young children at an older stage of life gives them the space they didn’t have with their own children. Maria, a retired childminder in Manchester, says: “We don’t have the added stress or pressures we had when our children were growing up. We have more time to just enjoy being with them.” Wendy, 77, who lives in Guildford and looks after her two grandsons once a week, says: “Grandparenting is better than being a parent. There is less anxiety.”Of course, when grandparents are so deeply invested, it can lead to friction. There may be disagreements about values. After all, even the basics of how children are looked after now differ, sometimes drastically, from the way many in this generation brought up their own children. In a2021 study of British grandmothers, some participants were taken aback by the expectation that children be constantly supervised.In my home, as well as many others, the consumption of sugar is a common source of tension.“She’s eaten well today,” my mum has reported on occasion, before listing off a cheese toastie, cake and “a bit of Grandad’s Twix bar”. Occasionally, screen time can be a jostle – just how many episodes ofBingis too many?Everyone says it’s gratifying, but then there is a lot of burden and obligation as wellSeveral grandparents report finding the prevailing style of “gentle parenting” tricky. Take this example, from an anonymous Guardian reader: “I have no issue with telling them if they have done something wrong. The four-year-old pushed her friend out of the way. My response was to make her say sorry to her friend straight away; her mum would rather talk to her and ask why she did it.”If grandparents are providing free childcare, is it reasonable to expect them to follow their own children’s ideals when it comes to care? They aren’t, after all, professional childcare workers.Despite this, the benefits outweigh any costs for all parties, says Anna Rotkirch, a Finnish sociologist who studies population ageing and families. “If you have a strong, close relationship to a grandparent compared with those who don’t, then you have fewer problems.”In times of upheaval – when parents divorce, for instance – “if you have at least one strong bond to a grandparent, that will be a kind of resilience booster”. An older relative’s home can be a raft of stability during difficult times with your parents.View image in fullscreenDenise and Stephen Burke say their grandson Ardy gets on well with their friends.Photograph: Courtesy of Denise and Stephen BurkeDenise Burke runs the thinktankUnited for All Ageswith her husband, Stephen Burke. She does this as well as picking up her eight-year-old grandson, Ardy, from school once a week and having him overnight. “It’s not just about the childcare, it’s what Ardy gets out of it,” she says. She cites trips to the local Indian restaurant or the pub. “He gets on well with our friends … and I think it really does children good to be mixing with all ages.”For grandparents, taking care of children brings the possibility of stimulation, cognitive sharpening and structure in a potentially amorphous life after retirement. John Perry and his wife take their 10-year-old granddaughter, Eva, to and from school, a 10-minute drive from where they live in the Nottinghamshire town of Bingham, most days. He says Eva has helped demystify supermarket self-service checkouts. “‘Oh, Grandad, just give it to me,’ she’ll say. She’ll scan it all and then go: ‘Grandad, give me your card.’”John L Bazalgette, who lives in south-west London, is 89 and has 13 grandchildren. He puts the benefits of looking after the children in terms of wisdom “mutually developed between the different generations … Discovering that we may have similar feelings, triggered by trying to belong in a shared fragmented world, can lead to deep experiences of attachment and love.”While there have been suggestions that caring for grandchildren keeps people young, a 2022 study suggested that any“rejuvenating effect” from looking after grandchildrenis a myth. The idea of whether care feels like a burden is central. Carole Easton, a psychotherapist and the chief executive of the Centre for Ageing Better, says that, among her grandparent friends, “there is a sense of obligation: ‘I’m not sure how they would manage if we didn’t do this’”. It’s not, she says, a complaint as much as “an acknowledgment that there isn’t a genuine choice in this”.I see this phase of my life as an opportunity to achieve things I put to one side earlierMany grandparents will still be juggling their work lives, too. Olga Grünwald is a researcher based in the Netherlands who looks at the positive and negative experiences of grandparenting. She says that for this new “sandwich generation” of grandparents balancing work and childcare, “everyone says: ‘Oh, it’s gratifying,’ but then there is a lot of burden and obligation as well”. An English teacher, who wishes to remain anonymous, says shesuggested having her three grandchildren round every Friday night, as it means getting to have regular time with them. “My job is very demanding and sometimes I am very tired at the end of the working week,” she says. “But my grandchildren are just such a joy that they really lift me up – before I eventually collapse on the couch!”According to a small survey of grandparents bythe childcare app Bubblein 2022, one in four reported retiring earlier to provide childcare. “That’s not a choice,” says Easton. “We are losing older people from the workplace, which is causing damage to our economy and to the workplace in terms of experience and knowledge.”Many grandparents I speak to report frustration at slipping boundaries and supposedly part‑time arrangements becoming full-time. I’m sure I have sometimes over‑asked my parents and they have been too kind to say no. One anonymous retired grandmother says of her daughter: “I have enabled her to earn a good wage. I received no payment of any description.”Frances Stadlen, a 76-year-old writer, gardener and baker in west London, had a discussion with her eldest son as soon as he said he was starting a family, explaining what her boundaries would be regarding childcare. Having been a stay-at-home mother when her children were growing up, she says: “I was not willing to enter into any regular childcare commitment.”That is not to say she doesn’t welcome her grandchildren into her home – her house is filled with toys and books – and she gives them her undivided attention when they are there, which, for each set of grandchildren, generally works out at one afternoon a week. However, she says: “I see this phase of my life as a significant opportunity to achieve things I put to one side at an earlier phase. In society as a whole, I observe an undervaluation or active devaluation of the legitimate aspirations of older women to live disentangled from the domestic sphere, should they so wish.”View image in fullscreenJohn Perry and his granddaughter Eva, whom he takes to school most days.Photograph: Courtesy of John PerrySome grandparents report not having time for their own interests, or feeling selfish when they take time for themselves. Perry and his wife, Veronica, often travel to their static caravan in France. “Rather than going for a long period, because of these commitments, we’ll just go for a week at a time.” Not in the school holidays, though. “We’re just around to help out, you know, as and when we’re needed.”Of course, grandparents wouldn’t need to be so heavily involved if childcare costs weren’t so prohibitively expensive. The cost of childcare in the UK isamong the highest in the world. According to thechildren’s charity Coram, summer holiday clubs this year cost parents an average of £1,075 a child – an average increase of 4% on 2024, with some areas seeing rises as high as 13%.If grandparents are backed into a corner because of the lack of affordable childcare, is something lost? Perhaps. While Paula Carter, a 59-year-old retired nurse, adores her grandchildren, “and all the care means I have a close and loving relationship with them”, she also feels that she misses out on “just being the granny”.In Finland, where childcare is subsidised based on income and family size and capped at about €300 (£260) a month, “there’s this expression that grandchildren are the dessert of life … the benefits without the burden”, says Rotkirch. “Very intensive grandchild care is not always ideal for the grandparents or even a grandchild. When we talk about caring for grandchildren in the Nordics, it’s an evening, or it’s when the child is ill for a few days, but it’s not every day for four hours.”Very intensive grandchild care is not always ideal for the grandparents or even a grandchildHigh-quality, affordable childcare would mean that the older generation could swoop in with their stickers, sweets and stories about life before the internet out of choice rather than obligation. It would allow them to enjoy time with their grandchildren rather than being called upon to plug the gaps of a system not fit for purpose – which, according to most of the grandparents I speak to for this piece, can be very tiring. I know my parents love hanging out with my daughter and get something different and rewarding from taking care of her without her parents around. But they are no doubt glad that we now have more of an ad hoc arrangement than the previous one, which involved regular, full days: scrambling eggs at 8am and keeping a toddler amused until past 6pm.Easton, who regularly cares for her grandson and loves to do so, says she often jokes with her other grandparent friends that “a woman shouldn’t be allowed to have a baby until she’s checked with the grandparents first”. The serious point here is that grandparents are now so often part of the caring package for young children that perhaps this should be a consideration.When Labiche-Robinson’s daughter and granddaughter eventually move out, she will still be getting involved, she says: she is invested in raising Nia. “She’s my granddaughter. So I’m very attached her – to all of them, my children and my grandchildren … while I’m here, I might as well help the family.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 29 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 08.38 EDTShareI am limited to one pan and a burner when I camp. What would chefsrecommend making?Maxwell, by emailHappy campers need supplies, and Ryan Cole, executive chef and co-owner ofSalsify at The Roundhousein Camps Bay, South Africa, doesn’t mess about. “We have three square boxes: one dedicated to dry goods, one to oil, salt, pepper and utensils, and the third to camping toiletries; we also have a dual compartment fridge-freezer.”Whatever your set-up, a considered mobile store-cupboard of spices, stock cubes, good oil, grains, pasta, tins of coconut milk and the like will really come into its own. Got tinned tomatoes? Makeshakshukafor a campside breakfast. “We always take a lightly spiced onion relish and add that to tinned tomatoes for the base,” Cole says. Otherwise, he’ll use long-life or nut milk to whip up some breakfast pancakes: “That’s super-simple.”Mitch Tonks, founder and CEO ofRockfish, is no stranger to confined cooking arrangements: “I live on a boat, so I’m used to limited space. That’s why Iloveone-pot dishes.” Pasta, he says, really suits this way of cooking. Ditalini, or other small, short tubes, with pancetta and peas, for example, will have you eating very well in the great outdoors – scout’s honour. “Put 75g pasta in a wide pan with a teaspoon of chicken powder or a quarter of a crumbled stock cube. Add cured smoked pancetta, tinned or frozen peas and a chopped tomato, then pour in 225ml water.” Simmer the lot for 10-15 minutes, until the pasta is cooked and the water has evaporated, then grate in some parmesan or stir in a tablespoon of mascarpone and eat.Wholesome, hearty meals are a balm when you’re camping, Cole says. A favourite starts by dusting bony cuts of meat (lamb neck or oxtail, say) with flour, then caramelising them in oil: “Take them out, add onion, garlic and carrot, and sweat until soft. Return the meat to the pan, and cook for half an hour with some stock, water, wine, beer or whatever liquid you have floating around the campsite.” Tip in some new potatoes, then leave to bubble away gently for two or three hours while you shoot the breeze: “You can make that to feed one, two or 10, and there’s nothing better on a summer’s night. Or any night, really.”It’s worth having snacks in your arsenal, too, says George Husband, co-founder ofGorka, the London-based pop-up: “Bring a zip-lock bag of 750g flour, two teaspoons of instant yeast [or even a premix bread flour from the supermarket] and a pinch of salt, then add water the night before you want to cook it, or even when you crawl out of your sleeping bag in the morning. You now have a flatbread dough that’s ready to fry.” Once cooked, slather the bread with butter and honey, and “that’s a great snack for hiking trips”.And if your idea of a good time includes something sweeter, keep things simple withs’moresor thin millet pancakes, Cole says: “Do this in a pan that’s almost too hot, so the edges caramelise, then put in a couple of marshies and a bit of maple syrup.” Roll them up, squeeze over some lemon juice and job’s a good’un. But remember, he adds, less really is more when you’re in the countryside: “The more you take with you, the more you have to bring back!”Got a culinary dilemma?

Eat a slice, shut your eyes and you will instantly be transported to the Aegean. Bake the tart ahead of time, because it’s perfect served at room temperature. If I am taking it on a picnic, I like to tub up the cucumber ribbons separately, then squeeze over the lemon and crumble in the feta just before serving.Greek salad tartPrep10 minCook50 minServes6-8If you have any plant-based eaters in the mix, use a non-dairy puff pastry and omit the feta.400g ripe vine tomatoesSea salt andblack pepper500g puff pastry1 large egg, beaten1 red onion,peeled and finely sliced3 tbsp capers50g black olives,pitted and chopped1tsp dried oreganoOlive oil½ cucumber,trimmed½ lemon,juiced75g fetaHeat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ and line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper.Finely slice the tomatoes with a sharp knife, so they are less than 5mm thick. Put them in a large colander, toss with a half-teaspoon of sea salt, and leave in the sink.Roll the puff pastry into a roughly 32cm × 25cm rectangle and score a border 2cm from the edge. Transfer to the lined baking sheet and brush the border with the beaten egg. Lay three or four rows of the sliced tomatoes inside the pastry border, and nestle in the slices of onion as you go. Scatter over the capers and chopped olives, sprinkle over half the dried oregano and drizzle with two tablespoons of olive oil. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until the border is golden all over and nicely risen, then remove and leave to cool.To make the topping, peel the cucumber into ribbons with a vegetable peeler and put in a bowl. Season generously, squeeze over the lemon juice, then sprinkle in the remaining half-teaspoon of dried oregano, crumble in the feta, add a tablespoon of olive oil and toss well.

Changing positions doesn’t help, so what’s left?Pamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 29 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 03.34 EDTShareI am a man in my 60s. When my wife and I have sex, I can keep it up (as it were) for 45 minutes, including about 20 minutes of coitus. All of which I enjoy very much. The problem in recent years is my orgasm. When it arrives, it is a bit of a letdown. It happens extremely quickly and feels like a premature ejaculation, even though it has taken a long time to get there. It makes no difference whether I am on top and in charge of the pace or whether my wife is. How can I make my orgasms more enjoyable?Certain medications – whether prescription or over-the-counter – can change the nature of one’s orgasm, so consider whether the culprit could be in your medicine cabinet. If this is a possibility, you should consult with the prescribing physician to find out if there might be an alternative. Another element to investigate is whether your hormones might have something to do with it. For example, you might ask a doctor to look at your testosterone levels. Strong orgasms are fuelled partly by sex hormones such as testosterone, and an insufficiency could lead to the symptoms you are experiencing. Finally, I can tell that you are proud of your sexual prowess, but it might be a good idea to relax a bit on the expectations you set for yourself. A person usually has a better orgasm when they are able to let go of performance pressure.

The council relies on random spot checksto identify any problems, andgives residents 14 days to supply whatever was missing. Anyone who misses the deadline has their permit cancelled without a refund.We’ve been told we will have to reapply for the permits and pay again. We later found the email informing us in our spam folder. I have hit a brick wall trying to speak to the council.In the meantime, we have received threetickets, totalling £150, for parking on our road.NT, CardiffYour experience is bizarre on so many levels: the apparent failure to check applications; the assumption that permit holders, who may be on holiday or in hospital, will be in a position to spot and act on a single email within a fortnight, or else lose their permit, and their money; and the fact that they must shell out for a second time to make good oversights that should have been detected at the application stage.I put all these questions to the council but it only answered the one about the document-checking policy.Incredible as it may seem, it does, indeed, rely on applicants to confirm they meet the eligibility criteria for a permit rather than scrutinising the evidence itself.Its terms and conditions state that it reserves the right to request further documents at any time to verify validity.“Any time” in your case meant three years.The council tells me that when a “review” found that you had not submitted proof that your vehicles were linked to your address, and you did not provide it within 14 days of the email – which you did not see – it cancelled the permit to “ensure the integrity of the application process”.This did not prevent the council sending PCNs to your address obtained via the registration plates from the DVLA database. It has now reinstated your permits, at no extra charge, and cancelled the three PCNs, but it appears to remain wedded to the system.Anna Tims was named consumer champion of the year at this year’s Headline Money awards.

The cheese – a nutty, golden gruyère – we’d bought from Pierre: we hadn’t expected to hike past a human, let alone a fromagerie, in the teeny hillside hamlet of Rouet, and it had taken a while to rouse the cheesemaker from within his thick farmhouse walls. But thankfully we’d persevered. Because now we were resting in a valley of pine and pasture with the finest sandwich we’d ever eaten. Just two ingredients. Three, if you counted the mountain air.Map for QueyrasAs lunches go, it was deliciously simple. But then, so was this trip, plainly called “Hiking in the French Alps” on the website. The name had struck me as so unimaginative I was perversely intrigued; now it seemed that Macs Adventure – organisers of this self-guided walk in the Queyras region – were just being admirably to the point.Yes, Queyras. I hadn’t heard of it either. Bordered to the north and east by Italy, barricaded by a phalanx of 3,000-metre peaks, this regional natural park might be the least-discovered – and the Frenchest – corner of the Alps. Queyras only really entered the national consciousness in 1957, after disastrous floods made it briefly headline news. Tourism filtered in. But it remains little known to outsiders, and centuries of undisturbed agriculture and isolation mean its rural character has been preserved.View image in fullscreenCeillac, the gateway to Queyras natural park.Photograph: Sarah BaxterEven now Queyras takes some effort to reach. Either you take the narrow, hair-pinning road through the gorges of the Guil River from Guillestre. Or you drive over the 2,361-metre Col d’Izoard (from Briançon) or the 2,744-metre Col Agnel (from Italy), both of which periodically test the thighs of Tour de France riders, and both of which close over winter, all but cutting Queyras off from the rest of the world.Making the most of Macs Adventure’s collaboration with the no-fly specialists Byway, my husband and I travelled as close as we could by train. We overnighted in Paris, whizzed down to south-east France, then chugged more slowly towards Montdauphin-Guillestre, where aVauban hilltop fortsurveils a strategic meeting of valleys. Finally, we boarded the end-of-day school bus, joining children inured to the spectacular views to squeeze up the valley to Ceillac, gateway to the natural park.It is a region that, reputedly, has 300 days of sunshine a year and as many species of flowers as it does peopleThe plan from here was to spend six days hiking a circular route that promised big, satisfying climbs but no technical terrain (and no shared dorms or privation). Covering up to 12 miles each day – and walking for an average of six hours – we’d use parts of the GR58 (thegrande randonnéethat circuits Queyras) as well as other trails to roam between traditional villages. We’d eat cheese, gaze over lakes and mountains, and generally revel in a region that, reputedly, has 300 days of sunshine a year and as many species of flowers as it does people (about 2,500 of both).On day one this meant walking from Ceillac to Saint-Véran, over the Col des Estronques (2,651 metres). It was a fine start, under blue September skies – we’d come at the end of the hiking season (the trip runs June to mid-September), when crocuses still fleck the meadows and houseleeks hang on higher up, but the bilberry bushes are beginning to blaze in fall-fiery colours and there’s a sense of change in the air.View image in fullscreen‘The highest village in Europe’, apparently … Saint-Véran.Photograph: Jo Skeats/Macs AdventureWe joined a light stream of other walkers, progressing up the valley via lonely farmsteads and meadows bouncing with crickets. Noisy choughs and a boisterous breeze welcomed us to the pass itself; 100 vertical metres more took us to the lookout of Tête de Jacquette, where we felt like monarchs of this mountain realm. These may not have been the very biggest Alps – few peaks sported any snow – but they rippled every which way, great waves of limestone, dolomite, gabbro and schist.From the col we dropped down through arolla pine and larch to Saint-Véran. At 2,042 metres, it claims to be the highest village in Europe. It’s also a snapshot of Alpine life before the modern world seeped in. The oldest house, built in traditional Saint-Véran style, dates to 1641 and is now the Soum Museum; the ground floor, with its half-metre-thick stone walls, is where animals and families would sleep together for warmth. The upper floors, built from tree trunks, were used to keep hay, barley and rye; the grains were made into coarse loaves that would last all winter, baked in the communal oven.By evening we’d be drinking reasonably priced wine, with a multi-course meal or indulgent fondue. The air was always fresh, the trails joyful, the crowds largely thinThat enormous village oven is still fired up a few times a year, for festivals. But I was pleased to be fed atHotel le Grand Tétras(“Capercaillie”) instead. Here, we feasted ongratin d’oreilles d’âne(literally “donkey’s ears”, actually a delicious spinach lasagne) and stayed in a simple room with a five-star view to the opposite peaks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’d set off after breakfast to buy picnic supplies. We’d hike up through butterfly-wafted green. We’d cross a pass, go by a lake or reach a panoramic ridge. Then we’d descend through forest or towards an icy river. By evening we’d be ensconced in a pretty village, drinking reasonably priced wine, with a multicourse meal or an indulgent fondue. The air was always fresh, the trails always joyful, the crowds largely thin.“It’s busy here mid-July to mid-September,” said Christophe Delhaise Ramond, the owner of agîtein Abriès where we stayed one night, as he poured usmélèze(larch) liqueurs while we pored over maps. Then he reconsidered: “But there are only around 2,000 tourist beds in the park, so it’s never that bad.”View image in fullscreenAtrès françaispitstop in Queyras park.Photograph: Sarah BaxterIt’s thanks to Christophe that we made a slight detour the following day. As planned, we climbed up to 2,583-metre Lac Grand Laus, a lake so brilliantly blue-green it seemed a bit of the Mediterranean had got lost in the mountains. It was spectacular, but as crowded as we’d seen anywhere in Queyras. So, on Christophe’s suggestion, we continued to climb, steeply, up to the Col du Petit Malrif, where tenacious flowers popped through the rocks and the views were immense, reaching to snow-licked peaks.The valleys of the Dolomites: exploring Italy’s new network of wild trailsRead moreFrom here, we looped back, via two smaller, but no less Mediterranean, tarns, where there were no other people. At the second we flopped down in the cotton grass and chewed baguettes stuffed withbleu dequeyras. We stayed there long after the baguettes were gone, listening to the water burbling in the wind. Finally, we headed on, descending via a rocky cleft. Soon we emerged on a track so swirled by puffs of silken thistledown it was as if we were hiking in Fairyland.

His goal is to guarantee he is far from the last Black professor.View image in fullscreenComposite: Guardian Design/Alamy“I’m a first-generation person. I grew up in poverty, grew up at the end of segregation,” he said. “Why is that important to not be the first? Well, it’s important because everybody has an ‘in’, and if there’s nothing left after your ‘in’, you just become a symbol for somebody else’s story.“I’ll be the subject of another report, but I won’t have influence, I wouldn’t have ushered in any of the people that look like me that the world said couldn’t be.”The point is not to simply produce a report but to act, he said.“The real fundamental issue is change. Not a symbolic apology, not a pay cheque. [How] do you create leagues of Black thinkers and clinicians and doctors and engineers and artists that fill the gap of what were lost by what white people engineered for centuries that deprived the world of Black human genius. That’s why this report matters so much to me.”In turn, he added,Scotlandcould become better equipped to tackle the endemic problems of racial disparity in health outcomes, mortality, employment, housing, education. “So when you think of it this way, what does reparations mean if it doesn’t mean dealing with the consequences that were created by the very institutions you want to write the cheque?”His singular status in Edinburgh’s philosophy department (which lists 12 tenured professors) also, he added, points to one of the most important findings of its investigation: the “severe underrepresentation” of Black staff, the patchy recruitment of Black and ethnically minoritised students, and continuing staff and student experiences of racism.The decolonisation review, which was co-chaired by Dr Nicola Frith, an expert in reparations policy, found that less than 1% (150 out of 17,260) of the university’s employees were Black – a figure that has been static for some years. A different picture emerges with other ethnic groups. The number of Asians – a category which includes Japanese, Chinese and south Asian people – reached 9% in 2022-23, up from 7% in 2018-19.View image in fullscreenDr Nicola Frith, co-chair of the working group that produced the report Decolonised Transformations: Confronting the University of Edinburgh’s Legacies of Enslavement and Colonialism.Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The GuardianAmong the university’s 49,430 students in 2022-23, 34% of its undergraduates were Asian – driven largely by growing numbers of Chinese students – with just 2% Black. Among postgraduates, 44% were Asian, 5% Black.The report says the increasing diversity in the university’s population “does not benefit Black staff and students” yet Edinburgh prides itself on being a “global institution”. That means it should measure progress against the world’s demographics too. “While there is a dominant white racial majority in the UK, and especially in Scotland, the basis of comparison must not presume that small numbers of non-white racial and ethnic minorities in Scotland offer an appropriate baseline for comparison.”Scottish census data from 2021 puts the country’s non-white minority ethnic population at 7.1%, but in Edinburgh that figure is just over 15% – nearly 77,800 people, 2.1% (10,881) of them Black. Across England and Wales, 18.3% of the population are from minority ethnic communities, 2.5% of them Black.“So I ask this very seriously,” Curry continued. “In the United States, before the end of Jim Crow segregation [in 1965], there was roughly 1.2% of Black scholars there.

Edinburgh has been a leading centre for reparations research for a decade, she said, since it held an international conference on reparations in 2015.View image in fullscreenA banner reading ‘Glasgow Says NO to Racism’ during the anti-racists protest called by the Stand up to Racism in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, 20 June 2020.Photograph: Robert Perry/EPAThe university, led by its principal, Peter Mathieson, made what Frith calls the “really good decision” to set up the review after a “collective groundswell” from staff and students to respond to the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, and Glasgow University’s groundbreaking report in 2018 on its slavery debt, as well as a controversy at Edinburgh in 2020 over therenaming of a university building named after the philosopher and alumnus David Hume, author of a “notorious footnote” in 1753 claiming “the Negroes” were “naturally inferior”.“I don’t see that history as something that sits in the past with a closed door,” Frith adds. “It is something that directly affects all of us today in very different and uneven ways, but it nonetheless does affect the shape of our society, our relations, everything.”Frith and Curry argue that if the university adopts their group’s recommendations, the impact could be profound.“There are very few things that stand beyond our lifetime,” said Curry. “A centre, an institute, the creation of Black scholars in the UK around this issue of racism, dehumanisation and colonialism is something that I think will change the intellectual tenor and academic climate of the country. Nothing like it exists.“So when we’re looking at why it’s important, it’s because if theUniversity of Edinburghserved as the pinnacle of the 17th, 18th and early 19th century for this work, why can’t it serve as the same centre to undo it in the 21st century?”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of EdinburghEdinburgh race reportRaceHigher educationColonialismEdinburghScotlandSlaveryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The nearest Metro station, which would offer protection from raids, is 500m away, “and most of the attacks on Kharkiv are so fast that as soon as you hear the sound of the alarm the bombs have already fallen”.View image in fullscreenPavlo Makov at his new art studio in Kharkiv.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAnd so, they put in ear plugs and lay a bet with death that they will survive the night.He and his family escaped Kharkiv and lived for a time in Italy at the beginning of the war in 2022. But, like many Ukrainians, he found living away from home more stressful than being present, despite the bombs.“I could have stayed in Italy but realised I was losing my senses. After six months you lose the ability to understand what you are doing there. When we came back I immediately I thought: ‘OK, I’m in my place.’”View image in fullscreenMakov’s drawing of a battered urban weed that grows in the cracks in the pavement.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianMakov has recently renovated a new studio in the city. It is on the ground floor: less vulnerable to air attack than his old, fourth-floor place. Its windows are small for an artist’s studio – but practical for a city where glass gets blown out of buildings every day.On an easel is a large, bold new drawing in vivid shades of emerald and orange – a departure for Makov who, for years, has worked mostly in highly intricate monochrome prints and graphite pencil.It is a drawing of a somewhat battered urban weed that grows in the cracks in the pavement. “It’s exactly how I feel myself now: a bit ruined but still alive,” Makov said.The weed is a kind ofplantain, different species of which grow across the world. In Ukraine, this humble plant is often applied to bruises or scrapes as a folk remedy. Its name,podorozhnyk, literally translates as “by the road” – a state of being for the many Ukrainians who are dealing with being displaced, or the threat of being made homeless by a shifting frontline or falling bombs.View image in fullscreenA drawing in the artist’s usual intricate, monochrome style.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian“We all have this feeling that we are living from suitcases,” Makov said. His rucksack always stands by the door, packed with his vital documents and ready for a swift departure.The image of this plant, and its metaphorical power, was a way of tackling the overwhelming subject of war indirectly, he said.“The language of war is so strong, so powerful. It is so enormous that none of us can compete with its power,” he said. “But at the same time, art exists. It has always existed. They were using it in caves to explain the world, to find a connection with the world. You’ll never save the world with it – but it will help you survive your life.”View image in fullscreenMakov working in his studio.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianWhen the invasion began on 24 February 2022, Makov, like other artists in the city, took refuge in Kharkiv’s contemporary art gallery, the Yermilov Centre, which is in the concrete basement of a university building.He was due to represent his country at the Venice Biennale – the art world’s most prestigious regular international gathering, which opened in April of that year. But sheltering from the bombings, he abandoned all thoughts of making it to Italy – until one of the project’s curators called him and told him she had part of his artwork in her car, she was already in Vienna, and she was determined to show something for her country, come what may.The next morning Makov and his family made their escape, racing to their car as a cruise missile hit the nearby headquarters of the SBU security service. One of his tyres got a puncture owing to the broken glass strewing the roads. He had to make an emergency return dash to his mother’s flat, because she had forgotten her false teeth. But the family and their pets made it out. And he did end uprepresenting Ukraineat the Venice Biennale.View image in fullscreenA piece of art in the studio. Makov says Ukraine has been changed for ever by the war.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianBut it was no thanks to the Ukrainian government, he said.“I got two telephone calls from the ministry of culture of Italy, asking whether we needed some help. And no phone call from from the ministry of culture of Ukraine.“It was like we didn’t exist,” he said. “OK, there was a war. But if you’re the ministry of culture, your war is there, in the world of culture.” The Ukrainian gallery with whom he works, The Naked Room, is still out of pocket because of the event “because we got no support from the state” beyond the hiring of the space in which the exhibition was held.Compared with Russia, which projects itself internationally via its literature, music, ballet and opera, Ukraine was way behind on promoting itself through culture, he said.View image in fullscreenThe artist’s tools.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThere is no museum of contemporary art in the country. “We have a unique situation, now,” he said. “For the first time in the history of Ukraine, three generations of artists are alive, not killed, and the art they produced has not been destroyed.” It was evidence of a kind of “provincialism”, he said, “a kind of disrespect to yourself”, not to have built such an institution in an independent Ukraine.“Why am I interested in Great Britain? Not because it won this war or lost this war, it is because Turner is British and I love Turner. Why do I love Ireland? Because James Joyce is one of my favourite writers.”“In Ukraine we don’t have any kind of vision of how to represent Ukraine as a cultural society. We have writers, we have poets, we have we have all these things that we can export, but nobody’s doing that. All our cultural exporting is based on volunteer movements.”‘The soldiers want you to see what they’re going through’: the heartbreaking follow-up to 20 Days in MariupolRead moreUkrainian society had been changed for ever by the war, he said Huge population shifts had been caused by internal displacement and by trauma, but also through the great divides opening up between individuals, based on their very different experiences during the war: soldiers living through a hellish trench warfare on the front, compared with those far behind the lines or those based abroad.Even so, he said, “We all have one general idea: we need the end of the war. Better, a victory, but at least some kind of stable peace.” But like many others in Ukraine, he finds it hard to envision, under the current circumstances, how that might be achieved. “Normally a stable peace comes if your enemy is destroyed. And I can’t imagine that we can destroy Russia, somehow. Russia has a lot of fat under the skin.”“This drama has been going on now for over three years. It will soon have been going on for as long as the second world war. And I don’t think that people understand Russians will never stop unless they are stopped. If they’re not stopped, they will never stop.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Johana Bhuiyan and Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who’s enjoying the beach but likely getting sunburned.Tech companies throw billions towards AI infrastructureTech companies are fighting to claim the title of having the world’s most advanced AI. The goal is to supercharge their bottom line and keep investors and Wall Street happy. But developing the world’s most advanced AI means spending billions on data centers and other physical infrastructure to house and power the supercomputers needed for AI. It also means adrain on natural resourcesand the grid in the areas surrounding data centers worldwide.Still, last week’s earnings reports made clear that tech firms are forging ahead. Googleannouncedit was planning to spend $85bn on building out its AI and cloud infrastructure just in 2025 – $10bn more than it initially predicted. And the company expects that spending to increase again in 2026. For context, Google reported $94bn in revenue in the second quarter of this year. Chief executive Sundar Pichai said Google is in a “tight supply environment” when it comes to the infrastructure needed to support AI processing and compute. The results of this increased spending would still take years to be realized, he said.Google isn’t alone. Amazon hassaidit plans to spend $100bn in 2025 – the “vast majority” of which will go to powering the AI capabilities of its cloud division. As a point of comparison, Amazon spent just under $80bn in 2024.“Sometimes people make the assumption that if you’re able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component … that somehow it leads to less total spend in technology,” said Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy during an earnings call in February. “We’ve never seen that to be the case.”Meta, too, hasupped the amountit plans to spend on AI infrastructure. In June, Mark Zuckerberg said the company planned to spend “hundreds of billions” of dollars on building out a network of massive data centers across the US including one that the firm expects to be up and running in 2026. Originally, executives said the firm was projected to spend $65bn in 2025 but adjusted that to anywhere between $64bn and $72bn.Meta and Amazon report earnings this week.AI is coming for artists, can anything be done rein it in?View image in fullscreenHimi and Mahito Maki in a scene from The Boy and the Heron.Photograph: APArtificial intelligence companies have come under fire for cannibalizing creative industries. Artists have seen their work used without their permission as companies train their algorithms. Creative teams have shrunk and been laid off as parts of their work are being done by AI.“It will mean that 95% of what marketers use agencies, strategists, and creative professionals for today will easily, nearly instantly, and at almost no cost be handled by AI,” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI,has said. “No problem.”In response, coalitions of artists havelaunched several copyright lawsuitsagainst the top AI companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google and Anthropic. The companies say that under the “fair use” doctrine they should be able to use copyrighted material for free and without consent. Artists, including names such as Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, say the companies shouldn’t be able to profit off their work. So far, theAI companies are winning.Adobe, the software company best known for making creative tools such as Photoshop, says it’s trying to walk the line between developing useful AI programs and making sure artists aren’t getting the short end of the stick.The company has introduced two “creator-safe” tools, that aim to tackle issues around copyright and intellectual property. One is its Firefly AI model, which Adobe says is trained only on licensed or public-domain content. The other is the Adobe Content Authenticity web app, which lets photographers and other visual artists indicate when they don’t want their work to be used to train AI and also lets them add credentials to their digital creations.Artists can “apply a signature to it in the same way that a photographer might sign a photo or a sculptor would etch their initials into a sculpture”, said Andy Parsons, a senior director at Adobe who oversees the company’s work on content authenticity. We spoke with Parsons about the burgeoning world of AI and what it means for creators.***Q: What do you see as the biggest issues that creators and artists are facing with the advent of AI, and generative AI?I think there’s one prevailing issue, which is the concern that various AI techniques will compete with human ingenuity and with artists of all kinds. And that goes for agencies, publishers, individual creators.***Q: Is Adobe Firefly one of the ways that Adobe is trying to address these problems and make sure that creators’ work is not ripped off?Yeah, absolutely. From the beginning of Adobe Firefly, we followed two guiding principles. One is to make sure that Adobe Firefly is not trained on publicly available content. It’s only trained on things that Adobe and the Firefly team have exclusive rights to use. That means that it can’t do certain things. It cannot make a photo of a celebrity, because that celebrity’s likeness we would consider guarded and potentially protected.The second thing we built in from the beginning is transparency, so knowing that something that comes out of Firefly was generated by AI. This is what we call content provenance, or content authenticity. It’s making clear something is a photograph or made by an individual artist as opposed to made by AI.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s an entire team devoted to trust, safety and assurances that the material is available to be used. We don’t crawl the open web, because as soon as you do that, you do risk potentially infringing on someone’s intellectual property. Our feeling is it’s not always the case that more training data is better.***Q: What does the future of human creativity look like now that we’re living in this new world with generative AI?When it comes to content authenticity, there’s that “nutrition label” idea we sometimes talk about. If you walk into a food store, you have a fundamental right that’s fulfilled in most democratic societies, to know what’s in the food that you’re going to serve your family.

Of the total area, 64% is intact tropical forest, according to thespatial mapping and analysisin a new report by Earth Insight. This expansion of oil and gas development is at odds with DRC’s commitments to protect biodiversity and climate protection, experts warn.In July 2022, the DRC government launched tenders for 30 oil and gas blocks, but this waslater cancelled, with the government citing late submissions and a lack of competition. “The world’s worst place to prospect for oil is up for auction, again,” said Prof Simon Lewis from University College London, who led the team that first mapped the central Congo peatlands. “No credible company would bid for oil in the DRC’s forests and peatlands, as there is probably not enough oil to be commercially viable, and it will be expensive oil in financial, social and environmental costs.”View image in fullscreenA Greenpeace scientist conducting research in the Congo’s vast peatlands.Photograph: Daniel Beltrá/GreenpeaceEarlier this year the government announced the flagshipKivu-Kinshasa Green Corridorconservation initiative, but now 72% of that area overlaps with planned oil blocks, according to the report, written in collaboration with DRC-based group Notre Terre Sans Pétrole [Our Land Without Oil],Corap, andRainforest Foundation UK.The Cuvette Centrale – which is the world’s largest tropical peatland complex – is included in the newly designated oil blocks. This vast swampy area is the size of Nepal and home to rare wildlife including forest elephants, lowland gorillas, chimpanzees and endemic birds. It stores approximately30bn metric tonnes of carbonin peat.Map of fossil fuel licensing blocksIn recent years there have been various international efforts to secure funding to protect DRC’s forests.The most significant tranche of money was a $500m (£417.6m)forest protection dealsigned on behalf of the Central African Forest Initiative (Cafi) at Cop26. The10-year agreement– running from 2021 to 2031 – aimed to cut deforestation and promote the regeneration of 8m hectares of degraded land and forests.The rangers turning the DRC’s ‘triangle of death’ back into a thriving wildlife reserveRead moreSo far, just $150m has been transferred to the DRC, well behind the nearly $400m that should have been delivered by now according to the terms of the agreement. Discussions are ongoing about how to increase the speed of money being released. A source said the lack of international funding to make it more profitable to keep forests standing than felled is making countries such as DRC more likely to look for oil and gas deals. They described it as a “collective failure”.In addition to conservation impacts, an estimated 39 million people live within the area being sold off for oil, including many Indigenous peoples and forest-based communities who depend on healthy forests and rivers for survival.View image in fullscreenTerritory key to Indigenous peoples such as the Mbuti pygmies, pictured, and other forest-based communities may be affected by the proposed auction.Photograph: De Agostini/Getty Images“Imagine: 39 million Congolese people … and 64% of our forests could be directly affected by the awarding of these oil blocks,” said Pascal Mirindi, campaign coordinator for Notre Terre Sans Pétrole. “And all this while the government is promoting the Kivu-Kinshasa ecological corridor. Where is the logic? Where is the coherence? We are reminding our leaders that the Congolese people are the primary sovereign. We will not remain silent while certain people organise themselves to sell off our future.”The report calls on the DRC government and international partners to cancel the 2025 oil tender and invest in development models that respect Indigenous and community rights. “Oil and gas development in these fragile ecosystems would have devastating impacts on biodiversity, communities, land rights and the global fight against climate change,” said Anna Bebbington, a research manager at Earth Insight.The DRC government did not respond to request for comment.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsOilThe age of extinctionFossil fuelsEnergyDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaConservationEndangered habitatsnewsShareReuse this content"

In court, EM testified that she was drunk and intimidated by multiple large men entering the room, which she estimated at times to be as many as 11, some of whom were just there to eat and socialize.EM also said that although she engaged in group sex acts with some of them, they were as part of a “porn star” persona she adopted in order to placate the men in what she felt was a dangerous situation – and did not actually consent to any of the activity.The men, for their part, have claimed EM was sexually aggressive, begged them for sex and actively consented to all of it. McLeod also recorded two videos of EM after the group encounter had finished, in which she said she had consented to sexual activity. EM testified that while she didn’t remember the videos being filmed, she recalled McLeod “hounding” her to say she consented.In fact, EM testified over nine grueling days, seven of them under by cross-examination by five separate teams of lawyers, one for each accused. Only one of the men testified.So when Justice Maria Carroccia told a packed London courtroom last Thursday that she found the complainant to not be “credible nor reliable”, it elicited gasps. As an example of these “issues related to credibility”, the judge said it was “telling” that EM testified she weighed 120 pounds – despite records showing she was 138lb. EM had explained she was just sticking to what she had estimated previously. The judge interpreted it as mendacity.“The complainant, rather than answering the question truthfully, chose to repeat what she had said previously,” she said.Carroccia also questioned how drunk EM could have been, as videos did not show “any obvious signs of impairment, such as stumbling” and suggested she “initiated touching” with McLeod at the bar despite having initially said she did not.In the end, the judge determined that EM fully consented, and was essentially lying in court – a callous take that appeared to scrutinize the female complainant’s claims far more harshly than the five men, according to Daphne Gilbert, a criminal law professor at the University of Ottawa.“I was extremely disappointed in the decision, and to me, it’s the worst possible outcome for [the woman] and efforts to tackle sexual violence generally,” Gilbert said, noting the judge’s conclusion seemed an extreme one to reach based on EM’s testimony, and appeared to indicate that she considered the complainant to be on trial, rather than the men.“She didn’t believe the complainant and only focused on what deficiencies she saw in the complainant, and doesn’t speak about the men at all,” said Gilbert.“I find that astonishing in a case like this,” she said. “She just completely blamed EM, and in doing so, she invoked stereotypes.”But few stereotypes may ultimately have proved as powerful as the one of Canada’s mainly young, mainly white and mainly male hockey stars being infallible national symbols – a stereotype which the case at first threatened to explode. The entire sordid saga did not emerge into public view at all for many years: police dropped their initial police investigation in 2019 after seeing video that made them think EM was not as drunk as she had stated; EM then sued Hockey Canada in 2022, which conducted its own investigation and settled with her for an undisclosed amount. It was only when the settlement was leaked to the media that a public uproar saw police reopen the investigation, and lay charges in early 2024.But it also revealed the existence of a secret Hockey Canada fund, which the organization eventually admitted it had specifically created to pay settlements in sexual assault cases against players – apparently lifting the lid off a long-simmering culture of abuse and cover-ups extending far beyond the case at hand.Sponsors dropped Hockey Canada like flies. In 2022 the incident spilled over into parliament, with hockey executives called in for questioning about what they knew of the London case and whether hockey had a problematic culture of the kind that would require the existence of a secret fund to settle assault claims.The furore led to multiple reforms, including mandatory training for athletes and staff on sexual violence and consent. The players themselves were barred from the NHL, though many have since been playing in Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The league said in a statement that even though the men had been acquitted, and the allegations found not to be criminal, they were disturbing and “the behaviour at issue was unacceptable”. It said it was conducting an analysis and “determining next steps”. Many observers think it’s likely the players will be made eligible again. Sponsors, meanwhile, have quietly returned to Hockey Canada.It was a starkly different atmosphere from 2022, and evidence that the trial alone was probably never going to be enough to bring a true reckoning to hockey culture, said Taylor McKee, an assistant professor at Brock University in Ontario who specializes in hockey and masculinity.He said in order to address a culture of secrecy and lack of boundaries, Hockey Canada needed to turn a “flamethrower” toward the issue. If one person has behaved in a way that is compromising someone else’s safety, including sexual assault, McKee advocates for punishing the entire team.“That’s the kind of messaging I want to hear from Hockey Canada: a zero tolerance policy,” he said.But with cars passing the courthouse after the verdict honking in support of the players, and with the union for professional hockey players now advocating for the men’s return, what appears more likely, at least for now, is for the story that threatened to shake the foundations of a sport being forgotten as quickly as possible.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIce hockeyAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Vietnam, Cambodia and several other south-east Asian countries are also lobbying for extensions to talks to head off a rise in US tariffs.Negotiations between White House representatives and trading partners threatened with high tariffs have often proved to be drawn out. The EU’s trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, spent more than 100 hours negotiating before the US agreed to reduce a planned 30% tariffto 15% on EU exports to the USin a deal announced on Sunday.Pascal Lamy, a former director general of the World Trade Organization, said many of the trade agreements announced by the White House were light on detail and needed further negotiation, leading to further uncertainty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such actions were “a deliberate violation of the agreement, aimed at destroying trust between one another”, said a Thai military spokesperson, Maj General Winthai Suvaree.A Thai government statement accused Cambodia of “continuous and indiscriminate attacks on Thai territory”.Cambodia said it firmly rejected the allegations, with the Cambodian defence ministry spokesperson, Maly Socheata, saying there had been no new fighting. “Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have strictly adhered to the orders and agreements under the ceasefire,” the ministry said in a statement.The bitter feud fuelling the border dispute between Thailand and CambodiaRead moreThailand’s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, sought to reassure fears over the strength of the ceasefire, telling reporters there was “no escalation” in hostilities. “Right now things are calm,” he said.Meetings between military commanders from either side of the border went ahead, as proposed under Monday’s deal. During their talks, they agreed to refrain from reinforcing or moving troops in a manner that could cause misunderstanding.The two sides would also facilitate the repatriation of injured and deceased from the clashes, and establish a local coordination team.The Thai military said on Tuesday it had captured 18 Cambodian soldiers in post-ceasefire fighting after “heavy and indirect fire” was launched into Thai territory. The group was being provided with basic provisions, including food and water, it said.Both countries have faced growing international pressure to end the fighting, including an interventionby the US president, Donald Trump, who warned on Saturday that trade negotiations would be paused until the clashes stopped. Thailand and Cambodia face the prospect of a 36% US tariff from 1 August.The Thai government, which has faced criticism over claims it was too soft on the border issue in recent months, is also facing domestic pressure to adopt a tough stance. “Are you trying to pressure the military to backdown for sake of tariff negotiations?” a reporter asked Phumtham on Tuesday in a heated exchange.Trump said after the ceasefire deal, for which he took credit, that he had spoken to both Cambodia and Thailand’s leaders, and had instructed his trade team to restart tariff talks. Thailand’s finance minister, Pichai Chunhavajira, said later that he expected negotiations would be finished ahead of the deadline on 1 August.On the Cambodian side of the border, some evacuees were seen leaving shelter centres on Tuesday to return home, AFP reported. In Thailand people have been told to wait for official guidance before leaving evacuation areas, though some border areas began to return to normal, with shops reopening.In Cambodia’s Samraong city – 12 miles (20km) from the border – an Agence France-Presse journalist said the sound of blasts stopped in the 30 minutes leading up to midnight, with the lull continuing until dawn.Monday’s ceasefire talks were hosted byMalaysia, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional bloc, and attended by officials from the US and China.Under the deal, a cross-border committee is also scheduled to convene in Cambodia to further salve tensions on 4 August.The Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who announced the ceasefire agreement on Monday, described it as “a vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security”.A spokesperson for UN secretary general, António Guterres, said “he urges both countries to respect the agreement fully and to create an environment conducive to addressing longstanding issues and achieving lasting peace”.Thailand says 15 civilians and 15 soldiers have been killed in the fighting, while Cambodia has confirmed eight civilian and five military deaths.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaMalaysiaDonald TrumpAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the leading international authority on food crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, saidthe “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out”in Gaza.More than 20 member states expressed “serious concerns” about the current situation inGazaat the EU ambassadors meeting on Tuesday to discuss the proposal.Some gave immediate support, with a few expressing concern that a suspension from Horizon would “hamper the dialogue” withIsrael, a diplomat said. The member states agreed to work quickly with the commission to clarify technical details before reviewing the proposal again.HorizonEuropeis among the most prestigious science research programmes in the world and has never suspended a country before. Officials believe, however, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is so extreme that it now has a legal basis for suspension.In its proposal to member states the commission reports that “90% of households face severe water insecurity and malnutrition rates are rising sharply” with “severe shortages of medicine” and “virtually the entire Gaza population … at risk of famine”.The IPC said “humanitarian aid is largely insufficient”, citing Israel’s “drastic restrictions” on aid shipments into Gaza, and a lack of security for humanitarian organisations inside Gaza.Israel has blamed food shortages on distribution failures by the UN and Hamas diverting aid. Those claims have been repeatedly undermined.Israel said on Tuesday that “over 200 trucks were collected and distributed yesterday by the UN and international organisations” with an additional 260 awaiting collection and distribution.Clouds on horizon as EU members meet to discuss relationship with UKRead moreThat volume of aid is, however, still below the levels needed. An average of 500 trucks a day entered Gaza before the war, at time when people had not endured months of malnutrition, most had shelter and access to clean water and there was a functioning agriculture sector.EU officials described the current aid increases as an improvement but said they had been denied access to Gaza to verify the delivery of humanitarian aid and that there needed to be more entry points and distribution centres.Their proposal, if approved, would deny Israel access to one of the critical research areas within the Horizon programme, called the European Innovation Council (EIC), which specialises in disruptive technologies.Israel is one of the most successful member countries in the programme, receiving about €200m (£173m) of the €900m allocated since 2021, withabout €135m in grants and €65m in equity investment.There are 46 Israeli companies in the EIC programme, the EU said.The commission said in a statement: “While Israel has announced a daily humanitarian pause in Gaza fighting and has met some of its commitments under the common understanding on humanitarian aid and access, the situation remains severe.”It added that the suspension would flow from its review of the trade association agreement with Israel, prompted by calls for a review of the agreement by the Netherlands backed by 17 countries in May.Officials said the partial suspension would be given legal effect through article 79 of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement if the action was deemed “proportionate”.A seven-page proposal was put to ambassadors from member states gathering in Brussels to discuss the EU-US trade deal.According to the rules the EU would need a qualified majority, which means votes from about 15 member states, to carry it through as long as they represent 65% of the bloc’s population.This would almost certainly mean Germany would have to support the move.Senior EU officials said the mood at the ambassadors’ meeting last week on the matter of humanitarian aid was “heated” and there seemed to be a “special urgency” about putting this proposal on the table.The UK was blocked from Horizon for three years after Brexit,rejoining in 2024, but officials said this was different from a suspension.Explore more on these topicsEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaEuropeResearch fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

About 100 people were injured across the country.Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that he welcomed Trump’s recent harsher rhetoric towards the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and said only tough measures against Moscow could stop the killing.“Every murder of our people by the Russians, every Russian strike, when there could have been a ceasefire long ago if Russia had not refused – all this shows that Moscow deserves very tough, truly painful, and therefore fair and effective sanctions pressure. They must be forced to stop the killings and make peace,” the Ukrainian president wrote on Telegram.During talks on Monday with Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer,Trump saidhe was going to cut a previous 50-day deadline for Putin to “about 10 or 12 days”, citing disappointment with him over a lack of progress.“We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever. You have bodies lying all over the street, and I say that’s not the way to do it. So we’ll see what happens with that,” Trump said.View image in fullscreenThe prison in Bilenke, which suffered a direct hit in one of eight strikes on Zaporizhzhia region.Photograph: Ukraine State Criminal Executive Service/APLater, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his return to the US from Scotland, Trump said Russia had not responded to his announcement and that was a “shame”.The US president said he was now giving Putin 10 days from Tuesday or he would impose tariffs. “Now, you want a big scoop. Everybody else, close your ears. Okay, you ready, 10 days from today,” he said.Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied earlier on Tuesday that Russia was targeting civilian facilities and said the Kremlin was “committed to the peace process to resolve the conflict around Ukraine and secure our interests”.Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for the third round of direct talks in Istanbul last week, but aside from agreeing a prisoner swap they appeared to make little progress and the meeting broke up after less than an hour.Analysts say Putin has not been prepared to abandon his maximalist war aims, and believes he can wait out the west, particularly as the Trump administration has made it clear that supporting Ukraine is not a top foreign policy priority.There is hope in Kyiv that Trump’s tougher words this week might be followed up with concrete action, including a new package of sanctions on Russia and continued military and intelligence support for Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Local authorities in a village near Kamianske named the woman as Diana Koshyk, and said she was seven months pregnant and had been admitted to a maternity ward after complications with her pregnancy.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The EU said the US’s reference to commitments to “address non-tariff barriers affecting trade in food and agricultural products including streamlining requirements for sanitary certificates for US pork and dairy products” did not amount to any lowering of its red-line rules on food standards.It is known that the European Commission has also made a commitment to the UK to streamline veterinary certification processes applying to British food exports post-Brexit.

In the video several individuals direct verbal abuse at the pair, including “Go back to your country, murderers”, “This isn’t Gaza, this is Milan, this is Italy”, and “You’ll end up in hell sooner or later”.He reported that more and more people inside the service station joined in the verbal abuse as he and his son made their way to the restroom. At least three individuals began pushing him, apparently trying to force him out of the rest area.‘‘I ended up on the ground, and they took advantage of that like animals, kicking me in the stomach,’’ Elie told Il Corriere della Sera newspaper. ‘‘Then one of them tried to pull me up and aimed a blow at my face, but I managed to block it. Amid the chaos of the scuffle, I caught a glimpse of my son, who – thankfully – a woman had taken aside and was holding safely in a corner.“I started shouting ‘Police! Police! Police!’ he added, ‘‘and only then did they stop and go back upstairs.”Police have launched an investigation into the attack, which has been condemned by politicians and Jewish associations.Commenting on the incident, Noemi Di Segni, the president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, said: “If simply being visibly Jewish is enough to provoke such a violent attack – if a family cannot safely move through public spaces in this country – then the legitimisation of hatred and antisemitism has become viral. This is about everyone’s freedom being at risk. Holding on to respect and dignity for every person is the only path that protects us all.”Elie told Il Corriere that ‘‘given the climate of hatred that has developed across Europe toward the Jewish community, I expected it. But I never thought it would happen to me, especially not in Italy, which I had always considered a tolerant country, a place where one could feel safe.“These kinds of incidents are becoming more and more frequent,,” he added.Antisemitic incidents have risen across countries with the largest Jewish communities outside Israel, according to the Anti-Defamation League’s J7 taskforce report published in May.The report states that attacks on Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, alongside individuals, have increased significantly, in some cases more than doubling in 2023 compared with the previous year.Antisemitic incidents increased in Germany by 75% from 2021 to 2023, 185% in France and 82% in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 1,600 Israeli passengers onboard the Crown Iris were prevented from disembarking amid safety concerns when more than 300 demonstrators on the Cycladic isle made clear they were unwelcome over Israel’s conduct during the war in Gaza and its treatment of Palestinians.Marina Rosenberg, the senior vice-president of international affairs at the Anti-Defamation League, said that because people are being harassed just for being Jewish, “many Jews around the world are hiding their Jewish symbols”, such as the Star of David.On Tuesday federal prosecutors in Germany filed terrorism charges against a Syrian man accused of stabbing a Spanish tourist at Berlin’s Holocaust memorial in February – an attack that the authorities say was intended to demonstrate allegiance to Islamic State.In France in May 2024 police shot dead an Algerian man who had set fire to a synagogue in Rouen and threatened officers with a knife.Explore more on these topicsItalyAntisemitismEuropeIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The US president said the issue had not come up, but that he did “not mind” the UK taking a position, even if he would not.Why is UK preparing to recognise Palestinian statehood?Read moreStarmer told his ministers that, because of the catastrophic situation on the ground inGazaand the diminishing prospect of reaching a two-state solution, now was the right time to finally move.“Ultimately, the only way to bring this humanitarian crisis to an end is through a long-term settlement,” he told reporters. “Our goal remains a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state, but right now, that goal is under pressure like never before.”He added: “I have always said that we will recognise a Palestinian state as a contribution to a proper peace process, at the moment of maximum impact for the two-state solution. With that solution now under threat, this is the moment to act.”UN-backed experts said a “worst-case scenario of famine” was playing out in Gaza as the World Food Programme (WFP) described the hunger crisis in the territory as the worst seen this century, comparing it to previous famines in Ethiopia and Biafra. Israel has denied its actions in Gaza have caused famine.It came as the death toll from Israeli attacks in the war passed 60,000 people according to Gaza health ministry figures, almost half of them women and children.Israel has repeatedly limited aid trucks reaching Gaza during 22 months of war, and halted shipments entirely for six weeks at the start of the war, and between March and mid-May this year.Shipments are below levels needed to cover basic needs and the WFP says only about half of the aid it has requested to enter Gaza is reaching the territory after Israel eased restrictions over the weekend.In a significant shift in the UK’s approach, Starmer said that recognition would take place before the UN general assembly in New York this September, unless Israel agreed to a series of conditions set out in the UK-led eight-point peace plan, and backed by allies.These were for Israel to take “substantive steps” to end the situation in Gaza, reach a ceasefire, commit to no annexation in the West Bank, as well as a long-term peace process. Starmer spoke to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, before the announcement.Israel’s foreign ministry last night told Starmer it “rejects” his statement, which it said on social media site X amounted to a “reward for Hamas”.“The shift in the British government’s position at this time, following the French move and internal political pressures, constitutes a reward for Hamas and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages,” it added.Netanyahu posted on X that Starmer had rewarded “Hamas’s monstrous terrorism”.“A jihadist state on Israel’s border today will threaten Britain tomorrow,” he added.The UK government also repeated its existing demands of Hamas, which it said must release all hostages immediately, disarm, sign up to a ceasefire and accept it would play no role in the government of Gaza.“We’ll make an assessment in September on how far the parties have met these steps, but no one should have a veto over our decision,” the prime minister added.However, there was some domestic pushback from the Liberal Democrats and the Greens against the government using the prospect of statehood as a “bargaining chip”. They both argued the UK should recognise Palestine immediately.The UK roadmap follows an agreement to work towards “lasting peace” in the region with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, at the weekend. Starmer spent Tuesday evening on calls to allies.After their talks in Scotland on Monday, Trump removed a key obstacle to the UK recognising a Palestinian state, signalling the US – one of Israel’s strongest backers – would not object to such a move. He alsoexpressed concernat images of children starving in the territory.However, a spokesperson for the US state department on Tuesday evening called Starmer’s remarks a “slap in the face for the victims of October 7”.“It gives one group hope, and that’s Hamas. It is a rewarding of that kind of behaviour,” Tammy Bruce said, adding: “There’s one group that benefits from the images, the reality of the horribleness, and that’s Hamas. And so there’s a reason why they don’t cooperate and stop.”Downing Street had insisted that formal recognition of Palestine was a matter of “when, not if”, with the Labour government facing calls to take further action as UK public opinion hardened over horrific scenes on the ground.Britons are in favour of recognition by more than three to one, according to polling by Survation, which shows 49% of people in favour, and only 13% opposed. It also suggested that, by a margin of almost five to one, people wanted the government to be more critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza.Starmer told reporters the humanitarian situation, which was “getting worse by the day”, was behind the timing of the UK’s decision, along with concerns that the possibility of a two-state solution was receding. The UK has worked with Jordan to drop 20 tonnes of aid by air in recent days.“We’ve been saying for some considerable time now we need to get more aid in at volume and at speed, and the situation now is absolutely catastrophic, which is why I’ve taken this decision today in relation to the two-state solution and the recognition of Palestine,” he said.The Guardianrevealed last weekthat Starmer was under pressure from cabinet ministers for the UK to immediately recognise Palestine as a state, joining almost 140 other countries, as global outcry grew over Israel’s killing of starving civilians in Gaza.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister,Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, are understood to have been among them, while more than a third of Labour MPs signed a letter backing recognition.Announcing the move at the UN, foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK hoped it could affect the situation on the ground in Gaza over the next eight weeks.He added the UK, which first supported the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine in 1917, bore a “special burden of responsibility” to back a two-state solution.“The Netanyahu government’s rejection of a two-state solution is wrong; it’s wrong morally; and it’s wrong strategically. It harms the interests of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace,” he said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

According to the coalition, IDF soldiers beat and choked the American labor activist Chris Smalls, who was onboard the ship. Smalls is most well-known for co-founding the Amazon Labor Union.The Handala, which carried food, baby formula, diapers and medicine, was attempting to breach Israel’s blockade of Gaza, as Palestinians there continue to starve in what UN-backed hunger experts have called a“worst-case scenario of famine”that is unfolding.“The Freedom Flotilla Coalition confirms that upon arrival in Israeli custody, US human rights defender Chris Smalls was physically assaulted by seven uniformed individuals. They choked him and kicked him in the legs, leaving visible signs of violence on his neck and back,” the Freedom Flotilla Coalition wrote in a statementposted on Instagramon Tuesday morning.“When his lawyer met with him, Chris was surrounded by six members of Israel’s special police unit. This level of force was not used against other abducted activists. We condemn this violence against Chris and demand accountability for the assault and discriminatory treatment he faced.”Smalls, the only Black person onboard the boat, was one of 21 members of the group who were detained. Others included 19 civilians, including parliamentarians, medics and engineers, and two journalists. Jacob Berger, a Jewish American actor whoshared on Instagramthat Smalls was in “great spirits” after his detention – everyone else who was detained, he said, should be released on Tuesday or Wednesday.The interception of the Handala came as more than 30 Israeli public figures called for“crippling sanctions”over Israel’s starvation of Gaza. Donald Trump saidhe wanted“to make sure [Gazans] get the food, every ounce of food” during a recent meeting with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer.The Handala was not the first effort by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to deliver aid to Gaza. Previous attempts, including one in June in which Greta Thunberg was arrested, were also intercepted by Israel. In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 activists setting sail for Gaza on the Mavi Marmara.“We are calling on others around the world, definitely our countries, to live up to their obligation of enforcing international law, of protecting human rights, but also other institutions that are founded to do the same,” said Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American attorney and Handala member, in an appearance on Monday onDemocracy Now. “We should not be waiting for Israel to give permission for food or other humanitarian aid to enter … we need to be breaking, challenging and breaking the blockade.”While they were onboard the flotilla, Araf said that the US government did not make contact with the seven American members of the crew, though France, Spain and Italy contacted their citizens to offer consular services after their detention. It is not yet clear if Smalls or any other American citizens have been contacted since their detention.They were “legitimizing Israeli piracy on the high seas. And that is unacceptable to us,” she said, referring to countries that offered services following the illegal boarding in international waters.“And that is the kind of impunity that our governments, all governments, really, have been allowing Israel to just violate international law.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS unionsGazaAidMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Last Tuesday,Keir Starmerbatted away all invitations to recognise the state of Palestine. It wasn’t happening. Keir was committed to being appalled by the situation in Gaza but not appalled enough to do anything about it.He then received a letter from more than 250 MPs, including some cabinet ministers, later in the week begging him to recognise the state of Palestine. He still stonewalled. The time was not yet right.Not even the opinion polls that showed most of the UK population supported the recognition of Palestine could move him. Keir knew best. Safety first. Don’t do anything to rock the boat.Few were expecting that much of the emergency cabinet meeting to discussGaza. Some slightly stronger words to reflect the level of feeling among some cabinet ministers maybe. But still leaving himself some wriggle room. A balancing act that was sure to leave almost everyone feeling unhappy.But then the readout. The message was unequivocal. The UK was going to recognise the state of Palestine before the next meeting of the UN general assembly in September unless the Israelis got their act together and committed to a ceasefire, allowed substantial aid into Gaza, got serious about a long-term peace plan, withdrew from the West Bank and accepted a two-state solution.Moments later, Starmer popped up in the Downing Street media room for a brief, five-minute statement to confirm the government’s position. The time for action had come. No more equivocation or delay. It could be sooner, it could be later, but there was no way of blocking a Palestinian state. Hamas had to release the hostages and step aside. Benjamin Netanyahu had to act in good faith or accept the inevitable. The UK could no longer stand to one side and watch a humanitarian disaster unfold.In a neat piece of timing, no sooner had Keir finished addressing the UK than David Lammy came on stage at the UN to repeat the message. The UK was done with pleading with both sides to act responsibly. The UN had passed resolution after resolution, demanding that the war in the Middle East come to an end and aid got through to a starving civilian population.Enough was enough. Britain had played a unique role in the history of the area with the Balfour declaration and the creation of a Jewish homeland. But the UK had also made a promise to the Palestinian people that they should have the right to their own land and to live in peace. Now was the time to no longer pay lip service to the idea of a two-state solution and right the historical injustice.“I feel the hand of history on our shoulders,” Lammy said in a deliberate echo of Tony Blair’s words on the Northern Ireland peace process. The chamber broke out in spontaneous applause as he left the stage after confirming that the UK would recognise the state of Palestine in just over a month’s time.It was also a sign that Keir had played a blinder during his meeting with President Trump in Scotland the day before. That hadn’t been the easiest day out for the prime minister. But Starmer has proved himself to be one of the best wranglers of The Donald on the world stage. Knowing when to keep his mouth shut and let Agent Orange just ramble.A narcissist is always going to be greedy for attention and Keir had been happy to sit back and let Trump be Trump. Let him boast about having ended six wars – though weirdly The Donald had reined that back to just five in a media appearance on Tuesday. Almost certainly still five too many, but no one was counting. Let him indulge his own vanity. Give him the Nobel peace prize if he really wants it. There were bigger prizes on offer. And the biggest of them all had been Gaza.There will still be some who think the UK could have reached this position weeks ago. But Keir was not bothered about them. He’s a man who operates at his own pace and to his own lawyerly methods. Everything must be squared away. No surprises left.This had been a good day for Starmer and the UK. A better day for the starving Palestinians. A day when a world leader had shown some leadership.

We told him, ‘There are a lot of people here, there are kids – don’t shoot!’ But he shot anyway. Awdah wasn’t even involved.”The killing comes amid an increasing wave of settler and Israeli military violence against Palestinians in the occupiedWest Bank. At least 1,009 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000 injured in the West Bank since October 2023.Accountability for settlers who commit acts of violence against Palestinians is rare. Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law.According to activists from Umm al-Khair in the south Hebron Hills, the killing happened after a settler in a bulldozer drove through their land, destroying trees and property.The village sits right below the Israeli settlement of Carmel, founded in 1980.When a resident approached to ask the driver of the bulldozer to stop, the driver knocked him down with the blade of the bulldozer. Residents began to throw stones, and Levi allegedly emerged from the settlement and began firing, the eyewitnesses said. Awdah Hathaleen, who was standing a distance away from the confrontation, was then struck by a bullet.Alaa said: “Yesterday morning, we were laughing and joking. I didn’t know it’d be the last time I’d see him. I carried him here. His blood was everywhere.”About a dozen Israeli soldiers raided the mourning tent, pushing those attending out while keeping a thumb on the pin of a stun grenade. Soldiers declared the area a closed military zone and said only residents of the village could be present. They arrested two activists and threw stun grenades at journalists who were too slow to leave.“Coming to the place that he was killed, where they killed him, and kicking people out? This is not a life, this is against any law in the world,” said Alaa as soldiers pushed him out of the tent.Despite the area being a closed military zone, residents later sent a video of a settler operating a bulldozer in the village.The killing of Awdah Hathaleen prompted a wave of sympathy and condemnation, with the French foreign ministry calling settler violence “a matter of terrorism”.“France condemns this murder in the strongest terms and all the deliberate violence perpetrated by extremist settlers against the Palestinian population that are proliferating throughout the West Bank,” the foreign ministry said, calling on the Israeli government to hold Hathaleen’s killer accountable.Hathaleen was a father of three and resident of Masafer Yatta, a string of hamlets located on the hills south of Hebron, which have been declared a military zone by Israel. The efforts to prevent Israeli forces from destroying their homes was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary.“My dear friend Awdah was slaughtered this evening,” Basel Adra, the Palestinian co-director of the No Other Land documentary, wrote. “He was standing in front of the community centre in his village when a settler fired a bullet that pierced his chest and took his life. This is how Israel erases us – one life at a time.”Activists shared the last message Hathaleen sent before being killed, in which he urged people to act to stop settler encroachment on Umm al-Khair.“The settlers are working behind our houses and … they tried to cut the main water pipe for the community … If you can reach people like the Congress, courts, whatever, please do everything,” Hathaleen wrote.The Palestinian Authority’s education ministry accused Israeli settlers in the West Bank of killing the activist, writing on social media that Hathaleen “was shot dead by settlers … during their attack on the village of Umm al-Khair” near Hebron, in the south of the occupied territory.The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, and said an armed “Israeli civilian” opened fire on a group of people hurling rocks. The Israeli police said they arrested one Israeli citizen for questioning and that they were investigating the incident, while the military arrested seven people from Umm al-Khair, including two international solidarity activists.“Following the incident, the death of a Palestinian was confirmed,” the police added.A police representative said during Levi’s remand hearing that Levi and a minor were attacked by stone throwers and that it appeared as if “their lives were in danger”.Michael Sfard, one of Israel’s leading human rights lawyers, said settlers enjoyed “near complete impunity” in Israel.Famine under way in Gaza, UN-backed experts sayRead more“Justice that in the past has made appearances at the rate of miracles disappeared completely. So settler violence is state violence, and it serves Israeli political and ideological interests,” Sfard said.Trump removed thesanctions Biden imposedon Levi and more than a dozen other extremist settlers and organisations that terrorise Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank,on his first day in officein January.Levi is under both EU and UK sanctions.Hathaleen also documented the campaign of forced expulsions and demolitions for the Israeli-Palestinian magazine +972.Last week, in a report headlined“In Umm al-Khair, the occupation is damning us to multigenerational trauma”,he wrote: “The demolition forces enter the village. All the children run to their mothers, who scramble to salvage whatever they can from their homes before it’s too late. Everyone watches on anxiously to see who will be made homeless today. The bulldozers gather in the centre of the village and then stop. Soldiers disembark. The villagers look each other in the eye, searching for words of comfort, but there are none. Our children ask us why this is happening, but we have no answers.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He said that the UK will recognise the state of Palestine in September, before UNGA, unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, reaches a ceasefire, makes clear there will be no annexation in the West Bank, and commits to a long-term peace process that delivers a two state solution. He reiterated that there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas and that our demands on Hamas remain, that they must release all the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, accept that they will play no role in the government of Gaza, and disarm.ShareUpdated at12.22 EDT"

It is designed to ensure continuity of service while the company is stabilised and restructured.There is a bespoke special administration regime (SAR) for the water industry, which was created in 1991 and is designed to prioritise customers and services while putting financial interests second.Reed has saidthat the government is stepping up preparations to take Thames Water into special administration, indicating he will reject pleas from the company’s creditors for leniency from fines and penalties.Thames Water’s largest creditors control the utility and have made efforts tocut some of its debts and have offered to provide £5.3bnin new funding to try to turn it around.But River Action’s head of legal, Emma Dearnaley, said the time to use the SAR process was now. “Enough is enough,” she said. “Why hasn’t the secretary of state used special administration to fix the water sector, starting with ThamesWater?“The government has the power but won’t use it, or even explain when it might trigger this process. Apparently, the government has no policy at all. That’s a fundamental failure of transparency and accountability, and it’s unlawful.”River Action has lodged an application for a judicial review against the secretary of state.The claim argues that the government has failed to publish its policy on when it would use the SAR process, breaching core public law duties, and that ministers have failed to develop a policy at all, breaching obligations under habitats regulations and other planning and environmental laws.Under section 24 of the Water Industry Act 1991, special administration can be triggered by a water company’s failure to meet performance standards, including environmental pollution, and a breach of its statutory or licence duties in ways that are “serious enough to make it inappropriate for the company to continue to hold its licence”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s absolutely devastating for the family and the local community,” said the local MP, Labour’s Neil Coyle.“Thankfully, police say this was an isolated incident … there’s no further risk to the public.”He added: “Lots of people will be shaken. As the local MP, I want to send my condolences to the family and everyone directly affected. But this is a safe community.”Coyle urged any witness to contact the police, adding: “My message to the community is this: if you saw anything, please come forward. And if you didn’t, but you’re worried, know that this remains a safe area.”Police were called to reports of stabbings inside a commercial address in Long Lane, Southwark, at 1pm on Monday. The Metropolitan police said the attack was not being treated as terror-related and detectives from its specialist crime command were leading the investigation.Officers said the next of kin of the victims had been informed, and were being supported by specialist officers.DCS Emma Bond, who leads policing for the area, said: “Our thoughts are, first and foremost, with the family and friends of the victims of this tragic incident. Our investigation continues at pace and we are working hard to understand the full circumstances.“I understand there may be concern in the local community and there will be an increased police presence in the area over the coming days. I would also encourage anyone who may be worried to speak to an officer.”Scotland Yard said the incident took place in a “business premises”, and added: “A crime scene is in place at a nearby hotel where the arrested man went into. We are aware of speculation the man was staying at the hotel – this is not the case.”The stabbings are understood to have taken place near the property development firm the Trademark Group, where the victims worked.A resident, who asked not to be named, told the PA news agency: “It’s terrifying. I walk past there all the time – it makes you feel really uneasy. You just don’t expect something like this to happen on a normal weekday.”Natasha Ennin, Southwark council’s cabinet member for community safety and neighbourhoods, said on Monday: “I’m horrified and deeply saddened by the deaths of two men in our borough. My heartfelt condolences go to their families and friends.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The likelihood may have increased since then given that vaping and smoking rates among teenagers have both risen in the past seven years.VapingThe academics wrote that although the research did not establish a causal link, their findings were “especially concerning” given the rising popularity of vaping, “despite some initial assurances that e-cigarettes would have little appeal to [adolescents]”.“The success of previous tobacco control efforts and broad shifts in intergenerational risk factors in reducing risk of cigarette smoking may be mitigated when adolescents use e-cigarettes,” they wrote.Figures compiled by Action on Smoking and Healththis year show that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain have tried vaping, an estimated 1.1 million children. This was the same level as in 2023, after the number of children using vapes in the previous three years had tripled. Smoking among youths also increased from 14% in 2023 to 21% in 2025.The research, led by the University of Michigan andpublishedin the Tobacco Control journal, drew on intergenerational data from three nationally representative birth cohorts of UK teens born in 1958, 1970 and 2001.The overall likelihood of cigarette smoking for an average teen (aged 16 or 17) was calculated as 30% for those born in 1958, 22% for those born in 1970, and 9.5% for those born in 2001.Number of vape shops in England rises by almost 1,200% in a decadeRead moreThe odds of smoking among 16- and 17-year-olds were estimated based on a common set of childhood risk factors, which included teen vaping for the youngest cohort. Some sociodemographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity, were unaccounted for due to insufficient sample sizes in the earlier cohorts.Risk factors included whether they had ever drunk alcohol by age 16 or 17; how engaged they were with education at school; poor impulse control reported by the main caregiver at ages 10 or 11; and parental occupation, education and smoking behaviour – including during pregnancy. The researchers found these risks remained broadly similar across the three cohorts.Analysis showed a steep decline in the prevalence of cigarette smoking among teens, falling from 33% in 1974 to 25% in 1986 and 12% in 2018.The researchers suggested the decline in the prevalence of teen smoking was the result of tobacco control laws, better public understanding of the health impacts of smoking and a shift away from the perception of smoking as socially acceptable.The study showed that other behaviours that contributed to the risk of smoking have changed over time.For example, the percentage of teens who had started drinking by the age of 16 or 17 fell from 94% for the oldest cohort to 83% in the youngest.The average age at which mothers left education rose from 15.5 in the oldest cohort to 17 in the youngest, the prevalence of parental smoking fell from above 70% in the oldest to 27% in the youngest cohort, and fewer mothers continued smoking while pregnant.Steve Turner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the research was “incredibly concerning”.“A major concern about children and young people vaping is that this age group is particularly sensitive to developing a lifelong addiction to the nicotine contained in the vapes. We know that nicotine addiction is harmful,” he said.“We have all worked so hard to stop young people from smoking and vaping may have undone decades of work.“Smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the UK. We all must take urgent steps to prevent young people from being drawn into smoking by vaping.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleVapingSmokingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is being developed as a film by Parker’s company Pretty Matches Productions and MA Productions.Sarah Jessica Parker gets a ‘golden ticket’ to the judging panel of 2025 Booker prizeRead more“It is not uncommon for judges to have a connection to authors whose work has been submitted, so all judges have to declare any conflicts of interest at the outset,” said Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation.“AsSarah Jessica Parkerpublished Claire Adam’s first novel, Golden Child, under her US imprint SJP for Hogarth, she declared the potential conflict to ensure transparency and only gave her view on the book after the other judges had shared theirs. No book can go through if it is supported by one judge alone, and Love Forms has earned its place on the Booker prize 2025 longlist through the active support of other judges on the panel.”In an interview with thethe Irish Timespublished in June, Adam said that the film option “was bought by a small production company in LA (MA Productions), and we’re all so thrilled that SJP’s Pretty Matches Productions is on board as well. Film stuff moves slowly, there are a zillion obstacles, and her supporting the project is fantastic.”Pretty Matches Productions, founded in 2005, is also behind the Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That … and the HBO series Divorce, which Parker executive produced and starred in.In aninterview with the Timesin June, Adam said that Parker “reads loads and so it was really fun to hang out with her. She’s so lovely and sincere. She read the book cover to cover and got up at 5am to travel to meet me.” Golden Child is published in the UK by Faber, and in 2019 won the Desmond Elliott prize.In June 2023, Parker launched SJP Lit, in partnership with the independent publisher Zando, which has published titles including These Days by Lucy Caldwell and The Story of the Forest by Linda Grant. Parker also shares book recommendations on her Instagram account.Parker wasannounced as a judgeof this year’s Booker prize in December, with Wood saying at the time that she had “enjoyed sharing book recommendations with Sarah Jessica, who has passionately supported contemporary fiction for many years”.The 2025 judging panel is chaired by Roddy Doyle, and Parker’s co-judges are Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀, Kiley Reid and Chris Power.Adam was named as one of 13 longlisted authors, which include the former winner Kiran Desai, Tash Aw and David Szalay. The shortlist will be revealed on 23 September, with the winner announced on 10 November.Explore more on these topicsBooker prizeSarah Jessica ParkerAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

He asked Swinney to stand for applause in front of other guests and described him as a “very special guy”.He also said the UK prime minister, Kier Starmer, was “very gracious”.Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Swinney said: “I think there’s a willingness for President Trump to look at the issues that I’ve set out to him. I don’t think that was the position a few days ago, because I think President Trump was of the view that the trade deal was done and dusted and that was an end of the matter.”The UK and USsigned a trade deal in Junebut it did not protect every sector from tariffs.The president had been asked about whisky tariffs by journalists at his Turnberry resort in Ayrshire on Monday, when he appeared not to realise there was an issue.“We’ll talk about that, I didn’t know whisky was a problem,” Trump said. “I’m not a big whisky drinker but maybe I should be.”Swinney also used Tuesday’s formal meeting to discuss the starvation crisis in Gaza. He said later: “I implored President Trump to use his immense influence on the Israeli government to end the unbearable, unjust, and inhumane situation unfolding in Gaza, and to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis we are witnessing.”Trump played a round on the new course before returning to RAF Lossiemouth to fly back to Washington DC, where he said he was needed to “put out fires all over the world”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpScotlandTrade policyJohn SwinneyTariffsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

It has meanwhile ramped up immigration arrest operations with prospective daily quotas of 3,000 arrests per day.Such moves have piled pressure on industries across theUS economy– including the food, hospitality, construction, transportation and care sectors – which rely on large numbers of migrants to do essential work.At a GE Appliances plant in Louisville, Kentucky, more than 125 workers were abruptly forced out of their jobs in the spring due to programs cancelled as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown, according to an employee. GE Appliances makes home appliances including refrigerators, microwaves and dishwashers.“In three different buildings, on a couple of different shifts, stewards reported that they lost production so they weren’t able to make all the products they were supposed to make,” said Jess Reese, a replacement operator at the plant and organizer for IUE-CWA Local 83761. “It was hard to cover certain job tasks on the assembly line, and so that created chaos, and it was just hard to get things done.”Reese expressed concern about the threat of more workers being forced out.Trump’s efforts to revokeprotected status could impact an additional 200 union members next February, she said. “Hundreds of workers kind of disappearing at the drop of a hat is no joke, as we’ve seen with the last wave of mass terminations.”A spokesperson for GE Appliances said: “We added additional staffing where needed and continue to follow the law.”At a Kraft-Heinz plant in Holland, Michigan, meanwhile, workers are said to have been mandated to work overtime. The firm is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world, behind brands including Philadelphia cream cheese and Jell-O deserts.“We had people there for 20 years, and all of a sudden they get notification their immigration authorization is revoked,” Tomas Torres, a maintenance mechanic of 13 years, and president of RWDSU Local 705. “And they can’t be there anymore, and that just puts a strain on everybody,.“The lack of people on the lines. There are employees running two machines; it should be one person per machine. Manager and supervisors are all stressed out,and cancelling vacations for people because they don’t have enough to run the machines.”Undocumented builders face unchecked exploitation amid Trump raids: ‘It’s more work, less pay’Read moreTorres has been working 12- to 14-hour days, he said: part of a first shift, all of a second shift, and part of a third shift.“I’m tired. And you catch people falling asleep on the line, and it’s a big safety issue,” he added. “All of this that has happened has affected everybody at the plant. It’s crazy, because I hear people complain every single day.”Kraft Heinz refuted the plant is experiencing labor shortages due to immigration policy changes, but did not say how many workers were lost at the plant due to the changes.“Kraft Heinz has strict work authorization verification processes that comply with all applicable laws and regulations,” said the firm in a statement. “Overtime is driven by the needs of the business, and we are currently in one of our busiest seasons of the year.”As Trump’s officials press ahead, economists have warned that deporting millions of immigrants from the US could have drastic consequences. The Economic Policy Instituteestimatedthis month that 4 million deportations would result in the loss of 3.3 million jobs held by immigrants in the US and 2.6 million US-born employees, hitting industries including construction and childcare.The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative thinktank, meanwhile found that Trump’s immigration policies would likely lead to a negative net migration into the US for the first time in decades and result in a decrease in US gross domestic product of between 0.3% and 0.4%, or $70.5bn to $94bn in economic output, annually.“One day they are there,” said Maria Jose Padmore, a human services assistant for Fairfax County in Virginia. “And the next day, I’m looking for my coworker, and he’s gone because their Temporary Protected Status expired.“Forget about the fact that I now have to share my coworkers’ job. Let’s think about my coworkers’ family: how are they going to put food on their table?”Padmore was speaking at a panel on how Trump’s immigration polices are affecting workers, organized by the AFL-CIO in Washington DC this month. Gwen Mills, President of Unite Here, the largest hospitality union in the US, said they were “wreaking havoc across the families of our coworkers and in our communities”.“Oftentimes within the labor movement, we find ourselves divided by industries,” said Jimmy Williams, president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, which represents construction workers. “When it comes to immigration, it’s gotta be the one single thing that puts a thread between a hotel worker, a construction worker, a service worker, a public employee, a teacher. This is something that affects every single working person in this country.”The Trump administration alleges that CHNV and other temporary protected status programs were abused, a claim challenged by groups such asRefugees International.“There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump’s agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration’s commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws,” said Abigail Jackson, White House spokesperson.But its policies are already causing apprehension on the factory floor. “This has a real impact on immigrant workers, obviously, but it also has a real impact on non immigrant workers,” Reese, at the GE Appliances plant in Louisville, said. “It’s really important that we stick together, because we all want the same things.“We want safe workplaces. We want good wages. We all want to go home to our family in one piece. We want to live in a safe place. We want to be free. These are things we all share, and we’re only going to get that stuff if we stick together.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS economyUS immigrationDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The EU said the US’s reference to commitments to “address non-tariff barriers affecting trade in food and agricultural products including streamlining requirements for sanitary certificates for US pork and dairy products” did not amount to any lowering of its red-line rules on food standards.It is known that the European Commission has also made a commitment to the UK to streamline veterinary certification processes applying to British food exports post-Brexit.

Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable.As Trump’s tariff regime becomes clear, Americans may start to foot the billRead moreThe analysis, released on Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell histariffsto the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs.Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He is prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%.The USstock markethas shown relief the tariff rates are not as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices.“We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland.Trump’s tariffs to face major court test brought by US small business ownersRead moreBut there is the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy.A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs on to US consumers through higher prices. Labor department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out on Friday.The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than one in five jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes.The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the US.The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” a White House spokesman, Kush Desai, said.There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” actgoes before a US appeals court on Thursday.The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s Kudlow show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the US market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said.But what Bessent did not say is US manufacturers are also paying much of that toll.“We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan manufacturing company in Belding, Michigan, north-east of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949.The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material – steel coil – rise 5% to 10% this year.Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan manufacturing does not buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic US steelmakers to hike prices.Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said.Explore more on these topicsBusinessDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS economyTariffsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "10.14 EDTClosing summary: US seeks 'escalation dominance' even as tariffs hurt economyThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is clear that the US tariffs on most trading partners will beharmful to global growth. One of the key questions is how the harms will be spread.Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, said the tariffs will reduce activity and gradually it will also translate into higher prices in the US – even as he revealed a slightly higher growth forecast than expected.Philip Luck, director of the economics programme at the Washington-basedCenter for Strategic and International Studies, said that the US has essentially aimed to convince other nations that it can take more pain – warding them off significant retaliation. He said:This success in avoiding retaliation likely stems from credible signaling of “escalation dominance”—essentially convincing partners that entering a cycle of economic retaliation would be more costly for them than for the United States.There are also more signs of discontent in the EU – which could feel particularly hard done by if other countries face a “world tariff” of 15%. That would be the same level that the EU agreed to much fanfare. Reuters reported:German Economy MinisterKatherina Reichesaid on Tuesday that the European Union is currently negotiating with the United States from a position of weakness and emphasized the need for a change in approach.The EU will closely measure the United States against the commitments made in Sunday’s tariff deal, Reiche said, adding that the new tariffs would bring an enormous burden.Modupe Adegbembo, an economist at Jefferies, an investment bank, said the EU deal meant the worst-case scenario of 30–50% tariffs has been avoided.While the agreed tariffs still represent a sharp increase from the pre-April average of just 1.2% to 17.5%, firms can now plan with greater confidence despite the higher costs. Over the longer term, however, this substantial rise in tariffs will materially increase the cost of US market access for EU exporters and may weigh on business sentiment.Although the absolute cost of exporting to the US has risen, the EU’s relative competitiveness has improved. The new 15% baseline tariff is higher than the 10% faced by UK exporters, but remains more favorable than the 30% applied to Chinese goods and is on par with Japan’s 15%. This positioning could help cushion the impact on export volumes, even as firms adjust to the new trade environment.In other business and economics news:Barclaysbank’s second quarterprofits rose 28%to £2.5bn, beating consensus estimates for £2.2bn.Donald Trump said the UK’s taxes onNorth Sea oil“make no sense” and called for incentivising production.Stellantis, the maker of the Fiat, Jeep and Vauxhall car brands, has said that itexpects a €1.5bn hit from tariffsthis year.Anglian Waterhas beenordered to pay £62.8mby the water regulator, Ofwat, over failures in managing its wastewater treatment works and network that meant it was unable to cope with sewage flows.Trade talks between theUS and Chinacontinued in Sweden, with anextension of a deadline likely, according to the Trump administration.You can continue to follow our live coverage from around the world:Gaza needs to be ‘flooded with large-scale food aid’ to prevent mass starvation, says World Food Programme – Middle East crisis liveRead moreStarmer to hold emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza amid calls to recognise Palestinian state – UK politics liveRead moreZelenskyy says at least 22 people killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine, hours after Trump put pressure on Moscow – Europe liveRead moreGunman who killed four people in New York building was targeting NFL headquarters, mayor says – follow liveRead moreEngland victory parade: fans join Lionesses in London after Euro 2025 triumph – liveRead moreThank you for following today again, and please do join me bright and early tomorrow.

The continent’s two other major railroads – Canadian National and CPKC – may also get involved.Union Pacific is offering $20bn cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.Union Pacific’s stock was up nearly 2% at $231.03 in pre-market trading after the announcement while Norfolk Southern’s stock dipped more than 2% to $280.Union Pacific chief executive officer, Jim Vena, who has been championing the potential benefits of a rail merger, said this deal could make it possible for lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh to all reach their destinations more seamlessly.“Railroads have been an integral part of building America since the Industrial Revolution, and this transaction is the next step in advancing the industry,” Vena said.The merged railroads would have an advantage over the other US railroads because they won’t have to hand off shipments in the middle of the country any more, enabling them to make deliveries more quickly and likely at a lower rate.Past rail mergers have also triggered additional consolidation in the industry. There used to be more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. But the industry has consolidated down to six major railroads that handle the majority of shipments nationwide.If BNSF is forced into the role of the acquirer, it will have resources to work with because Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348bn cash at Berkshire Hathaway that owns the railroad, and he could be interested in completing one last major deal before he gives up his CEO title at the end of the year.Buffett recently threw cool water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC – but, given that he rarely uses investment bankers, that doesn’t mean that he and his successor, Greg Abel, aren’t considering the options. After all, Buffett reached the agreement to buy the rest of BNSF for $26.3bn in a private meeting with the CEO in 2009.But there’s widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial industry.That’s largely because of the aftermath of an industry consolidation nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. Union Pacific merged with Southern Pacific in 1996, and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on US rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups on rails in the east.However, just two years ago, the STBapprovedthe first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31bn to create the CPKC railroad.But there were some unique factors in that CPKC deal that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America.Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRail industryMergers and acquisitionsRail transportnewsShareReuse this content"

And then on Sunday, the US president – flanked by a different leader of the European Commission – hailed another new era of transatlantic relations, another economic pact and declared: “I think it’s the biggest deal ever made.”Trumpian hyperbole can typically be relied upon as long as he’s in the room, at the lectern or typing into Truth Social. What matters after that is the underlying detail – and we have very little, beyond a handful of big numbers designed to grab headlines.Are US tariffs starting to bite? Trump, in denial over rising prices, targets Fed chief PowellRead moreWhat we do know, as a result of this deal, is that European exports to the US will face a blanket 15% tariff: a taxexpected, at least in part, to be passed along to US consumers. The price of key products shipped from the EU, from cars to medicine and wine, is about to come into sharp focus.This pact is not unique. Trump’sagreement with Japanalso hits Japanese exports to the US with a 15% tariff. Most British exports to the US face a 10% tariff under his deal with the UK.A string of countries without such accords, including Brazil, Canada and South Korea, areset to face even higher US tariffsfrom Friday. The Trump administration currently has a blanket 10% levy in place for US imports, although the president threatened to raise this to “somewhere in the 15 to 20% range” earlier this week.Ignore, for a moment, the chaos and the noise. Put to one side the unpredictable stewardship of the world’s largest economy, and its ties with the world. And forget the many U-turns, pauses and reprieves which have followed bold pronouncements,againandagainandagain.If you, like many businesses in the US and across the world, are struggling to keep up, take a step back and look at a single number. Since Trump took office, the average effective US tariff rate on all goods from overseas has soared to its highest level in almost a century: 18.2%,accordingto the Budget Lab at Yale.Trump argues this extraordinary jump in tariffs will bring in trillions of dollars to the US federal government. On his watch, tariffs haveso farbrought in tens of billions of dollars more in revenue this year than at the same point in 2024.But who picks up the bill? The president and his allies have position this fundamental shift in economic policy as a historic move away from taxing Americans toward taxing the world. But in reality, everyone pays.Tariffs are typically paid at the border, by the importer of the product affected. If the tariff on that product suddenly goes from 0% to 15%, the importer – as you’d expected – will try to pass it on. Every company at every stage of the supply chain will quite literally try to pass the buck, as much as possible.And the very end of the chain, economists expect prices will ultimately rise for consumers. The Budget Lab at Yale estimates the short-term impact of Trump’s tariffs so far is a 1.8% rise in US prices: equivalent to an average income loss of $2,400 per US household.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inflation, which Trump claims is very low in the US,picked up in June.The president appeared to reluctantly reckon with the reality that Americans may start to foot the bill for his tariffs before setting off for Scotland late last week.Asked about the prospect of using revenue from tariffs to distribute “rebate” checks to US consumers, Trump said: “We’re thinking about that, actually … We’re thinking about a rebate, because we have so much money coming in, from tariffs, that a little rebate for people of a certain income level might be very nice.”Given what inflation did to Joe Biden’s electoral fortunes, and Trump’s keen eye for populist policies, it’s hardly a stretch to imagine those cheques – signed by Donald J Trump – landing in bank accounts in time for the midterm elections next November.And such a move would, indeed, be very nice. Especially as it appears increasingly likely that, after this week, Americans will probably be paying more for almost everything.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionDonald TrumpTrump administrationInflationBrazilChinaanalysisShareReuse this content"

He asked Swinney to stand for applause in front of other guests and described him as a “very special guy”.He also said the UK prime minister, Kier Starmer, was “very gracious”.Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Swinney said: “I think there’s a willingness for President Trump to look at the issues that I’ve set out to him. I don’t think that was the position a few days ago, because I think President Trump was of the view that the trade deal was done and dusted and that was an end of the matter.”The UK and USsigned a trade deal in Junebut it did not protect every sector from tariffs.The president had been asked about whisky tariffs by journalists at his Turnberry resort in Ayrshire on Monday, when he appeared not to realise there was an issue.“We’ll talk about that, I didn’t know whisky was a problem,” Trump said. “I’m not a big whisky drinker but maybe I should be.”Swinney also used Tuesday’s formal meeting to discuss the starvation crisis in Gaza. He said later: “I implored President Trump to use his immense influence on the Israeli government to end the unbearable, unjust, and inhumane situation unfolding in Gaza, and to bring an end to the humanitarian crisis we are witnessing.”Trump played a round on the new course before returning to RAF Lossiemouth to fly back to Washington DC, where he said he was needed to “put out fires all over the world”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpScotlandTrade policyJohn SwinneyTariffsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The outlook for 2026 was upgraded from 3% to 3.1%. The global economy grew by 3.3% in 2024.Most regions benefited from the more benign economic outlook, including Britain, which is expected to grow by 1.2% this year – 0.1 percentage points higher than in the IMF’s April outlook – an upgrade it firstannounced in its annual review of the UK economy in May.Trump threatened in April to impose severe import tariffs on the world’s biggest exporters of goods, including the UK, EU, China and South Korea, to combat what the US president sees as unfair competition.Stock markets divedand the US dollar fell as investors, spooked by the potential hit to world trade, bought safe-haven assets.IMF growth forecasts chartThe US later delayed or reduced tariffs in return for commitments to buy US-made goods, reversing market falls as investors concluded“Trump always chickens out” – a trade nicknamed Taco for short.Trump ended months of speculation at the weekend over whether he would impose 30% tariffs on EU goods imports, saying he would limit the figure to 15% in exchange for concessions from the EU, including the purchase of US oil and gas worth almost £600bn. The French prime minister, François Bayrou, described the US-EU trade deal asa dark day for Europe.Japan recently agreed to buy Boeing planes as part of a deal tolimit tariffs on its exports to the US to 15%. Trump has also scaled back tariffs on Chinese goods, but only after Beijing retaliated by imposing punitive tariffs on rare earth metals needed by defence industry manufacturers.Gourinchas said the US had “partly reversed course”, reducing its effective tariff rate from 24% to about 17%, but that tariffs were still “historically high, and global policy remains highly uncertain, with only a few countries having reached fully fleshed-out trade agreements”.The White House has set a deadline of 1 August for several countries, including Vietnam and South Korea, to sign deals.“Without comprehensive agreements, the ongoing trade uncertainty could increasingly weigh on investment and activity,” Gourinchas said.He said the situation could also worsen should attacks on central banks intensify, undermining their authority. Trump has repeatedly called on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates,calling him a numbskullfor failing to do so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The evidence is overwhelming that independent central banks, with a narrow mandate to pursue price and economic stability, are essential to anchoring inflation expectations.“That central banks around the world achieved a successful ‘soft landing’ despite the recent surge in inflation owes a great deal to their independence and hard-earned credibility.”In line with how markets are betting, the IMF expects the Bank of England to cut interest rates twice this year to 3.75%, but said rising inflationary pressures in the US and the UK could undermine market expectations. The City expects the Bank to make the first reduction to 4% on Thursday next week.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the IMF’s forecasts meant the UK remained the fastest-growing European economy in the G7 “despite the global economic challenges we are facing”.Under pressure to overcome spending contraints to boost the economy, she said investment plans were on track in “city region transport, record funding for affordable homes, as well as backing major projects like Sizewell C”.Trade data released on Tuesday showed that imports of goods into the US fell by $11.5bn (£8.6bn) in June, to $264.2bn, after a rise in imports earlier this year as companies tried to beat Trump’s tariffs.This narrowed the US trade deficit to $86bn in June, down from $96.4bn in May.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Private-hire firms declared the verdict to be a “triumph for the sector” after athree-year legal battle, which they had said could end with fares rising sharply for passengers.Uber had brought the case after a2021 supreme court decisionthat its drivers were workers, which had an impact on its tax and other obligations.The company sought a declaration that private-hire taxi operators enter into a contract with passengers and the high court in London ruled in its favour in 2023.That decision meant that operators would have to pay VAT at 20%, but the ruling was reversed by the court of appeal in July last year after a challenge by the private hire operators Delta Taxis and the platform Veezu.Uber appealed to the supreme court, which on Tuesday unanimously dismissed the US company’s case.The Veezu chief legal officer, Nia Cooper, said: “This decision is a triumph for the UK private-hire sector. The unanimous verdict ends a three-year legal battle and confirms that operators can continue to choose which business model they adopt to run their business.”She said the outcome would protect passengers from threatened fare increases and lessen the burdens on licensing authorities. “Uber was seeking a declaration that would have resulted in 20% VAT being charged on all PHV fares,” she said.“This ruling also shows that British-owned businesses can stand up against global giants that attempt to use litigation as a tactic to shape the sector to suit their business model.”An Uber spokesperson said: “The supreme court ruling confirms that different contractual protections apply for people booking trips in London compared to the rest of England and Wales. The ruling has no impact on Uber’s application of VAT, which has been upheld twice by other courts.”In a separate case, the Estonian ride-hailing and food-delivery startup Bolt this year defeated an appeal by the UK tax authority HMRC on what exactly it has to pay VAT on at 20%.HMRC has since been granted permission to challenge the ruling that Bolt is only liable for VAT on its margin, rather than the full cost of the trip, at the court of appeal.Explore more on these topicsUberTransportLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The shooting – which seriously injured an NFL employee, according to a staff email sent by the commissioner, Roger Goodell – marks a new chapter in the league’s decades-long history of denying concerns about long-term effects of head injuries in the sport. “Study my brain, please,” reads Tamura’s note. “I’m sorry.”What to know about the victims of the New York City skyscraper shootingRead moreWhatever the truth that eventually emerges from Tamura’s medical problems, his note is sure to reopen the existential debate that nearly stalled football’s surging popularity during the 2010s.Short for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE is a progressive disease associated with physical contact that causes the brain to bang against the inside of the skull. In CTE cases, a protein called tau overdevelops in the brain, choking off blood vessels and the neural pathways that abet memory and impulse control. Some direct effects of CTE include mood disorders, cognitive impairments and behavioral changes; often, it results in dementia. Crucially, CTE can only be diagnosed posthumously.CTE was identified almost a century ago in boxers who exhibited memory loss, impaired gait and other symptoms of neurological decline. (They called CTE “punch-drunk” syndrome back then.) And while the disease has since emerged in hockey, soccer and other full-contact team sports, it’s football that holds the greatest potential for CTE. Many associate the game with its big hits, but the repeated collisions in between (often characterized as mini-car crashes) have just as much chance to lead to CTE over time, if not more so.Helmets, despite what manufacturers and the league itself may claim, offer scant protection. The longer one plays, the greater potential there is to become afflicted with CTE – which makes the risksespecially acute for competitors who start younglike Tamura, who played in high school. Starting in 2018, a number of state lawmakers introduced legislation toprohibit children under the age of 12from playing tackle football – but few of those proposals made it out of committee.The NFL has long been aware of the head injury threats to its players, forming a committee specifically to address mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) as early as 1994. Eight years later, fans were blindsided by the death of Mike Webster, a cornerstone of thePittsburgh Steelers1970s-era dynasty.In retirement, Webster was diagnosed with amnesia, dementia and depression. He lived out of his pickup truck andelectroshocked himself to sleep. Following Webster’s death at age 50, he became the NFL’s first CTE case after the forensic neuropathologist Bennet Omalu examined his brain tissue. Omalu and his peer neurospecialists published research linking football to CTE, highlighting Webster and Terry Long – a Steelers teammate who also suffered from depression and died by suicide at age 45. But when Omalu’s findings were presented to Goodell at a league-wide concussion summit in 2007, Ira Casson, the Long Island neurologist who co-chaired the NFL’s MTBI committee, flagrantly dismissed them.The NFL’s CTE casualties would only mount from there. In particular, four players had their brains posthumously donated to Boston University’s CTE Center, the foremost database of its kind, and the findings ratcheted up concerns about the disease’s impact in professional football to an unprecedented level. Dave Duerson, a Chicago Bears hero who found more post-retirement success in the business world, sent textsinstructing family members to donate his brainto science before shooting himself in the chest in 2011. Junior Seau, a hall of fame linebacker for the San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots who was renowned as the NFL’s happy warrior, killed himself inmuch the same fashion in 2012.View image in fullscreenSan Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau during an NFL game against the Washington Redskins at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, on 9 September 2001.Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesAaron Hernandez – a preternaturally talented receiver who was tied to the murder of three people,one of them a friend–killed himself in prisonin 2017 at age 27 and was later diagnosed withthe worst case of CTEever found in a young person. (He took up the game at five years old.) In 2021 Phillip Adams, a veteran of five NFL teams who shot and killed five people in his South Carolina home town before shooting himself, was found to have had CTE all over his frontal lobe – the part of the brain responsible for decision-making, impulse control and other executive functions.OJ Simpson also nearly donated his brain to Boston University, but he eventually backed away from comments he made in 2018 expressing curiosity overwhether he had CTEand wasultimately cremated. Of the 376 former NFL player brains that the center has examined since 2008, it has found CTE in 345 cases. By contrast, BU researchers found onlyoneinstance of CTE in a 2018 survey of the general public, and even that sample came from a former college football player.BU researchers would further sound the alarm on the head injury dangers that tackle football poses to kids whose developing brains, necks and bodies are not yet ready to absorb such impacts. In 2019, a high school football player named Wyatt Bramwell, who killed himselfmonths after graduating high school, became the youngest player to be diagnosed with advanced CTE. While many past CTE cases have been associated with violent behavior, there’sno conclusive proofof any direct links.The combination of Seau’s death in 2012, the 2015 release of the Will Smith film Concussion (which focuses on Omalu’s quest to hold theNFLaccountable for head injuries) and more than 4,500 players filing suit against the league for concealing head injury dangers would throw the NFL – the world’s biggest and most profitable sports league and an American cultural institution – into full-blown crisis mode.To staunch the drop in viewership and combat a rising disinclination among parents to sign their kids up for football (a move many prominent former playersendorsed), the NFL legislated some collisions out of the game and beefed up safety protocols while ramping up its promotion of flag football – to the point of successfully lobbying for a place for the non-contact version of the sport on the Olympic program for the 2028 LA Games. In 2013, the league agreed to alandmark $765m settlementwith former players that included payouts but, crucially, no admission of liability and limited compensation for CTE claims.New York shooting: gunman said in note that playing football gave him CTERead moreIt wasn’t until 2016 that the leaguefinally acknowledgedthe link between football-related head injuries and CTE – and, still, the legal battles continued as the leagueoutright denies claimswhile punting the responsibility for medical care to individual teams. Meanwhile, retired players, who were left to manage their health problems in the background, could only call out the league for prioritizing profits and scold the game’s incumbent generation of stars for not doing enough to consider their forebears in collective bargaining. The deeper the NFL digs in, the more it gives college and high school leagues permission to do the same and risk tragedies like the one that unfolded inside the very building where the league is headquartered.Tamura never played in the NFL, but he did carve out a respectable high school career at Los Angeles county’s Granda Hills Charter, distinguishing himself as a running back and kick returner. Those two positions, high-impact in both their potential for scoring and for brain injury, would have certainly increased his vulnerability to CTE – especially if Tamura took up the game before high school. He seemed to realize something about himself was off, too.In the note he left behind, Tamura suggests he may have even taken up Long’s habit of drinking antifreeze to cope with potential CTE symptoms, and resigns himself to feeling powerless to take on the NFL. Since covering the initial news of the attack at headquarters on its website on Monday, the league’s official media channels have moved back to tracking the latest developments from team training camps.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsNew YorkUS crimeGun crimeNeurosciencePittsburgh SteelersanalysisShareReuse this content"

But despite widespread speculation, the Sphere will not be hosting the event due to a scheduling conflict.Sourcestold ESPNthat Las Vegas was chosen over candidate cities in Canada and Mexico, though Fifa has not yet confirmed either the date or location. The draw will assign the 48 participating nations into 12 groups of four, reflecting the first time the men’s tournament will feature an expanded 48-team field and span three host countries: the United States, Canada and Mexico.Las Vegas previously hosted the World Cup draw in 1994, the last time the tournament was held in the United States. That year’s ceremony was staged at theLas VegasConvention Center, a venue that is unavailable this time around. Allegiant Stadium, home to the NFL’s Raiders, was also passed over as a World Cup match site during the host city selection process.The 11 US cities selected for 2026 are divided into three geographic regions. New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Boston, Miami and Atlanta comprise the East; Kansas City, Dallas and Houston make up the Central region; and Los Angeles, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area represent the West. Mexico’s venues include Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City, while Toronto and Vancouver will host matches in Canada.Mexico, Canada and the United States have already been placed in Groups A, B and D respectively. The tournament will conclude on 19 July 2026, with the final set to be played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.While early reports pointed to the Sphere – a state-of-the-art, 17,500-seat venue boasting a 54,000-square-meter wraparound LED screen – as the frontrunner to host the draw, sources close to the venue confirmed to the Guardian it is unavailable due to a previously scheduled concert. That, along with the Convention Center being booked, leaves the final venue for the draw still unannounced.Pedro Cedillo, a Pachuca executive involved in World Cup preparations, told ESPN: “I understand it will be in Las Vegas, and that’s where we need to be present.”Fifa has yet to comment on the venue or timing of the event.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Las VegasWorld CupUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The on-field rules are identical, but the atmosphere in Mexican baseball stands is noisy, musical, constant and infectious. The two fan cultures are distinct enough that, were you to drop a blindfolded supporter into either crowd, they would be able to identify which side of the Rio Grande they stood within seconds – or so you might think. Reality is never so binary.Despite the often unyielding political debates about them, international borders rarely possess hard edges. This is particularly true in South Texas, and not merely as some writerly conceit - even that most material indicator of crossing a border, a checkpoint with customs officers, can be found 50 miles away from the actual national boundary. The Rio Grande may delineate where Mexico and the US officially begin and end, but the famous river simultaneously exists at the centre of economies, communities and individual lives that span both of its banks. Living with one foot in Laredo (on the US side) and the other in Nuevo Laredo (in Mexico) is so intrinsic to life here that it’s even reflected in the name of the cities’ beloved baseball team,los Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos(the Two Laredos Owls).Like many things in border regions, the team affectionately known as “los Tecos” enjoys multiple identities. As their name suggests, they play home games on both sides of the border, making them simultaneously Mexican, American and, perhaps most of all, representative of the blended experience that has always survived in the blurry lines between the two.Venezuelan teenagers denied US visas for Senior Baseball World SeriesRead more“The US-Mexican borderesuna herida abierta[is an open wound] where the Third World grates against the First and bleeds,” wrote Gloria Anzaldúa, a scholar and South Texas native whoseBorderlands/La Fronterais considered a seminal work on the subject. “The lifeblood of two worlds merg[es] to form a third country.” This third country, to many, is the cultural zone known asLa Frontera(the border).People on either side of many borders often have more in common with each other than they do with their compatriot communities deeper in their own countries’ heartlands. This is the case along the Rio Grande and, as such, los Tecos can also be viewed as La Frontera’s de facto national team. They are first and foremost, however, representatives of the two Laredos.“Yes, there are fans in Matamoros, Reynosa, Piedras Negras [other cities along the Texas-Mexico border],” says Juan Alanis, a media official for los Tecos who also serves as one of the team’s play-by-play broadcasters. “The base, the nucleus [however] is in the two Laredos … there’s a history here.”Los Tecos compete in theLiga Mexicana de Béisbol(the Mexican Baseball League, or LMB), a competition featuring twenty teams spread across much of the country, from Tijuana to Cancún. Club baseball lacks a standard metric for comparing domestic leaguesà la European footballbut, depending on the criteria and source, the LMB is arguably the third- to sixth-strongest domestic competition in the world. Although LMB baseball falls well below the standard of play in the MLB and Japan’s NPB, it is arguably as good as (or better than) leagues in Korea, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic (during the LMB’s offseason, Mexico also hostsa smaller and shorter winter baseball leaguewhich some pundits argue to be Mexico’s highest standard of baseball).What can be said about without debate, however, is that the LMB was considered a AAA competition (i.e., on par with the second-highest level of competition in the U.S.) from 1967 until the 2021 restructuring of minor league baseball. The LMB is also older than all the non-US leagues mentioned above – indeed, the league is now celebrating its 100th anniversary.Los Tecos have been there for most of it.Guardians pitcher Emmanuel Clase placed on leave amid MLB betting investigationRead moreMexican baseball clubs bounce from city to city at least as much as their US counterparts, but a club called los Tecolotes has played in either Laredo or Nuevo Laredo for the vast majority of seasons since the 1940s. The current team may technically be the third franchise to bear the Tecos name, but such trivialities seem to matter little to fans.“The entire place was a party,” fan Ricardo Ábrego says of los Tecos’penultimate championship in 1977 (two franchises ago). A 58-year-old carpenter from Nuevo Laredo, Ábrego attended the match with his extended family and smiles at the memory. Sporting a plushie Tecos mascot poking out of his breast pocket, it’s fair to call Ábrego a superfan. When asked what los Tecos mean to him, he replies “todo” (everything) before going on to recount the team’s championship pedigree.With five titles under their belt, los Tecos are one of the LMB’s winningest teams, roughly analogous to the MLB’s Detroit Tigers in terms of post-season success (as well as their location on the northern border). Such success, when partnered with the team’s longevity in the area, makes Tecos fandom a multi-generational affair.“I’ve always liked them – my grandfather always liked them,” says 23-year-old factory worker Eduardo Espino. “For my family, it’s baseball more than football. I think it’s because we are from La Frontera, we’re veryfronteriza[of the border culture].”In many ways, Espino exemplifies the Tecos’binational identity– despite living in Nuevo Laredo, most of his childhood memories of Tecos games are from the Texas side of the border. He speaks with the Guardian, however, while attending a match in Nuevo Laredo, where he prefers the atmosphere.Vintage base ball: the charm of a sport where the 1860s never endedRead more“The people at the matches in Nuevo Laredo are more emotional,” says Espino “The stands are full and the support is just… more.” Alanis and Ábrego both agree–a slight preference for the (much older) stadium in Nuevo Laredo seems to be a universally acknowledged but unwritten truth among Tecos supporters.“I prefer the atmosphere in Nuevo Laredo,” says superfan Ábrego, before clarifying that he loves going to games at both sites. ““[In Nuevo Laredo], the crowd is more passionate, fiercer, moregrrrr,” notes Alanis the broadcaster. “But respectful, always respectful … If the fielder of the other team makes a good play, the fans applaud.” This is more than just the positive PR of a marketing professional. On several occasions at the games this correspondent attended, Tecos fans applaud the away team’s defensive efforts. This, however, happens at games in both Laredo and Nuevo Laredo – as ever, either side of the border have much in common.Yes, the stadium at Nuevo Laredo is a bit louder than its counterpart in Laredo (especially owing to the presence of a regularly hand-cranked raid siren). But, to someone used to East Coast baseball, home games in the two Laredos are more similar than they are different.On both sides of the border, many plays (even simple strikes early in the count) are greeted with a stadium-wide chorus of twirlingmatracas, wooden mechanical noisemakers that one spins and werecommon sights at British football groundsa half-century ago. Hand-pumped airhorns are also popular and regularly activated.“In Mexico, compared to MLB, there’s always noise, noise, noise until the pitcher pitches, [when] it’ssilent,” says Alanis. “You have 12 seconds with the pitch clock, [so] the DJ knows he can play music for ten seconds. It’s very normal in Mexico.” Indeed, either English-language pop music (think Michael Jackson and Clearance Clearwater Revival) or Spanish-language genres popular in La Frontera (think Selena and Grupo Frontera) are loudly piped through the stadium’s speakers until just before the pitcher begins his windup. The music’s constant fading in and out can cause a sensory overload but, given how many fans are actively dancing and singing between pitches, it palpably adds to the atmosphere (and, in line with what every interviewee above said, there is certainly a bit more dancing in the crowd at the game in Nuevo Laredo).Aside from the acoustic experience, attending an LMB game is a nice mix of the best elements of both major and minor league baseball in the US. As with the minor leagues, a Tecos game is cheap and family friendly; parking is free and just four dollars buys both a hot dog and a small beer, even at the Laredo stadium. Like the US major leagues, however, LMB games feature in-stadium replays on the big screen and significant emotional investment all around the ballpark. Pitchers pound their chest emphatically after a strike out and fans with worried faces clasp their hands in prayer. LMB baseball’s existence atla fronteraof minor and major league baseball appeals to players as well fans.“It’s been fun – everywhere I’ve been has been awesome,” saysStephen Gonsalves, a pitcher for the visiting Charros de Jalisco who previously played for the MLB’s Boston Red Sox and Minnesota Twins. Gonsalves is part of a recent wave ofUS players who’ve opted to play in the LMB. “There are fewer jobs stateside,” he adds, referring to the nationwide reduction of minor league teams in the US in 2020. “So, now … there are a lot of older, veteran guys that have played in the big leagues. Every team has at least three or four former big leaguers on it… It’s good competition.”LMB players also seem to enjoy a higher quality of life than their minor league counterparts.“Minor league baseball was a hassle,” says Andrew Pérez, another pitcher from the visiting Charros team who spent six years with Chicago White Sox organization, including significant time with their AAA affiliate. “I was in the minor leagues when you had eight guys in an apartment.” Now, for players like Pérez and Gonsalves, the most annoying logistical hurdles seem to be the multiple border crossings and hotels during away stands at the two Laredos (home games alternate between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo). This cross-border shuffling seems to be a common complaint among visiting teams, and may even represent a homefield advantage for los Tecos.For many,manyresidents of both Laredos (including los Tecos), crossing the US-Mexico border is simply a bureaucratic fact of daily life, much like toll roads or paying for public transport in other cities. Recent surges in media coverage may suggest the presence of some new crisis at the border but, based on those responses of those who live around it, it’s business as usual. Every person interviewed for this article said that they hadn’t noticed a significant change at the border in recent months and, if anything, seemed a little amused by my questions on the subject. In the two Laredos, the border has always been a part of everyday life and will continue to be long after the surge in interest dies down.By claiming both Laredos as their home, los Tecos’fronterizaidentity represents an older, historical and undivided Laredo that predates the United States and was only bifurcated in the 19th century as a result of the Mexican-American War. Here on the Rio Grande, questions of national jurisdiction seem temporary compared to the longevity of many families’ and communities’ presence in the area. Los Tecos represent the reality ofthosepeople. Walking back over the bridge to the US from the game in Nuevo Laredo (the CBP officer, a fan, asks about the game), the river look remarkably un-grande.Explore more on these topicsBaseballMLBUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether the Turnberry owner was Donald Trump or Donald Duck, its lack of adjacent infrastructure makes it unfit for the Open. The Ayrshire venue, lauded again by its owner, Trump,during a visit in recent days, is simply incapable of hosting the Open in its present form.This need not be an uncomfortable reality for the US president, who can secure at least a portion of the profile and kudos he desires for Turnberry – one of the world’s most outstanding golf courses – from an alternative source. It would, in fact, now be a surprise if Turnberry does not appear on the Scottish Open’s rota at some point soon. Mutual convenience is staring us all in the face if Trump can even temporarily accept a prize which sits in the shadow of the championship he has craved since buying Turnberry in 2014.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump takes the inaugural tee shot on the first hole at Trump International.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockTheEuropean TourGroup has proved adept at navigating choppy sporting waters. Or, perhaps, merely dealing with the same away from prying eyes. It was the DP World Tour, formerly European, which eased Saudi Arabia into the golf mainstream and it is the same tour which allows Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton to pursue Ryder Cup ambitions while technically in dispute over fines issued for participation in LIV competitions.As eyes fix on Royal Porthcawl and the Women’s Open this week, where Lottie Woad will look to continue her vertiginous rise, the Legends Tour – Europe’s domain for senior citizens – will stop off at Trump Aberdeen. Only days later, the DP World Tour’s Nexo Championship is to be contested at the same venue. The European Tour Group has continued its trick of hiding in plain sight by arranging these events with no backlash whatsoever. Not so much as a raised eyebrow; a scenario that will inevitably continue as the tournaments take place.Depending on one’s viewpoint, this is either a tremendous example of public relations or an ominous sign that few people care about the European Tour Group’s approach to business. This is not at all to suggest protest or hand-wringing is essential, rather that Trump has quietly and already increased his golfing footprint in a land far from home. The Scottish government has even contributed £180,000 of public money to the Nexo Championship.The stakes look set to be raised. Doonbeg, now Trump Ireland, is known to be under consideration to stage the Irish Open. Reports suggest that could happen as quickly as 2026. Doonbeg and the Irish Open looks a strong alliance; a stunning location which also boasts hotel accommodation. Ireland, like Scotland, should have links venues for its national open.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump lauded Turnberry on his latest trip to the course.Photograph: Hugo Philpott/UPI/ShutterstockGuy Kinnings, the European Tour Group’s chief executive, attended a function in Trump’s company in Aberdeenshire on Monday evening before being present for the opening of the president’s New Course on the Menie Estate. As Trump cut the ribbon on the New Course, Kinnings was one of just four people standing behind him; two were the president’s sons.TheScottish Open’s present baseat the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is convenient. Leading players can stay on or close to the venue. Renaissance’s American owners want the Scottish Open to stay there in perpetuity. The tournament offers a form of seaside preparation immediately before the Open. Last month’s edition, though, bore witness to audible grumbles from golfers about the nature of that test. It is impossible to shake the feeling that Scotland has too many exceptional, true links courses for this competition to remain at its current home. Chief among them? Turnberry.There may be a necessary break to Renaissance’s run. The R&A will give the Open an overdue return to Muirfield at some point, meaning it would be logistically impossible to stage the previous week’s Scottish equivalent at a course which is basically next door. A switch to the west coast would make perfect sense at that point. Any suggestion Turnberry would be banned from future Open duties by hosting the DP World Tour is undermined by the fact professionals and amateurs crash around St Andrews and Carnoustie every year at the Dunhill Links Championship. Turnberry could not only handle a Scottish Open but would be a celebrated venue.“We love Scotland,” Trump announced before boarding Air Force One on Tuesday. Get ready for a lot more of the same.Explore more on these topicsGolfDonald TrumpThe OpenEuropean TourPGA TourUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Lots of great races over the years.”Ledecky was ahead of her world-record pace through 1,250 meters, pushed early by Pallister.

She will face Ledecky in the 800, maybe the most anticipated race of the worlds.Paris Olympic champion David Popovici of Romania won the 200-meter freestyle, overtaking American Luke Hobson in the last 50 meters for the victory. Popovici swam 1:43.53 with Hobson across in 1:43.84. Tatsuya Murasa of Japan was third in 1:44.54.“I think it was better than the Olympics to be honest,” Popovici said of the victory. “You know why? Because I trained a lot for the Olympics. But this coming for a more relaxed year, easygoing year after the Olympics. I don’t know.

It was also the first match, no doubt of many over the coming years, that made a hero of Michelle Agyemang.Nick AmesThe final betweenEngland and Spainwas exactly what I expected from two heavyweights of the game. It was a gladiatorial tactical battle between Spain’s possession-loving football and England’s defensive diligence. A fitting ending to a brilliant tournament.Sophie DowneyFrance and Germany’s quarter-finalin Basel, which the Germans won 6-5 ina high-quality penalty shootout, provided compelling drama from start to finish and it was a game that had it all; a mindless red card, disallowed goals, VAR drama and the best save I can ever recall seeing live as Ann-Katrin Berger seemed to defy physics to claw the ball off the line. Ultimately it was a match that saw Germany doggedly progress despite playing 107 minutes of the game with 10 players. It was a remarkable knockout tie.Tom GarryAnn-Katrin BergerSweden 2-2 England. That game had just about everything. The prospect of an England comeback felt almost impossible approaching the 80th minute, but within a matter of seconds you just knew that they were going to do it. The drama!Emillia HawkinsSweden 2-2 England.Everyone will remember the stirring England comeback and the dramatic penalty shootout but this is a game that also deserves to be remembered for Sweden’s devastating opening burst, a standard of pulsating attacking football that stands with any produced at this tournament.Jonathan LiewFrance v Germany.This game had everything. A red card, a penalty, resolute German defending, THAT Ann-Katrin Berger save and a penalty shootout. The fact Germany were the first team at a women’s Euros to progress after going down to 10 players showed just how hard they worked. Berger also put in some great saves during the shootout – goalkeeper of the tournament for me.Sarah RendellIt has to be the final doesn’t it? England’s rollercoaster ride of a tournamentconcluded in a thrilling showpiecebetween magical world champions Spain and the Euro holders. It was the final everyone wanted and it delivered. England were battlers, tactically astute and disciplined, Spain were Spain, master technicians on the ball.Suzanne WrackPlayer of the tournamentHannah Hamptonwas little known to the wider public a month ago and had replaced a national treasure in Mary Earps between the posts. She left Switzerland having earned the same status by producing exceptional performances of which multiple penalty saves were only part. Calm, composed on the ball and with cat-like reflexes, Hampton deserves every credit.NAMichelle Agyemang.What a player. The 19-year-old was given an opportunity and seized it with both hands. The way she impacted games caught the eye but equally the way she came on in high pressure situations and handled them without panic. Will surely be a star for England for years to come.SDChloe Kellymade a gamechanging impact in all three of England’s knockout ties and therefore has to win this, in my eyes, although the best technical footballer was Aitana Bonmatí. Kelly came up clutch in the big moments, whether it was with her two lethal crosses to create England’s two quickfire goals in their comeback against Sweden, or her lively performance and late winner against Italy, or her assist for England’s equaliser in the final followed by her nerveless, title-clinching penalty.TGAitana Bonmatí.It’s crazy to think that she was hospitalised with viral meningitis just days before Euro 2025 started.

The defender started every game and played 598 minutes for England in total and the performances, particularly her leadership and skill against Sweden, were crucial to the Lionesses retaining the trophy. The fact she did all that with a fractured tibia is unbelievable and she once again lived up to one of her middle names: “Tough”.SRView image in fullscreenLucy Bronze was crucial to the Lionesses’ title defence and she played the entire tournament with a fractured tibia.Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images/AllstarAitana Bonmatí may have scooped player of the tournament but, for me, it was her midfield companionPatri Guijarrothat deserves all the plaudits. She became the second player on record, since the 2011 World Cup, to have completed 100-plus passes and won possession more than 10 times in a knockout stage game at a major tournament – after the Denmark great Katrine Pedersen.SWGoal of the tournamentWe can quibble over Ann-Katrin Berger’s positioning all we like, but for sheer did-she-really-try-that at such a knife-edge point in Spain’s semi-final against Germany, the winner fromAitana Bonmatístands above them all.NACristiana Girelli’s wonder strike against Portugal. The 35-year-old always delivers for Italy and did so in spectacular fashion on this occasion.SDClàudia Pina’s curler into the top corner against Belgium takes this for me, although her near-identical finish against Switzerland in the quarter-final was almost equally worthy. We should also throw more praise at Vivianne Miedema’s strike against Wales and Lauren James’ superb first-half goal against the Netherlands.TGLauren James v Netherlands.Not necessarily just because of the strike – which was great in itself – but also because of the buildup. That long pass from Hannah Hampton through to Alessia Russo in attack was absolutely exquisite.EHVivianne Miedema v Wales.Not just the screaming finish into the top corner from distance, but the quick feet and clever body feints to create the space for herself.JLClàudia PinaClàudia Pinahad a fine tournament and her goal against Belgium was an absolute stunner. It was similar to the rocket she scored against Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final. A sensational strike from outside the box.SRThere may have been prettier goals this tournament but the context ofMichelle Agyemang’s equaliser against Italy made it all the more remarkable. At just 19 years old, with less than a minute left of added time and with England 1-0 down and facing an exit from the tournament, the coolness with which the Arsenal forward scored through the legs of both a defender and the keeper was stunning.

The way we all pulled together to help each other this last month is what it is all about.SDWhen Riola Xhemaili scored a 92nd-minute goal to send Switzerland into the knockout stages, I was watching the action on a screen that evidently had around a 10-second delay compared to other televisions, and therefore hearing the roar – before actually seeing the goal myself – of noise and cheers echoing all around the streets of Zurich, as an entire city was glued to the game and celebrating joyously, was a sound I’ll never forget. That was the moment I fully appreciated how emotionally-invested the host nation had become into their women’s football team, which was really heartening.TGMichelle Agyemang’s goal v Italy. From the verge of heartbreak to absolute ecstasy. The fact a 19-year-old kept England’s hopes alive on just her fourth appearance for the senior team, four years after she was a ball girl, is incredible.EHGetting recognised by Ellen White’s husband at half-time during the final. Happy to report Ellen and Callum are both avid Guardian readers.JLMichelle Agyemang became a star overnight with her equaliser against Sweden but the fact she did it again against Italy was quite something. The roar when she was shown on the big screen getting ready to come on in the final shows what she already means to England fans. A special summer for a special player.SRView image in fullscreenRiola Xhemaili’s goal for Switzerland against Finland was a huge moment for the host nation.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/APThe interaction with the players. Many of them know that some of us have been on this journey with them for a very long time. It’s been an incredible privilege to tell their stories and this tournament had stories in abundance. The jokes, the looks, the interviews. They are a very likeable group.SWWhat next for women’s football?Resource and attention need to be concentrated on countries that risk being left behind. England, Germany, France and Spain – for all their specific local issues – are going to be just fine. It is time to make sure clubs and national teams outside the leading pack are equipped to develop in both sporting and economic terms: “The head must not leave the body”, as a number of top Uefa executives are fond of saying.NAJust more of everything. More investment, more coverage, more fans, more viewership. The sky is the limit at the moment.SDThe next Euros in 2029 needs to feature larger stadiums to try to surpass a million spectators, and there are some strong contenders with Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and a joint Denmark-Sweden bid all in the running. In England, the challenge now has to be to improve the grassroots facilities for girls and women across the country and make sure the huge influx of young girls who have taken up the sport in the past few years can be retained within the sport into their teenage years and adult lives, for a long-lasting legacy. Lastly, the Women’s Super League needs to capitalise on the national team’s success by reversing last season’s decline in average attendances.TGIt’s been fantastic to see how Switzerland as a nation has embraced women’s football this summer. Hopefully we see the same with other nations. Given the success of the Lionesses once again this year it would also be great to see a steady increase in TV viewing figures and attendances across England.EHThis is a thornier question than it appears. Huge levels of interest at big events do not necessarily translate to mass appeal at domestic or grassroots level. But as long as the funding is there (and fairly distributed), and as long as the institutional will to grow the game remains (looking at you,Jim Ratcliffe and Daniel Levy), we can anticipate another few years of cautious, optimistic growth.JLHopefully this Euros win will see attendances in the WSL rise again and for other leagues across Europe to reap the same reward with most teams impressing one way or another at the tournament. But the next step now is to focus on and celebrate the football and the players. This Euros win for the Lionesses felt like it was all about the football rather than having to prove something to others.SRThe sky’s the limit. The impact of the win in 2022 was evident in the support for England this time round. That will be elevated again. This team has changed the face of women’s football and society for the better. Their platform is bigger than ever and there can be little doubt that they will take full advantage of that increased authority to challenge things and fight for more for women and girls.SWExplore more on these topicsFootballEngland women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stay with us. This story is not done yet.”Listening to the team bask in accolades with a broad grin on her face was 49-year-old Beth Magee. She said she had scaled a wall separating VIPs from the crowds below, aided by her three teenage daughters Ella, Martha and Rosie.“I’ve never broken a rule in my life, but I made an exception to see this today,” she said. “When the police tried to move us I said to my daughters: ‘I’ll speak to them, girls, but we won’t be moving.’”0:49'it's unbelievable': Alexandra Topping from the Lioness parade through London – videoPointing to the team on stage, she added: “These women are such incredible role models – they are strong, healthy and smart and we are so proud of them.”The Lionesses have been vocal about their desire to inspire the next generation of players, and the influence of their first Euros victory in 2022 was everywhere during the victory parade. In the season following that trophy,1,500 new teams were registeredin England, with the number of girls and women playing the game increasing by more than 50%.Among them was 55-year-old Vivienne Avery. “I literally started the week after they won,” she said. “I saw a course and I thought it’s now or never.

It starts with talent, the bonding in this team made the absolute difference. Everybody was ready to support each other.”Looking out across the vast swathes of fans, England’s talisman Lucy Bronze said the response to the victory had been amazing.“This moment is unbelievable,” she said, wearing her trademark skiing sunglasses and an England scarf wrapped around her head. “Obviously we did it three years ago but to come back to this is incredible.”Asked how the party was after the final – which the England defender had played, she later revealed,with a fractured left tibia– she deadpanned: “I don’t remember.”View image in fullscreenThe singer Burna Boy performs with Sarina Wiegman on stage.Photograph: Adam Davy/ReutersWith the show over and the final dances done, the fans started to leave past Buckingham Palace, the strains of Sweet Caroline and Daft Punk’s One More Time – played as the team raised their trophy in a shower of ticker tape and red and white pyrotechnics – still ringing in their ears.“It has made me want to play a lot more,” said nine-year-old Eva Mummery, who had travelled from Gloucestershire with her friends from the Gotherington Jaguars under-11s. “I want to get up to a higher level of football to hopefully bring home that trophy one day with all my amazing teammates.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballWomen’s Euro 2025LondonLeah WilliamsonSarina WiegmanEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is unbelievable. Thank you for coming out.“My message is, everything we do, obviously we do it for us and our team, but we do it for the country, and we do it for young girls.

The defender said: “There are lots of ways to win a football match and we repeatedly did it the hard way, but I think you can see how much we care about playing for England and how much we love it.“I don’t know, 2022 was a fairytale but this feels really hard‑earned.

We had tough moments and nasty things to deal with and still we rise.”The team’s next challenge will be to win a first Women’s World Cup, when that event is staged in Brazil in the summer of 2027, a gauntlet that was thrown down to them by King Charles when – in his congratulatory message on Sunday – asked the team to “bring home the World Cup in 2027 if you possibly can”.In the meantime, the team’s celebrations will continue. Among the other star performers of their run to glory in Switzerland was Hannah Hampton, playing in a tournament as the No 1 goalkeeper for the first time. She saved two penalties in the final and told the presenter Alex Scott on stage on Tuesday: “They [her teammates] got me through the whole tournament, when it didn’t start off the way I wanted [it] to and they just kept me going.View image in fullscreenEngland’s players celebrate with fans during a ceremony in front of Buckingham Palace.Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP“To be standing here with this group of girls is amazing.

I got told many times that I’m not good enough, that I shouldn’t be playing football from the start, so just keep doing it and, if it makes you happy, go follow that smile.”The award for young player of the tournament was given to Michelle Agyemang, the 19-year-old striker who scored two crucial equalisers for England in the quarter- and semi-finals. Given a rapturous reception by the central London crowds, the Arsenal player said: “I’m so grateful to be here. It’s still surreal. It doesn’t even seem real seeing people down there, it seems fake!

The goalkeeper has signed a five-year deal, with the option of a sixth, at the Etihad Stadium where he will battle with Ederson and Stefan Ortega to be first choice.It was anticipated that Trafford would move to Newcastle, who have been tracking him over the past 12 months. City, however, used their matching rights clause, inserted when the goalkeeper left the club in 2023, to secure his services. The fee has been confirmed as a club-record sale by the Clarets.Chelsea close to £35m deal for Ajax’s Jorrel Hato and want RB Leipzig’s Xavi SimonsRead more“Rejoining City is such a special and proud moment both for me and my family,” Trafford said. “I always dreamed that one day I would be able to come back to Manchester City. This is the place I call home – it’s a truly special football club with fantastic people who make it such a unique place to work and play.“I am also very excited and honoured to have been given the opportunity to work under Pep [Guardiola] and with such a world-class group of players. I am still very young and hungry to keep learning and improving – and I know there is no better environment than Manchester City to help make me become the best goalkeeper I can be.”The 22-year-old Cumbrian joined City aged 12 from Carlisle and went on to have eight years in ­Manchester before joiningBurnleyin 2023 for £14m. Prior to moving to Turf Moor, Trafford impressed during loan spells at Accrington and Bolton but never made a first-team appearance for City, although he did work with the first-team goalkeepers.“When he [Ederson] first joined, he was extremely talented,” Trafford said. “He is one of a kind with the ball at his feet. He was someone that I looked up to a lot when I first trained with him when I was 17. I tried to take small bits of his game and try to put them into my game and improve.”Vincent Kompany made Trafford his first choice at Burnley, giving him a first taste of Premier League football. But in a struggling side he was dropped eventually in favour of ­Arijanet Muric as Burnley went down. Trafford recovered his form and confidence last season, helping the Clarets to reach the top flight, conceding 16 goals in 45 appearances, with 29 clean sheets.Trafford was an integral member of the England Under-21 squad that won the European Championship in 2023,saving a penalty in the final, and has been named in numerous senior squads but is yet to make his full international debut.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having just won the FA Cup for the first time in 1896, the club then forgot to apply for the following season’s competition, missing the deadline entirely, which meant that most of their cup-winning side were rather cheesed off, threatened to leave and start their own professional club, Sheffield Rovers, where players would be paid for their performances. The next few months for Wednesday were something of a shambles and in scenes that will be familiar to anyone that has played Sunday League, the club struggled to find enough players to put out a proper side, culminating in a 16-0 defeat to Bolton-based Halliwell FC in January 1887, a match in which Wednesday could only field 10 players. A few months later, an emergency meeting was held between players and president John Holmes, after which the club turned professional. The players were paid and The Wednesday were saved.It won’t be the tiniest crumb of comfort to Sheffield Wednesday fans that the hat-trick of suffering existential crises due to poor admin, not paying players and staff properly and failing to have enough players for a full team is well ingrained into the club’s history. In case you hadn’t seen, the Owls are again in trouble. After a chaotic summer dominated by financial issues (failing to pay all the squad’s wagesfor the third time in four months in June) manager Danny Röhl has now left the club by mutual consent, 12 days before the start of the Championship season, with first-team coaches Sascha Lense, Chris Powell, Neil Thompson and Sal Bibbo all following through the door marked Doing One. They aren’t the only departures. While Djeidi Gassama was sold for actual money to Rangers, Josh Windass, Michael Smith and Callum Paterson have all departed for free, with the club unable to bring in any new senior arrivals owing to theirtransfer ban until January 2027, enforced after the repeated failure to pay players’ wages. Wednesday could face further disciplinary action from the EFL, a possible player walkout, longer transfer embargo, plus a fine and a points deduction if the situation continues.Despite his exit, Röhl had been generally beloved by Wednesday supporters, having rescued the club from relegation to League One in his first campaign and leading Wednesday on an unlikely playoff push last season. “This summer has been difficult and, in the end, the club and I came to the mutual decision to part ways,” posted Röhl on various Social Media Disgraces. “Even during the difficult moments and setbacks, I have always continued to feel the support from everyone. We achieved a miracle together and that will always be something truly exceptional. I wish everyone associated with Wednesday my very best. I will never forget you.”Wednesday currently have just 16 first-team players listed on their website, although to what extent those players are actually contracted to the club, including captain Barry Bannan, remains unclear. Wednesday’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri, is willing to sell and has received offers from at least two US consortiums, but neither has met his valuation. The Thai businessman’s tenurehas been littered with problems: from the late payment of tax bills to points deductions, to a broken boiler unable to provide hot showers for the players at Hillsborough and even a threat to ban anyone who attended the stadium in a fake shirt. It’s fair to say Chansiri is not flavour of the month. With pay day for July due this week, it remains to be seen if any of the remaining players and staff will stick around for the opener against Leicester City, recently relegated from the Premier League of course – a match which now feels as daunting as Wednesday’s 10-man trip to Halliwell in 1887. Just like they did nearly 140 years ago, here hoping one of England’s grand old clubs can somehow navigate this latest mess and spread their wings again.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Sarina’s got rhythm.

The 22-year-old forward, who is capable of playing in several attacking roles, joined Leipzig from Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m after two successful loan spells and it is expected that he could cost up to €70m.Simons has also attracted interest from Bayern Munich but is thought to prefer a move to the Premier League.Chelsea have already sanctioned the departures of Kepa Arrizabalaga, Noni Madueke and Djordje Petrovic, while João Félix joined the Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr on Tuesday after a £44m deal was agreed.Explore more on these topicsChelseaAjaxRB LeipzigTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

If a deal can be done for the 29-year-old Fulham winger it would reunite him with Nuno Espírito Santo, with whom he worked at Wolves.After selling Anthony Elanga and Ramón Sosa, Forest are eager to recruit new wingers. A club‑record deal was agreedon Monday for Bologna’s Dan Ndoye, with the Switzerland international to join this week after a medical is completed. Personal terms are not thought to be an issue or Ndoye, who turned down the chance of moving to the Serie A champions Napoli in favour of the Premier League.Football transfer rumours: Donnarumma to leave PSG … for Manchester United?Read moreTraoré has spent the past two seasons at Craven Cottage after joining on a free transfer from Wolves, where he worked under Nuno for three years, helping them to finish seventh twice. The Portuguese is a huge admirer of Traoré and is pushing for a deal to be completed. Traoré played 36 times forFulhamlast season, scoring twice and creating a further seven goals to help Marco Silva’s team to finish 11th.The potential arrival of Traoré, considered one of the quickest players in the Premier League, would help to negate the loss of Elanga, who joined Newcastle for £55m earlier in the window. Going into their first European campaign in 30 years, Forest are also considering increasing their bid for James McAtee after an opening offer of £20m plus £5m in add-ons was rejected by Manchester City for the England Under-21 midfielder.Evertonhave signed the teenage left-back Adam Aznou from Bayern Munich for a fee in the region of £8m. The 19-year-old a Morocco international spent three years at Barcelona’s La Masia academy before joining Bayern at the age of 16. He made four senior appearances for Bayern, including one at the recent Club World Cup, and featured 13 times in La Liga last season while on loan at Real Valladolid.Aznou is Everton’s fourth signing of the summer and will provide much-needed competition for Vitalii Mykolenko, who was the club’s only established left-back. The teenager has signed a four-year contract.The Everton manager, David Moyes, said: “He’s a young, talented player with a lot of potential. Left-backs are not easy to get and we’ve brought in a young player who we hope will grow in his time at Everton.”Leicester City, meanwhile, have signed Asmir Begovic on a one-year contract. The 38‑year‑old goalkeeper was a free agent after leaving Everton at the end of last season and last played in the Championship for Queens Park Rangers in 2023-24. Begovic, who played for Bournemouth, Chelsea and Stoke in the Premier League, reunites with the head coach, Marti Cifuentes, who worked with him at QPR.Begovic is Leicester’s first summer signing with the club hamstrung by financial parameters. Their No 1 goalkeeper, Mads Hermansen, has top-flight interest.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowNottingham ForestFulhamEvertonLeicester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

She has also won five Giro stages between from 2021-2025.Tour de France Femmes 2025: Lorena Wiebes holds off Vos in stage four sprint – as it happenedRead more“I have tried to have more of a free mindset, like I had in the Giro,” Wiebes, of Team SD Worx-Protime, said. “This season has already been really good, even if I hadn’t won in theTour de France. It doesn’t feel like we have a lot of pressure from the team.”While Wiebes celebrated another sprint success, the pre-race favourite Demi Vollering was just happy to get through the day after aheavy crash close to the finish of stage threealmost ended her race.Vollering,winner of the 2023Tour de France Femmes, finished the stage in the main group, a feat which had looked unlikely before the start in Saumur, when she winced her way through a pre-race warm-up and was visibly in pain.“It was a big relief to feel good and that I was able to ride and to keep my head up,” she said.“That’s the biggest relief. From now on we will see, day by day. I was a bit anxious for the final because it was kind of similar to yesterday, so you feel tension. A crash like that takes its toll on you. Again, no time loss, and now I think the shock is over.”Vollering admitted she had ridden at the front of the peloton “mostly to stay safe … It’s better to spend energy in the front of the peloton than be behind. My team did a very good job with keeping me in front of the bunch. When I was a bit anxious they were always next to me”.The Dutch professional is the most high-value rider in the women’s peloton and her €1m transfer to the French team FDJ-Suez was built around her winning this year’s Tour.However, some rival teams were dismissive of comments by the FDJ-Suez team manager, Stephen Delcourt, about a lack of respect shown towards Vollering by others in the peloton, in the aftermath of her crash.View image in fullscreenDemi Vollering credited her FDJ-Suez team with helping her through the stage.Photograph: Szymon Gruchalski/Getty Images“What he’s saying is ridiculous,” Jos van Emden, the team director at Visma-Lease a bike, told Dutch media. “Apparently he wants a peloton of eight riders, with Demi in it, to ride in a gilded cage. He’s simply been influenced by Demi, by Demi’s posturing.”This was Vollering’s second high‑speed crash in the Tour, following her verysimilar fall in the race last year, six kilometres from the finish of stage four to Amnéville, while wearing the yellow jersey.“When I was on the ground I had some throwback of last year,” she said, “but luckily this time it was in the five-kilometre rule [meaning she did not lose any time].”However, she still blames her rivals for not honouring the tradition of waiting for the race leader when they are down, and her former teammates at SD Worx for racing ahead and abandoning her to her fate.This time, though, with Vollering’s committed FDJ-Suez team around her, things were different. But it will still be a tall order for her to be fully recovered from what she described as a “hard impact” for Wednesday’s longest stage of the race, from Chasseneuil-du-Poitou Futuroscope to Guéret, which includes three categorised climbs in the final 35km.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

He was a special horse’Greg Woodat GoodwoodTue 29 Jul 2025 12.35 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 16.57 EDTShareThe result seemed immaterial after the Group One Goodwood Cup on Tuesday as confirmation arrived that Trueshan, one of the most popular horses in training thanks to a hugely successful partnership with his regular jockey, Hollie Doyle, had sustained a fatal injury in the two-mile feature event on the opening day ofGlorious Goodwood.Trueshan sustained a fracture of his left-hind pastern while galloping uphill on the far side of the track and was immediately attended by the track’s veterinary team. Alan King’s nine-year-old gelding had set off as a 22-1 chance for a repeat of his win in this race in 2021, which was Trueshan’s first success – and Doyle’s second – at Group One level.Trainers’ chief backs radical alternative to government’s gambling tax planRead more“I’m just devastated,” Doyle said later. “It couldn’t be any worse. He was a special, special horse, I can’t think of anything else to say. I am gutted. He’s been amazing for me, a star, and those memories we have together are some of my very best.”The race on Tuesday was the 35th start of Trueshan’s career, during which he was a last-minute scratch from several major races because of concerns over fast ground.In addition to his Goodwood Cup success four years ago, he recorded two wins in the Group One Prix du Cadran at Longchamp in October, one in the Group Two Doncaster Cup and three in the Long Distance Cup at Ascot on Champions Day in October. Trueshan also put up one of the most impressive handicap performances of recent decades in the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle in 2022, when he won the famous two-mile race under 10st 8lb off an official mark of 120.James Given, the British Horseracing Authority’s director of equine welfare, told Racing TV that “like all the horses running here today, Trueshan was examined by my team this morning and gave us no concerns””Given said: “What has happened unfortunately is just an accident, mid-race, in a straight line going up a hill. His left-hind pastern broke and left him in a situation that wasn’t recoverable from.“He would have been immediately sedated and given pain relief while vets examined the extent of the injury. Alan was able to get down there and assess him with the vets, and they felt there was no option really but to put him down.”View image in fullscreenScandinavia ridden by Wayne Lordan (centre) wins the Goodwood Cup.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAScandinavia, the eventual winner of the race on Tuesday, was the first three-year-old to secure the prize since Stradivarius, who went on to win the Ascot Gold Cup three times, in 2017.Aidan O’Brien’s colt got the better of a sustained struggle with his stable companion and favourite, Illinois, and is now likely to set off as the market leader for the St Leger at Doncaster next month.“They were head-to-head all the way down the straight and it was exactly what you like to watch,” O’Brien said. “He’s by Justify and he showed what we see in Justifys all the time, they will not lie down. No matter how tired they get, the strides keeps going and the head keeps down.”Take Gold to shine in SussexField Of Gold’s three-year-old career to date has been an near-facsimile of his sire Kingman’s second season on the track, even including a second-place finish in a 2,000 Guineas that he probably should have won, and the pattern is likely to continue at Goodwood on Wednesday when John & Thady Gosden’s colt lines up for the Group One Sussex Stakes.Field Of Gold(3.05)will probably set off at a similar price to Kingman too, as his sire was a 2-5 shot to beat three rivals in this race 11 years ago and Field Of Gold is also odds-on for his first start in all-aged company.Field Of Gold confirmed his status as the season’s best three-year-old miler with an emphatic three-and-a-half-length defeat of Aidan O’Brien’s Henri Matisse in the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot last month.Henri Matisse is again among his half-dozen rivals on Wednesday and Goodwood’s sharp downland circuit is a different test, but even a master tactician such as O’Brien will struggle to hatch a plan to overturn his Ascot deficit and Rosallion, the St James’s Palace Stakes winner last year, is a more credible rival for the favourite.Richard Hannon’s colt was a late scratch from the Sussex 12 months ago because of an infection and missed the rest of the campaign, and has just one more start on his career record than Field Of Gold. Even his best form to date gives him something to find with the Gosdens’ runner, though, and the Classic generation’s recent dominance in this race – with four wins in the past six years – should continue.Goodwood 1.20A slow start from a wide draw leftSing Us A Songwith a mountain to climb in the King George V Handicap at Royal Ascot last time and he did well to finish within seven lengths of the winner in the circumstances.

Since his side took an unbeatable 2-0 series lead against the Wallabies he has even had a congratulatory message from the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, who was in Melbourne forthe game last Saturday. Was he asking Itoje to consider dipping his toes into politics? “No, no … he has some world issues to try and sort out before that.”Ask Itoje about his future vision for the Lions, however, and his manifesto is crystal clear. This tour has been the England captain’s third in a red jersey and with every passing year his personal appreciation of the Lions continues to grow. “It’s been without a shadow of a doubt one of the highlights of my career. When I am old and grey these occasions and these tours are going to be one of the experiences I look back on with extreme fondness.”The Breakdown | Absorbing Lions tour of Australia shows why best-of-three Test format worksRead moreHe also firmly believes that, for every top player, representing the Lions is a light that will never go out. “I would be surprised if you can find a British and Irish rugby player who says they don’t want to be a Lion. This is something the players will continue to want for decades and for as long as rugby is being played. It’s something I know provides a huge sense of excitement in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. And it adds an extra bit of spice and intrigue to the Six Nations when it’s a Lions year. So I am struggling to see the negatives. It is a great event and long may it continue.”Coming from a man who is now one of just six living individualsto have captained a series-winning Lions squad– the others being Willie John McBride (1974), Finlay Calder (1989), Martin Johnson (1997) and Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones (2013) – it is a significant rallying cry. There are occasional moments, particularly in the ever-more detailed modern game, when the Lions can feel like an anachronism but nothing gives the concept more of a boost than an enjoyable series win.Interestingly, Itoje is also of the opinion that the quadrennial Lions tour rota should not be casually altered, amid increasing support in high places for a potential tour to France one day. “I thought about this at the beginning of the tour. There’s a strong sense of history and tradition … part of me is keen for it to continue to rotate among the three countries it does. Also it wouldn’t feel the same if we took a short-haul flight. It needs a long‑haul flight!”With a simply stunning view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge as the backdrop to the Lions’ first fitness session since clocking back on after 48 hours of celebrations, Itoje’s logic was easy to follow. There are many worse places to spend a week with a major series already in the bag but, as their captain was swift to reiterate, the Lions are still over here on business.View image in fullscreen‘You build bonds’: Maro Itoje celebrates with his Lions teammates, including Jamie Osborne and Jac Morgan, in Melbourne.Photograph: Billy Stickland/Inpho/Shutterstock“We want to be part of something very special,” Itoje said, brushing aside any notion that he might wish to sit out the final Test. “Winning a Lions Test series is obviously extremely special but what would be an absolute dream would be to go out, perform to the level to which we think we can perform and win the third game.“While the first two games have been great, there’s still a feeling that we haven’t put it together in a way we know we can. We want to chase down the performance we’ve been searching for. The Wallabies will be hungry and up for it but we also want to make some history this weekend.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As recently as last month, for instance, he would never have guessed he would be spending time with Ireland’s Jamie Osborne, let alone greeting the latter by his nickname. Itoje said: “I now know that whenever I play against him in the future I can call him ‘Showbiz’ and he will have that little smirk on his face.“I also have a lot of admiration for Jac Morgan, who is a very, very talented player. I’ve respected him from afar and being alongside him has been amazing. Finlay Bealham is another one. I never thought we would have a good relationship, but he’s absolutely hilarious and a very endearing person. I can go through so many others.”Even at the end of a marathon season, consequently, Itoje sounds like a captain who doesn’t want the tour to end. “It has been said before but, in many ways, it shouldn’t really work. You have four different nations, four different ideologies, several different ways of how to play the game and how to think. It is not a homogenous group but people buy in, you forge great relationships and you build bonds. That’s what makes it special.”Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025Maro ItojeBritish & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

In better news for Farrell, Joe McCarthy, Mack Hansen and Sione Tuipulotu all took a full part in training on Tuesday and are in contention.The Breakdown | Absorbing Lions tour of Australia shows why best-of-three Test format worksRead moreFarrell sought to blow off any lingering cobwebs from the second-Test celebrations with a Squid Game challenge at the start of training. It was a version of “green light, red light”, a survival game based on stealth and the Ireland tighthead prop Thomas Clarkson was the first to be eliminated, but the Lions were soon down to business.The head coach and his staff will meet on Wednesday night to finalise selection, but Farrell is not expected to make wholesale changes given the Lions’ pursuit of history. Maro Itoje is likely to captain the side again even though he has surpassed the mandated 30-game limit dictated by the Rugby Football Union.“For this time of tour it’s amazing how many people we’ve got available,” the assistant coach Andrew Goodman said. “Unfortunately Garry has been ruled out of this Test match, but we have Mack, Joe, Sione all out there running today.“We had a Squid Game challenge, green light, red light, the whole field was covered in different things they could hide behind, and they had people in the top tier keeping an eye. It was a good craic.View image in fullscreenTadhg Furlong works hard in the gym.Photograph: David Davies/PA“[The motivation to win 3-0] is huge. It’s everything for us as a group to get excited about. It was 1974 the last time a Lions team went through the Test series unbeaten, so there’s huge motivation for the group.“[It will be] the best team available to win the series. That might look like some changes, that might look like consistency. We will see how the boys go through their recovery process over the next couple of days and whatever 23’s picked will go out there and do the best for the team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was 65.Sandberg was surrounded by his family when he died at his home on Monday, according to the team.Sandberg announced in January 2024 that he had been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. He had chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and then said in August 2024 that he was cancer-free.But he posted on Instagram on 10 December that his cancer had returned and spread to other organs. He announced this month that he was still fighting, while “looking forward to making the most of every day with my loving family and friends.”Cubs chair Tom Ricketts said Sandberg “will be remembered as one of the all-time greats in nearly 150 years of this historic franchise.”“His dedication to and respect for the game, along with his unrelenting integrity, grit, hustle, and competitive fire were hallmarks of his career,” Ricketts said in the team’s statement.Sandberg was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. He was selected out of high school by Philadelphia in the 20th round of the 1978 amateur draft.He made his major league debut in 1981 and went 1 for 6 in 13 games with the Phillies. In January 1982, he was traded to Chicago along with Larry Bowa for veteran infielder Ivan De Jesus.It turned into one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history.Sandberg hit .285 with 282 homers, 1,061 RBIs and 344 steals in 15 years with Chicago. He made 10 All-Star teams – winning the Home Run Derby in 1990 – and took home nine Gold Gloves.“Ryne Sandberg was a legend of the Chicago Cubs franchise and a beloved figure throughout Major LeagueBaseball,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said. “He was a five-tool player who excelled in every facet of the game thanks to his power, speed and work ethic.”Even with Sandberg’s stellar play, the Cubs made just two postseason appearances while he was in Chicago.He was the NL MVP in 1984, batting .314 with 19 homers, 84 RBIs, 32 steals, 19 triples and 114 runs scored. Chicago won the NL East and Sandberg hit .368 (7 for 19) in the playoffs, but the Cubs were eliminated by San Diego after winning the first two games of the National League Championship Series at Wrigley Field.The 1984 season featured what Cubs fans still call “The Sandberg Game,” when he homered twice and drove in seven runs in a 12-11 victory over St. Louis in 11 innings on 23 June.Chicago paid tribute to Sandberg and that game when it unveiled a statue of the infielder outside Wrigley Field on that date in 2024.“He was a superhero in this city,” Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer said during a TV broadcast of the team’s game on 20 July. “You think about (Michael) Jordan, Walter Payton and Ryne Sandberg all here at the same time, and I can’t imagine a person handling their fame better, their responsibility for a city better than he did.”Sandberg led Chicago back to the playoffs in 1989, hitting .290 with 30 homers as the Cubs won the NL East. He batted .400 (8 for 20) in the NLCS, but Chicago lost to San Francisco in five games.Sandberg set a career high with an NL-best 40 homers in 1990 and drove in a career-best 100 runs in 1990 and 1991, but he never made it back to the postseason. He retired after the 1997 season.“When you examine the offense and defense, you’ll find some years where he was the best player you’ve ever seen in your life,” former Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said.Sandberg was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005, receiving 76.2% of the vote by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America in his third try on the ballot. The Cubs retired his No 23 that same year.“Ryne Sandberg had a relentless work ethic and an unshakable positive outlook,” Hall of Fame chair Jane Forbes Clark said. “With it, he inspired all those who knew him.”Sandberg also managed Philadelphia from August 2013 to June 2015, going 119-159. He got the interim job when Charlie Manuel was fired, and he resigned with the Phillies in the middle of a difficult 2015 season.Explore more on these topicsMLBChicago CubsBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Private-hire firms declared the verdict to be a “triumph for the sector” after athree-year legal battle, which they had said could end with fares rising sharply for passengers.Uber had brought the case after a2021 supreme court decisionthat its drivers were workers, which had an impact on its tax and other obligations.The company sought a declaration that private-hire taxi operators enter into a contract with passengers and the high court in London ruled in its favour in 2023.That decision meant that operators would have to pay VAT at 20%, but the ruling was reversed by the court of appeal in July last year after a challenge by the private hire operators Delta Taxis and the platform Veezu.Uber appealed to the supreme court, which on Tuesday unanimously dismissed the US company’s case.The Veezu chief legal officer, Nia Cooper, said: “This decision is a triumph for the UK private-hire sector. The unanimous verdict ends a three-year legal battle and confirms that operators can continue to choose which business model they adopt to run their business.”She said the outcome would protect passengers from threatened fare increases and lessen the burdens on licensing authorities. “Uber was seeking a declaration that would have resulted in 20% VAT being charged on all PHV fares,” she said.“This ruling also shows that British-owned businesses can stand up against global giants that attempt to use litigation as a tactic to shape the sector to suit their business model.”An Uber spokesperson said: “The supreme court ruling confirms that different contractual protections apply for people booking trips in London compared to the rest of England and Wales. The ruling has no impact on Uber’s application of VAT, which has been upheld twice by other courts.”In a separate case, the Estonian ride-hailing and food-delivery startup Bolt this year defeated an appeal by the UK tax authority HMRC on what exactly it has to pay VAT on at 20%.HMRC has since been granted permission to challenge the ruling that Bolt is only liable for VAT on its margin, rather than the full cost of the trip, at the court of appeal.Explore more on these topicsUberTransportLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

It was made by Thomas Edison’s production studio in 1894 and can be found in the Library of Congress.So what you’re saying is that humanity hasn’t progressedmeaningfullyin almost a century and a half?No, I’m saying that there is something vital about the appeal of cat videos and the manner in which they have evolved with us.The Boxing Cats.But also …Well, yes, humans have always been easily pleased idiots.Now that we’ve cleared that up, why are we talking about them today?Oh, because CatVideoFest 2025 is preparing to launch.WhatVideoFest?Do keep your finger on the pulse, please. Every year since 2016, Will Braden has painstakingly assembled a compilation of online videos and public submissions into CatVideoFest, a feature-length, theatrically released montage of cat videos.Seriously, is this a thing?Not only is it a thing, but it’s a wildly successful one at that. The 2021 edition grossed just $94,000 at the box office, but last year’s took more than a million dollars. If the series continues to get 10 times more successful every three years, CatVideoFest 2036 will be the most successful movie of all time.So, is itany good?Sort of.

Sure, the Shire has a hazy comfort to it, and there’s plenty of unique food to gorge on and friendly faces to meet. But once the saccharine novelty begins to wear off, this bucolic wonderland is actually a fairly dull place to live.Tales of the Shire is set in the Third Age of Middle-earth, years before the events of The Lord of the Rings. As such, there are no Nazgûls or Uruk-hai – instead the “action” centres on the quaint town of Bywater, whose most pressing issue is its municipal status. Here, you play as a recent transplant from the nearby hamlet of Bree, who gets swept up in the process of turning the town into an official village by building infrastructure and befriending locals one odd job and home-cooked meal at a time.View image in fullscreenHazy comfort … Tales of the Shire.Photograph: Private DivisionNaturally this high-fantasy life simulator houses plenty of Tolkienian paraphernalia. You can find the Three-Farthing Stone nestled atop a hillside, and walk through the homely Green Dragon Inn. Plus, there are plenty of familiar surnames bobbing around, from Tooks to Cottons and Brandybucks – heck, even Gandalf pops his head in every so often. A chunky art style frames these iconic spaces and characters, coating the world with an appropriately twee veneer. It’s not a huge map to explore, but what’s there is tenderly dressed, with hanging washing swaying in the breeze, dinky lanterns, and roaming wildlife aplenty.As an upstart Hobbit, your primary goal is to feed and be fed, with all aspects of day-to-day life revolving around this all-important activity. In the wild you can find veggies, nuts and fruits to forage, and the rivers are home to plenty of fishing spots where you earn your catch of the day. There are also seasonal seedlings to purchase and plant, as well as artisanal shop stalls offering speciality items such as flour. With each day running on a timer, the major source of friction is in how efficiently you can dash about and hoover up the goods before bedtime.View image in fullscreenFishing spots aplenty … Tales of the ShireIt’s a well-trodden loop familiar to anyone who has played rural life sims such as Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon. But here, the steady flow of button clicks and undemanding chores operates more successfully as a sleep-inducing mental message than any form of compelling challenge.If you can brave the repetition and invest in your relationships with others, the game begins to open up, providing a slew of formulaic but appetising skill paths to rank up. Collecting ingredients is only half the story; you’ll also need to cook them up into satisfying bundles to serve at extravagant Breakfasts, Second Breakfasts, Elevenses, and so on. Combining elements of Cooking Mama and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tales of the Shire asks you to balance culinary profiles and textures to curate the perfect plate. To do this, you’ll chop, mix and sauté ingredients while consulting a flavour compass in the bottom corner of your screen to ensure your food is as delicious as possible. Eventually, by feeding the right folks, your kitchen expands and there are more opportunities available to get you into the Middle-earth Michelin Guide.But beyond its overly familiar mechanics, Tales of the Shire’s most pressing problem is how naive and placid it all feels. When vague interpersonal issues arise between your new friends, they’re always resolved in a swift, often mundane manner. Much of your time is spent running between frustrated halflings as they burden you with their petty dissatisfactions.Not all cosy games need to evoke hard emotions. However, it does feel like a disservice to the emotionally complex source material not to explore the richness of the world at large – especially when dry humour, tragedy and finely drawn social structures are what make Tolkien’s writing so powerful. Without any challenging quandaries to pull at your heartstrings, the promising atmosphere in Tales of the Shire is overwhelmed by endless fetch quests. Diehard Tolkienites and Stardew Valley lifers may be better off looking elsewhere for their cosy thrills.Tales of the Shire is out now, £34.99.Explore more on these topicsGamesPCNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5XboxreviewsShareReuse this content"

Why has this happened and where will it lead?Rick LaneTue 29 Jul 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 06.35 EDTShareIn the last two weeks, thousands of “adult only” and “not safe for work” games have disappeared fromSteamanditch.io– two of the most prominent distribution platforms for PC video games – as they scrambled to comply with stricter rules mandated by payment processors such as MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal.These rules were established after a campaign by the organisationCollective Shout, which urged payment processors to stop facilitating payments to platforms hosting “rape, incest and child sexual abuse-themed games”. But the new rules have affected a far broader range of games – including some award-winning titles.How did this start?On 16 July, Valve, the developer of Steam, updated itsrules and guidelinesregarding the games and software that can be distributed on the platform. The rules, which already prohibited “nude or sexually explicit images of real people” and “adult content that isn’t appropriately labelled or age gated” were expanded to include “content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors” including “certain kinds of adult content”.In a statement to PC Gameron 18 July, Valve confirmed it was “retiring” several games from the Steam store due to these new rules. It did not clarify which games were being removed, nor what “kinds of adult content” are now deemed unsuitable.A week later, itch.ioissued a statementexplaining it had also come under “scrutiny” from payment processors, and as such was “deindexing” (removing from search results) all games labelled “NFSW” as it undertook a “comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors.” Unlike Valve, itch.io specifically referenced Collective Shout as the cause of the renewed scrutiny.What is Collective Shout?Collective Shout is an Australian organisation thatdescribes itselfas “a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls”.In April, itsuccessfully petitionedto have the gameNo Mercy– which featured depictions of “incest”, “blackmail” and “unavoidable non-consensual sex” – removed from Steam and itch.io. After this, the grouppublished an open letterto payment processors claiming to have “discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse on both Steam and itch.io”, and requesting payment processors “demonstrate corporate social responsibility and immediately cease processing payments on Steam and itch.io”.After Steam altered its rules, Collective Shoutclaimed credit for the change, stating that more than 1,000 of its supporters had called or emailed payment processors to demand they “stop facilitating payments and profiting from these games”.Why payment processors?Like many online retailers,Steamand itch.io rely on payment processors to enable users to make purchases on their platforms. As such, these companies hold considerable power and can influence what products – regardless of their legality – are bought, sold or published.In recent years, payment processors have become increasingly strict about transactions relating to adult content. In 2021, the subscription-based video platform OnlyFans, widely used by adult content creators,announced it would ban adult materialfrom the site after pressure from payment processors – though this plan wassubsequently abandoned. Later that year, Mastercard imposed a new policy regulating adult content sellers – one criticised by theAmerican Civil Liberties Unionas being restrictive to free speech and potentially harmful to sex workers – and an example of what is known asfinancial censorship.View image in fullscreenThe award-winning Consume Me is among the games affected.Photograph: HexecutableWhich games have been affected?It isn’t clear how many games have been “retired” from Steam due to the new rules, but multiple games thatdepicted incest fantasieshave been removed. Itch.io, as mentioned, has deindexed most games labelled NSFW. According to the games industry newsletterGame File, more than 20,000 games have been removed from itch.io’s NSFW category since 16 July.But these include games that explore queer identity and sexuality, such as Radiator 2 by Robert Yang, a former teacher at New York University’s Game Center. And the rules have also hit games that do not depict sex in any way at all. These includeLast Call, a game about surviving domestic violence by award-winning game designerNina Freeman, andConsume Me, a game about disordered eating which has alsowon numerous industry awards.How has the games industry responded?Many developers have decried the power that payment processors wield over what games are bought and sold, and how that power can be exerted indirectly by campaign groups such as Collective Shout.In a Bluesky post, Yang described Collective Shout and payment processors as “waging culture war against LGBTQ people and sexual expression”, while Consume Me’s developers toldWiredthat it is “completely unacceptable that payment processors are conducting censorship-by-fiat and systematically locking adult content creators out of platforms”.Achange.orgpetition calling for payment processors and activist groups to “stop controlling what we can watch, read, or play” was launched on 17 July. The petition claims “MasterCard and Visa are interfering with legal entertainment”, and demands “the right to choose the stories we enjoy without moral policing”. So far it has accrued more than 150,000 signatures. Meanwhile, gamers and developers are sharing the phone numbers of major payment companies and encouraging people to call and complain.What happens next?It is hard to know for sure. With sustained consumer pressure, payment processors may reconsider their position, but it may also be challenging for anti-censorship voices to muster political support due to prevailing legislative winds surrounding online adult content. The UK this monthenacted stricter regulations regarding age verificationfor internet users wanting to access adult content, while the EU hasdrafted guidelinesfor similar systems.Consequently, it is likely that the new rules will remain in place at Steam and itch.io, at least for the immediate future. But the fallout has drawn attention to the power that payment processors wield, and the lack of clarity surrounding their rules. Because of this, they may tread more cautiously when responding to pressure from advocacy groups in the future.Explore more on these topicsGamesSteamPCexplainersShareReuse this content"

So it was reassuring to hearSir Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, resist the momentum behind cryptocurrencies. In his July Mansion House speech, hereiteratedhisscepticismover the need for a “Britcoin” central bank digital currency or a UK stablecoin, with tokens issued by finance houses and backed by their sterling reserves. As Donald Trump signsstablecoinsinto US law and rebrands private dollars with political colours, Sir Andrew’s caution isn’t just prudent, it’s essential.The governor’sviewis that UK banks should not be allowed to issue their own stablecoins. Nor should the Bank effectively runBritcoinbank accounts without clear public benefit. These are not the views of a luddite, but of a regulator worried, correctly, about creating a new class of imprudent assets. The key question is not whether new technologies can be adopted in finance, but whether they should be – especially when the consequences of failure could affect the wider economy.George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who advises alarge cryptocurrency exchange, argued that Mr Trump’s embrace of stablecoins, which are privately issued digital money, means Britain must sign up to remain relevant. The former Labour cabinet minister Ed Ballsconsideredthis naive, given recent history. He was right.Stablecoins are not, despite the branding, stable. These private digital tokens purport to be backed one for one by real money, often US dollars. But the peg is only astrustworthyas the institution making the promise. When a commercial bank issues a stablecoin, it is effectively minting its own currency – without, as theBank for International Settlementsnoted, the backing, oversight or “lender of last resort” guarantees of a central bank. This creates a parallel financial market, one prone to runs, crashes and contagion – just as happened in19th-century America’s free banking era, when half the new banks collapsed, many unable to honour the notes they had issued.Yet Mr Trump is pressing ahead by letting banks and even non-banks issue dollar-pegged crypto assets. He is alsoleveragingthe power of his office for personal gain in plain sight. One of the Trump family’s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320m since January, while another received a $2bn investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550m in tokens. Steven Levitsky of Harvard University spoke for many when he told theGuardianthis summer that he had “never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere”.Cyber-libertariansviewcryptocurrencies as a tool to evade state control, regulation and taxation, aligning with radical rightwing ideas about government as a problem. This seems to be the view ofPaul Marshall, the UK hedge fund tycoon andmedia baron, who sees a Manichean world of central bank fiat versus free-market cash. Such ideological takes don’t help with stable capital markets or effective consumer protection. Britain’sfinancial sectorshould besmallerfor the country’s long-term health, but it must still remain competitive – on regulatory terms that preserve stability, not simply to keep pace with Trump-era financial populism orpetro-stateopportunism. Crypto is a gamble not just on technology, but on the very meaning of money and who gets to control it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Whether the Turnberry owner was Donald Trump or Donald Duck, its lack of adjacent infrastructure makes it unfit for the Open. The Ayrshire venue, lauded again by its owner, Trump,during a visit in recent days, is simply incapable of hosting the Open in its present form.This need not be an uncomfortable reality for the US president, who can secure at least a portion of the profile and kudos he desires for Turnberry – one of the world’s most outstanding golf courses – from an alternative source. It would, in fact, now be a surprise if Turnberry does not appear on the Scottish Open’s rota at some point soon. Mutual convenience is staring us all in the face if Trump can even temporarily accept a prize which sits in the shadow of the championship he has craved since buying Turnberry in 2014.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump takes the inaugural tee shot on the first hole at Trump International.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockTheEuropean TourGroup has proved adept at navigating choppy sporting waters. Or, perhaps, merely dealing with the same away from prying eyes. It was the DP World Tour, formerly European, which eased Saudi Arabia into the golf mainstream and it is the same tour which allows Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton to pursue Ryder Cup ambitions while technically in dispute over fines issued for participation in LIV competitions.As eyes fix on Royal Porthcawl and the Women’s Open this week, where Lottie Woad will look to continue her vertiginous rise, the Legends Tour – Europe’s domain for senior citizens – will stop off at Trump Aberdeen. Only days later, the DP World Tour’s Nexo Championship is to be contested at the same venue. The European Tour Group has continued its trick of hiding in plain sight by arranging these events with no backlash whatsoever. Not so much as a raised eyebrow; a scenario that will inevitably continue as the tournaments take place.Depending on one’s viewpoint, this is either a tremendous example of public relations or an ominous sign that few people care about the European Tour Group’s approach to business. This is not at all to suggest protest or hand-wringing is essential, rather that Trump has quietly and already increased his golfing footprint in a land far from home. The Scottish government has even contributed £180,000 of public money to the Nexo Championship.The stakes look set to be raised. Doonbeg, now Trump Ireland, is known to be under consideration to stage the Irish Open. Reports suggest that could happen as quickly as 2026. Doonbeg and the Irish Open looks a strong alliance; a stunning location which also boasts hotel accommodation. Ireland, like Scotland, should have links venues for its national open.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump lauded Turnberry on his latest trip to the course.Photograph: Hugo Philpott/UPI/ShutterstockGuy Kinnings, the European Tour Group’s chief executive, attended a function in Trump’s company in Aberdeenshire on Monday evening before being present for the opening of the president’s New Course on the Menie Estate. As Trump cut the ribbon on the New Course, Kinnings was one of just four people standing behind him; two were the president’s sons.TheScottish Open’s present baseat the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is convenient. Leading players can stay on or close to the venue. Renaissance’s American owners want the Scottish Open to stay there in perpetuity. The tournament offers a form of seaside preparation immediately before the Open. Last month’s edition, though, bore witness to audible grumbles from golfers about the nature of that test. It is impossible to shake the feeling that Scotland has too many exceptional, true links courses for this competition to remain at its current home. Chief among them? Turnberry.There may be a necessary break to Renaissance’s run. The R&A will give the Open an overdue return to Muirfield at some point, meaning it would be logistically impossible to stage the previous week’s Scottish equivalent at a course which is basically next door. A switch to the west coast would make perfect sense at that point. Any suggestion Turnberry would be banned from future Open duties by hosting the DP World Tour is undermined by the fact professionals and amateurs crash around St Andrews and Carnoustie every year at the Dunhill Links Championship. Turnberry could not only handle a Scottish Open but would be a celebrated venue.“We love Scotland,” Trump announced before boarding Air Force One on Tuesday.

Here are eight reasons to be hopefulAlthough the trends can be hard to perceive, we are making incredible progress on global poverty, health, longevity and climate changeJohn D BoswellTue 29 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Seba Cestaro/GuardianDon’t fret the future.A lot of people do, and for powerful reasons – we are facing enormous challenges unprecedented in human history, from climate change and nuclear war to engineered pandemics and malicious artificial intelligence. A 2017 survey showed that nearly four in 10 Americans think that climate change alone has a good chance of triggering humanity’s extinction. But we seem largely blind to the many profound reasons for hope – and it’s not entirely our fault.Humans are wired with a “negativity bias” that triggers a stronger emotional response to bad news than good news – evident in the journalism maxim “if it bleeds, it leads”. This loss-aversion behavior served a purpose in our evolutionary past, when information and resources were scarce, but in the age of endless information access, it can lead to pessimism, anxiety and a distorted vision of what humanity is capable of.In reality, we are making incredible progress in global poverty, health, longevity, climate change and much more, but these trends are harder to perceive because they accumulate gradually and quietly. As the Wired magazine founder Kevin Kelly points out, progress is often about what doesn’t happen – the children who won’t die of smallpox, or the farmers whose crops won’t get raided.The world is still an awful place in many ways, and the crises we face are daunting. But looking past the dark headlines, we can see bright trendlines that give us profound reasons to be optimistic for our future.View image in fullscreen1 We’regetting agrip onclimatechangeJust a decade ago or so, it appeared that civilization was on a course to cause a disastrous 4C-5C of warming above pre-industrial levels. But since then, major nations and markets have responded with surprising force and urgency; global carbon dioxide emissions have significantly slowed, and in many countries, per capita emissions are falling even while per capita GDP and energy use are going up.We are still not doing enough – there is a lingering risk of runaway carbon cycle feedback loops that could push us over 4C – but nations are making ambitious net-zero commitments that, if realized, could feasibly keep warming below 2C.The pathway for avoiding the absolute worst outcomes – humanity’s extinction, for one – is increasingly clear and doable, and involves a combination of decarbonization, renewable energy breakthroughs, responsible geoengineering and carbon dioxide removal.The central reason for optimism, however, remains the coming age of radically cheaprenewable energy, primarily from solar photovoltaics.2 EnergyabundanceiswithinreachThe exponential growth insolar energyhas stunned even expert forecasters. In 2015, the International Energy Agency predicted that the world would add about 35 gigawatts of solar energy capacity by 2023.Their estimate was off by a factor of 10. The costs of solar have fallen below the cost of coal, a tipping point that will financially incentivize markets to go green even in the absence of policy pressures. There are strong reasons to believe this exponential progress will continue; soon it could become cheaper to create fuel out of thin air and water using solar energy than to drill for it underground.More signs of an energy revolution are all around: The same expert-defying growth is happening in the adoption of electric vehicles, and global investment in clean energy now far outstrips that offossil fuels. With worldwide access to radically cheap renewable energy and carbon-neutral fuels, underdeveloped countries can achieve first-world standards of living without a corresponding increase in carbon emissions. Already wealthy nations will see new waves of growth as energy abundance triggers new economic possibilities, including affordable desalination, which could address water shortages in many parts of the world. We may be on the verge of a new industrial revolution and a new era of human prosperity.3 WeareeradicatingpovertyAs the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker points out, you’ve never seen a newspaper run the headline “137,000 people escaped from extremepovertyyesterday” – yet this incredible statistic has been accurate every day for decades now. Since 1990, more than a billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty, with the impoverished share falling from 38% of the global population down to 9.1% today.That still leaves more than 600 million people living below the international poverty line of $2.15 a day, making it clear that the fight is far from over. But with energy abundance driving new growth and economic modalities, we can expect to see the downward trend continue; ultimately, we should strive for no less than a 0% rate of poverty globally. Further progress is there for the taking.View image in fullscreen4 Wearelivinglonger thaneverIt might be the most feelgood statistic of all time: an average person born today can expect to live more than twice as long as someone born around 1900. In South Korea, life expectancy has more than tripled, surging from just 23.5 years in 1908 to more than 83 years today.This dramatic increase is thanks to huge advances in medicine, public health and living standards, but also by a stunning fall in child mortality: for most of human history, about half of all children died before their 15th birthday; today the figure is less than 5% globally and as low as 0.4% in some wealthy nations. We can, and probably will, save millions of children’s lives by driving the global rate this low – a feasible and morally urgent goal for the 21st century.On top of all this progress, advances inageingbiology are leading to breakthroughs in slowing the ageing process and keeping laboratory animals healthier for longer. We now have numerous ways of accomplishing this with mice and primates; what is needed is an injection of funding to bring these experiments to human trials. Ageing is responsible for about two-thirds of all deaths; channeling our resources to lessen its tragic effects will have enormous and immediate benefits to human society. If the funding does come, the next few decades could get very interesting.5 Medicalbreakthroughs areacceleratingConverging advancements inAIand biotechnology are pointing toward a radical enhancement of human health and wellbeing. Already, projects like Google’s AlphaFold are discovering structures of pathogens and potential treatments for cancer much faster than humans could. New gene-editing tools like Crispr have the potential to cure many of the more than 10,000 diseases that are caused by single-gene mutations.Barney Graham, an immunologist who played a pivotal role in developing mRNA vaccines, puts it thusly: “You cannot imagine what you’re going to see over the next 30 years. The pace of advancement is in an exponential phase right now.” In the coming decades, we could potentially gain the power to regenerate limbs, engineer designer life forms, eliminate all disease and possibly extend our life spans indefinitely.View image in fullscreen6 Robotswilltakeourjobs (andthat’s agoodthing)If you’ve ever watched two-legged robots navigating obstacle courses and landing synchronized backflips, you are familiar with the incredible developments in robotics over the past decade. But the real reason to get excited now is not the leaps in physical capabilities (save for the potential of a future robot Olympics), but in intellectual abilities.OpenAI, creators of ChatGPT, has partnered with Figure, a robotics startup, to incorporate multimodal artificial intelligence into a humanoid form factor. Their walking, talking full-body robots are learning tasks merely by watching videos – no manual training required. Tesla’s Optimus bot is a direct competitor that its CEO,Elon Musk, believes will eventually be more valuable than the company’s electric car business.It’s not hard to see the value: humanoid robots could address acute labor shortages and replace labor-intensive and dangerous jobs, taking on roles in disaster response, healthcare, manufacturing, space exploration and much more – freeing real people to pursue more desirable jobs, elevating quality of life and boosting economic growth.Of course, humanity will only benefit if we can address the risks of job displacement and human safety. Half of the battle will be controlling these risks and ensuring we reap the benefits, rather than be overcome by armies of terminators.7 Anewspaceage isdawningFor decades, the final frontier was only accessible to a handful of major nations with mainly geopolitical interests. But in the past 10-15 years, launch costs have fallen drastically thanks to the advent of reusable rockets and innovative fuel types, enabling a new generation of space technologies and opening up the final frontier to a wave of commercial and scientific interests. Satellite broadband is starting to bring internet access to rural and underdeveloped parts of the world, which will bolster agriculture, education, health, economic opportunity and participation in democracy. Low-gravity environments are uniquely ideal for cell research, where scientists are growing miniature organs for study, and could lead to pharmaceutical breakthroughs. Eventually, bolder prospects like asteroid mining could supply trillions of dollars’ worth of rare materials without compromising environments back on Earth.You can almost feel the pace quickening: this decade has already seen twice as many moon missions as the 2010s. Plans for commercial space stations like Orbital Reef and Starlab are under way and slated to be operational before 2030. Nasa has plans to put humans on the moon again as soon as 2026. To top it all off, the recently launched James Webb space telescope is already discovering new secrets of the universe only two years into its mission. It’s finding water vapor on alien planets and holds the promise of detecting signatures of alien life. We may be on the verge of the most significant scientific discovery of all time. It’s safe to say that a new space age has arrived.View image in fullscreen8 Humans areincrediblyresilientIt’s not far-fetched to speculate that a major disaster may await us in the coming centuries. But humans have a long history of rebounding from catastrophic collapse. Our ancestors have survived asteroid impacts, ice ages, supervolcano eruptions and deadly plagues – each time eventually bouncing back to new heights.The Black Death of 1347 killed up to half the population of Europe and one out of every 10 people globally. But even this did not derail human progress in the long term, and it was followed by the scientific revolution just 200 years later. The upward march of humanity has never been and will never be perfectly smooth, but progress is unmistakable over the long term. It will take a truly apocalyptic sequence of events to stop us.Conclusion:optimism is aweaponThe modern world was built and shaped by optimists. We owe it to them to carry the torch. Optimism for the future is not only justified – it’s a weapon in the fight for a higher future, and a moral obligation to ourselves and to future generations.No future is guaranteed; there will be injustices and suffering in every path forward, just as there have been forever. A utopia will never be achievable, but in striving to reach it, we can create the best possible world for us and our descendants.The larger the problems we face, the greater the opportunity for progress; the immense challenges of the 21st century can be the catalyst for a new leap in the human condition to heights we cannot yet imagine.We have everything we need to thrive. Our resiliency will protect us; our intelligence will propel us. If there is one lesson our history can teach us, it’s to never underestimate the human race.View image in fullscreenIllustrations by Seba CestaroJohn D Boswell is a film-maker, composer, visual effects artist and editor"

But the packaging is more important than the productTue 29 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 12.46 EDTShareSummer, I’ve been told, is travel season. From about May to August, we’re all meant to be flinging cash at airlines, hotels, overpriced restaurants with watered-down Aperol spritzes, and whatever new wonder drug is supposed to make our bodies moderately palatable for display at the beach. The social pressure to go somewhere (anywhere) during summer has only gotten more pervasive since social media began its clumsy, knifepoint home invasion into our brains. Our Instagram and TikTok accounts are just free advertising for the travel industry. “Gosh, Spain looks nice. But maybe Mexico City is more chic these days?” It doesn’t matter where you go, as long as you go.Travel seems more socially necessary than ever, even while thetoll it takes on the environment gets heavierand theprospects of being allowed back home get grimmer. Travel is not healthy for the planet, and it’s not healthy for your mental state. But,according to the New York Times, itisdelicious. Airport lounges across the world are investing in better food, fancier accommodations and other perks like “being left alone” and “a functional shower”. You can have access to posh hideaways like the Delta One Lounge or the American Express Centurion Lounge for a price (either credit card fees or a long, expensive flight to a place you don’t necessarily want to go).Awaiting you are opulent buffets with food from celebrity chefs such as José Andres and Kwame Onwuachi, and open bars with elaborate cocktails on offer. Most things in these lounges are free, but there are always extras for those who are truly irresponsible with their money. The Delta One Lounge at New York’s John F Kennedy airport offers dollops of caviar for $85. At most of these places, you can get actual champagne, rather than the bathtub-flavored grape water they have on tap for losers like me. They should give you a free button to wear with every purchase that says “I can afford the good stuff” – so everyone knows you have no student loan debt.All of this is meant to help airlines and credit-card companies maximize profits for their avaricious stockholders. They will charge an exorbitant amount of money for well-heeled passengers to, say, get their feet rubbed by a nude stranger, but if you can’t afford such a luxury at the airport, you can get naked and rub a guy’s feet for free.An airport is now like the condo building fromJG Ballard’s novel High-Rise, where our ossified class system manifests itself in a massive concrete structure that divides us based on income and accident of birth. The lower floors are occupied by tradespeople, the middle floors by artists and educated strivers. The top floor is reserved for the truly wealthy and the landed gentry, who sneer at the lower floors and expect fealty. The airport is similarly stratified. It’s not just one lounge per airline. Now, the mind-bogglingly decadent Delta One Lounge sits near the decidedly middle-class Delta SkyClub, where the food consists not of caviar or succulent roast pork, but a melange of vaguely local fare (at Detroit’s SkyClub, I recently turned my nose up at the wettest casserole I’ve ever seen, paired with a white dinner roll smothered in glistening butter, which I assume is a midwestern delicacy with a funny name like “Gristlepassage”).The SkyClub is an attainable simulacrum of luxury, with free magazines and a hot chocolate bar. These middlebrow lounges are routinely overcrowded, because the barrier to entry is lower. In the Delta One Lounge, which I cannot afford, I assume the exclusivity means that more often than not, it’s just you and a manservant named Longbottom whose only job is to carry your bags to and from the lavatory. The Delta One lounge is like a beacon of contentment (or an obnoxious tease, depending on how jet-lagged I am) when I walk past. I turn into Oliver Twist at the sight of a Delta One Lounge, begging for a crumb of lobster before my connection to Salt Lake City. I know envy in a way that makes me feel like a child deprived of screen time on a long drive to Yosemite national park.Surely this sort of class cold war can’t sustain itself forever. In High-Rise, conditions in the building deteriorate – elevators stop working, trash chutes clog, and electricity fails regularly. As the physical structure falls into disarray, so does the citizen population. There areriots, assaults, murders and the eating of a dog. I could see this happening at Los Angeles international airport (LAX) if the Buffalo Wild Wings runs out of honey mustard – throngs of unwashed masses re-enacting January 6 on the unsuspecting patrons of the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse. All for a spot of caviar.You might be wondering, though: is the food as good as the New York Times claims? Is it actually worth setting fire to a public place for a taste? In short, yes.Also, no.You see, the airport lounge is only as good as the food outside it is bad. It’s a microcosm of how our class system perpetuates itself. As things grow more dire for the lower class, the middle class is driven to consume even more, as a signal to the world that they are, in fact, better. The deeper the hole gets beneath you, the more desperate you are to climb out. I am so eager to avoid having to swallow a limp hoagie at the LAX Jersey Mike’s that I will spend money I shouldn’t for the privilege of a slightly firmer sandwich in an airport lounge. Is the food demonstrably better at the Centurion Lounge at Heathrow than it is in the main concourse? No – it all probably gets squirted out at the same sludge factory. But it makes me feel special, because someone is being paid minimum wage to take my plate when I’m done eating.While half-asleep, dehydrated and full of flight-related anxiety, I can’t even tell the difference between good and bad, right or wrong, fabulous or fetid. I am a yawning cavern of need, hoping to be filled up with whatever greasy carbs I can find. I had a perfectly adequate chicken tinga at the LAX SkyClub recently, which satisfied me until I woke up in a cold sweat over the Atlantic Ocean nine hours later. I likely would have responded to it more negatively if I had eaten it out of a paper cup next to a Hudson News while a dog in a gym bag silently farted a few feet away.Airlines, like every other big business, have figured out that the packaging is more important than the product. It’s about the emotional response people have to what you’re selling. The lords and ladies on the top floor of the metaphorical high-rise of our society have deigned to offer up a Disneyland re-creation of civilization, where we are treated with dignity rather than herded like lemmings over a cliff made of rubbery chicken. As was once said: “Let them eat cake (as long as they have a Chase Sapphire Rewards card).”Explore more on these topicsTravelOpinionAirline industryFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

The groundwork is already being doneTue 29 Jul 2025 09.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 13.46 EDTShareRoll up! Roll up! TheGhislaine MaxwellRehabilitation Tour is coming to town. You may think Jeffrey Epstein’s associate and former girlfriend is now behind bars for good reason but, according to some big brains in the Maga-sphere, poor old Maxwell may have suffered a terrible miscarriage of justice.Maxwell “just might be a victim”, Newsmax anchor Greg Kellymused on air recently. “She just might be. There was a rush to judgment … All right, granted, she hung out with Jeffrey Epstein, and I know that’s apparently not good, but she’s in jail. For how long now? Twenty years.”To discuss this further, Kelly brought on Alan Dershowitz, whom he introduced as “one of the greatest attorneys who ever lived”. Which certainly isn’t how I’d describe the retired Harvard professor.Dershowitz, who helped procure alenient plea dealfor Epstein in 2008, alsowrote an op-ed for the LA Timesin 1997 headlined Statutory Rape Is an Outdated Concept, in which he argued 15 seems “appropriate” for the age of consent. Dershowitz suggested some “reasonable people” might even favour 14 – which happens to be the age of some ofEpstein’s victims. When that op-ed resurfaced in 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Dershowitzdefended it, saying he stood by “the constitutional (not moral) argument” offered.Dershowitz now reckons Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 on five counts of aiding Epstein in his abuse of underage girls andsentenced to 20 yearsin federal prison in 2022, has suffered enough. “She shouldn’t have been in jail for five years for what she is alleged to have done,” Dershowitztold Newsmax on Sunday. “She served more time than anybody has ever served for any comparable offence.”I’m sure I don’t need to spell out why others seem to be attempting to rebrand Maxwell as the victim of a stitch-up. The Epstein files have turned into a disaster of Trump’s own making. He hasn’t been able to distract people from the story, so now there is speculation that he is trying to make some sort of deal with Maxwell. Who, by the way, had secretive conversations with Trump’s department of justice last week and, on Monday, asked thesupreme court to overturn her conviction, saying she was unjustly prosecuted. One can imagine a scenario in which Maxwell releases a few select details about Epstein that absolve Trump and make his enemies look bad in exchange for a pardon. (“I’m allowed to give her a pardon but nobody’s approached me with it,” Trump said on Monday.) However, for that hypothetical strategy to be successful, Maxwell’s reputation needs to be rehabilitated. She would need to look like a victim rather than a monster.Which is where Newsmax, and its sudden interest in Maxwell, might help. The cable news channel, which is to the right of Fox News, is essentially a pro-Trumppropaganda outletwith strong financial ties to the president. Earlier this month the outlet announced that it hadstruck a dealfor the Trump Media and Technology Group Corp to stream Newsmax on its platform. Which obviously raises a lot of conflict-of-interest questions. “This is now the Trump network,” one Newsmax insider complained tothe Independent last week. “Even the most conservative people at Newsmax think it’s a terrible look and they feel like state-run media.” Also raising questions is the fact that Alex Acosta, the prosecutor who gave Epsteinthat plea dealin 2008, happens to be onthe board of Newsmax.I don’t know what will happen next with Maxwell, but I can tell you that I absolutely believe the women Epstein abused over anchors on Trump’s propaganda channel. And I believe those women over Maxwell herself. Epstein’s accusershave repeatedly been clearthat Maxwell was no victim. “She didn’t just procure girls for Epstein – she participated in their abuse,” accuser Annie Farmertold ABC News on Monday. Now it’s looking increasingly likely that, instead of releasing the Epstein files, Trump will release Maxwell instead.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If he is trying to keep a scandal clandestine, Trump has instead shined a klieg light on it. His changeable diversions constantly call attention to what he wishes to remain hidden. His prevarications, projections and protests have scrambled his allies and set them against each other. His inability to remain silent on the subject makes him appear as twitchy as a suspect in the glare of a third-degree police interrogation.The supine Republican Congress abruptly adjourned for the summer to flee the incessant demands for the release of files in the possession of the Department of Justice. But three Republicans broke to vote with Democrats on theHouseoversight committee to demand the Epstein files. The speaker, Mike Johnson, abandoning his assigned role as a Trump echo chamber, blurted, “This is not a hoax,” directly contradicting Trump. Johnson’s plain statement prompted widespread jaw dropping.With every rattled excuse, Trump throws his administration into further chaos. His cabinet members are pitted against each other – the attorney general,Pam Bondi, versus the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, a pair of scorpions in a bottle.Ghislaine Maxwell is talking – but what can she tell and can she be believed?Read moreTrump has succeeded in driving Bondi from her regular perch on Fox News, as his reliable apologist, into virtual seclusion. She has reportedly engaged in a screaming match with the deputy director of the FBI, Dan Bongino, a former far-right talkshow jock who made his bones parroting that the Epstein files held the secrets of a vast conspiracy to blackmail deep state actors. After she issued a statement that there was no such “client list”, he apparently sulked at home,declining to come into the office, upset that his reputation was being sullied with his former Maga listeners. Bondiaccused himof leaking unfavorable stories to the media that blamed her for the Maga backlash against her announcement. The manosphere bigmouth, sensitive about his hurt feelings, was in a tizzy, oh dear.“No, no, she’s given us just a very quick briefing,”Trump saidon 15 July about whether Bondi had told him his name was in the files. “I would say that, you know, these files were made up by [the former FBI director James] Comey, they were made up by [Barack] Obama, they were made up by the Biden administration.” The next day hepostedon Truth Social that “Radical Left Democrats” and “the Fake News” were behind “the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”.A week later, on 23 July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Bondi hadbriefedTrump in May that his name appeared in the Epstein files. Which also raised the question: what did Elon Musk know and from whom did he know it when he tweeted in June that Trump’s name was in the files, a tweet he quickly deleted after he had played arsonist? Did Bondi and the FBI director, Kash Patel, inform him about Trump’s presence in the Epstein documents? Where else would he have gotten the idea?Into the death valley of parched alibis stepped Tulsi Gabbard to win Trump’s affection with a press conference orchestrated at the White House on the same day the Journal punctured Trump’s lie about Bondi briefing him on the Epstein files. Gabbard was there to expose a “treasonous conspiracy” of Obama administration officials who supposedly plotted to manufacture the “Russiagate” scandal that Putin sought to help Trump in the 2016 election, which was a fact. Herpresentationwas a farrago of falsehoods. She conflated Russian interference with false claims that Obama fabricated information about Russian hacking of voting machines and other fairytales. Gabbard also triumphantly unveiled a report that Hillary Clinton was on a “daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers”, which was sheerpropagandaconcocted by Russian intelligence long debunked as “objectively false” by the FBI.Gabbard’s performance unselfconsciously portrayed herself as a useful idiot for Russian spies. Trump was ecstatic. “She’s, like, hotter than everybody. She’s the hottest one in the room right now,”he said. Hepostedthat the Democrats “are playing another Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax but, this time, under the guise of what we will call the Jeffrey Epstein SCAM”.Trump made a remark that he had never made before, something that underscored the depth of his anxiety. ‘Don’t,’ he said, ‘talk about Trump’Bondi was reportedlyfrustrated with Gabbard. Bondi had been given little warning that Gabbard’s work would be dumped in her lap “for criminal referral”, apparently in order to satisfy Trump’s appetite for revenge. Bondi had been the catalyst of the“client list” pseudo-scandal, claiming it was sitting on her desk. Always ready to gratify Trump’s whims, she was not prepared to be sideswiped by Gabbard. In the pursuit of Trump’s favor, one lackey lapped another.Bondi finessed the situation by appointing a special “strike force” to examine and undoubtedly dismiss yet again Trump’s attempt to blot out the conclusive official reports, from the Mueller report to the report by theSenate intelligence committee, chaired by thensenator Marco Rubio, that had documented his campaign’s involvement with Russian agents in 2016. Bondi appeared to be seething inannouncingthe “strike force”, going out of her way to describe Gabbard as “my friend”. The grueling Trump cabinet dance marathon goes round and round until they drop.To demonstrate Obama’s supposed guilt, Trump posted an AI-generated video showing Obama forced to his knees and shackled in chains by federal agents before a seated and smiling Trump in the Oval Office to the soundtrack of the song YMCA. Trump apparently thinks that depicting himself as an enslaver, President Simon Legree, is a positive image that can deflect questions about his sexually predatory behavior and Epstein relationship.“He’s done criminal acts,”saidTrump about Obama, and he mused, “There’s no question about it, but he has immunity. He owes me big.” Trump was referring to the supreme court’s ruling granting him “absolute” immunity for “official acts” that wound up relieving him of prosecution for the January 6 insurrection. As Trump explained it, he was responsible for the decision, at least through justices he had appointed, and Obama was indebted to him over “crimes” that Trump himself had made up to make the Epstein shadow disappear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Suddenly, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, who had been Trump’s personal attorney in the Stormy Daniels hush-money trial, in which Trump was convicted of 34 felonies, was sent racing to Tallahassee to interview Epstein’s imprisoned co-conspiratorGhislaine Maxwell.No mere professional prosecutor would do for this high-level mission. Instead, in an unprecedented move, the deputy attorney general would conduct the interrogation. The case, in fact, was closed after Maxwell’s indictment for perjury, conviction for sex-trafficking minors and 20-year sentence. Yet Blanchestated, sloppily misspelling her first name in his haste, “If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.” He said that Maxwell can “finally say what really happened”, as if she would perhaps prove the existence of the fictional “client list” or some version of it to incriminate the enemies it contained, or clear Trump as a gentleman beyond reproach.Blanche’s remark seemed to dangle a pardon or clemency. Asked about the possibility, Trump said, “I’m allowed to do it.” Curiously, on 14 July, the solicitor general, D John Sauer, who was Trump’s lawyer in the presidential immunity case before the US court of appeals, had filed a brief to the supreme court opposing relief that Maxwell had requested. “From about 1994 to 2004, petitioner ‘coordinated, facilitated, and contributed to’ the multimillionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of numerous young women and underage girls,” Sauerwrote. She could not be exempt from her conviction on the basis of Epstein’s first trial agreement as she claimed; she had been fairly tried, convicted and the matter was closed.But the acceleration of the Epstein backlash apparently flipped the administration’s position. Now, Blanche gave Maxwell a grant oflimited immunity. Her attorney, David O Markus, was a good friend of Blanche’s. In the Stormy Daniels hush-money case, he had offered Blanche the advice that he should impeach Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, as a witness against him, by characterizing him as “GLOAT” –the “Greatest Liar of All Time”. In 2024, Blanche appeared twice on Markus’s little-watched podcast. “I consider you a friend,”saidBlanche.Blanche asked Maxwell over two days about 100 people,accordingto Markus. Who those people might be, what she was asked and what she said remain unknown. One wonders, for example, if Blanche inquired about her knowledge of Trump’s adventures in the dressing rooms of underaged models and beyond.One prominent model agent, quoted in a 2023 story inVariety, “Inside the Fashion World’s Dark Underbelly of Sexual and Financial Exploitation: ‘Modeling Agencies Are Like Pimps for Rich People,’” said that Trump was “certainly” a “fixture”. “I would see Donald Trump backstage at [Fashion Week home] Bryant Park, and I’m like, ‘Why is he standing there when there’s a 13-year-old changing?” In 1992, Trump got George Houraney, a Florida businessman, to sponsor a “calendar girl” competition with 28 young models who were flown to Mar-a-Lago. But there were reportedly only two guests. “It was him and Epstein,” Houraneysaidto the New York Times. “I said, ‘Donald, this is supposed to be a party with VIPs. You’re telling me it’s you and Epstein?’”One of those models, Karen Mulder, who had appeared on the cover of Vogue the year before and was considered among the most elite supermodels, described her experience with Trump and Epstein as “disgusting”, according to theMiami Herald.A year later, in 1993, Epstein brought a Sport Illustrated swimsuit model, Stacey Williams, to Trump Tower. She had met the future president at a Christmas party in 1992. “It became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together,” Williamstoldthe Guardian. “The second he was in front of me,” she recounted toCNNin 2024, “he pulled me into him, and his hands were just on me and didn’t come off. And then the hands started moving, and they were on the, you know, on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt, back up, sort of then, you know – they were just on me the whole time. And I froze. I couldn’t understand what was going on.” While Trump groped her, he kept talking to Epstein, and they were “looking at each other and smiling”.Markus said: “We haven’t spoken to the president or anybody about a pardon just yet.” Still, he added: “The president this morning said he had the power to do so. We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way.”The House oversight committee has subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition on 11 August, but she has not decided yet whether to cooperate,her lawyer said.While Blanche hurried back to Washington, Trump appeared to have depleted his armory of conspiracy theories, at least for the moment. He tried a novel tack, his most audacious projection yet. “I’m not focused on conspiracy theories that you are,” he admonished the White House press corps. Then he made a remark that he had never made before, something contrary to his entire character, which underscored the depth of his anxiety. “Don’t,” he said, “talk about Trump.”But Trump quickly recovered from the tension of his momentary reticence, and on the evening of 26 July, from Scotland, where he was touring his golf courses, hepostedthat Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey and Al Sharpton should be prosecuted for their endorsement of Kamala Harris in exchange for payments of millions of dollars. “They should all be prosecuted!” he demanded. Though a bogus accusation, it accurately reflected Trump’s crudely transactional worldview. A few hours later, in the early morning of Sunday 27 July, heposteda Fox News clip of the rightwing talker Mark Levin, writing in capital letters: “THIS IS A MASSIVE OBAMA SCANDAL!”Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

We say: it is not too late to save lives. End the genocide nowTue 29 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTShareThe world has stood by as Israel has murderedtens of thousandsof Palestinians in Gaza, wounded more than double that number, buried countless more under the rubble anddevastatedcivilian infrastructure. The territory’s survivors, displaced repeatedly by the Israeli military, are in a state ofenforcedstarvation and utter precarity. Despite Israel’s ban on international journalists, witnesses and victims are livestreaming unbearable images and videos of emaciated children and adults shot while desperately seeking aid. Israeli officials have proposed the construction of what would be concentration camps and the deportation of surviving Palestinians.Protesting over Gaza’s starvation feels like screaming into a void – but we mustn’t stop | Nesrine MalikRead moreMotivated by our deep scholarly and ethical engagement with political violence and mass atrocity, including the Nazi genocide of Jewish people, we helped found theGenocide and Holocaust Studies Crisis Networkin April. More than 400 scholars of genocide and Holocaust studies from two dozen countries joined within weeks of its launch. The rapid growth of the group testifies to the urgency of this moment. Today, along with hundreds of humanitarian organizations, dozens of governments, and millions of protesting students and citizens across the globe, we call for immediate concrete measures to prevent further atrocity crimes and to protect civilians.Since the 7 October massacre, Israeli officials and their accomplices have justified genocidal violence against Palestinians by equating Hamas with Nazism,instrumentalizingthe memory of the Holocaust to advance, rather than prevent, mass violence. Meanwhile, too many governments materially support the genocide in Gaza while silencing protest. Even as the tone of some official statements has become more critical of Israel in recent weeks, many states continue tosupplyIsrael with lethal weapons,shieldIsraeli leaders from international arrest warrants and fuelinvestmentin the Israeli war economy. International pressure can work, but we need much more of it.The emergency is in front of us. And yet, some prominent scholars of the Holocaust continue to engage in open denialism or outright approval of mass atrocities perpetrated by Israel. Scholarly associations, universities and institutions dedicated to Holocaust research, education and commemoration not only remain silent in the face of Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza but provide ideological cover for Israel’s blatant violations of international law. Institutions such asYad Vashemand theUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museumadhere to a “Palestine exception” when opposing genocide and mass atrocity. At the same time, organizations dedicated to combating prejudice, such as the Anti-Defamation League, use spuriousaccusations of antisemitismto silence or discredit those who dare to speak out.We are determined to challenge this moral and political capitulation.We created the Genocide andHolocaustStudies Crisis Network to do just that. We pledge to support Palestinians as they exercise their rights to education and cultural heritage in the face of massive destruction of their schools, archives and memory sites. We commit to pressuring our institutions to confront the contradictions between their stated commitment to “never again” and their silence or complicity in the face of Gaza. In light of ongoing genocidal violence and the return of authoritarian regimes, we will provide new resources and syllabuses in order to teach rigorously about the past in the context of our ever more vulnerable present. We will offer solidarity and support to our students and colleagues who run grave personal and professional risks for speaking out.Gaza is starving. So are its journalists | Jodie GinsbergRead moreWe contest the widespread “conspiracy of helplessness” and the normalization of mass violence and starvation in Gaza. We have learned from history that there are many ways in which states can take action in response to crimes against humanity. We urge all states who signed theConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocideto fulfill their responsibilities under international law: demand and enforce a permanent ceasefire, an arms embargo, the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip, unimpeded distribution of humanitarian aid, and equality and self-determination for all Palestinians.As members of the Genocide and Holocaust Studies Crisis Network, we say: it is not too late to save lives.

But while the people have spoken, turbulence is inevitable when coexisting with such a large and unpredictable beast.Guardian Essential poll: most Australians doubt we will ever receive Aukus submarines amid Trump uncertaintyRead moreThis week’s Guardian Essential Reportsuggests that Albanese is hitting the right notes so far; neither kowtowing nor cock-strutting, seeking sober engagement with the US while modelling a more constructive relationship with our largest trading partner, China.Trump’s tariff torpedoes have been a first test of Australian resolve and, while the beef over biosecurity was resolved while our poll was in the field, there is still strong appetite for drawing lines around pharmaceuticals, media and tech, all potential battlefields to maintain our democratic sovereignty.For each of the following policies, which approach most reflects your view of how the Albanese government should respond to this tariff pressure?But even if Albanese can manage the trade maze and maybe even pare back some of the impost on steel and aluminium, this is just the pointy end of our relationship with the elephant.The trunk is the Aukus defence agreement forged, we should remember, by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and“that fella down under”, before the 2022 federal election.That deal was to allow Australia to access US-UK nuclear technology delivering long-range submarines as a part of a broader defence integration with the dominant colonial powers of the previous two centuries.In returnwe payeye-watering sums of money to retool British ship-making and provide regular (shake) downpayments to the US (we deliveredanother $800mlast week).In opposition, the Labor leadership made the snap decision to back inAukus, making the totally rational short-term calculation that they did not want to allow an unpopular incumbent to run a drums of war election.But Australians are now shackled to this agreement as it begins to unravel, with growing doubts emerging as to whether it will ever deliver a single submarine and suspicions it is more about expanding the US nuclear footprint in the region.How likely is it that the US will deliver nuclear submarines to Australia under the Aukus agreement?And it’s not just the weapons. Aukus will also see the integration of the American model of surveillance technology, designed and delivered by the same overlords and hucksters who have integrated their interests into the US military-industrial complex.The elephant in the room is about more than Trump. US power has been exercised so fully for the last 80 years that Australia’s interests have become synonymous (apart from Gough Whitlam’s ultimately futile crack at independence in the 1970s).In the name of the alliance, we gratefully accepted US protection in the second world war, cheered them on through the cold war, absorbed American culture and values while turning a blind eye to the overthrow of scores of democratically elected governments from Chile to Iran.The time for Australia to recognise the state of Palestine is right now | Ed HusicRead moreBut as defence analyst Hugh White argues in his recentQuarterly Essay, the times are a-changing; Biden had already moved to a more isolationist posture and “in a strange, sad way Trump is doing us a favour” by saying this out loud.“That makes it even more urgent now for Australia to work out how to make our way, for the first time in our history in an Asia no longer made safe for us by a great and powerful friend,” White writes.Even as Trump dominates our attention, diplomatic separation is occurring in real time with Australia inching, far too slowly, towards more decisive action with other middle powersin recognising the ongoing slaughter and starvation in Gaza.A final question in this week’s report suggests voters sense this recalibration is under way, with a significant turnaround in the numbers who see our fortunes more closely tied to China.Given the choice between the United States of America and China, with which country do you think it would be most beneficial for Australia to strengthen our relationship?So how do you eat an elephant? As the great South African freedom leader Bishop Desmond Tutu used to say: “One bite at a time.”With the US and UK already reviewing the Aukus agreement to see how much more they can squeeze out of us, convening our own review and asking own pointed questions seems to be the least we should do.What are the benefits and costs? Are we seeking (to quote Paul Keating) security in Asia or from Asia? And is it really in our interests to become more fully integrated into the US industrial-military-tech complex?As Joyce and McCormack attack net zero and rejoice in not being ‘gelded’, Ley’s big challenge is now crystal clear | Tom McIlroyRead moreOnce we’ve set those parameters we can confront the more fundamental question about our US relationship: are we a member of the family, a trusted partner, a valued client or just somebody they used to know?Maybe the answer will indeed be “All the Way with Donald J”; but if so, let’s do it with open eyes (and open wallets) and a clear understanding of the opportunities and risks inherent in taking this path.The PM begins his second term with an overwhelming majority and capacity to do great things on energy transition, health services, economic equality and so much more. But until he addresses the elephant in the room the government will never truly be his own.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the 2025 election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

People want real transformative politics – we will give it to themJeremy CorbynMore than 500,000 people have signed up to our new party to help build a genuine alternative to poverty, inequality and warTue 29 Jul 2025 12.14 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShare“Make no mistake: this is just the beginning.”That is what we saidafter our election victory in Islington North last summer – and we meant it. For many people, the past year in politics is easy to define: Labour has failed to deliver the change the British people deserved. Refusing to scrap the two-child benefit cap. Taking support away from disabled people. Providing political and military support to Israel as starving Palestinians are shot in the street. From the moment this government was elected, it has inflicted suffering and injustice at home and abroad.There is another definition of the past year in politics: up and down the country, communities have been organising for something different, something new, something better. Trade unions and tenants’ unions are fighting back against corporations, bosses and rogue landlords profiting from the cost of living crisis. Disability justice campaigners are mobilising in their thousands to resist cruel welfare cuts, anti-racism campaigners are resisting the prime minister’s attack on migrants and climate activists are bringing into focus the single greatest threat facing humanity. A movement for Palestine is still coming out to demonstrate in unprecedented numbersagainst the government’s support for Israel’s assault on Gaza.These movements are united by a similar conviction: our political system is broken. Over the past 40 years in parliament, I have witnessed first-hand the reasons why. Politics should be about empowerment. Instead, people are shut out of the decisions that affect their daily lives. For too long, top-down political parties have patronised their members and disempowered the communities they claim to represent. When highly centralised political parties answer to nobody but themselves, you get policies that nobody asked for. You get privatisation of our public services. You get austerity. You get4.5 million children living in povertyin the sixth-richest country in the world.For too long, people have been denied a real political choice. Not any more. Last Thursday, we announced that we were building anew kind of political party– one that belongs to you. In just three days, more than 500,000 people signed up to yourparty.uk to help build a real alternative to poverty, inequality and war. This was not just a rejection of the establishment. It was a rallying cry for a new way of doing politics – one that is open, inclusive and democratic.Only a truly democratic party can provide the space for the policies that are needed to transform society. Up and down the country, there is huge appetite for an economic reset. One that brings water, energy, rail and mail into public ownership. One that invests in welfare, not warfare. One that ends this government’s complicity in genocide and brings about justice for the Palestinian people. One that makes the wealthiest in society pay a bit more in tax to ensure that everyone can live in dignity.This is the political vision that can inspire hope, not fear. The great dividers want you to think that migrants and minorities are responsible for the problems in our society. They’re not. Those problems are caused by a rigged economic system that protects the interests of billionaires and corporations. By scapegoating migrants and minorities for its own domestic failures,Labourhas paved the path for Reform UK. This Labour government is here to appease Reform. We are here to defeat Reform. We are at a critical juncture, and we need an alternative, now.No fear or favours: how Corbyn and Sultana’s party could blow up British politicsRead moreOne of the biggest mistakes we can make is thinking we must choose between parliament and our communities as battlegrounds for change. We want to build power everywhere. That is how you transform a moment into a movement that grows for generations to come. That is how we can take on the establishment, inside and outside parliament, to win a better society for us all.And that is why a democratic party is necessary: to link up campaigns across society, and help people win power in their localities, workplaces and neighbourhoods. As I said, the past year is not just about Labour’s failure. It’s about the extraordinary fightback from trade unions, tenants’ unions, disability justice campaigners, anti-racist campaigners, climate activists and a global movement for peace. These groups can only achieve so much on their own. Think of what we could achieve together.The future we deserve is no pipe dream. Look around you, and you will find proof that a better world is possible. We are not fighting for crumbs. We are fighting for real change – and we are never, ever going away.Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North.

It will be bad for them and for the desperate people seeking helpTue 29 Jul 2025 11.19 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 11.26 EDTShareIn the darkness, a light. It shines on the corner of a modest row of houses in a nondescript street. The night may feel oppressive and empty, but still the light shines. And it illuminates a word that says there is still hope. That word is: Samaritans.That light was fixed to a building where I spent many extraordinary hours. I had the privilege of volunteering for the charity for three years; the experience changed my life. And there are many other such lights, in cities and towns and villages across the country: you may sometimes glimpse them from a window of a train, and they remind you there is desperate suffering everywhere, but also that, everywhere, there is someone to help.Samaritans has more than 200 branches. But, according to its managers,that is too many. They said last week that they want to close 100 of them. Volunteers will be moved to “regional hubs”, and some volunteers will take calls at home. This news has alarmed many of those who give up their free time for the charity, and I share their fears. Both parts of the plan carry wider significance, too: the first as an example of a trend towards making charities more like corporations, the second in the questions it raises about working from home.One of the first things that struck me about Samaritans was its amateurism. I mean that in the best possible way. Its standards are professional and its training is rigorous, but it runs on love. We operated not from a shiny call centre, but from a converted mid-20th-century semi, a homely place. Although the branch had dozens of volunteers, there would be only two or three of us on duty at any given time.Chad Varah, who founded Samaritans in 1953.It was intimate, humble and human. You would gradually get to know the other volunteers, and the relationships forged would be crucial in getting you through tough calls. A lot was done with pen and paper. In contrast to a digital world that can seem so alienating, it all felt warmly analogue.This culture is what makes Samaritans so distinctive. There are no scripts or prompts – just you, your ears and your humanity. Samaritans are not automatons. Yes, you could theoretically operate in the same way from a “regional hub”, but the feel of the thing would surely be different: less grounded, less rooted, less like somewhere a caller might call from.The “localness”, too, is important. You might receive a call from anywhere in the country, but your branch is a symbol to its community. What the charity’s managers call “bricks and mortar” are real buildings in real places. And a branch is embedded in its place: its volunteers may help out at nearby schools, or spread the message of Samaritans at local fetes.Of course, running a charity is difficult, and the demands on Samaritans are intense. What was once regarded as the last resort for those on the brink of suicide is now, for too many, the only way to get through to a human who will listen. The charity is having to fill huge gaps left by underfunded public services, a problemcompounded recently by economic problems and the crisis in the cost of living. If you’re running Samaritans, and you need to balance resources with demand, you may well look at your budget and see the sense in shutting half your branches. But efficiency can bring its own costs, and so much of what makes Samaritans special will never show up on any spreadsheet.And there are surely risks too in taking calls “remotely”. Remotely – the word suggests a kind of isolation. But rarely in my life have I wanted more to be close to someone else than when taking a Samaritans call. If a mother is telling you that she wants to end her life and has the means to do so there and then, you may well want someone with you. That person may just sit with you silently, or may write the occasional note of support. Afterwards, that person may talk with you over a cup of tea. The idea that a volunteer may have to take such a call alone, “remotely”, is troubling indeed.Samaritans to close at least 100 branches across UK and IrelandRead moreAnd those are far from the only difficult calls you may take. Far more frequent are calls from men seeking sexual gratification. These can feel invasive enough as it is, and surely would feel even more so in the privacy of your own home. Indeed, perhaps this whole exercise shows us where we might draw a line between work that can be done at home and work that must be done elsewhere. We have tended to see the issue in terms of what is physically possible, rather than what is emotionally wise: the charity may be doing us an indirect favour by making us consider the importance of both.As a charity, Samaritans has to deal with many of the symptoms of deepening societal malaise. But it must beware the hazards of succumbing to those same dread forces. Humanity and connection are what callers crave, and what Samaritans provides. Yet it is in danger of becoming more like the wider world, and less like itself. Up and down the country, those lights still shine.

It’s not easy maintaining the patience of JobRavi Holy is the vicar of Wye in KentTue 29 Jul 2025 10.34 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareJesus famously said, “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone”. So, possibly, I have no right to pass judgment on Jonathan Baker, the bishop of Fulham, forunceremoniously stopping a concertin his church in mid-flow the other night – and it really was unceremonious in that he was barefoot and in his dressing gown. Perhaps the audience would have taken him more seriously if he’d been wearing his cope and mitre rather than heckling him as they did.But I do sympathise with my senior colleague. I too have a very low tolerance for noise when I’m trying to sleep – or just relax. I am constantly asking my now adult children, who still live with us in the vicarage, to keep the noise down. On a good day, I do this in the manner of Ross from Friends, with apassive-aggressive hand gesture. On a not-so-good day, I might be a bit snappier. My longsuffering wife calls me Victor Meldrew and refuses to go to the cinema with me unless I promise not to turn round and tut at talkers – or, worse, “politely” ask them to stop talking, which is potentially dangerous in this day and age.View image in fullscreenBaker outside 10 Downing Street, 1 December 2021.Photograph: PjrNews/AlamyHowever, I’m not “in role” in either of those contexts. I’m just Dad or a random grumpy old man. Whereas part of the deal of being an official representative of God is that you have to be nicer than nice all the time. In the filmIn the Loop,Tom Hollander’s politician character moans that holding a surgery for his constituents is “like being Simon Cowell, only without the ability to say, ‘Eff off, you’re mental’.” But in that respect, being a vicar is even harder. People expect you to turn the other cheek, smile and say “Bless you, my son” even in the face of extreme provocation. And failure to do that doesn’t just reflect badly on you, it could undermine someone’s very faith.That’s quite a lot to live up to, which is whySaint James saidpeople should think twice before becoming church leaders (I’m paraphrasing somewhat) and, of course, we’re all only human. I know that I’ve fallen short of this high standard many times. Nonetheless, I accept that that is the nature of my calling and I try, as much as possible, to be a good ambassador for Christ – particularly at weddings.There’s a long history of conflict, for example, between wedding photographers and grumpy vicars and often, when I arrive at the church on a Saturday afternoon, I see the photographer take a deep breath and force their face into a smile before nervously asking: “So, what are your rules?” When I say: “I don’t have any. Just do whatever the bride wants”, they look like I’ve offered to pay off their mortgage.0:55Bishop of Fulham interrupts choir and tells them to leave – videoThe other classic grumpy vicar move is not allowing the local yoga class to meet in the church hall – because yoga is, as they see it, tantamount to witchcraft. Well, aside from the fact that most such classes have no spiritual or religious component and are just harmless – and, indeed, healthy – exercise, I think it’s an own goal to ban them in any case. If it gets into the press, it’s not going to advance the mission of God and will just make the church look ridiculous. And so we return to the bishop of Fulham.When I first saw the story on my Facebook feed, I assumed it was a spoof fromthe Babylon Bee(“your trusted source for Christian news satire”)and it seems that those who were present felt the same. The choir director, Leigh Stanford Thompson, said he thought, for a moment, that it was some form of performance art. The bishop’s dressing gown would have heightened that impression. But slowly the awful truth became clear. And most awful, surely, was that the bishop rudely referred to the choir’s performance as a “terrible racket”, which brings to mind another excruciating episcopal gaffe.Mervyn Stockwood discusses Monty Python’s Life of Brian with John Cleese and Michael Palin on Friday Night, Saturday Morning in 1979.I’m told by people who knew him that the lateMervyn Stockwood, who rose to be bishop of Southwark, was generally charm incarnate, but he let himself and the church down when he joined its ill-considered pushback against The Life of Brian in the famous BBC debate with John Cleese and Michael Palin, dismissing the film as “undergraduate humour” and suitable for the mentally deficient. For me – and most clergy I know, including the former archbishop Rowan Williams – it’s first-rate and theologically astute; but the point here is, we should always play the ball not the man.Baker has, to his credit, now apologised, but while he and I are required to forgive others their sins by virtue of our office, those whom he offended that night might be less willing to do so. As the saying goes, reputation is like virginity: once you lose it, it’s impossible to get it back. But fortunately, I believe in miracles. So, I’ll be praying for my fellow Vicar Meldrew – and remembering that there but for the grace of God go I.Ravi Holy is the vicar of Wye in Kent and a standup comedianExplore more on these topicsChristianityOpinionReligionLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

In Israel’s globalised economy, here’s what will shift public opinionTue 29 Jul 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 08.58 EDTShareAfter months of complete blockade or extremely limited supplies, and with thousands of famished children in Gaza at risk of death, Israel finally relented last week to allow increasedlevels of aid, as well as electricity and water, into the territory. Yet given Israel’s systematic destruction of Gaza’s medical infrastructure, the aid will not prevent irreversible damage to many severely malnourished children. And even in the best scenario,this is but a hiatus.For many months now, Israel’s far-right government has been unambiguous in its words and actions. It has made Gaza uninhabitable through the destruction of the built environment and infrastructure. The plan, repeatedly stated by Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers, is the ethnic cleansing (“voluntary emigration”) of the bulk of Gaza’s population. It is now clear that the Israeli government is willing to slow down this campaign temporarily, but it will not stop unless it is forced to, by international pressure. Such pressure has been entirely inadequate.The UK hasscaled up its rhetoric, to words such as “appalled” and “horrified”. It has also limited arms shipments to Israel, andplaced sanctionson ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir. Yet surely a G7 member, the world’s sixth largest economy and a close ally of Israel can do more. “Netanyahu only listens to Trump, and even then only sometimes,”says Emily Thornberry, implying there’s little to do beyond pleading with the US president.This is a profound misunderstanding ofIsrael, and an underestimation of the UK’s options. Indeed, Netanyahu and his ministers would not listen to the UK. But Netanyahu is not an all-powerful dictator like VladimirPutin, and Israel is no North Korea. Its economy is highly globalised, and its society cherishes its ties to the world. It has deep material and emotional investments in those connections, including to the UK. From the banking system to defence cooperation, from trade to tourism and academia, the UK is connected to Israel in myriad ways. By continuing business as usual, Israel’s international partners are allowing the Israeli government to continue with its genocidal campaign with no consequences beyond symbolic gestures of disapproval and statements.After 7 October 2023, the horror of Hamas’s massacre prompted western governments to support Israel as it launched its retaliation against Gaza, effectively giving the far-right government carte blanche. Despite unprecedentedinternational criminal court arrest warrantsagainst Netanyahu for the crime of starvation, international sanctions on Israel remain extremely limited. The Israeli government is banking on this. “We can kill 100 Palestinians every night in Gaza and no one in the world cares,”said one member of the coalition recently. Sadly, so far he has not been proved wrong.Over the past 21 months, tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to demand a ceasefire and hostage release deal. While polls showoverwhelming supportfor ending the war, the fragmented and demoralised opposition has not been able to bring the government down. This is partly because, despite pleas from the hostages’ families and activists, Israel’s key economic powerbrokers in the finance and IT industries and trade unions have been reluctant to take an active stand against the government, even if many of them are deeply opposed to it.This reluctance stems, at least in part, from the fact that Israel’s economy has proved surprisingly resilient. True, Israel’s credit ratingwas downgradedand the government deficit has ballooned. But at the same time, since July 2024, the Tel Aviv stock exchange hasrisen by close to 30%. Growth in 2026 isexpected at 4.6%, and unemployment is extremely low. The war has even benefited key economic sectors: Israel’s defence exports are booming, and the UK is one of those export destinations. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, between 2020 and 2024 Israel was thesecond largest supplierof arms to the UK.In the UK and Europe, there are new mobilisations of Israelis against the genocide, calling for sanctions. In December 2024, more than500 Israelisin the UK called on the government to sanction Ben Gvir and Smotrich. In the past couple of months, a new group of Israelis in the UK, Mi-Neged – with which I am involved – called on Keir Starmer and David Lammy to imposefar-reachingsanctionson Israel, not only on a few “bad apples” but systemically. Such measures would include suspending the Trade and Partnership Agreement (TPA) and halting military cooperation.For many of us, this is a deeply painful moment. Calling on our government to sanction the state where we grew up, to which we are closely attached and where our families and friends live is not an easy step. But we are horrified not only by what has happened but also by what is likely to happen if we do not take such steps.UK suspension of Israel’s preferential trade access could push the EU in the same direction. As a trading bloc, the EU is Israel’slargest export destination, accounting for a third of Israeli exports. Proposalsto suspend articlesin Israel’s EU association agreement are on the table.For now, there is an Israeli middle and upper-middle class receptive to external pressure. That constituency has sufficient power and influence to translate this into political action. Israeli civil society is still able to mobilise and challenge the government.

It may sound daft, but ‘social prescribing’ could be a giant leap for the NHSDevi SridharBig pharma pushes drugs, but community resources such as exercise, nature, music, and, yes, watching a game may better address root causesTue 29 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 05.23 EDTShareAnew NHS pilot in Gloucestershiregives 12 GP practices the ability to prescribe Forest Green Rovers football tickets to patients with mild to moderate depression. It’s part of a movement towards replacing a purely medical model – think: what antidepressants should we prescribe? – to a social and community model of care. Initiatives like this are easy to mock for being insufficient to address the huge strains faced by the NHS. And, for better or worse, may lead to an increase in people seeking care for depression in the hope of free football tickets. But this sort of thing has been supported by thehealth secretary, Wes Streeting, as part of his efforts to change the NHS from a sickness treatment system to a preventive health service.The rationale is that GPs are overwhelmed, with patients showing up with issues such as back and neck pain, depression and anxiety, or just overall fatigue, headaches and feeling unwell. The medical approach is to prescribe medications – in fact,the NHS in 2023-24prescribed more than 89m antidepressant courses (for an estimated 8.7 million identified patients who received at least one drug)– at great cost to both individuals, given the side-effects, and to the budget of the health service.And yes, there is a strong pharmaceutical lobby pushing magic bullets and drugs on to individuals. Can’t sleep? Take a melatonin pill. Anxious? Take Xanax. Obese? Try a GLP-1 agonist such as Ozempic or Wegovy. In pain? How about oxycodone (which carries the risk of opioid dependency). Perhaps we have been overmedicalising how we treat common conditions that people go to see a GP about. Which is where the idea ofsocial prescribingcomes in – that is, referring patients not for specialised care or medication, but instead linking illness to community resources found in exercise, nature, community, music – or even football matches.There’s no need to hammer on about prevention – I think it’s universally agreed that prevention is better than cure. But it’s easier said than done (as I’ve written about extensively). To develop the implementation of schemes, pilots have been launched with promising results.NHS Englandrefers to a 2017 University of Westminster evidence summary which estimated 28% fewer GP consultations and 24% fewer A&E visits for people in a social-prescribing scheme. This is not just in the UK, but part of a growingglobal policy approachwhether in Denmark, Canada or Malaysia.For example, the Danish health authority funded a pilot scheme calledKulturvitaminer (culture vitamins), which offered those unemployed or on state sick leave and suffering from stress, anxiety or depression, support over 10 weeks to be part of cultural activities such as a singing group, a guided reading club, or a drama class. Data from the trial found that participants were happier, more motivated and felt better physically.7,000 steps a day could be enough to improve health, say researchersRead moreYet, we can’t just talk about joining a new walking group, cooking club or art class without considering the larger stresses of modern life that often cause these chronic health issues. Inequality has increased in the UK – driven by Brexit, the pandemic and record inflation: just look at the simultaneously growing numbers of billionaires and food banks. Housing is increasingly unaffordable, while salaries stagnate. Life is indeed harder, especially for young people unsure about their economic futures and quality of life.In almost every health metric, the poorest communities are also the sickest. As the divide grows between the top 1% and the rest of the population, an increasing number of people are pushed into hardship, including many in traditionally middle-class occupations such as teaching and nursing, whose incomes do not support the same standard of living as that of the previous generation working in the same jobs. Prevention is also about ensuring stable and affordable housing, a living wage and social support. The biggest health challenges aren’t medical, but social, economic and political.At least social prescribing is a step forward in recognising that health issues are often the result of underlying isolation, precarity and stress, and in offering a route into individuals feeling more integrated and supported. In giving free football tickets, perhaps it’s giving a moment of joy and support to someone – who a GP has identified as feeling isolated, disconnected and depressed – who otherwise might not have been able to afford or even dream of that kind of experience. The football ticket pilot won’t fix theNHSor Britain’s underlying economic troubles, but it’s a step in the right direction of seeing health as something built in communities and not in hospitals or clinics.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionGPsWes StreetingMental healthDoctorsHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

But investing in stocks and shares? Not so much. Ministers have a duty to be clear about the benefits and risksHilary Osborne is the Guardian’s money and consumer editorTue 29 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 08.41 EDTShareWithout wanting to sound like a jeremiad from the Daily Mail, I should warn you thatRachel Reeves is after your money. Part of her plan to grow the UK economy involves persuading cautious Britons to take more risks with their savings. It’s a win-win, she says. British business gets more investment and savers get better returns. The “nation of shopkeepers” becomes a nation of investors.And it could all work out like that, of course. But there is the potential for things to go horribly wrong if the mooted letters from banks suggesting different investments and changes to risk warnings are done badly. There is also the danger of persuading people into the market in the good times, only for them to find themselves nursing losses in the next downturn.There are things that you will need to know – and they will need to know that you know – if this is to be a responsible policy. People, voters, know about savings. Stocks and shares,not so much. Timing is everything in stock markets – being able to sit out falls in share values is vital, and if people need their money just as things are going badly, they will rue the day that they moved money from their cosy cash Isa.Mis-selling is another problem. Allowing banks to flag up investments to people who are deemed to be sitting on more than enough in savings makes sense from the point of view that banks can see those accounts, but few would suggest that banks offer the best alternatives, or have previously done the best job of marrying consumers with the most suitable deals.Graphic about British saversAnd then there’s the potential for scams – a call or email claiming to be from your bank, and suggesting you move your money, may not seem as suspicious if there are genuine communications flying around.The plan is not untenable. I agree with a lot of the government’s comments about the stock market’s potential to provide people with greater returns than cash deposits. The numbers are inarguable (even if theTreasury’s choice of figuresto show just how much better shares do has provoked disagreement).I invest: I have emergency money in savings, some in fixed-rate accounts that offer a bedrock. I have a couple of stocks and sharesIsastoo – the first was an absolute disaster and demonstrates what could go wrong if people are persuaded to buy in at the top of the market.I was just starting in personal finance and excited by everything I’d heard about shares. I had £500 in a savings account that was doing miserably, and I thought that by making it work harder I would get some money to put towards a flat deposit in a few years’ time. I chose a UK growth fund – a fairly cautious choice as it invested in big UK companies that I understood. It was March 2000: the peak of the dotcom bubble.For the next decade, my investment was worth less than I had paid in. In 2009 it stood at £335.05 – the fund managers still had to be paid, so as well as falling prices, I’d had charges to contend with. I was lucky I didn’t need to realise my paper loss, but the six-monthly statements outlining it did not inspire me with confidence in the market.Any attempt to persuade people out of their comfort zone is going to need to be clear about the potential for falls in value. But the chancellor has suggested that the risk warnings on investments now are too scary, and that they need to change. “For too long, we have presented investment in too negative a light, quick to warn people of the risks without giving proper weight to the benefits,” she said, in her Mansion House speech.Balancing out risk warnings with details of the potential gains – asresearchers have tested with consumers– does encourage more money into stocks and shares. However, those warnings shouldn’t be so diluted that people do not understand the unpredictability of when those gains might be available. If you have a specific timeframe in mind, you need to know that you might be getting back less than you paid in.By the time I started my second stocks and shares Isa, I had learned a lesson about “pound cost averaging”. Never again would I put a lump sum in the stock market – paying in regularly is the best way to reduce risk. I’ve also spread my money across several funds – and not all in the UK. These things are simple and have not added to the cost, but they take time to explore, and are not necessarily what will be offered widely.Past mis-selling scandals make me wary of handing responsibility for this to the big financial companies. Although the worst of the incentives that drove sales staff to heavily tout investments seem to have gone, there is a disincentive to offering the kind of holistic approach that is needed to make sure people are getting the guidance for specific investments at the right time: the promise is “targeted support”, but the more targeted it is, the more costly it will be for companies to provide.How to manage your money in turbulent times, from savings to mortgagesRead moreAt what point does it become wise to put money in the market, rather than savings? Advice on that will need to be clear. The answer is not one size fits all. Some people have bigger monthly commitments than others, so should keep more in easily accessible accounts. Retired people generally should be taking less risk than younger people because they have less time to ride out the falls. But we all have our own goals and financial ties. A bank letter that is generated as soon as someone’s savings account hits, say, £10,000 is not going to be offering the right advice for everyone. But making it more bespoke will cost more.The chancellor is basically right – more people should be investing, and there are things that could be done to help this. Perhaps a note on savings accounts: a warning of the risk of inflation eroding money in low-interest accounts – something experts say is too often ignored. Confidence could be built by reminding us that if we have a private pension, we already are investors – it’s not something we will be doing for the first time. Increasing the contributions that must be paid into pensions through auto-enrolment will also bring money into the market. Better financial education in schools is crucial.Investing is, like politics, a matter of rises and falls, risk and returns – ever subject to sudden turbulence. Reeves understands both spheres, but can the public live like that? That’s really quite the gamble.Hilary Osborne is the Guardian’s money and consumer editorExplore more on these topicsSharesOpinionSavingsRachel ReevesInvestmentsIsasBanks and building societiesCash IsascommentShareReuse this content"

Striking doctors are playing into their handsPolly ToynbeeThe BMA’s demand for pay restoration is a slap in the face for the health secretary who gave them a 22% rise – and it’s testing the public’s sympathyTue 29 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareThere were no pickets when I set out at the weekend to talk to striking doctors. Not even at St Thomas’ hospital, a prime site opposite the Houses of Parliament, or at Guy’s at London Bridge. “It’s a bit sparse,” said the duty officer from the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union. The British Medical Journal (owned by the BMA but with editorial freedom)ran the headline: “Striking resident doctors face heckling and support on picket line, amid mixed public response.”Public support has fallen, with52% of people“somewhat” or “strongly” opposing the strikes and only 34% backing them.Alastair McLellan, the editor of the Health Service Journal, after ringing around hospitals told me fewer doctors were striking than last time, which isn’t surprising given thatonly 55% votedin the BMA ballot. Managers told him these strikes were less disruptive than the last ones. But even a weaker strike harms patients and pains a government relying on falling waiting lists.“When you’re operating on the margins, it takes very little disruption to send waiting lists up again,” McLellan said. Strikes are costly, since consultants have to be paid to fill shifts, which is typically more expensive. One hospital manager asked me wryly: “Have you tried paying for an out-of-hours emergency plumber or electrician?” This time Jim Mackey, the head of NHSEngland, is playing it tough. He told medical directors on Monday to warn doctors that anyone striking on one of their 12 compulsory training days would forfeit their qualification – and not to let strikers take up locum shifts on non-strike days to make up for the money they’ve lost. No more Mr Nice Guy.Everyone employed by the NHS will get anabove-inflation pay rise this year, which is less than the 5.4% (comprising a 4% rise and a consolidated £750 payment) thatresident doctors will receive. Nurses and ambulance crews have just voted overwhelmingly against apay award of 3.6%. That was only a consultative ballot, leaving plenty of time for negotiations that might avoid holding a full strike ballot. Consultants are now balloting too. These looming demands make it vanishingly unlikely that Wes Streeting will give even more money to striking resident doctors, who have already received the top NHS offer.Mackey plays the hard man, but Streeting’s emollience is over. He seems indignant and offended by the BMA. His first act as health secretary was to end the resident doctors’ 44 days of strikes between March 2023 and July 2024 with a generous22% pay rise, even while the rightwing press accused him of bowing to “union paymasters”. Making peace was his welcome political signal that the party of the NHS was setting about repairing Tory damage.There was hope for goodwill and patience from healthcare workers. So the BMA coming back for more within a year was a shock, and a slap in the face for Streeting. The BMA is kicking a government that had been well-disposed towards it. With Tory and Liberal Democrat peersattempting to blockthe government’s radical employment rights bill, Labour’s enemies will relish this timely assistance from the strike. A piece on CapX, a comment site owned and produced by the Centre for Policy Studies, called the striking doctors “Scargills in white coats” with “blood on their hands”, which is of course the literal truth, given what they do at work (Tom Dolphin, the new BMA chair, is a consultant anaesthetist who works in trauma surgery; hisjob involves“a fair amount of stabbings, occasional shootings, assaults [and] falls from height”).Keir Starmerhas warnedthat the strikes “play into the hands” of those who do not want the NHS to “succeed in its current form”. Vultures are circling: Nigel Farage talks ofFrench-style insurance; the International Monetary Fund, in its great unwisdom, recently suggested the better-offshould pay for NHS services; while the piece on CapX echoed the right’s glee at the strike: “The problem here isn’t just that the BMA is populated by socialist thugs, it’s that the NHS is a socialist system.”The NHS is ever ready to rescue us all, regardless of status – that is why doctors and nurses top public respect charts, and why they have much to lose as the public turns against them. “When the BMA asks, ‘What’s the difference between a Labour government and a Conservative government?’, I would say a 28.9% pay rise and a willingness to work together to improve the working conditions and lives of doctors,”Streeting said in vainlast week. In a timely contrast, Kemi Badenoch has declared that the Tories would ban doctors’ strikes, putting them under the same restrictions that apply to police officers and soldiers.Both sides in this strike are obdurate. “This could be a marathon. We could be doing this until Christmas or maybe beyond,” thedeputy chief executiveof NHS England has glumly warned. Streeting says the negotiation door is always open, but the BMA says there’s no point without cash on the table. Bad blood between them springs from the negotiations: talks were going well until the BMA resident doctors’ committee told its co-chairs that it could not approve the government’s deal because it did not address the BMA’s demand that resident doctors receive a 29% pay rise over the next few years.Yet Streeting’s offer tackled serious grievances: years of bad planning left 20,000 resident doctorswithout specialist training places, stuck in a bottleneck that he promised to resolve. The BMA damaged people’s sympathy for the doctors by absurdlycomparing their payto that of a coffee barista. Resident doctors can expect to be on asteep annual trajectory, averaging £43,400 in year one and £51,600 in year two; asnew consultantsthey will get £105,000, while GP partners earn as much as £160,000.The word in the corridors is that the BMA is losing support across theNHSand among its own members, Nick Hulme, the CEO of the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS foundation trust, told me. He said some of his consultants had this week resigned from the BMA. So has the fertility pioneer Robert Winston. History may reassure the BMA that the public will always trust doctors over politicians. This time, the public backs those trying to cut waiting lists more than the strikers who are adding to them.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 29 July 2025 to refer to “French-style” rather than “private” insurance in relation to Nigel Farage’s position on the NHS.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionNHSHealthIndustrial actionEnglandWes StreetingLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

They scribble over each other’s drawings, scrawl in each other’s notebooks, push each other, inspire each other. Their work has been on every Radiohead album cover since 1995’s The Bends, every Yorke solo record, every poster and every T-shirt. Nothing is farmed out to designers or agencies – Radiohead’s visual identity has been fully overseen by Donwood and Yorke.And now, in a homecoming of sorts for local hero Yorke, their artistic output is being celebrated at Oxford’sAshmolean Museum. There’s no doubt that Donwood and Yorke, who met while studying at the University of Exeter, have created some of the most recognisable, ubiquitous and maybe even iconic album covers of their generation. But do they make sense in a huge, historic gallery such as the Ashmolean? Does any of it make for good art? Does it stand up to scrutiny when removed from the context of the records and merchandise it was designed for? It’s a nice dream, but nope.It feels as though you are in a very hip but dour record shopThe exhibition starts with LPs, CDs, posters and T-shirts arranged as though you are in a very hip but dour record shop. The gasping, deathly resuscitation dummy of The Bends; the ghostly schematics and angry doodles of OK Computer; the weeping little fella of Amnesiac; the mountains of Kid A; the multicoloured poetry of Hail to the Thief; the woodcuts of Yorke’s The Eraser. This is how the work was meant to be seen, this is the context it works best in: arranged as if in racks, as if you could pull a record off the wall and play it.View image in fullscreenRadiohead’s visual identity has been fully overseen by Yorke and Donwood.Photograph: Julian Broad, courtesy of Tin Man ArtDonwood clearly has an issue with art galleries. “They’re just intimidating – it’s not very democratic,” says a quote of his on the wall. “Whereas you go into a record shop and it’s full of all kinds of oiks.” I’m not sure I buy into this. Record shops can have exactly the same atmosphere of sneering exclusivity as galleries. There’s a touchiness here that makes the show feel a little bitter. Guys, you’re in the Ashmolean. You’re not kicking against the establishment, you’re in it.The exhibition goes album by album, with sketchbooks and paintings displayed to lay bare their creative process. Everything is jointly attributed, positioning Yorke and Donwood as equals.View image in fullscreenUntitled poster, 1997.OK Computer sets an unfairly high bar early on in the show. The 1997 album captured the era’s zeitgeist with its anxious teardown of corporate facelessness, technological paranoia and capitalist excess. It still resonates, as does its sense of isolation and loneliness in a world where you’re constantly surrounded by people. The artwork looked like nothing else of its era: featuring a motorway overlaid with airplane safety manuals and the ghosts of people rushing by, the cover image looks how the music sounds – cold, frustrated, isolated, desperate. A brilliant meeting of music and album artwork.But it works infinitely better as a CD insert. You gain almost nothing by seeing these digital images enlarged, framed and plonked on a gallery wall.Radiohead would struggle to capture the moment again in quite the way they did with OK Computer. The same goes for the art. Donwood and Yorke made vast, bleak acrylic paintings for the covers of Kid A and Amnesiac. Eight canvases are displayed here and they are an unbelievable mess: badly composed, poorly executed, smudgy, splodgy, confused landscapes that even the RA Summer Exhibition would reject. The paintings of spiders and trees for 2011’s King of Limbs are even worse; sub-A Level attempts at Max Ernst that almost make me embarrassed for them.View image in fullscreenInoffensive … London Views (6 of 14), lino cut print block.Photograph: Ellie AtkinsThe woodcuts for Yorke’s solo albums are less visually offensive, and the ultra-colourful paintings of rivers and forests for the most recent albums by his other band the Smile work better as artworks, but are still quite a distance from anything you’d call brilliant.The art of Radiohead sleeve designer Stanley Donwood – in picturesRead morePlenty of the work here, especially from the 90s and early 2000s, has entered the wider public consciousness in a way that proves album artwork has cultural heft. It matters. It has an impact. But that doesn’t mean any of it is especially good, or even interesting, as art.If you’re a Radiohead fan, there is tons of insight and detail here to keep you happy, but from an art perspective it is a succession of bad paintings. Donwood and Yorke probably shouldn’t have put themselves in this position, but they did it to themselves, and that’s what really hurts.This Is What You Get: Stanley Donwood, Radiohead, Thom Yorke is at theAshmolean Museum, Oxford, from 6 August to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtRadioheadPaintingExhibitionsAshmolean MuseumThom YorkereviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, though, leaps in AI audio restoration technology mean we can finally hear Guthrie’s own long-lost, home-recorded version, and it’s striking how powerfully it speaks to the way migrant workers are demonised today. They “fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil”, he sings, “and be called by no name except ‘deportees’”. Singer Billy Bragg argues that “When the ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] are rounding people up in fields, the song could hardly be more relevant.”View image in fullscreen‘I slammed the door on Bob Dylan’ … Nora Guthrie.Photograph: Reuters Staff/ReutersInitially a single, Deportee also appears on Woody at Home, Vol 1 and 2, a new 22-track treasure trove of Guthrie’s final recordings (including 13 previously unheard songs), made at home in 1951 and 1952, just months before he was first hospitalised with the neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease that led to his death aged 55 in 1967.“He’d been blacklisted [during the McCarthy era, for activism], so he couldn’t perform as much and couldn’t get on the radio,” says Nora. “Huntington’s was seeping into his body and his mind. The tapes are a last push to get the songs out, because he senses something is wrong.”Guthrie’s advocacy for migrant workers and social justice was informed by lived experience. Born into a middle-class family in Okemah, Oklahoma, he was just 14 when the family lost their home and he subsequently lived through the dust bowl, the Great Depression, the second world war and the rise of fascism. “He had to migrate from Oklahoma to California,” says Bragg. “He knew what it was like to lose your home, to be dispossessed, to go on the road. The Okies were really no different to those Mexican workers and were just as reviled.”Performing with the slogan “This machine kills fascists” written on his guitar, Guthrie packed his seminal 1940 debut Dust Bowl Ballads with what Anna calls “hard-hitting songs for hard-hit people”.He penned his most famous anthem, This Land Is Your Land – a new version of which opens Woody At Home with extra verses – after a road trip, as the lyric says, “from California to the New York island”.“Woody wrote it because he was really pissed off with hearing Irving Berlin’s God Bless America on every jukebox,” says Bragg. “It annoyed the shit out of him. I’ve actually seen the original manuscript for the song and crossed out at the top is Woody’s original title, God Blessed America for You and Me, which I think gives him claim to be an alternative songwriter, the archetypal punk rocker.”Between the early 1930s and the 1950s, Guthrie penned an astonishing 3,000 songs, recording more than 700 of them. The Woody at Home recordings were made at his family’s rented apartment in Beach Haven, Brooklyn, on a primitive machine given to him by his publisher with a view to selling the songs to other artists. With his wife out working, the increasingly poorly singer somehow managed to record 32 reels of tape while minding three kids. Sounds of knocks on doors, and even Nora as a toddler, appear on the tapes along with conversational messages.View image in fullscreen‘Everything was coming out so quickly’ … Guthrie in McSorley’s bar, New York.Photograph: Eric Schaal/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock“He’d write on the couch with the kids jumping on his head,” Anna says. “He’d write on gift wrappers or paper towels. We’ve found some of Woody’s most beautiful quotes in correspondence, like in a 1948 letter to [folk music champion] Alan Lomax, ‘A folk song is what’s wrong and how to fix it.’ Sometimes he only had time for a title. Everything was coming out so quickly he had to get it down.”Woody at Home contains previously unheard songs about racism (Buoy Bells From Trenton), fascism (I’m a Child Ta Fight) and corruption (Innocent Man) but also showcases the breadth of Guthrie’s canon. There are songs about love, Jesus Christ, atoms … even Albert Einstein, whom he once met and took a train with. It tickles Nora that her father wrote “no less than five songs about washing dishes”.Guthrie wrote Old Man Trump, also known as Beach Haven Race Hate, about their landlord, Fred Trump – father of Donald – and his segregative housing policies. Woody at Home premieres another song about him, Backdoor Bum and the Big Landlord. “It’s really the story of how the guy who has everything gives nothing and the guy who has nothing gives everything,” says Nora. “My favourite bit is when the landlord gets to heaven laden with gold. They send him to hell and he goes, ‘Let me see your manager. I’m gonna buy this place and kick you out.’ The arrogance and entitlement are astonishing, but it clearly defines someone we all know. We lived in Trump buildings. We know who they are.”View image in fullscreenThis one’s called Old Man Trump … Donald and Fred Trump, subject of a song.Photograph: Bill Truran/AlamyThe family moved to Queens where, when Nora was 11, she answered the door to an inquisitive 19-year-old singer-songwriter called Robert Zimmerman. The future Bob Dylan had read Guthrie’s autobiography, Bound for Glory. “I was a little upset because I was watching American Bandstand and had to answer the door,” she chuckles. “There was this guy standing there who looked dusty and weird. I slammed the door and ran back to American Bandstand. But he kept on knocking.”View image in fullscreenThe cover artwork for Woody at Home.Photograph: undefined/Shamus RecordsThe 2024 Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown dramatises the iconic 1961 meetings between the teenage future legend and his hospitalised, dying idol. Nora loves the film, but points out: “My father wasn’t in a room on his own like in the movie. Woody was on a ward with 40 patients, in a psychiatric hospital because there were no wards for people with Huntington’s at the time. There was a sunroom to the side where Bob would meet him, take him pens and cigarettes. My memory is that Bob would not only sing his songs for Woody” – Dylan subsequently recorded a heartfelt tribute, Song to Woody – “but that he’d also sing my father’s own songs to him. I can’t emphasise enough how kind Bob was, but he understood that Woody needed to hear what he’d achieved.”By then, Guthrie was very ill. “Because of Huntington’s I didn’t have a dad in the traditional sense people talk about,” Nora says with a sigh. “He couldn’t really talk or have long conversations like we’re having now. We couldn’t have physical contact because with Huntington’s your body’s always moving. You’d have to hold his arms back so you could hug him. If we ever went out to a restaurant people would look at us like he was drunk and that hurt.” Nora became Woody’s carer and, in her tireless curation of his legacy, has been caring for her father ever since.“That happened accidentally,” she says, explaining how she’d spent 10 years as a professional dancer when – in 1991 – Guthrie’s retiring manager called her in to sort through boxes of his stuff. “One of the first things I pulled out was a letter from John Lennon,” she says, fetching the framed letter, sent to the family in 1975, for me to see. It reads: “Woody lives and I’m glad.” The next find was the original lyrics for This Land Is Your Land. “It was a treasure trove.”From which there is more to come. His descendants hope to spark today’s young songwriters – and protesters – in the way Guthrie did for Dylan, Springsteen and countless others. “I see us as the coal holders,” says Anna. “We keep Woody’s ember burning so that whenever someone wants to ignite the fire in them, Woody is hot and ready.”Deportee (Woody’s Home Tape) is available now on streaming services.

The director talks about the ‘heart-pounding’ story that inspired herDeborah ColeTue 29 Jul 2025 10.16 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 12.42 EDTShareThe world could face ashortage of 13 million nurses by the end of this decade. For her new film, Swiss director Petra Volpe imagined the consequences of just one missed shift on a busy night at a hospital, and found herself making a disaster movie.With Late Shift, Volpe aimed to shine a light on the frontlines of the looming healthcare catastrophe through the eyes of the dedicated, exhausted Floria. Played by German actor Leonie Benesch, the young nurse shows an initially acrobatic grace in her workday, whose first half resembles a particularly hectic episode of the restaurant kitchen series The Bear, but with life-and-death stakes.Arriving for her shift cheery and energetic and taking the time to ask about her colleague’s recent holiday, Floria soon hears that another nurse has called in sick. The looming workload suddenly grows exponentially, compounding the stress and driving up the likelihood she will make a fateful mistake.The Swiss-born Volpe says she chose the film’s German titleHeldin(Heroine) because it took a mythic term often reserved for warriors and applied it to the bravery and self-sacrifice of care work.View image in fullscreen‘The work is extremely complex and emotionally charged’ … Leonie Benesch in Late Shift.Photograph: Salvatore Vinci“This work, which is extremely complex and emotionally charged, is completely devalued in our societies,” Volpe says. “I find it very symptomatic because it’s women’s work – 80% of the people [in many countries] who do this work are female.”Volpe was inspired by a longtime roommate who worked as a nurse, and by the autobiographical novel Our Profession Is Not the Problem – It’s the Circumstances by German former care worker Madeline Calvelage, who advised her on the script.“My heart was pounding from the first chapter and I thought to myself – this reads like a thriller,” Volpe says. “But within that stress you find the most tender, human moments.”The film revolves around the escalating and competing needs of patients on a hospital ward, with a different set of medical and emotional demands lurking behind each door, signalled to the staff by a shrieking call bell.Benesch’s turbo-driven career has already included roles on The Crown and Babylon Berlin as well as film parts in Michael Haneke’s The White Ribbon, Munich Olympics attacks drama September 5 and German Oscar nominee The Teachers’ Lounge. She says a common thread in her most recent characters is “people who burn for what they do”. But she notes it was rare in TV medical dramas to see nurses and their everyday feats front and centre.View image in fullscreenNursing staff from various hospitals in Berlin demonstrate in front of the Zoo Palast on the fringes of the premiere of Heldin in February.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy“You’re used to getting the physicians as the heroes and then in the backdrop a nurse might hang an infusion bag or drink a coffee or have an affair with the senior doctor,” Benesch says. “Before this it wasn’t clear to me how much of the actual medical responsibility rests on nurses’ shoulders.”Benesch, who trained at London’s Guildhall School of Music & Drama, said she spent several shifts trailing real nurses at a Swiss hospital to learn the “choreography” of interactions between staff and patients, and the manual skills of prepping a syringe or taking blood pressure. “I wanted real nurses not to be able to tell the difference between me and a professional,” she says. “I just hope people aren’t scared off by a film with subtitles because the story is absolutely universal.”Late Shift has stoked heated policy reform debates and proved a critical and box office success in German-speaking Europe, even besting the latest Bridget Jones movie in Swiss cinemas.At the world premiere at theBerlin film festivalin February, several nurses were invited to appear in their uniforms on the red carpet and take the stage after the screening for a round of applause. Days beforeGermany’s general election, some held #wirsindfloria (We Are Floria) signs.One of those guests was Ingo Böing, 47, who worked in hospitals for a quarter century and is now on staff at the German Association ofNursingProfessionals, which lobbies for better conditions for care workers. “It was incredibly moving,” he says of the film gala. “Watching several of the scenes I thought ‘Wow, that’s really how it is.’”Böing says Late Shift does a convincing job depicting the “vicious circle” of nursing, in which people working at the absolute limits of their strength call in sick at short notice, leaving those who show up for duty with an even more daunting task. “It’s that feeling of trying to meet so many needs at once and not managing,” he adds.He says waiting lists like those used by the NHS in Britain, although frustrating for patients, would help hospitals in Germany better prioritise while keeping medical staff from getting overstretched.Franziska Aurich, 28, who works on a cancer ward at Berlin’s Charité hospital, also found the film “very close to reality”. Asked what she’d advise Floria, Aurich says: “I would say go back to work tomorrow because like her I can’t imagine doing anything else with my life. But join a union, so you don’t have as many shifts like this one.”Late Shift review – pressure is on in badly understaffed hospital as compassion shines throughRead moreVolpe, who divides her time between Berlin and New York, says she was gratified to see nurses going in groups to see the film, and hopes it will make the rest of the audience into better patients. “Nurses should be at the very top of our social hierarchy but we live in a world where it’s just the opposite,” she says. “This film is a love letter to the profession.”While the film is set in Europe’s creaking but still intact social infrastructure, Volpe said she saw in the US whereDonald Trump’s swingeing cuts to Medicaid,which mainly serves poor and disabled people, threatened to hurt the most vulnerable. “You see a great cruelty in all these measures,” she says.“Elon Musk said he saw empathy as the biggest problem of our timewhich is of course completely monstrous. The least an artist can do is to push back against that. Sooner or later we’re all going to be dependent on that person standing by the bed.”Late Shift will be released in the UK and Ireland on 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmNursingHealthWorld cinemaSwitzerlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A doctor became a specialist, “specialising in diseases of the rich”. And Lehrer reflected on protest singers: “It takes a certain amount of courage to get in a coffee house or a college auditorium and come out in favour of the things that everybody else in the audience is against, like peace and justice and brotherhood and so on.”Tom Lehrer, acclaimed musical satirist of cold war era, dies aged 97Read moreBut Lehrer turned his back on fame and fortune in 1960, and after 1972 he spent most of his time teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz. His students and close friends say he was wonderfully funny, scattering witticisms like confetti. Most of them are lost, but I’ve retrieved a few unknown Lehrer anecdotes.In 1943, aged 15, Lehrer applied to go to Harvard, and was accepted because he was a mathematics prodigy. His application took the form of a poem, that finished:But although I detestLearning poems and the restOf the things one must know to have ‘culture’,While each of my teachersMakes speeches like preachersAnd preys on my faults like a vultureI will leave movie thrillersAnd watch caterpillarsGet born and pupated and larva’edAnd I’ll work like a slaveAnd always behaveAnd maybe I’ll get into Harvard …During his study there, the art historian Paul Turner (now of Stanford University) remembers a group sitting on the bank of the Charles River singing songs about their home towns, such asChicago. Turner complained there was no song about his home town of Schenectady. Lehrer replied that there was, and sang: “The toe bone Schenectady the foot bone, the foot bone Schenectady the ankle bone…”View image in fullscreenLehrer gives a rare interview at his home near Santa Cruz in 2000.Photograph: Anthony Pidgeon/RedfernsIn 1970, a British graduate student at Harvard asked for an interview. Lehrer was inclined to refuse, but agreed because it was the young man’s ticket to a job in journalism in London. He told him he was now “on that vague borderline between adolescence and senility. I’m hoping to hang on to go from the world’s oldest adolescent to the world’s youngest dirty old man.” The interview did its job. The student got his job in journalism and is now the celebrated historian and member of the House of LordsPeter Hennessy.For 30 years beginning in 1972, Lehrer’s working life was teaching two courses at Santa Cruz. One was a mathematics course for students whose main subject was something else – he called it “Maths for Tenors”. The other was a course on The American Musical. It was work he loved, and his students loved him.‘My songs spread like herpes’: why did satirical genius Tom Lehrer swap worldwide fame for obscurity?Read moreBut he was a private man, he disliked fame, and he did his best to live as though it had not happened to him. He was indifferent to money – he had enough for his needs, and no interest in acquiring more – so he put a legal instrument on his website allowing anyone to do anything they liked with his work, without paying him royalties. This is in amazing contrast with most high-profile performers, who have international legal teams to guard their intellectual property. In 2008 he was visited in Santa Cruz by Norwegian journalist Erik Meyn, who had set up a Tom Lehrer channel on YouTube without asking permission, and felt guilty about it. Lehrer explained that he didn’t mind, and even insisted on paying for their lunch: “It’s the least I can do, and that’s why I’m doing it.”Lehrer’s copyright decision gave rise to two shows which make their cheerful way round London’s theatres and occasionally further afield. One isStefan Bednarczyk’s one-man show The Elements of Tom Lehrer. The other is my play, Tom Lehrer Is Teaching Math and Doesn’t Want to Talk to You, with Shahaf Ifhar as Lehrer, which includes many of his greatest songs but also tries to get to the truth about this extraordinary and enigmatic man. I think it succeeds as far as anyone has ever succeeded, which is not very far.Explore more on these topicsMusicComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then she made The Philadelphia StoryAs a stuck-up socialite tangled in a love triangle, Hepburn delivers one of the most memorable screwball heroines – and we can’t help but love herJamie TramTue 29 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 19.00 EDTShareThese days, Katharine Hepburn is revered as a progressive icon of Hollywood’s golden age, an androgynous (andpossibly queer) fashion rebel whosefour best actress awardshave yet to be topped at the Oscars. But back in 1938, only six years into her illustrious career, she was branded as “box office poison”.She was a star ahead of her time, her domineering screen presence registering as shrill and petulant by the tail end of the 1930s. After the box office disappointments of Bringing up Baby and Holiday – both now canonised romcom classics – she retreated from Hollywood and signed on to a new play penned by her friend Philip Barry: The Philadelphia Story.Like its film adaptation, Barry’s script centres on Tracy Lord, a stuck-up socialite (easily read as a stand-in for Hepburn herself) set to marry a wealthy politician, only for the wedding to be upended by the arrival of two competing romantic prospects: her ex-husband, CK Dexter Haven, and tabloid reporter Mike Connor.The production was a runaway success on Broadway, and Hepburn soon took the reins of a film version, for which she brought on her trusted collaborator George Cukor (A Star is Born, My Fair Lady and countless more) as director. Her initial choice of co-leads – Clark Gable (Gone with the Wind) and Spencer Tracy (Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner) were vetoed. But it’s hard to imagine a more dazzling collision of stars than the eventual casting of Cary Grant (Charade) and James Stewart (It’s a Wonderful Life) as Dexter and Mike respectively.View image in fullscreen‘One of the finest pairings in romcom history’ … Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn.Photograph: Ronald GrantAcross their four collaborations, which culminated in The Philadelphia Story, Hepburn and Grant would continually redefine one of the finest pairings in romcom history. The former’s strong-willed, fast-talking women bulldozed over lesser leading men, but were perfectly parried by the slinky yet similarly imposing Grant. As embittered, sniping exes, they effortlessly locate each other’s pressure points – Dexter’s alcoholism, Tracy’s performance of invulnerability – but they share a private camaraderie.It’s James Stewart’s Mike, though, who guides the film’s sweeping romantic moments (and sets the benchmark fordrunk acting). The night before the wedding, he shares a poolside flirtation with the bride-to-be that evolves into an exhilarating declaration of love, powered by Stewart’s earnest intensity. “You’re lit from within, Tracy. You’ve got fires banked down in you, hearth fires and holocausts,” he beseeches. Cukor’s rapturous direction presses into both actors until they’re framed in glazed, moonlit closeups, Hepburn’s eyes and beaded gown twinkling irresistibly. She’s every bit the goddess that he sees.View image in fullscreen‘Under Hepburn’s command, you can’t help but fall in love.’Photograph: Snap/Rex FeaturesBut the film doesn’t allow her to bask in the image for long. The Philadelphia Story’s success hinges on Tracy’s humbling. She lowers herself from her own lofty esteem to eventually find love among other mere mortals, catering to the public’s desire to see Hepburn taken down a peg. There’s maybe some truth to Kazuo Ishiguro’s dismissal of the film as “a really nasty piece of work”, especially considering how the screwball comedy traditionally revolved around stories of men being cut down to size.To Kill a Mockingbird: a call to compassion that’s more urgent than everRead moreI think the screenplay deserves more credit for its intricacies: at each corner of the love triangle is a deeply fallible character who hides behind various defence mechanisms. Tracy’s eventual happiness is entirely her own choice; she only submits to love upon finding the one person who can recognise and accept her faults.In a subgenre defined by its memorable female leads, Tracy Lord offers one of the more nuanced takes on the screwball heroine. She’s a spoilt brat, an arrogant intellectual, an impervious fortress – and under Hepburn’s command, you can’t help but fall in love.The Philadelphia Story is available to stream on HBO Max in Australia and available to rent in the UK and US.

Also in the period-specific pipeline are second series for Disney+’s brilliant Shogun and Amazon Prime’s terrible House of David.Historical epics, it would not be unreasonable to say, are everywhere.But which are the best and which should be catapulted, screaming, across a poorly rendered CGI battlefield? Given their abundance, some arbitrary judging criteria are clearly in order. Hence: no “fantasy” nonsense (ie Game of Thrones) and nothing set after the early 1800s, the latter on the grounds that a) there are too many of the sods and b) Julian “Downton Bloody Abbey” Fellowes has effectively tucked the era under his top hat and run off with it while honking like an overprivileged goose.Let battle commenceth…The BestChief of War (2025)View image in fullscreenHeartfelt storytelling … (from left) Te Kohe Tuhaka, Jason Momoa and Siua Ikale’o in Chief of War.Photograph: Nicola Dove/APA barrel-chested wodge of Big History in which mountainous creator and co-writer Jason Momoa thunders through the based-on-true-events that led to the late 18thcentury unification and, ultimately, colonisation of his native Hawaii.

Cue stoic samurai, scurvy-ridden sailors and preoccupied warlords in a succession of exquisitely indifferent terrains and everyone else sprinting for cover as the whole shebang is (justly) pelted with Emmys.I, Claudius (1976)Yes, the pace is slow, the sets perfunctory and the wigs apparently assembled from the contents of a vacuum cleaner. But still, 50 years on, the BBC’s adaptation of Robert Graves’ novels on the bastardry of the early Roman empire remains one of TV’s finest achievements, with an unapologetically adult script and magnificent, pillar-rattling performances from John Hurt, Siân Phillips and Derek Jacobi, the last assisted by prosthetic makeup and a false nose that could dislodge the cobwebs from a triumphal arch.Wolf Hall(2015 and 2024)View image in fullscreenPrestige drama … Mark Rylance and Ellie de Lange in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light.Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/Playground EntertainmentAn object lesson, here, in how to deliver prestige historical drama without recourse to bums or bombast. Instead, there are exquisitely layered performances (Damian Lewis, Jonathan Pryce), quiet, adult explorations of difficult, adult things (grief, ageing) and many, many candlelit silences into which Mark Rylance’s Thomas Cromwell glides, his expression, as always, that of a ferret saddened by developments in France. A monumental achievement, obviously, and in director Peter Kosminsksy and scriptwriter Peter Straughan’s hands, a near-perfect adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s three-piece masterpiece.The WorstThe Borgias (2011-13)View image in fullscreenPlot? What plot? … Lotte Verbeek and Jeremy Irons in season 2 of The Borgias.Photograph: c Showtime/Everett/Rex FeaturesRome, 1492, and the Vatican is besieged by filth as director/co-creator Neil Jordan takes a stiff quill to non-secular skulduggery. Cue: tumescent priests, pouting strumpets and a never-wearier Jeremy Irons as Pope Shagger VI. Here, historical integrity is something to be bent over and humped, unconvincingly, behind a net curtain. The script? Pfft. The acting? Tsk. The plot? Possibly, although it’s tricky to concentrate on the dynastic machinations of 15th century Italy when Irons in a mitre keeps shouting “WHORE”.The Cleopatras (1983)A catastrophic attempt by the BBC to replicate the success of I, Claudius by squeezing Grade II-listed hams into togas and forcing them to SHOUT at punishing length about the PTOLEMAIC DYNASTY in what appears to be an abandoned REGIONAL LEISURE CENTRE. The upshot? Tedium. Plus? Bald caps, flagrant boobery, Richard Griffiths “working” a “smoky eye”, the line “Let’s get out of Egypt!”and trembling extras gulping in horror as the plot catapults yet another flaming ball of exposition at the studio floor.Spartacus (2010-13)Manacled jocks go loincloth to loincloth in a US production comprised almost entirely of buttocks. There is, occasionally, other stuff: blood, knockers, airborne viscera, Americans in sandals decapitating other Americans while shouting “ass”, some “plot” or other involving revenge, John Hannah (as dastardly slave trader Batiatus) bellowing “BY JUPITER’S COCK!” at 30-second intervals etc. But it is mainly buttocks. Watch it on fast-forward and it’s like being shot in the face by a pump-action bum-gun.The Musketeers (2014-16)One, two, swashbuckle my shoe: abject “international co-production” tosh here from the Beeb as Alexandre Dumas’s novels are reimagined for whichever generation it is that is supposed to be interested in this sort of thing. And lo, much adolescent tomfoolery doth ensue, with PG-rated punch-ups, tiresome hunks smirking in pleather and dialogue of the “Things just got complicated!” genus. The result? Hollycloaks. Peter Capaldi does his best as Cardinal Richelieu but it would take more than thigh boots and nostril-flaring to lighten this particular load.The Tudors (2007-10)View image in fullscreenDancing a merry jig on historical accuracy … Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Joss Stone in The Tudors.Photograph: Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockVerily, my liege, this idiot Canadian-Irish co-production does dance a merry jig upon the very concept of historical accuracy, with its Irish Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), its ripped courtiers and Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves. There is the occasional grudging nod to Actual Historical Stuff (the Reformation, wives etc). But it’s mostly just Henry banging his way around Tudor England, his bum cheeks jack-hammering with such ferocity that they are little more than a meaty blur, like a deli counter viewed from the top deck of a speeding bus in the rain.Chief of War is on Apple TV+ from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPeriod drama (TV)featuresShareReuse this content"

As the album turns 50, does the musician – who went on to tour with Sting and Eric Clapton – have any regrets?Tue 29 Jul 2025 07.31 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 10.26 EDTShareIt was a late spring night in 1971 and David Sancious had walked from his home on E Street in Belmar, New Jersey to the Upstage club in Asbury Park. He was 17 and he had been playing piano and guitar with local bands for four years. “I had walked to the Upstage because I wanted to play,” he says, “and as I’m coming in I see Garry Tallent, a bass player who I already knew from other gigs.” Tallent was with a fellow New Jersey musician, a 21-year-old guitarist calledBruce Springsteen, “the local guitar hero”, says Sancious, “very famous locally.” Springsteen told Sancious he was having a jam session and invited him to play. “I said: ‘Absolutely.’”The band played until 5am. As they were walking out of the club, Springsteen told Sancious he was breaking up his current band Steel Mill to form a new one: would he be interested in joining? Sancious said yes. He went on to record with Springsteen on his first three albums, but left the group before Born to Run transformed Springsteen and his bandmates into superstars. As that album approaches its 50th anniversary next month, I have wondered whether Sancious regrets walking away.View image in fullscreenDavid Sancious with Sting at the 1993 MTV video music awards in Los Angeles.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, IncHe was five years old when his family moved into 1105 E Street in Belmar. The previous owners had left their piano in the house. “The day we moved in, my mum sat down and started playing Chopin and Beethoven,” he says. “It blew my mind.” Sancious started playing piano and later guitar and was in local bands in his early teens, giving illegal underage performances at local bars. “The police used to raid these places and card everyone,” he says. “One night I’m on stage with Bruce and the cops are hanging out at the front door.” The band hatched a plan to get Sancious off stage, sandwiched between Springsteen, saxophonist Clarence Clemons and two others. “I was in the middle moving slowly, trying not to draw any attention.”Sancious and his bandmates sometimes rehearsed in his mother’s garage, but mostly in a surfboard factory owned by an early manager of Springsteen’s. “You don’t know enough to be self-conscious because you haven’t had that much experience yet,” he says about those early days. Sancious contributed keyboards, piano and delicate jazz textures that enriched the early E Street sound on songs such as New York City Serenade and Incident on 57th Street. “The thing about Bruce is that musically he was always open to a good idea. If I came up with a certain chord or inversion, he was very open to that.”Around 1974, Sancious and Springsteen were back in Belmar, by Sancious’s childhood home. “We were coming home from somewhere,” he says, “turning on to E Street from 12th Avenue. There were these white obelisks with the street names painted on them. Bruce saw it and just said, ‘E Street … E Street Band.’” How did it feel to have his address inspire this iconic band name? “Pretty cool – quite an honour.”I looked at Springsteen and thought: as soon as everybody finds out about this guy, he’s going to blow up. It’s going to go crazySancious worked on Springsteen’s debut Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ and its followup The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, and also toured with the band. “We didn’t have private planes back then,” he says. “We had a station wagon, three of the guys in the front and three in the back. You’re doing everything with these people. Eating, laughing, crying with them if something really bad happens. It’s a great life.”He was the first Black member of what became the E Street Band – Clemons joined shortly after. “You are constantly, completely, 100% aware of being Black – full stop – in any situation,” he says. He recalls one incident. “I was at the beach and there were two guys making threatening gestures and saying inappropriate racial stuff. Clarence comes along and sees what’s going on. He sat down right next to me and then Bruce comes walking by. Bruce found a piece of driftwood and he kept hitting it in his hand like he was saying: ‘I’m not going to let you hurt our friend.’”View image in fullscreenDavid Sancious (second from right) on stage with Peter Gabriel (second from left) on Gabriel’s This Way Up Tour, Ahoy, Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1987.Photograph: Rob Verhorst/RedfernsSancious continued playing with Springsteen but during breaks from touring he was working on his own music. When CBS heard his demo they offered him a three-year contract that would launch his solo career. It was an offer he couldn’t refuse, and shortly after playing on a song for Springsteen’s third album – a little number called Born to Run – Sancious left the E Street Band.How did it feel, I ask, to see Born to Run become a massive hit album, and Springsteen on the covers of Time and Newsweek simultaneously? “I felt very happy for him, honestly,” he says. “I knew it was going to happen for him.” How did he know? “We did shows in Texas in 1974 and the crowd went nuts. We finished the show and the audience wouldn’t leave. Bruce used to end the set with a song called For You that he would play by himself on piano and we would go off stage and watch. I remember standing there looking at him and thinking as soon as everybody finds out about this guy he’s going to blow up. It’s going to go crazy.”In 1975 came the release not only of Born to Run but also Sancious’s first solo album Forest of Feelings – a fusion of jazz, rock, funk and classical that suggested he had travelled far from E Street. Of the numerous albums that followed, both solo and with his band Tone, the most successful “got to No 78 in the Top 100 for one week. But my sense of self as an artist isn’t diminished because I didn’t sell a million records. That’s a narrow definition of success and I don’t resonate with that.”View image in fullscreenDavid Sancious performs at the Sellersville Theater in Pennsylvania on his Open Secret tour, May 2025.Photograph: Avraham BankIn the early 80s, Sancious paused making his own music. “The phone kept ringing with artists asking me to go on tour,” he says. “I toured with Peter Gabriel and then Sting and later Eric Clapton and Santana. They have more in common than you might think: none of them had a plan B, they all did it out of a love for music.” Sancious got to play the lead guitar riff to Clapton’s Layla as well as the song’s final piano coda when he toured with him – “such a thrill because I love that song and I love his playing”.Sancious didn’t return to the studio until 2000; he continues to record and tour today. He always remained in contact with Springsteen – he joined him on stage during the Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and played on 1992’s Human Touch album and 2019’s Western Stars. He was part of the live band that backed Springsteen when he performed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in November 2022. “We love each other,” he says. “We love working together and whenever the situation allows we do it and we get fantastic results to this day.”On the night I speak to Sancious, Springsteen and the E Street Band are on stage in front of 60,000 people in Berlin. It feels appropriate to ask: with hindsight, would he have still walked away? “There is a whole life I would have missed out on,” he says. “Working with all these other artists and making my own music. If I had to do it again would I do the same thing? Absolutely. Because I didn’t walk away from anything – I walked towards something.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockBruce SpringsteenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was an enigma. The songs that made him famous were mostly written and recorded before 1960, after which he returned to teaching mathematics and tried to behave as though no one had heard of him.His songs were by turns gloriously vulgar, ludicrously macabre or ferociously political:I Got It from Agnes– “it” being a sexually transmitted disease;I Hold Your Hand in Mine, in which the held hand is no longer attached to a body; andWe Will All Go Together When We Go, perhaps the best anti-nuclear weapons song ever written, praising “Universal bereavement / An inspiring achievement”.Others were wonderfully clever games with words and music, including The Elements (1959), which names all the chemical elements, set to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan’s I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General.He began writing songs as a graduate student at Harvard, where he had enrolled at 15 and had taken a first-class maths degree at 18. He sang them to his friends and soon people started asking him to perform at parties. “My songs spread slowly,” he said. “Like herpes, rather than Ebola.”The politics and rudeness of his material put off the record companies, so in 1953 he paid for 400 discs to be cut of a record called Songs of Tom Lehrer, having worked out that if he sold them all, he would break even. He sold many more than that: he had to keep getting them cut.View image in fullscreenTom Lehrer performing in California in 1965.Photograph: Ted Streshinsky photographic archive/Getty ImagesHis university idyll was broken by a period with the Atomic Energy Commission at Los Alamos, and two years in the army. “I dodged the draft for as long as anybody was shooting at anybody,” he said. “I waited until everything was calm and then surrendered to the draft board.”Afterwards he wrote the songIt Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier, about strange and disturbing army folk: “Now Fred’s an intellectual, brings a book to every meal. / He likes the deep philosophers, like Norman Vincent Peale.” Peale was a famous evangelical Christian of even more than usual banality and intolerance, and alsothe Trump family pastor, who gave the US president his ethical base.After the army, Lehrer returned to studying and singing in night clubs in New York and other cities, while his reputation grew in a samizdat sort of way – record companies ignored him and newspapers sneered, but his growing army of fans loved him. He undertook a series of concert tours, including in the UK, and produced another album, More of Tom Lehrer, in 1959, with a live concert version, An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer, also released.Then, in 1960, he stopped, and that was almost that, except that in 1964 he was lured back to write some songs for the American version of That Was the Week That Was. During the 1970s he contributed songs to the children’s educational television programme The Electric Company and, two years later, appeared in episodes of the Frost Report at the BBC.There were occasional songs after that –(I’m Spending) Hanukkah in Santa Monicain 1990 is probably the best known (“Amid the California flora / I’ll be lighting my menorah, /Like a baby in his cradle / I’ll be playing with my dreidl”). In 1980, the British producer Cameron Mackintosh persuaded him to agree to a revue of his songs called Tomfoolery, which started life at the Criterion theatre in London. But Lehrer neither appeared in it nor wrote new material for it. He was done with performing.Born in New York, Tom was the elder son of James Lehrer, a prosperous necktie manufacturer, and his wife, Anna (nee Waller). He learned to play the piano, fell in love with the Broadway of Danny Kaye and Cole Porter, and attended private schools, which discovered they had a mathematics prodigy on their hands.So he went to Harvard, and took a master’s in 1947, the year after his degree, before settling down to the life of a graduate student, which he enjoyed. He registered for a doctorate but never finished it.Over the years he gave various reasons for stopping song-writing and performing. “What’s the point of having laurels if you can’t rest on them?” he asked. He said he never supposed he might be doing some good, and quoted Peter Cook, who talked about the satirical Berlin kabaretts of the 30s, “which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the second world war”.Things that were once funny now scared him. “I’m not tempted to write a song about George W Bush,” he said of the then US president. “I don’t want to satirise George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporise them.” He said that satire died when they gaveHenry Kissingerthe Nobel peace prize, but that was not his reason for giving it up.However, if you listen to his students, you come away thinking the biggest factor was that he loved teaching and wanted to spend his life doing it. He taught on the US east coast until 1972, when he moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz, where for almost 30 years he taught two classes: The American Musical and The Nature of Math.The American fiction writer Greg Neri wrote: “He was very humble, his fame meant nothing to him, the past he’d fob off as nothing more than messing around with satire. But get him talking about the American musical and he was off and running … He was truly delighted to see a play get on its feet and the day we performed it, he was all grins … He was extremely kind and patient with students.”Other former students reported that you did not mention his career as a performer, or ask about his personal life: it was an unspoken rule in his class.There is a video he recorded in 1997 called The Professor’s Song.One of the songs, to another Gilbert and Sullivan tune, begins “If you give me your attention I will tell you what I am. / I’m a brilliant mathematician, also something of a ham.” But these were private songs for his students. He had turned his back on fame and fortune. And the most dramatic illustration of that came in 2020 when he announced that his lyrics and sheet music were now available for anyone to use or perform without paying royalties.I benefited from this when writing a play called Tom Lehrer isTeachingMath and Doesn’t Want to Talk to You, and including many of his greatest songs. It was performed last year at Upstairs at the Gatehouse in Highgate, north London, and is due to return this November at the OSO Arts Centre, south of the river in Barnes. “Help yourselves, and don’t send me any money,” he wrote on his website. So I did.Thomas Andrew Lehrer, singer, songwriter, satirist and mathematician, born 9 April 1928; died 26 July 2025Explore more on these topicsMusicComedyTeachingMathematicsobituariesShareReuse this content"

Set to be published in September,The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunnytook almost 20 years to write, and at 667 pages is the longest title on the list.

If he takes home the £50,000 award in November, he will become the first Malaysian to win the prize.Szalay, previously shortlisted in 2016 for All That Man Is, was this time put forward forFlesh, which traces the story of one man, István, from his teens to midlife. Another past shortlistee, Miller – nominated in 2001 for Oxygen – made this year’s list forThe Land in Winter.Publisher Fitzcarraldo Editions, which has had multiple titles nominated for the International Booker prize for translated fiction, earned its first Booker longlisting this year with Buckley’s 13th novelOne Boat– which is the slimmest title on the list, coming in at 168 pages.Another independent publisher, Faber, has three titles nominated this year: Brown’sUniversality, Markovits’The Rest of Our Lives, and Claire Adam’sLove Forms. Penguin imprints see the highest number of titles, with five making the list.Just two debuts appear on the 2025 longlist:Misinterpretationby Ledia Xhoga andEndlingby Maria Reva, which follows three women and an endangered snail travelling in a mobile lab through contemporary Ukraine.It is “striking that most of the longlisted writers have already had sustained careers”, said Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

No Irish writers appear on this year’s list, despite having strong representation in recent years.Doyle said that whittling down the nominations “at times” was “agony”. 153 books were submitted, all written in English and published in the UK or Ireland between 1 October 2024 and 30 September 2025.Joining Doyle, Parker and Adébáyọ̀ on this year’s panel is the novelist Kiley Reid as well as the writer and critic Chris Power.Parker follows other actors who have judged the prize in recent years, including Adjoa Andoh and Robert Webb. When the panel wasannounced in December, Wood said that in recent months she had “enjoyed sharing book recommendations with Sarah Jessica, who has passionately supported contemporary fiction for many years.”In 2016, Parker began serving as editorial director at SJP for Hogarth, an imprint of Penguin, before launching her own imprint, SJP Lit, in partnership with independent publisher Zando in 2023.

Fans at home will be able to watch the procession via an ongoing live stream of theSabbath bench.Fans from across the world – including the Canadian R&B megastar Drake, who was passing through the city on tour – have travelled toBirminghamto pay their respects to Osbourne. Iqbal said that he had been moved by accompanying fans in a line to sign a book of condolences, and that Osbourne had put “Birmingham on the map. He put Aston on the map.”In June, Osbourne and Black Sabbath were given the Freedom of the City ahead of theirBack to the Beginning gig,a mammoth, all-star show paying tribute to Osbourne as he and Black Sabbath gave their final live performance. The event raised more than £1m for local charities fundraising for children’s causes and treatment of Parkinson’s, which Osbourne was diagnosed with in 2003.Evoking David Bowie’s death just days after the release of his final album, Blackstar, in 2016, Osbourne died 17 days after the performance, at home in Buckinghamshire.Thousands of fans are expected to attend the event: Birmingham council has encouraged mourners to turn up early, and roads will close from 7am. A book of condolences will remain open at the Birmingham Museum and Art gallery, where the exhibitionOzzy Osbourne (1948-2025): Working Class Heroremains open.In 2011, Osbourne told the Times what he hoped for from his funeral. He didn’t care about the music, he said. “But I want to make sure it’s a celebration, not a mope-fest.”Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneBlack SabbathMetalBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

But Dalí abandoned the project after completing just 100 of the 500 illustrations – leaving all of them unpublished.Norfolk woman hands over 16th-century painting identified as stolen 50 years agoRead more“Of these 100 illustrations, half remained with the publishing house Rizzoli and were either damaged or lost, while the other 50 stayed with the Albarettos and were later inherited by their daughter, Christina – who was also Dalí’s goddaughter,” said Downie.The 50 illustrations retained by the Albaretto family were finally published in 2014, reigniting interest in the abandoned project and raising intrigue over the whereabouts of the unpublished pieces.View image in fullscreenA Salvador Dali exhibition in Nice this summer.

On this occasion, I was really taking a bit of a punt, because I wasn’t sure I’d have it on the wall, to be honest … I do like some unusual art, but you’d have to love it, wouldn’t you?”He was told the painting had been found in the garage of a London house and could barely contain his excitement when he saw stickers on the back, indicating it had been listed in a Sotheby’s auction in the 1990s. “I did a little bit of research and I couldn’t believe what I was looking at.”View image in fullscreenNicolas Descharnes, a expert on Dalí, certifies the painting as authentic.Photograph: Cheffins/CambridgeRussell decided to bid for it “on the spur of the moment”, gambling on his ability to spot a fake after spending years avidly watching the BBC TV show Fake or Fortune. “It’s one of my favourite programmes.”The painting, which depicts a bejewelled sultan, did not command widespread admiration: despite being described as an original painting by Dalí, the vendors “hadn’t even listed it with a reserve [price]”, he said, and “there was no interest in the room” from other dealers Russell knew. One person bid against him during the auction – and dropped out when Russell offered £150.A few months later, via eBay in the US, he tracked down the relevant Sotheby’s sale catalogue, which listed the 38cm x 29cm painting and demonstrated ithad been previously identified as Dalí’s work and asked Cheffins to value it.Cheffins consulted the renowned Dalí expert Nicolas Descharnes, who certified the painting as authentic. He told the Guardian the style, subject and colours of the illustration matched those of other pieces in the series, along with the quality and size of the paper.“People expect to see very surrealist pieces by Dalí. This one is not surrealist, but it’s a Dalí,” Descharnes said.Explore more on these topicsSalvador DalíArtPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

The nearest Metro station, which would offer protection from raids, is 500m away, “and most of the attacks on Kharkiv are so fast that as soon as you hear the sound of the alarm the bombs have already fallen”.View image in fullscreenPavlo Makov at his new art studio in Kharkiv.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianAnd so, they put in ear plugs and lay a bet with death that they will survive the night.He and his family escaped Kharkiv and lived for a time in Italy at the beginning of the war in 2022. But, like many Ukrainians, he found living away from home more stressful than being present, despite the bombs.“I could have stayed in Italy but realised I was losing my senses. After six months you lose the ability to understand what you are doing there. When we came back I immediately I thought: ‘OK, I’m in my place.’”View image in fullscreenMakov’s drawing of a battered urban weed that grows in the cracks in the pavement.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianMakov has recently renovated a new studio in the city. It is on the ground floor: less vulnerable to air attack than his old, fourth-floor place. Its windows are small for an artist’s studio – but practical for a city where glass gets blown out of buildings every day.On an easel is a large, bold new drawing in vivid shades of emerald and orange – a departure for Makov who, for years, has worked mostly in highly intricate monochrome prints and graphite pencil.It is a drawing of a somewhat battered urban weed that grows in the cracks in the pavement. “It’s exactly how I feel myself now: a bit ruined but still alive,” Makov said.The weed is a kind ofplantain, different species of which grow across the world. In Ukraine, this humble plant is often applied to bruises or scrapes as a folk remedy. Its name,podorozhnyk, literally translates as “by the road” – a state of being for the many Ukrainians who are dealing with being displaced, or the threat of being made homeless by a shifting frontline or falling bombs.View image in fullscreenA drawing in the artist’s usual intricate, monochrome style.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian“We all have this feeling that we are living from suitcases,” Makov said. His rucksack always stands by the door, packed with his vital documents and ready for a swift departure.The image of this plant, and its metaphorical power, was a way of tackling the overwhelming subject of war indirectly, he said.“The language of war is so strong, so powerful. It is so enormous that none of us can compete with its power,” he said. “But at the same time, art exists. It has always existed. They were using it in caves to explain the world, to find a connection with the world. You’ll never save the world with it – but it will help you survive your life.”View image in fullscreenMakov working in his studio.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianWhen the invasion began on 24 February 2022, Makov, like other artists in the city, took refuge in Kharkiv’s contemporary art gallery, the Yermilov Centre, which is in the concrete basement of a university building.He was due to represent his country at the Venice Biennale – the art world’s most prestigious regular international gathering, which opened in April of that year. But sheltering from the bombings, he abandoned all thoughts of making it to Italy – until one of the project’s curators called him and told him she had part of his artwork in her car, she was already in Vienna, and she was determined to show something for her country, come what may.The next morning Makov and his family made their escape, racing to their car as a cruise missile hit the nearby headquarters of the SBU security service. One of his tyres got a puncture owing to the broken glass strewing the roads. He had to make an emergency return dash to his mother’s flat, because she had forgotten her false teeth. But the family and their pets made it out. And he did end uprepresenting Ukraineat the Venice Biennale.View image in fullscreenA piece of art in the studio. Makov says Ukraine has been changed for ever by the war.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianBut it was no thanks to the Ukrainian government, he said.“I got two telephone calls from the ministry of culture of Italy, asking whether we needed some help. And no phone call from from the ministry of culture of Ukraine.“It was like we didn’t exist,” he said. “OK, there was a war. But if you’re the ministry of culture, your war is there, in the world of culture.” The Ukrainian gallery with whom he works, The Naked Room, is still out of pocket because of the event “because we got no support from the state” beyond the hiring of the space in which the exhibition was held.Compared with Russia, which projects itself internationally via its literature, music, ballet and opera, Ukraine was way behind on promoting itself through culture, he said.View image in fullscreenThe artist’s tools.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThere is no museum of contemporary art in the country. “We have a unique situation, now,” he said. “For the first time in the history of Ukraine, three generations of artists are alive, not killed, and the art they produced has not been destroyed.” It was evidence of a kind of “provincialism”, he said, “a kind of disrespect to yourself”, not to have built such an institution in an independent Ukraine.“Why am I interested in Great Britain? Not because it won this war or lost this war, it is because Turner is British and I love Turner. Why do I love Ireland? Because James Joyce is one of my favourite writers.”“In Ukraine we don’t have any kind of vision of how to represent Ukraine as a cultural society. We have writers, we have poets, we have we have all these things that we can export, but nobody’s doing that. All our cultural exporting is based on volunteer movements.”‘The soldiers want you to see what they’re going through’: the heartbreaking follow-up to 20 Days in MariupolRead moreUkrainian society had been changed for ever by the war, he said Huge population shifts had been caused by internal displacement and by trauma, but also through the great divides opening up between individuals, based on their very different experiences during the war: soldiers living through a hellish trench warfare on the front, compared with those far behind the lines or those based abroad.Even so, he said, “We all have one general idea: we need the end of the war. Better, a victory, but at least some kind of stable peace.” But like many others in Ukraine, he finds it hard to envision, under the current circumstances, how that might be achieved. “Normally a stable peace comes if your enemy is destroyed. And I can’t imagine that we can destroy Russia, somehow. Russia has a lot of fat under the skin.”“This drama has been going on now for over three years. It will soon have been going on for as long as the second world war. And I don’t think that people understand Russians will never stop unless they are stopped. If they’re not stopped, they will never stop.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This powerful documentary tells the story of these shocking missionsJack SealeTue 29 Jul 2025 04.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 04.06 EDTShareGoing by the raw numbers, Japan’s use of kamikaze pilots in the dying days of the second world war was an effective military action. While the country lost almost 4,000 of its men by asking them to fly planes laden with explosives into enemy ships – a task that entailed certain death – the losses on the other side were closer to 7,000. But it was a bewildering act of collective desperation that still has the ability to shock, and tells us a lot about the futility of modern warfare and the power of mass hysteria in times of conflict.Kamikaze: An UntoldHistoryis a documentary by the Japanese public broadcaster NHK that could have been a very powerful film at 60 minutes but is still impactful at an exhaustive hour and a half. It starts with the first suicide pilots who flew in October 1944, as the Americans advanced inexorably across the Pacific towards mainland Japan. The programme is determined to commemorate individuals who perished, beginning with 20-year-old Hirota Yukinobu. There is clear footage of his plane hitting an aircraft carrier and creating a large explosion on deck, having taken a hit to the wing on its descent: we can well imagine the last moments of a young man’s life being filled with fear of failure and perhaps the physical pain of fire in the cockpit, followed by a final split-second of realisation that his mission had been accomplished.What is even more extraordinary was what happened once the first wave of kamikaze pilots had flown. Newsreel propaganda, shown in cinemas nationwide, lauded the men as something beyond heroic: “With your departure,” said one proud announcer, “you have joined the gods.” It was thought that a nation that was willing to resort to such measures could not possibly lose, and that if Emperor Hirohito were forced to negotiate for peace, this show of strength would enable a more favourable deal.The men became superstars. The home village of 19-year-old Terashima Tadamasa erected a stone monument to his memory, and local dignitaries attended his funeral. In one of several interviews recorded in the 2000s and 2010s with first-hand witnesses, who have since died, the sister of 23-year-old Ishii Mitoshi recalls how hordes of well-wishing strangers made it hard for her family to grieve for him. Pilots had their final written statements read out on national radio (“Mother, are you well? I will not squander the 21 years of life you have given me!”). As the slogan “100 million kamikaze” became popular, schoolchildren wore headbands expressing support for the men, while adults who were not physically fit to serve often proved to be particularly fervent amateur agitators, urging the kamikaze on.The film is a straightforward historical account, so it doesn’t debate the spiky moral and philosophical conundrums the kamikaze phenomenon raises. War requires the mass sacrifice of human life, often in the form of strategies that will certainly lead to heavy losses for your own side. The emotional pull of last year’s American-made second world wardrama Masters of the Air, for example, was provided largely by the idea of men being sent on missions from which many would not return. What is the logic in feeling inspired by the selflessness of soldiers who had a tiny chance of survival, but horrified by those who had none? Clear answers are not to be found here but, as we gaze at photographs of squadrons of men under the age of 25, whose whole adult lives were rehearsals for their death, we have to ask why.The slightly baggy back half of the film does give us more to chew on, as it looks at those who weren’t selected, or who volunteered with some reluctance. Documents are found that suggest the Japanese navy rejected some men’s applications if they had scored top marks in aptitude tests: at a time when few Japanese families could afford higher education, university graduates saw their peers become kamikaze pilots and wondered whether the country really wanted to turn its brightest minds into ammunition.More distressing than the tales of those whose privilege didn’t protect them are reports of kamikaze mania driving men of all backgrounds to sign up unwillingly. We hear how they felt that the political climate gave them no choice: the dynamic that is always in place during conflicts, where it is treasonous to criticise the war effort, crushed any dissent. The kamikaze strategy gave Japanese citizens hope. The film ends by glimpsing the atomic bombs hitting Hiroshima and Nagasaki, brutal events that showed that hope to be false. Whether that made the gestures of the kamikaze pilots more or less noble than any other war death is a question that can’t ever be answered, but this film shines new light on it.Kamikaze: An Untold History aired on BBC Four and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVJapanHistorySecond world warreviewsShareReuse this content"

We are all basically operating a Blockbuster kiosk inside a Tower Records.”The remark did not dull Stewart’s righteous anger about his friendStephen Colbert’s show beingcancelledby CBS after its parent company Paramountsettleda lawsuit withDonald Trump– and a week before Paramount’s $8bn merger with Skydance wasapprovedby federal regulators.Stewart did, however, point to another truth about the decline of a format that has been part of America’s cultural fabric for three-quarters of a century.Late-night TV serves a nightly supper menu of comic monologues, variety sketches, celebrity interviews and musical acts. It turned hosts such asJohnny Carson, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O’Brien and Colbert into a familiar and reassuring presence in millions of homes. It was also relatively cheap to make and offered lucrative returns from advertising, representing a cash cow for major networks.Stephen Farnsworth, a co-author of Late Night With Trump: Political Humor and the American Presidency, says: “It was a comforting collection of lighter fare before bed. It was for people who work second shifts in factories, people who just wanted a joke or two and a celebrity interview before they drop off. It was a cultural experience back in the days of Carson where you had one show that dominated above all and it had those moments that people would talk about the next day at work.”Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?Read moreNot any more. The late-night format has been struggling for years as viewers increasingly cut the cable TV cord and migrate to streaming. Younger people are more apt to find amusement on YouTube or TikTok, leaving smaller, ageing TV audiences and declining ad revenues. Whereas the Late Show might once have raked in about $100m a year, it now reportedly loses $40m a year – givingCBSa convenient pretext to pull the plug and claim it was “purely a financial decision”.Farnsworth, the director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, adds: “The big problem with late-night comedy in recent years is the problem with all traditional media in recent years. When you move to an online environment with podcasts and on demand, it’s hard to get people to pay attention in a place where the ad rates are the highest.“There are plenty of people watching Colbert clips throughout the day on all kinds of platforms. But when you’re talking about advertising revenue, it’s mainly the eyeballs fixed on this TV screen. That’s where the money is made, but it’s also where the decline has been the greatest.”Late-night TV began in the 1950s as the postwar consumer boom made TV sets widespread, including in many bedrooms. Networks saw potential in late-night slots to capture audiences, especially younger viewers and urban professionals.The first notable show wasBroadway Open House on NBC, created by Sylvester “Pat” Weaver (the father of the actor Sigourney Weaver). Airing from 11pm to midnight, it introduced a casual, variety-style format with comedy, music and guest interviews, setting the template for future shows.View image in fullscreenJoan Rivers and Johnny Carson in 1976.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo BankThe definitive late-night programme was The Tonight Show, premiering in 1954 on NBC with host Steve Allen, whose wit and improvisational style were so successful that he got moved to prime time. His successorJack Paaradded emotional depth and conversational interviews during his five-year reign.Then came Carson, whose 30-year run solidifiedThe Tonight Showas a cultural institution, pulling in between 10 million and 15 million viewers a night at its peak. Born in Iowa and raised in Nebraska, Carson’s charm went well beyond coastal cities to middle America. He interviewed presidents, performed impressions of them and told jokes at their expense but wore his own politics lightly.Losing Stephen Colbert and the Late Show is a crushing blow, whatever the reason | Adrian HortonRead moreFarnsworth comments: “They were jokes that never were biting. A joke aboutRonald Reaganbeing a little confused is hardly the same thing as the kind of fare that’s provided today. But it’s important to remember that was a tamer time in American politics too. As America has gotten more partisan and voters and politicians themselves have gotten much harsher, late-night comedy has reflected those changing realities.“I don’t think Carson would be anywhere near as successful today. His relatively tame approach to humour would strike a lot of contemporary viewers as out of touch in the same way that, had Colbert been on the air in the 80s, he wouldn’t have gotten very far.”Carson’s success inspired competitors including CBS, which launched The Late Show with David Letterman in 1993.The Daily Show, a spoof news programme with mock reporters, began on the cable network Comedy Central three years later.UnderStewart, the Daily Show gave late-night a satirical edge, exposing the hypocrisy of politicians and the media with lacerating commentary and smartly edited video clips. A spin-off, The Colbert Report, was a searing parody in which Colbert played an exaggerated, bombastic version of a conservative news host and coined the term “truthiness”.The distribution method has changed so dramatically that making money off the old format is very difficultBill Carter, authorBill Carter, the author of the book The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, says: “Jon Stewart, more than anyone else in that era, brought point of view to what he did, certainly more than Letterman and Leno ever did. Young people loved it. He was breaking news to them. They didn’t pay attention to news; they watched his show and they’d find out things from watching his show.”Among that generation wasTyler Hall, 36, who recalls growing up inspired by the Daily Show’s iconoclastic take on the 2003 Iraq war. He says from New York: “That was so appealing, to think that you can speak with moral authority while still being fun and funny and not preachy and shouty. It felt like a dream to put a finger in the eye of people who were oppressing and causing harm.“I’ve always thought there was something kind of punk rock about Colbert tricking people in his interviews in those early days because they thought he was for real, orJon Stewartspitting back in people’s faces their own video clips. It felt badass. The teenage version of me wanted to be part of it and was fortunate to be part of it.”Hall got a job as as a researcher at The Colbert Report and followed Colbert to The Late Show in 2015. Even as Stewart stepped away from the Daily Show to make way for the South African comedianTrevor Noah, his legacy lived on as proteges such as Samantha Bee, Jordan Klepper,John Oliver, Larry Wilmore and Roy Wood Jr forged their own paths.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama makes an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersHall reflects: “There was certainly an abundance, a diversity, you could even say, a glut of these late-night political shows. There would honestly be times where we could all accidentally write the same punchline off the same thing of the day. We didn’t know what the other one was writing, but inevitably enough of the same smart people writing on the same topic bang out the same basic joke.”Having initially struggled with the transition to a major network, appearing as himself rather than a character, Colbertfound his voicein the era of Trump. His nightly monologues skewering the president are sardonic, silly, smart, snarky and sublime, an invaluable body of work for future historians seeking to understand the decade when America lost its mind. They also carry a rare moral force.I was a late-night writer. Colbert’s cancellation hurts American comedy – and sanity | Jill TwissRead moreDavid Litt, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama whose books includeIt’s Only Drowning, says: “What stood out was Colbert’s kindness as an individual and his public persona as an upstanding citizen. That stands in real contrast to Donald Trump. Colbert was the personification of the idea that people who believe in basic decency have a natural inclination toward saying: ‘I want nothing to do with Trump and I have no interest in bending the knee.’“The Maga frustration with Colbert was you had this person who was a religious Catholic from South Carolina, in many ways not easy to dismiss as a coastal elite or crazy socialist. And what he was saying is that it is deeply American to oppose this man and to find what he’s doing both ridiculous and abhorrent.”The Late Show became the most watched late-night programme with ratings peaking at 3.1 million viewers during the 2017-18 season, according to Nielsen data. But not even Colbert was immune to the tectonic plates shifting beneath the format. In the season that ended in May his audience averaged 1.9 million. The show’s ad revenue plummeted to $70.2m last year from $121.1m in 2018, according to thead tracking firm Guideline.Carter, who has written four books about TV, is not surprised. “It’s of a piece with the end of linear TV,” he says. “The regular primetime programming that’s on the old traditional networks has faded to the point where the ratings stagger me how small they are. It’s like a pond that’s shrinking in the sun. It’s getting smaller and smaller.This is definitely a warning signal for the genre of late-night humour. But it’s not a death knellStephen Farnsworth, author“CBS has made the point that they were losing money and we have to believe them; I’m sure they have finances that show that. But it didn’t look to me like they did a whole lot to counter that.”Carter notes that some late-night shows have saved money by ditching their live band or reducing the number of nights they broadcast. But CBS, whose parent company was accused by Colbert of paying a “big fat bribe” to Trump just three days before the cancellation, made little effort to adapt or save the format.“I don’t know exactly how they handled this, but the shows became somewhat bloated. When Colbert talked about this last week, he said I want to thank the 200 people who work on the show, and one of Letterman’s former producers spoke to me and said: ‘They have 200 people on their show?’ The shrinkage was happening but it didn’t look like CBS was doing that much that I could see until they totally pulled the plug.”Indeed, CBS appears to be ready to give up on late-night. When The Late Late Show host James Cordenleft in 2023, the network opted not to hire a replacement. The network also cancelled After Midnight this year after host Taylor Tomlinson chose to return to full-time standup comedy.Late-night comedians have followed their younger audiences online, releasing clips to YouTube or TikTok. But digital advertising does not make up for the lost TV ad revenue.View image in fullscreenStephen Colbert.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesCarter observes: “They have very big subscriber bases.Jimmy Kimmelof ABC andJimmy Fallonof NBC both have over 15 million to 20 million people subscribe to their TikTok or YouTube channels. That’s an enormous number of people but they have not been able to monetise that.“People watch it whenever they feel like it, which is the way television works now. It’s very hard, if you’re not compelled to watch something, to then commercialise it. How do you get commercials into that? In the past, people would sit through the commercials with Johnny Carson and wait till he came back. People try to avoid commercials now.”He adds: “It isn’t like the idea of late-night is bad or weak or old or used up. It’s that the distribution method has changed so dramatically that making money off the old format is very difficult.”Farnsworth agrees: “The shows haven’t failed. The shows have kept up with the changing preferences but you simply don’t get the same advertising revenue online that you do with over-the-air broadcasts.“These are shows that draw millions of viewers every evening, not to mention millions of more viewers through other platforms. There’s an audience for this. It may not be as big as it was, but no audience is. There’s nothing that television could do to recreate must-see TV or the popularity of All in the Family or M*A*S*H today. People just don’t consume media the same way.”He concludes: “Ultimately the strategy for the remaining shows is living with less. You’re going to have to figure out ways to cut the staff, maybe air fewer nights a week. This is definitely a warning signal for the genre of late-night humour. But it’s not a death knell.”Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTV comedyStephen ColbertComedyTelevisionTelevision industryUS television industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(As well as playing a teacher in that film, she was also the interpreter in theMunich Olympics drama-thriller September 5and played Prince Philip’s sister Cecilie in Netflix’s The Crown.) Benesch could be cornering the market in tough, competent, hardworking young women doing their best in a stressful situation.Here she plays Floria, a nurse (and a single mum) working the late shift in a gleamingly modern but evidently badly understaffed Swiss hospital. Floria has to hit the ground running from the very beginning of every working day. (The original German title is Heldin, or Heroine.) Writer-director Petra Volpe was inspired by the autobiographical novel Our Profession Is Not the Problem. It’s the Circumstances, by German nurse turned author Madeline Calvelage. It’s shot using classically Aaron Sorkin walk-and-talk lines, with Floria exchanging terse technical dialogue with colleagues in the corridors. And there’s almost a real-time single-take aesthetic, although there are conventional edits. British audiences would be within their rights to compare it to Casualty or Holby City.Floria is compassionate and conscientious, but it is clear that the workload is almost intolerable. Over the closing credits, the film invokes WorldHealthOrganization findings that there is a global lack of nurses. Every conversation or encounter with a patient is pressured, and patients are either poignantly grateful or resentfully on the verge of complaining. To calm one old woman with dementia, Floria sings the German lullaby The Moon Has Risen, and the woman quaveringly joins in. It’s a touching moment, which briefly stills the movie’s frantic pace, but it makes Floria late for everything and everyone else.The crisis arises with a pompous man who has paid for a private room and is furious because Floria is late bringing him his tea. Floria snaps, but the situation is resolved a little too easily. This is where the movie begins to look like a TV soap whose storylines have to be wrapped up within the hour (and the final montage with sad music ranging across all the patients verges on cliche). But Benesch brings a tough, smart, credible presence.Late Shift is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsNursingSwitzerlandHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is an against-the-odds story of the first all-female crew to attempt an ocean race – the Round the World Whitbread race of 1989-1990 – even as a sexist press scoffs at them.Skipper, Tracy (based on Tracy Edwards, played by Chelsea Halfpenny), leads the eight-strong team, singing all the while. The production’s sails are raised in an opening scene featuring a projection of waves (good work by video designer Jack Baxter), the set itself the boat’s helm.But the endeavour quickly runs aground. The problems are multifold: the songs composed by Carmel Dean contain plenty of harmonising but they are hollering in volume, blandly hymnal, often unmelodious bar the odd, tuneful number such as Approaching Australia. Lyrics by Mindi Dickstein are strained and expositional, as is her book. Characters speak in unconvincing ways. “I really need a scoop,” a journalist tells the team as he interviews them. “We’ve been at this for six months and no one wants to back a female team,” Tracy tells her friend, Jo (Naomi Alade), as if she doesn’t know this fact.The songs repeatedly, needlessly, remind us that these arewomenat sea. Alade is a strong singer but some others wobble.View image in fullscreen‘I really need a scoop’ … Maiden Voyage.Photograph: Pamela RaithUnder the direction of Tara Overfield Wilkinson, the action on the yacht feels beached, from interpersonal tensions, too briefly brushed across, to the drama of the competition. At the team’s most treacherous flashpoints in the water, the ensemble do little more than sway or pull at rigging. It’s way too tame, you never feel the danger.Characters remain frustratingly unknown and actors appear wooden, perhaps as a result.The team is differentiated by little more than their accents and nationalities (nine in total, we are told). Even Tracy seems barely coloured in, with Halfpenny wearing a one-size-fits-all look of concern through the show.Her friendship with King Hussein of Jordan (Shahaf Ifhar) and his patronage is under-explained too. He bestows a Yoda-like wisdom but what does he know about competitive yachting? There is reductiveness in his portrayal: thickly accented, he speaks of “my people” and compares Tracy’s endeavour to Bedouin life.Meanwhile, the cartoonishly drawn all-male press who brand the team as “tarts” and “cows”, sound like they have had elocution lessons from the Artful Dodger – and borrowed some of his wardrobe too.The cast changes into swimming costumes to celebrate the team’s triumphant moment in the contest. It is based in fact but rather than emanating empowerment, it is discomforting, with sexist newspaper headlines projected behind them.All of it is off-kilter, over-simplified, and rather too premature a production to stage.AtSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, London, until 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsStageMusicalsTheatreSailingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sure, the Shire has a hazy comfort to it, and there’s plenty of unique food to gorge on and friendly faces to meet. But once the saccharine novelty begins to wear off, this bucolic wonderland is actually a fairly dull place to live.Tales of the Shire is set in the Third Age of Middle-earth, years before the events of The Lord of the Rings. As such, there are no Nazgûls or Uruk-hai – instead the “action” centres on the quaint town of Bywater, whose most pressing issue is its municipal status. Here, you play as a recent transplant from the nearby hamlet of Bree, who gets swept up in the process of turning the town into an official village by building infrastructure and befriending locals one odd job and home-cooked meal at a time.View image in fullscreenHazy comfort … Tales of the Shire.Photograph: Private DivisionNaturally this high-fantasy life simulator houses plenty of Tolkienian paraphernalia. You can find the Three-Farthing Stone nestled atop a hillside, and walk through the homely Green Dragon Inn. Plus, there are plenty of familiar surnames bobbing around, from Tooks to Cottons and Brandybucks – heck, even Gandalf pops his head in every so often. A chunky art style frames these iconic spaces and characters, coating the world with an appropriately twee veneer. It’s not a huge map to explore, but what’s there is tenderly dressed, with hanging washing swaying in the breeze, dinky lanterns, and roaming wildlife aplenty.As an upstart Hobbit, your primary goal is to feed and be fed, with all aspects of day-to-day life revolving around this all-important activity. In the wild you can find veggies, nuts and fruits to forage, and the rivers are home to plenty of fishing spots where you earn your catch of the day. There are also seasonal seedlings to purchase and plant, as well as artisanal shop stalls offering speciality items such as flour. With each day running on a timer, the major source of friction is in how efficiently you can dash about and hoover up the goods before bedtime.View image in fullscreenFishing spots aplenty … Tales of the ShireIt’s a well-trodden loop familiar to anyone who has played rural life sims such as Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon. But here, the steady flow of button clicks and undemanding chores operates more successfully as a sleep-inducing mental message than any form of compelling challenge.If you can brave the repetition and invest in your relationships with others, the game begins to open up, providing a slew of formulaic but appetising skill paths to rank up. Collecting ingredients is only half the story; you’ll also need to cook them up into satisfying bundles to serve at extravagant Breakfasts, Second Breakfasts, Elevenses, and so on. Combining elements of Cooking Mama and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tales of the Shire asks you to balance culinary profiles and textures to curate the perfect plate. To do this, you’ll chop, mix and sauté ingredients while consulting a flavour compass in the bottom corner of your screen to ensure your food is as delicious as possible. Eventually, by feeding the right folks, your kitchen expands and there are more opportunities available to get you into the Middle-earth Michelin Guide.But beyond its overly familiar mechanics, Tales of the Shire’s most pressing problem is how naive and placid it all feels. When vague interpersonal issues arise between your new friends, they’re always resolved in a swift, often mundane manner. Much of your time is spent running between frustrated halflings as they burden you with their petty dissatisfactions.Not all cosy games need to evoke hard emotions. However, it does feel like a disservice to the emotionally complex source material not to explore the richness of the world at large – especially when dry humour, tragedy and finely drawn social structures are what make Tolkien’s writing so powerful. Without any challenging quandaries to pull at your heartstrings, the promising atmosphere in Tales of the Shire is overwhelmed by endless fetch quests. Diehard Tolkienites and Stardew Valley lifers may be better off looking elsewhere for their cosy thrills.Tales of the Shire is out now, £34.99.Explore more on these topicsGamesPCNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5XboxreviewsShareReuse this content"

Why has this happened and where will it lead?Rick LaneTue 29 Jul 2025 06.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 06.35 EDTShareIn the last two weeks, thousands of “adult only” and “not safe for work” games have disappeared fromSteamanditch.io– two of the most prominent distribution platforms for PC video games – as they scrambled to comply with stricter rules mandated by payment processors such as MasterCard, Visa, and PayPal.These rules were established after a campaign by the organisationCollective Shout, which urged payment processors to stop facilitating payments to platforms hosting “rape, incest and child sexual abuse-themed games”. But the new rules have affected a far broader range of games – including some award-winning titles.How did this start?On 16 July, Valve, the developer of Steam, updated itsrules and guidelinesregarding the games and software that can be distributed on the platform. The rules, which already prohibited “nude or sexually explicit images of real people” and “adult content that isn’t appropriately labelled or age gated” were expanded to include “content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors” including “certain kinds of adult content”.In a statement to PC Gameron 18 July, Valve confirmed it was “retiring” several games from the Steam store due to these new rules. It did not clarify which games were being removed, nor what “kinds of adult content” are now deemed unsuitable.A week later, itch.ioissued a statementexplaining it had also come under “scrutiny” from payment processors, and as such was “deindexing” (removing from search results) all games labelled “NFSW” as it undertook a “comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors.” Unlike Valve, itch.io specifically referenced Collective Shout as the cause of the renewed scrutiny.What is Collective Shout?Collective Shout is an Australian organisation thatdescribes itselfas “a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls”.In April, itsuccessfully petitionedto have the gameNo Mercy– which featured depictions of “incest”, “blackmail” and “unavoidable non-consensual sex” – removed from Steam and itch.io. After this, the grouppublished an open letterto payment processors claiming to have “discovered hundreds of other games featuring rape, incest and child sexual abuse on both Steam and itch.io”, and requesting payment processors “demonstrate corporate social responsibility and immediately cease processing payments on Steam and itch.io”.After Steam altered its rules, Collective Shoutclaimed credit for the change, stating that more than 1,000 of its supporters had called or emailed payment processors to demand they “stop facilitating payments and profiting from these games”.Why payment processors?Like many online retailers,Steamand itch.io rely on payment processors to enable users to make purchases on their platforms. As such, these companies hold considerable power and can influence what products – regardless of their legality – are bought, sold or published.In recent years, payment processors have become increasingly strict about transactions relating to adult content. In 2021, the subscription-based video platform OnlyFans, widely used by adult content creators,announced it would ban adult materialfrom the site after pressure from payment processors – though this plan wassubsequently abandoned. Later that year, Mastercard imposed a new policy regulating adult content sellers – one criticised by theAmerican Civil Liberties Unionas being restrictive to free speech and potentially harmful to sex workers – and an example of what is known asfinancial censorship.View image in fullscreenThe award-winning Consume Me is among the games affected.Photograph: HexecutableWhich games have been affected?It isn’t clear how many games have been “retired” from Steam due to the new rules, but multiple games thatdepicted incest fantasieshave been removed. Itch.io, as mentioned, has deindexed most games labelled NSFW. According to the games industry newsletterGame File, more than 20,000 games have been removed from itch.io’s NSFW category since 16 July.But these include games that explore queer identity and sexuality, such as Radiator 2 by Robert Yang, a former teacher at New York University’s Game Center. And the rules have also hit games that do not depict sex in any way at all. These includeLast Call, a game about surviving domestic violence by award-winning game designerNina Freeman, andConsume Me, a game about disordered eating which has alsowon numerous industry awards.How has the games industry responded?Many developers have decried the power that payment processors wield over what games are bought and sold, and how that power can be exerted indirectly by campaign groups such as Collective Shout.In a Bluesky post, Yang described Collective Shout and payment processors as “waging culture war against LGBTQ people and sexual expression”, while Consume Me’s developers toldWiredthat it is “completely unacceptable that payment processors are conducting censorship-by-fiat and systematically locking adult content creators out of platforms”.Achange.orgpetition calling for payment processors and activist groups to “stop controlling what we can watch, read, or play” was launched on 17 July. The petition claims “MasterCard and Visa are interfering with legal entertainment”, and demands “the right to choose the stories we enjoy without moral policing”. So far it has accrued more than 150,000 signatures. Meanwhile, gamers and developers are sharing the phone numbers of major payment companies and encouraging people to call and complain.What happens next?It is hard to know for sure. With sustained consumer pressure, payment processors may reconsider their position, but it may also be challenging for anti-censorship voices to muster political support due to prevailing legislative winds surrounding online adult content. The UK this monthenacted stricter regulations regarding age verificationfor internet users wanting to access adult content, while the EU hasdrafted guidelinesfor similar systems.Consequently, it is likely that the new rules will remain in place at Steam and itch.io, at least for the immediate future. But the fallout has drawn attention to the power that payment processors wield, and the lack of clarity surrounding their rules. Because of this, they may tread more cautiously when responding to pressure from advocacy groups in the future.Explore more on these topicsGamesSteamPCexplainersShareReuse this content"

The cheese – a nutty, golden gruyère – we’d bought from Pierre: we hadn’t expected to hike past a human, let alone a fromagerie, in the teeny hillside hamlet of Rouet, and it had taken a while to rouse the cheesemaker from within his thick farmhouse walls. But thankfully we’d persevered. Because now we were resting in a valley of pine and pasture with the finest sandwich we’d ever eaten. Just two ingredients. Three, if you counted the mountain air.Map for QueyrasAs lunches go, it was deliciously simple. But then, so was this trip, plainly called “Hiking in the French Alps” on the website. The name had struck me as so unimaginative I was perversely intrigued; now it seemed that Macs Adventure – organisers of this self-guided walk in the Queyras region – were just being admirably to the point.Yes, Queyras. I hadn’t heard of it either. Bordered to the north and east by Italy, barricaded by a phalanx of 3,000-metre peaks, this regional natural park might be the least-discovered – and the Frenchest – corner of the Alps. Queyras only really entered the national consciousness in 1957, after disastrous floods made it briefly headline news. Tourism filtered in. But it remains little known to outsiders, and centuries of undisturbed agriculture and isolation mean its rural character has been preserved.View image in fullscreenCeillac, the gateway to Queyras natural park.Photograph: Sarah BaxterEven now Queyras takes some effort to reach. Either you take the narrow, hair-pinning road through the gorges of the Guil River from Guillestre. Or you drive over the 2,361-metre Col d’Izoard (from Briançon) or the 2,744-metre Col Agnel (from Italy), both of which periodically test the thighs of Tour de France riders, and both of which close over winter, all but cutting Queyras off from the rest of the world.Making the most of Macs Adventure’s collaboration with the no-fly specialists Byway, my husband and I travelled as close as we could by train. We overnighted in Paris, whizzed down to south-east France, then chugged more slowly towards Montdauphin-Guillestre, where aVauban hilltop fortsurveils a strategic meeting of valleys. Finally, we boarded the end-of-day school bus, joining children inured to the spectacular views to squeeze up the valley to Ceillac, gateway to the natural park.It is a region that, reputedly, has 300 days of sunshine a year and as many species of flowers as it does peopleThe plan from here was to spend six days hiking a circular route that promised big, satisfying climbs but no technical terrain (and no shared dorms or privation). Covering up to 12 miles each day – and walking for an average of six hours – we’d use parts of the GR58 (thegrande randonnéethat circuits Queyras) as well as other trails to roam between traditional villages. We’d eat cheese, gaze over lakes and mountains, and generally revel in a region that, reputedly, has 300 days of sunshine a year and as many species of flowers as it does people (about 2,500 of both).On day one this meant walking from Ceillac to Saint-Véran, over the Col des Estronques (2,651 metres). It was a fine start, under blue September skies – we’d come at the end of the hiking season (the trip runs June to mid-September), when crocuses still fleck the meadows and houseleeks hang on higher up, but the bilberry bushes are beginning to blaze in fall-fiery colours and there’s a sense of change in the air.View image in fullscreen‘The highest village in Europe’, apparently … Saint-Véran.Photograph: Jo Skeats/Macs AdventureWe joined a light stream of other walkers, progressing up the valley via lonely farmsteads and meadows bouncing with crickets. Noisy choughs and a boisterous breeze welcomed us to the pass itself; 100 vertical metres more took us to the lookout of Tête de Jacquette, where we felt like monarchs of this mountain realm. These may not have been the very biggest Alps – few peaks sported any snow – but they rippled every which way, great waves of limestone, dolomite, gabbro and schist.From the col we dropped down through arolla pine and larch to Saint-Véran. At 2,042 metres, it claims to be the highest village in Europe. It’s also a snapshot of Alpine life before the modern world seeped in. The oldest house, built in traditional Saint-Véran style, dates to 1641 and is now the Soum Museum; the ground floor, with its half-metre-thick stone walls, is where animals and families would sleep together for warmth. The upper floors, built from tree trunks, were used to keep hay, barley and rye; the grains were made into coarse loaves that would last all winter, baked in the communal oven.By evening we’d be drinking reasonably priced wine, with a multi-course meal or indulgent fondue. The air was always fresh, the trails joyful, the crowds largely thinThat enormous village oven is still fired up a few times a year, for festivals. But I was pleased to be fed atHotel le Grand Tétras(“Capercaillie”) instead. Here, we feasted ongratin d’oreilles d’âne(literally “donkey’s ears”, actually a delicious spinach lasagne) and stayed in a simple room with a five-star view to the opposite peaks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’d set off after breakfast to buy picnic supplies. We’d hike up through butterfly-wafted green. We’d cross a pass, go by a lake or reach a panoramic ridge. Then we’d descend through forest or towards an icy river. By evening we’d be ensconced in a pretty village, drinking reasonably priced wine, with a multicourse meal or an indulgent fondue. The air was always fresh, the trails always joyful, the crowds largely thin.“It’s busy here mid-July to mid-September,” said Christophe Delhaise Ramond, the owner of agîtein Abriès where we stayed one night, as he poured usmélèze(larch) liqueurs while we pored over maps. Then he reconsidered: “But there are only around 2,000 tourist beds in the park, so it’s never that bad.”View image in fullscreenAtrès françaispitstop in Queyras park.Photograph: Sarah BaxterIt’s thanks to Christophe that we made a slight detour the following day. As planned, we climbed up to 2,583-metre Lac Grand Laus, a lake so brilliantly blue-green it seemed a bit of the Mediterranean had got lost in the mountains. It was spectacular, but as crowded as we’d seen anywhere in Queyras. So, on Christophe’s suggestion, we continued to climb, steeply, up to the Col du Petit Malrif, where tenacious flowers popped through the rocks and the views were immense, reaching to snow-licked peaks.The valleys of the Dolomites: exploring Italy’s new network of wild trailsRead moreFrom here, we looped back, via two smaller, but no less Mediterranean, tarns, where there were no other people. At the second we flopped down in the cotton grass and chewed baguettes stuffed withbleu dequeyras. We stayed there long after the baguettes were gone, listening to the water burbling in the wind. Finally, we headed on, descending via a rocky cleft. Soon we emerged on a track so swirled by puffs of silken thistledown it was as if we were hiking in Fairyland. But no, we were still just hiking in the French Alps – albeit a particularly magical bit.The trip was provided byMacs Adventure and Byway,; the seven-night self-guidedHiking in the French Alpstripcosts from £1,150pphalf-board.

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 29 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 29 Jul 2025 08.38 EDTShareI am limited to one pan and a burner when I camp. What would chefsrecommend making?Maxwell, by emailHappy campers need supplies, and Ryan Cole, executive chef and co-owner ofSalsify at The Roundhousein Camps Bay, South Africa, doesn’t mess about. “We have three square boxes: one dedicated to dry goods, one to oil, salt, pepper and utensils, and the third to camping toiletries; we also have a dual compartment fridge-freezer.”Whatever your set-up, a considered mobile store-cupboard of spices, stock cubes, good oil, grains, pasta, tins of coconut milk and the like will really come into its own. Got tinned tomatoes? Makeshakshukafor a campside breakfast. “We always take a lightly spiced onion relish and add that to tinned tomatoes for the base,” Cole says. Otherwise, he’ll use long-life or nut milk to whip up some breakfast pancakes: “That’s super-simple.”Mitch Tonks, founder and CEO ofRockfish, is no stranger to confined cooking arrangements: “I live on a boat, so I’m used to limited space. That’s why Iloveone-pot dishes.” Pasta, he says, really suits this way of cooking. Ditalini, or other small, short tubes, with pancetta and peas, for example, will have you eating very well in the great outdoors – scout’s honour. “Put 75g pasta in a wide pan with a teaspoon of chicken powder or a quarter of a crumbled stock cube. Add cured smoked pancetta, tinned or frozen peas and a chopped tomato, then pour in 225ml water.” Simmer the lot for 10-15 minutes, until the pasta is cooked and the water has evaporated, then grate in some parmesan or stir in a tablespoon of mascarpone and eat.Wholesome, hearty meals are a balm when you’re camping, Cole says. A favourite starts by dusting bony cuts of meat (lamb neck or oxtail, say) with flour, then caramelising them in oil: “Take them out, add onion, garlic and carrot, and sweat until soft. Return the meat to the pan, and cook for half an hour with some stock, water, wine, beer or whatever liquid you have floating around the campsite.” Tip in some new potatoes, then leave to bubble away gently for two or three hours while you shoot the breeze: “You can make that to feed one, two or 10, and there’s nothing better on a summer’s night. Or any night, really.”It’s worth having snacks in your arsenal, too, says George Husband, co-founder ofGorka, the London-based pop-up: “Bring a zip-lock bag of 750g flour, two teaspoons of instant yeast [or even a premix bread flour from the supermarket] and a pinch of salt, then add water the night before you want to cook it, or even when you crawl out of your sleeping bag in the morning. You now have a flatbread dough that’s ready to fry.” Once cooked, slather the bread with butter and honey, and “that’s a great snack for hiking trips”.And if your idea of a good time includes something sweeter, keep things simple withs’moresor thin millet pancakes, Cole says: “Do this in a pan that’s almost too hot, so the edges caramelise, then put in a couple of marshies and a bit of maple syrup.” Roll them up, squeeze over some lemon juice and job’s a good’un. But remember, he adds, less really is more when you’re in the countryside: “The more you take with you, the more you have to bring back!”Got a culinary dilemma?

Eat a slice, shut your eyes and you will instantly be transported to the Aegean. Bake the tart ahead of time, because it’s perfect served at room temperature. If I am taking it on a picnic, I like to tub up the cucumber ribbons separately, then squeeze over the lemon and crumble in the feta just before serving.Greek salad tartPrep10 minCook50 minServes6-8If you have any plant-based eaters in the mix, use a non-dairy puff pastry and omit the feta.400g ripe vine tomatoesSea salt andblack pepper500g puff pastry1 large egg, beaten1 red onion,peeled and finely sliced3 tbsp capers50g black olives,pitted and chopped1tsp dried oreganoOlive oil½ cucumber,trimmed½ lemon,juiced75g fetaHeat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ and line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper.Finely slice the tomatoes with a sharp knife, so they are less than 5mm thick. Put them in a large colander, toss with a half-teaspoon of sea salt, and leave in the sink.Roll the puff pastry into a roughly 32cm × 25cm rectangle and score a border 2cm from the edge. Transfer to the lined baking sheet and brush the border with the beaten egg. Lay three or four rows of the sliced tomatoes inside the pastry border, and nestle in the slices of onion as you go. Scatter over the capers and chopped olives, sprinkle over half the dried oregano and drizzle with two tablespoons of olive oil. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until the border is golden all over and nicely risen, then remove and leave to cool.To make the topping, peel the cucumber into ribbons with a vegetable peeler and put in a bowl. Season generously, squeeze over the lemon juice, then sprinkle in the remaining half-teaspoon of dried oregano, crumble in the feta, add a tablespoon of olive oil and toss well. Scatter the cucumber mix over the top of the cooled tart just before serving.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkPastryGreek food and drinkFoodPicnicsPieMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"
