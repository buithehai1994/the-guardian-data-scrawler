Let Manchester be a turning pointJonathan FreedlandThis was a horror but amid rising antisemitism, no one can say it was a surprise. There are lessons to learn, and that must start nowFri 3 Oct 2025 12.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.22 EDTShareIt was the Jewish New Year last week, when the traditional greeting isshana tova: a good year. This time around, you’d often hear it in adapted form, as Jews wished each other something more modest: “A better year.” As if, given the times we live in, “good” would be too much to ask for; as if we ought to scale down expectations. It turns out we didn’t scale them down enough.I was in synagogue when word spread of the murderous attack at Heaton Park in northManchesterthat left two people dead, along with the killer. Yom Kippur is rightly described as the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, but it is also a moment of vulnerability. Those who follow tradition, and that includes plenty who wouldn’t describe themselves as believers in God, do not eat or drink for 25 hours; many switch off their phones, and don’t watch TV or listen to the radio; they engage in reflection on the year that has passed, submitting themselves and the wider Jewish people to intense self-criticism.So they – we – were already vulnerable when we heard the first whispers of murder in Manchester. That made the shock and the sadness more intense. But what was missing was any sense of surprise. Having seen attacks on Jews, and on synagogues,recur around the world, British Jews had been fearing it and preparing for it.I don’t just mean emotionally. To an extent that is perhaps not realised by most Britons, every Jewish building in this country – every school, every cultural centre and synagogue – has long been hardened against attack, compelled to operate stringent security. Indeed, community officials I’ve spoken to believe that it was only the presence of guards and gates and fences, and of congregants who knew the drill, that prevented the assailant from killing more.It’s good that the system – operated by a Jewish charity, the Community Security Trust – worked. But it is a bleak kind of comfort to realise that Jews were right to reach the conclusion they came to long ago – that to live a Jewish life in Britain, to send a child to a Jewish school or simply to go and hear an evening talk on a Jewish theme, is best viewed as a high-risk activity requiring serious protection.It’s early to speak of the motive of the killer, Jihad al-Shamie, a British citizen born in Syria. Police warn that a clearcut answer may prove elusive. In the mental stew of a killer, it can sometimes be hard to calculate the exact portions of political radicalisation and psychological disturbance.Even so, there are some things we can and perhaps ought to say. The first is that we are living in an age of renewed political violence. Whether it’s the murder of Charlie Kirk or the attempted torching of refuges for asylum seekers, people are converting political rage into physical acts designed to cause injury or death. The condemnation of this is not as absolute as it needs to be. Too many feel the temptation, when sympathetic to the rage, to make excuses for the violence: you could hear a lot of that around last year’s anti-migrant riots. We need to be unbending on this. No anger, no matter how righteous we might consider its supposed source, justifies the murder of innocents. None.View image in fullscreenPeople with flowers before a vigil to be held after the attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue, Manchester, 3 October 2025.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesSecond, we should be wary of those who seek to use a wicked act such as this to advance a political agenda. I was struck that one Jewish community official I spoke to on Thursday night volunteered, unprompted, how “profoundly unhelpful” it was that rightwing Israeli politicians had rushed to claim the Manchester killings as proof of the folly of Keir Starmer’s Middle East policy. “Weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism,”wrote Benjamin Netanyahu, apparently unaware that the man who was prime minister when Israel suffered the greatest act of terrorism in its history on 7 October 2023 was one Benjamin Netanyahu.Third, there needs to be some soul-searching among those who pride themselves on their vigilance against racism and yet who have long had a blind spot around antisemitism. You don’t have to agree with all of David Baddiel’sJews Don’t Countthesis to recognise that too many progressives have, even unconsciously, seen antisemitism as a lesser menace, one that does not demand their full attention.The arguments, often made implicitly rather than explicitly, are now wearily familiar. That Jews don’t experience real racism because they’re supposedly white (the position that Diane Abbott advanced in the 2023 letter that saw her first suspended as a Labour MP). That Jews are powerful and therefore antisemitism constitutes a kind of “punching up” (a view that itself rests on an antisemitic cliche). That to talk about antisemitism is really to talk about Israel and it’s therefore all very complicated and best put to one side. (Witness the Jewish educational charity that tells me its offer of training against antisemitism was rejected by one headteacher on the grounds that their school was taking a “neutral stance”.)Threaded through such thinking is a kind of unspoken, maybe even unconscious, assumption that antisemitism need not be a prime concern of the left because it is discussed often by the right – the likes of the Daily Mail and GB News, for their own reasons – leaving the left free to downgrade or ignore it. But in Manchester we saw the proof that antisemitism can be as lethal as any other form of hate. It demands equal seriousness; its victims deserve equal solidarity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One only has to look at theenormous surgein antisemitic incidents since 7 October to see that. Perhaps this might be a way to think about it. Let’s say you’re a Guardian reader who is appalled by Israel’s destruction of Gaza and its killing of more than 60,000 Palestinians. Your fury will be entirely directed at the Israeli government and have nothing to do with Jews: the line between the two will be sharp and clear in your own mind. But what is surely now undeniable is that there are others for whom the line is not so clear, whose rage against Israel manifests itself as, and may be driven by, hatred of Jews.For you, it’s an article of faith that “anti-Israel” is not “anti-Jewish”. But not everyone is so careful. So the plea many British Jews might now make is for those justifiably outraged by Netanyahu’s conduct of the Gaza war to think of that line when they chant a slogan or carry a placard, and be sure their words and actions fall on the right side of it. Because sometimes theline gets blurry.And as for Jews, where does this leave us? The synagogue service that I was in on Thursday carried on, the same way as always. No one considered stopping. That, I suspect, is how it will be. Journalists have been asking if Jews might now leave Britain. I don’t expect it. But I do see Jews wanting to huddle together against the cold, to be among those to whom they don’t have constantly to justify or explain themselves. Even if that means being in the same place at the same time – even if that carries the risk of more sorrow, more pain, more tears. They will take the risk because, who knows, maybe next year will be better.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Under the landmark legislation, which was passed with the almost unanimous support of the Conservative party under David Cameron in 2008,carbon budgets are set for many years beyond the current government’s remit, binding future governments to climate policies, though it does not specify what those policies should be.The Tory leader says she wants to “scrap those failed targets”. But Ed Matthew, the UK programme director for the thinktank E3G, said: “This is a new low point forKemi Badenochas she blows up the Conservative party’s credibility for protecting nature and the climate in her quest to ape the far-right policies of Nigel Farage. This announcement is anti-science, anti-growth, anti-health and anti-nature. It is the kind of policy that Vladimir Putin would be recommending.”So we thought we would take a closer look at the Tory claims:The Conservatives are announcing their plans to prioritise cheap energy and economic growth and halt the deindustrialisation of Britain by replacing the Climate Change Act 2008 (CCA).The CCA, passed by Ed Miliband under the last Labour government, has forced governments to introduce burdensome rules and regulations that have increased energy bills for families and businesses, eaten away at Britain’s manufacturing sector, and contributed to a worsening in economic growth.Kemi Badenoch fails to mention that Cameron played a key role in the legislation. He and his advisers put out their own versions of potential legislation, ahead of Labour’s bill, which were similar to the final bill.Cameron led the entire Tory party, minus five rebels, through the House of Commons lobby to vote for it.The Conservative party, under Kemi Badenoch’s leadership, is focused on making sure our economy and our businesses are given the right regulatory framework to thrive and ensuring that elected politicians can make the right decisions for Britain’s economy and prosperity. This includes freeing the country from the economically harmful regulations that are holding it back, while ensuring we protect our natural environment.The Confederation of British Industry (estimates there are 1 million people in green jobs in the UK today, and the green economy was thebiggest success story of the last year, growing by 10% and adding £83bn to “gross value added” – a much faster clip than the rest of the economy could manage. Other countries are seeing similar success: globally, thegreen economy is the second fastest growing, behind only the tech sector.That is why the next Conservative government will replace the CCA with an energy strategy that puts cheap and reliable energy as the foundation for economic growth first, and an approach to climate and environmental protection that prioritises enhancing and preserving our natural environment.Studies show theclimate crisis is one of the biggest threats to nature and wildlife, alongside the intensification of farming.By replacing the CCA, ministers will be freed from legally binding targets that force them to make decisions to meet arbitrary climate targets, even if they make the British people poorer, destroy jobs, and make our economy weaker.The UK’s legally binding target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is not “arbitrary”; the target – enshrined in law by Theresa May when Conservative prime minister – is in fact based on the highest scientific authority: theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of thousands of the world’s leading climate scientists.A future Conservative government will be able to balance the interest of the economy and our natural environment, without the constant threat of judicial review and eco-lawfare that has cost the taxpayer millions over the past decade, and driven up the cost and timeline of multiple government projects.The 2008 legislation has forced successive governments to introduce punitive measures that have hit family finances – including the boiler tax which will push up the price of gas boilers to force people to adopt heat pumps just for the purpose of meeting a self-imposed target.WhenVladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, the price of UK gas tripled. The resulting crisis in the cost of living revealed the UK’s deep overreliance on gas, most of which is imported because the North Sea is a basin in rapid and terminal decline. Heat pumps, which use electricity instead of gas, are three times more efficient than gas boilers andcould save consumers hundreds of pounds a year, even if gas prices fall further from their peaks.The act ignores the fact that climate change is a global problem. If the British chemicals, cement, or metals industry shuts down and moves abroad to countries with cheaper but dirtier energy, then Britain won’t need any less chemicals, cement, or metals – we will just import more from abroad instead, and lose out on all the jobs, tax revenue, and economic growth. Britain will be poorer and global emissions will increase.The CCA was the world’s first legislation of its kind, but since then has been copied by scores of governments around the world. If the UK repeals the act, it will become an outlier among large developed economies, apart from the US. Without the CCA and a strong carbon price in place, the UK alsofaces being punishedby its largest trading partner, the EU, which isputting in place a carbon border adjustment mechanism. This is agreen tariff on industrial goods that penalises imports from countries that have weak climate laws.The CCA has also forced ministers to support Drax, where trees are cut down in North America, shipped across the Atlantic in diesel-chugging ships, and burnt in a power station in Yorkshire, at great cost to billpayers and our environment, because it is labelled ‘clean’ for the purposes of our climate targets.The Conservative governments from 2010 to 2024 supported the Drax power station, drawing up rules that grantedbillions of pounds in subsidy to the biomass plant. Earlier this year, Labour moved to crack down on Drax,halving its subsidies and imposing strict new environmental criteria.The UK has already halved its emissions since 1990, reducing emissions by more than any other major economy. But global emissions are rising and countries like China are not following our lead. Continuing down this path of unilateral economic disarmament will make us a warning, not an example, to the rest of the world.The first part is true: the CCA has been successful in helping to push down UK greenhouse gas emissions. However, the UK is not alone. The US, the EU, Japan, Canada, Australia and other leading developed countries have alsoput in place targets and policies to reduce emissions. Only the US has so far reneged on them. China will reach net zero by 2060, and is set to peak its emissions this year. China has alsoturned its green efforts into an engine of economic growth– low-carbon sectors now account for 10% of its economy, and were the key driver of growth last year.The Conservatives support action on climate change – and believe in safeguarding our environment for future generations – but this has to happen when it makes people’s lives better. People should be able to adopt electric vehicles and electric heating when they want to and when it will save them money, not when they are forced to by a government mandate.No one in the UK has been forced to adopt electric vehicles or heating, says E3G. There is amandate for car manufacturers to produce all electric vehicles by 2035. “If it doesn’t move to manufacture electric vehicles, then the UK car industry will die,” says Matthew. There is also no regulation requiring households to stop using their gas boilers.Cheap energy for families and businesses has to be our priority, but Ed Miliband is delivering the opposite, with his upcoming wind auction (Allocation Round 7) locking us into much higher electricity prices for longer, solely for the purpose of meeting climate targets. This latest announcement demonstrates the Conservatives and Kemi Badenoch’s commitment to making economic growth our central imperative – unleashing British businesses from crushing bureaucracy.Electricity from renewable sources is stillcheaper to produce in the UK than electricity from gas. Polling shows thatmost people in the UK are keen on renewable energy."

She was the foxy cafe owner, Sylvia Snape, flirting with tradesmen and upselling cheese baps, and everything about her – from her frisson to the fact that she had her own set, a little cafe – screamed regular-character energy. But she “just knew, inside, that I needed to have other adventures,” she said on Parkinson, nearly 40 years later. She then spent the 50s, 60s and 70s mainly on stage, in jaunty-sounding musicals (How’s the World Treating You?) lost to posterity. She had a stunning voice that the small screen rarely found a proper use for, and was a longtime member of the RSC.Mrs Snape was the last time she played the romantic interest, and the first time, she said later, she’d been offered a role that wasn’t significantly older than her. An episode of Z-Carsand a couple of appearances in Steptoe and Son later, she was back as the title character in Plain Jane in 1977, an extravagantly weird, extremely British rumination on the class system (maybe this is unfair, but the inquiry seems to be: who would have thought that a working-class woman who isn’t pretty would know so much?).View image in fullscreen‘Regular-character energy’ … Patricia Routledge as Sylvia Snape in Coronation Street.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockShe was 40 before she considered herself to have an acting career, she said once, and in her mid-50s, by the time she started working with Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood, both of whom would have called her a muse, if people who wrote with their kind of self-deprecation would ever have used a word like “muse”. Routledge did Bennett’s stand-alone TV play, A Woman of No Importance, in 1982, in which she’s an inflexible, overbearing spinster who dies alone. Her performance was almost certainly part of the inspiration for Bennett’s groundbreaking monologue series, Talking Heads, which first aired in 1988, with Routledge first playing Irene Ruddock – another overbearing spinster who ends up in prison – and then Miss Fozzard who, through a series of quite normal events, ends up in a transactional relationship with a foot fetishist (“very kinky”,she said in 2007. “I didn’t really enjoy it”).She loved performing Bennett, saying later: “The fact that his work is microcosmic, he sees the world in a grain of sand – and the sympathy, the humanity. I know those women. It’s in one’s bloodstream, almost. There but for the grace of God, one could be one of those tragic spinsters, a lone person fighting bureaucracy.” It was commented upon – well into the 90s, and with dispiriting regularity – that Routledge herself had never married, and perhaps this was Bennett’s jumping off point, into his imaginative universe in which not having a husband was the worst thing that could happen to a woman. In fact, she didn’t seem to mind much that she’d never found the prospect of a man “quite exciting enough, as an alternative” to her career, and Bennett definitely fell for her as an actor rather than an emblem of thwarted femininity. Sending her a script once, he wrote: “I’m sorry if you find there are echoes, but I can hear your voice.”View image in fullscreen‘She could yammer away for ever’ … Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances, alongside  Clive Swift, playing her husband, Richard.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyAround the same time, in 1985, in fabulous counterpoint, Victoria Wood wrote her as Kitty, this brassy, garrulous creation who could bring furniture to life with her comic charisma. In 1990, Hyacinth Bucket – who insisted her surname was pronounced “bouquet”, a weirdly memorable detail we’ll still have long after we’ve forgotten how to pronounce our own names – arrived in Keeping Up Appearances. A sitcom of manners, it was very different; a grotesque, really, but plainly tapping into a Routledge quality: that she could yammer away for ever, and even if the entire dramatic point was to be totally unlistenable, you nevertheless wanted to listen. That’s quite an elegant and enigmatic art, and her own origin story, about her relationship to comedy – that she fell in love with it as a child, going to the Argyll music hall in Birkenhead every Monday night – doesn’t really nail down her uniqueness.View image in fullscreen‘Brisk and redoubtable’ … Patricia Routledge in ITV’s Hetty Wainthrop Investigates.Photograph: Ronald GrantHetty Wainthropp, an adaptation of the novel Missing Persons by David Cook, started as a two-hour adaptation for Yorkshire TV. Fun but clunky, it became episodic for four seasons. Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, on the BBC, saw Routledge through to the end of the 20th century. She was brisk and redoubtable and could see through humanity like a pane of glass but liked to help it out all the same, “flying the flag for the senior citizen”, she said later, though she considered herself “younger than springtime”.“Getting a performance together seems like starting on a long walk,” she said as Wainthropp reached the end of its run. “There in the distance, there is a tiny speck of a character, that you have an idea of in your imagination, and bit by bit, you come closer to each other. If you manage to meet up, link arms, and go off in the same direction, then you’re in business.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPatricia RoutledgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Generals need to say somethingFri 3 Oct 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 12.39 EDTShareAt what point will the US’s top military brass decide that enough is enough, that loyalty to the constitution and the rule of law supersedes blind fealty to job andDonald Trump?The question is hardly academic. The president has been rapidly intensifying military operations on United States soil during his second term. In April, he began expanding the military presence along parts of the US’s southern border byestablishingso-called “national defense areas”. Troops are now authorized to search, question and detain people in those zones, dangerouslymuddlingthe line between military rule and civilian law enforcement.By the summer, Trump sent in the marines and the national guard to Los Angeles, against the wishes of the governor, and later to Washington DC. Similar deployments of the national guard, also against the wishes of the respective state governors, are expected for Chicago and Portland, Oregon.Needless to say, US law, under thePosse Comitatus Act, generally prohibits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement roles. A federal judgeruledin September that Trump’s troop deployment in Los Angeles violated the act, but Trump is doing it anyway. And he expects the military to follow him.Not just follow him. He expects the military to venerate him. Trump turned a 250th Anniversary Parade for the Army, which we already didn’t need, into his own 79th birthday celebration, which we definitely didn’t need. (Both anniversaries were on the same day. Attendance at the parade was not only sparse, but was dwarfed by theestimated 5 million peoplewho turned out for the “No Kings” demonstrations across the country on the same day.)And most recently, he joined his recently renamed secretary of war,Pete Hegseth, in an abruptly summoned meeting of the country’s military commanders on 30 September. (“I love the name,” Trump said, referring to the Department of War. “I think it’s so great. I think it stops wars.”) At the meeting, Trump told the leadership: “We’re under invasion from within, no different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms.” His evidence was that “Democrats run most of the cities that are in bad shape,” even though all the cities he listed –San Francisco,Chicago,New York,Los Angeles– have some of their lowest levels of violent crime in decades. And then he said: “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”Trump and Hegseth are attempting to reshape the US military into a partisan force committed to preserving Trump’s power, a prospect which is not only anathema to our tradition but should also worry all Americans. And they want to make this restructuring into a spectacle. Everything Hegseth said at this highly publicized and very expensive meeting could have been issued by memorandum, and in factwas. But Hegseth in particular needs a rebrand. He is, at this point, much less known for leading military operations than he is forleakingthem. For Hegseth, the very public lecture was a vainglorious attempt at buffing his own tarnished image. Unfortunately for him, it came across more like a condescending Ted talk that had possibly been directed by the ghost of Leni Riefenstahl.But far more significant, and infinitely more troubling, was Trump’s foreshadowing of even greater numbers of troops on our American streets. So, I return to my initial question: when will the nation’s top military brass decide that enough is enough?There’s every reason to believe that high ranking members of the military might already be worried about getting sacked by this president, either for being insufficiently loyal to Trump, insufficiently white, or insufficiently male, based on past actions from this administration. Within weeks of assuming office, Trumpsackedthe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Air Force Gen CQ Brown, only the second Black man to hold the position. Adm Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to be named to chief of naval operations, the US Navy’s highest rank, was alsodismissed.Trump alsogot ridof judge advocates general for the army, navy and air force, and fired Gen Tim Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command,reportedlyat the request of far-right activist Laura Loomer, who claimed Haugh was insufficiently loyal to the president. There aremany more examples.While it’s true that every administration does some house cleaning upon assuming power, it’s also true that the scale and mission to restructure the military during this administration is unprecedented. As Peter Feaver and Heidi Urben write inForeign Policy: “No previous administration exercised its power in this dramatic fashion for fear that doing so would effectively treat the senior officer corps as akin to partisan political appointees whose professional ethos is to come and go with changes of administration, rather than career public servants whose professional ethos is to serve regardless of changes in political leadership.”Hegseth claimed that he will also now get rid of “stupid rules of engagement”. Those rules, however, define what is lawful and unlawful behavior by the military, a line made more difficult to discern as the administration decimates the legal wing (the judge advocate generals) of the military. Clearly, there has been plenty of illegality in the US military behavior from its inception until today. But if you are a member of the military, you have the right, if not the duty, torefuseillegal orders.The Trump administration is currently engaged in blatantly illegal acts being carried out by the US navy. Lethal strikes are being launched against vessels in the Caribbean that the US claims are drug smuggling boats. No evidence has been provided, and now the administration isclaimingthe US is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels and the people who were murdered by the US in the strikes are “unlawful combatants”.This is ludicrous, of course, and is reminiscent of the worst legal reasoning developed during the early War on Terror era. Even if the people on those boats were participating in drug smuggling (which is quite unlikely), being involved in the sale of a controlled substance does not rise to the standard of engaging in hostilities, asnotedby Geoffrey Corn, a retired judge advocate general lawyer and formerly the army’s senior adviser for law-of-war issues.When a state intentionally kills a person outside of armed conflict and without due process, it’s a form of murder. It’s already happening in the Caribbean Sea. Is that the path we’re headed down on the streets of our own cities? Trump may have drawn up his own battle plans for his purposes, but it’s the members of the military who will have to carry them out. With all our institutions currently on the line, including the military, we need a much stronger defense against his idea of war.Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

It was the 1970s, the National Front were mobilising, and they were the children of south Asian workers invited to Britain a decade earlier to fill labour shortages.Among them was Asad Rehman, who had moved to the Lancashire town with his family from Pakistan at the age of four. “We would all walk together, because it was dangerous to walk alone,” he remembers. “Younger children in the middle, older children around the edge, because we’d be attacked on the way.”Things were no better at school. Pupils would perform Nazi salutes and hurl racial epithets at them, some exchanged Bulldog, the National Front newspaper, openly in the halls, and the black and brown pupils “every day, as soon as the dinner bell would go, we would barricade ourselves into a classroom, because we would be attacked”.“So I started talking to everybody,” says Rehman. Together, they decided to defy the teachers who had failed to protect them by collectively refusing to attend, “and we will say this is because the schools aren’t safe for us”. It was Rehman’s first taste of organising, and as he joined wider antiracism movements that were formed across the country, it shaped his political outlook.“We started to protect our community and I started to realise that abiding lesson that has stayed with me: we are much more powerful when we are a ‘we’ than when we’re individual. You need organisations to organise you and you need a vision to hold you together.”This summer, Rehman was appointed chief executive of the environmental charityFriends of the Earth. For decades, the poster child of climate breakdown was the polar bear drifting on an ice floe in a warming ocean. Now, to speak of the climate crisis without mentioning social, racial and economic injustice has become all but unthinkable. And Rehman has been at the forefront of this transformation.“I took this job because of the scale of the crisis out there,” he told the Guardian on the sidelines of a Make Them Pay climate justice protest outside Downing Street last month. “It’s an interconnected crisis of climate, [of] inequality, of economic systems that have been rigged against ordinary people. It’s ultimately a crisis of justice.“And there is only one organisation that has always centred justice – environmental justice and climate justice – that’s Friends of the Earth.”With more than 250,000 supporters and 233 local action groups, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland (Scotland has its own Friends of the Earth) is the UK’s biggest environmental campaigning network. In the year to summer 2024, it spent more than £10m on activism ranging from courtroom challenges to government policy to local campaigns against councils’ use of pesticides in park playgrounds.View image in fullscreenRehman addresing  young people in London in 2021 taking part in a global  strike for climate justice.Photograph: Mark Kerrison/AlamyBut it has – albeit undeservedly – earned a reputation as a less radical organisation compared with its peers, more bake sales and petitions than road blockades and occupations.The appointment of a stalwartly class-conscious campaigner like Rehman could be the organisation’s attempt to shed that image.And it is not the first time he has worked there.After graduating from university, Rehman continued campaigning for racial justice, working with the Newham Monitoring Project in the era when the far right was still a force in east London.“It was running campaigns, and it was doing casework, and it was rooted in the community,” he says. “And I learned being a community organiser.”But not content with simply reactively countering racism on the streets and from the state he, along with many others at the time, sought to place antiracism on a human rights level. This led him to Amnesty UK, where over the next decade he worked with global south activists to push for a fundamental shift in the understanding of human rights. “At that time, Amnesty didn’t campaign on economic and social rights, they only campaigned on civil and political rights,” he says.By the end of the 1990s, Rehman’s work with Amnesty had brought him into contact with a range of international social justice organisations that at that time had coalesced into the counter-globalisation movement against neoliberalism. What he was to learn from them would affect the rest of his career.“I was going and working with these people, and everybody you spoke to was saying how bad climate was, how farming was becoming impossible, how it was displacing people,” he says. “And I was like, Jesus! Everything we have fought for and won is going to be unravelled by this thing. And this thing that is happening, it’s called climate – and yet nobody’s talking about it like that.”View image in fullscreenRehman speaking at a conference in London about confronting the rise of the far right.Photograph: Mark Kerrison/AlamyThis led Rehman to his first job with Friends of the Earth, in 2006. At the time, most environmental organisations were talking about climate change as a problem for the future.Pollution levels highly harmful to wildlife in quarter of England’s neighbourhoods, research findsRead more“Friends of the Earth was the only mainstream environmental organisation that then officially broke with what I’d call the rest of the environment movement, and was one of the founders of what we now call the climate justice movement,” he says.Rehman worked to bring the voices of the developing world to the table. It did not always make him popular. On one occasion, he recalls, after a meeting between UK government representatives and environmental NGOs, a minister called his chief executive demanding he call off his “climate Taliban”. He would not be drawn on which minister it was.“People just felt: ‘Who is this person who doesn’t follow [the] same rules?’ You know, the environment is a nice thing, we can all agree and talk. [But] I saw it as a fight against racism, a fight for human rights … a deeply political fight.”View image in fullscreenRehman at  Cop27 in Egypt in 2022.Photograph: Nariman El-Mofty/APJustice narratives were increasingly becoming accepted in climate and environmental campaigning. But the converse was also happening, with justice-oriented groups increasingly tackling climate and environmental issues.And so it was that War On Want, the trade union-backed anti-poverty campaign, in 2017 appointed Rehman as director. “I was able to bring another part of that coalition together into that space, writing the same story, but with slightly different actors.” It was here that he worked until this summer, when Friends of the Earth announced it wanted him back, this time as the boss.Shortly after news of Rehman’s appointment broke, the UK environment movement’s political wing chose its new leader. The election ofZack Polanskias the leader of the Greens marked a significant leftward shift for the party.Hours before Rehman spoke at September’s Make Them Pay demo, Polanski was leading protesters in a march down Regent Street in central London. “I think Rehman’s phenomenal,” Polanski said. “He’s been a keen voice in the climate movement for a long time. Someone who’s able to speak with clarity, particularly around the global south and the deep inequality.”View image in fullscreenRehman speaking to striking McDonald’s employees in London in 2021.Photograph: PjrNews/AlamyOthers among the crowd, including some who had worked with Rehman, had more nuanced views about his suitability for the role. “Asad is very principled and committed,” said one former colleague. “But he is a campaigner, not an organiser. He’s very good at saying the right things, and getting people fired up, but he’s not really about the hands-on organisation.“That said, I have not met anyone who is able to bring together the economic and climate justice messages so well, so if anyone is going to take this job, I would want it to be him.”And it is organising that is at the heart of Rehman’s intentions for Friends of the Earth. His vision is to mobilise and grow the organisation’s significant local network, building on its environmental base into broader community organising.“We have over 230 local groups – that makes us an incredible force,” he says. “We were responsible for the climate bill, for the first Climate Change Act in the whole world. We’ve been responsible for winning transformative solutions. We led the fight against fracking.“Now we have to lead the fight again. For a new story, a story that connects climate and inequality, that tackles the far right by recognising we have millions of people in this country who have been left behind. We’re being offered nothing but division and hatred. We have to provide an answer for them. Friends of the Earth is going to be in the forefront of that.”Explore more on these topicsFriends of the EarthClimate crisisClimate financeZack PolanskiprofilesShareReuse this content"

How to beat impostor syndromeDo you struggle to take a compliment? Cringe at your own achievements? From celebrating your wins to embracing your failures, these top tips will help you banish self-doubtKate WillsFri 3 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 12.51 EDTShareFake it till you make it, the saying goes. But what happens when you’ve “made it” but still feel like a total fraud? The term “impostor phenomenon” was coined in 1978 by American psychologists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes, who noticed their female students and therapy patients were full of doubt about their abilities. A 2021 survey found thatup to 82%of people have experienced what’s become known as impostor syndrome – that nagging feeling that you’ve tricked everyone into thinking you know what you’re doing.“Impostor syndrome is incredibly common among my clients,” says psychologistDr Jessamy Hibberd, author of The Imposter Cure. “It seems to be worse among high-achieving, very competent people who are outwardly very successful and experienced.” Indeed, Michelle Obama, David Bowie and Maya Angelou have all spoken about feeling as if they didn’t deserve their success.Hibberd says it’s not just at work that people can feel like impostors: parenting, relationships and social media can all bring on feelings of inadequacy and a deep fear of getting found out. Impostor syndrome can lead to anxiety and depression, interfere with our ability to take risks, and make it harder to progress.So what should you do if you can’t shake the feeling that you’re only a poorly worded email away from being fired? How can you overcome the fear that one bad day means everything will fall apart? We asked the experts for their tips on how to beat feelings of self-doubt for good.Track your fears“People with impostor syndrome often predict the worst-case scenario happening, and will turn down opportunities as they believe things could go wrong and then they’ll get found out,” says Hibberd. “I recently had this myself, when I tried to talk myself out of a public speaking engagement because I was nervous it would go badly.”To overcome this, Hibberd encourages her clients to write down their anxious predictions and then track what actually happens – something she does herself. “When you start doing this you realise that the worst doesn’t happen, in fact things normally go positively,” she says. “You grow in trust and confidence as you realise it’s just your impostor brain talking, it’s not realistic. The next time I’m asked to give a talk and I feel nervous, I can look back and remember that I’ve felt this way before, but also I’ll be able to track how pleased I felt afterwards.”Swim in the unknown“Those of us who feel like impostors often have a belief that we always have to be the expert or have all our ducks in a row,” says business coach and therapistAmanda Brenkley. “When in fact, coming from a place of not knowing is a superpower, not a weakness.”It is possible, says Brenkley, to train the brain to be comfortable with uncertainty and to enjoy swimming in the unknown. “You don’t have to come in all guns blazing, knowing everything,” she says. “Remind yourself that it’s perfectly OK to say ‘I don’t know’; it’s good to ask questions; it can feel empowering to ask for help. Actually, you might find that people respond better to the curious learner, rather than the know-it-all expert.”Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman embraced this philosophy, breaking down new and complex ideas in what he called his Notebook of Things I Don’t Know About, a technique that became known as the Feynman Method. Normalise that you’ll never know everything, and that it’s OK. Maybe even start your own notebook.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Getty Images/iStockphotoCelebrate your wins“Those with impostor syndrome tend to be very hard on themselves when things don’t go well and belittle any success they have,” says Hibberd. “When things go right, they’ll say ‘I was just lucky’ or ‘I had a good team’, which is why they never feel good enough and feel disconnected from their accomplishments.”To combat this, Hibberd asks her clients to write down three things they’ve done well every day. “I ask them to read them out in our sessions and they find it incredibly hard at first,” she says. “They’ll say, ‘Oh I forgot to do it,’ or visibly squirm as they read it to me. People are much more comfortable replaying the things they’ve been unhappy with. But over time, celebrating wins like this feels more natural, and you can even up the negative thoughts with positive ones.”Create an impostor-busting CV“I ask clients to write a big list of their achievements or create a big CV of everything they’ve done and keep adding to it all the time,” says life coachAsh Ambirge, author of The Middle Finger Project: Trash Your Imposter Syndrome and Live the Unf*ckwithable Life You Deserve. “I tell them to imagine they’re making this for someone who’s not in their industry. Many of the amazing things they’ve done they’ve never written down or said out loud.”Ambirge then gets clients to take a step back and imagine they were reading about this person as if it wasn’t them. “I ask them, ‘How would you feel if you heard about someone who’d done all these things?’ and ‘What would your 16-year-old self feel about the person who’d achieved all this?’ Sometimes just seeing your accomplishments on paper is enough to make you stop feeling like a fraud and start feeling like a badass.”Learn to take a compliment“Those struggling with impostor syndrome find it particularly hard to take and remember compliments, and they gloss over successes,” says Hibberd. “We have to learn to take credit when it’s due. This can feel uncomfortable or unnatural at first – try starting by simply saying ‘Thank you’ when someone pays you a compliment or gives you credit.”The next step is to start paying yourself compliments. “Remember to tell yourself when you believe you have done well,” says Hibberd. “Then you can begin to tell others about the things you have done well, achieved or learned.”Embrace your failures“There’s a tendency these days – especially online – to only share the best bits of our jobs or our families and friendships, and that can make impostor syndrome feel even worse, as it seems like everyone else has got it all figured out,” says Brenkley. “We’re very good at pretending things are effortless, but we don’t share the feelings of nerves or inadequacy along the way, or all the hard work that’s gone into an end result.”Brenkley says that by embracing our failures and mistakes– by sharing our pitfalls, and even rewarding ourselves and others for the learning opportunity – feelings of being inadequate or a fraud no longer feel like something we have to hide. “Growth and discomfort are a circle, not a straight line, and no one gets it right 100% of the time.”Find your threadFor many people, impostor syndrome strikes when we’re trying something new, putting ourselves in a different context, or getting out of our comfort zone. Ambirge says that’s when it’s important to reflect on what your “secret sauce” is – your USP, which translates across many different areas of your life and your interests.“If you’re starting something different, it’s easy to feel out of your depth or like you don’t know what you’re doing,” she says. “But actually, if you look back at what you’ve done in the past, you’ll probably be able to trace some commonalities or a theme, for example it could be creativity, or helping people find their purpose, or even just being inquisitive.If you map out your life so far, the path may seem jagged, but there will be a thread between your previous experience and this new interest or project. Sometimes, that’s all it takes to make you realise that you’re not a fraud trying to fool everyone. Everything you’ve done before is an advantage, and you do have valuable skills. Now you’re just applying them to a different setting.”Own up to your impostor syndrome …“Part of the power of impostor syndrome is that it feels like a private shame,” says Hibberd. “But by being open about how you’re feeling, you can start to bring the different parts of yourself together.”Hibberd advises talking to friends and trusted colleagues about the mistakes you feel you’ve made or – even better – the fears you have about mistakes you might make in the future.“Revealing our insecurities and admitting our struggles to others can help give us better perspective on the way we talk to ourselves,” she says. “You might find that if you talk about how you feel, you’ll notice how many other people in your life feel exactly the same way sometimes, and that can be very healing.”… but don’t cling on to it“Sometimes people have lived with their impostor syndrome for so long, they have convinced themselves that it’s actually a positive trait,” says Ambirge. “They might think it’s a way of ensuring that they stay humble and don’t become arrogant. They also think that if you underestimate yourself, you will be motivated to improve – it makes you work harder, aim higher, stops you getting big-headed or complacent, and will protect you if everything goes wrong.“They feel like not thinking these impostor thoughts will somehow jinx them, and it feels too risky to try another way,” she says. “But acknowledging your own skills, knowledge and experience is not arrogance. Impostor syndrome isn’t helping you – it’s holding you back.”Additional reporting by Zahra OnsoriExplore more on these topicsLife and styleWork & careersHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He faced calls of “shame on you”, “go to Palestine, leave us alone” and “you have blood on your hands”.Police named the two dead men as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Relatives of Cravitz said he was a “gentle giant” who “would never harm a fly”. A Muslim neighbour of Daulby described him as “one of the most fantastic men I ever knew in my life”.Rabbi Daniel Walker, who was leading a service at the synagogue at the time of the attack, told how the attacker shouted “I’m going to get you” as he tried to force his way in.Also on Friday night, three more people – a man and two women aged between 18 and their mid-40s – were arrested, bringing the total held on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism to six.Counter-terrorism police and security services are working to piece together the background of the attacker, who is believed to have chosen the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, to target worshippers.The Guardian has been told that Shamie had not been referred to the anti-radicalisation scheme Prevent.It is not known when exactly the alleged rape took place but at the time of the synagogue attack Shamie was on bail while under investigation by Greater Manchester police.One source said Shamie had criminal convictions for lesser offences not related to terrorism.“He was on nobody’s radar for terrorism but he definitely had a criminal record, though nothing to suggest he was going to do anything like this,” said a source.Police are examining whether Shamie, who was granted British citizenship in 2006 when he was around the age of 16, was responsible for a death threat sent to a former Conservative MP in 2012. The email to John Howell came from someone calling themselves “Jihad Alshamie” and said: “It is people like you who deserve to die.”Howell, who stood down as MP for Henley in 2024, said he did not know if it was the same person and he did not feel the police had taken the death threat seriously enough at the time.A news report from 2012 said Howell was believed to have been targeted over his support for Israel. “The last thing I want to appear as is a drama queen, but you have to take seriously a threat when it says ‘I would like to see you dead,’” Howell said in 2012, in remarks reported by the Jerusalem Post.“It is not just a question of me, it is my family and my staff. All it takes is one person out there who is weird enough, with a distorted view of life, to make an attempt to carry this out.” He said Thames Valley police had provided him with “extremely good security advice”.Police have not confirmed whether the “Jihad Alshamie” who messaged Howell was the same person who carried out the synagogue attack but they are looking into whether there is a link.The attacker’s father, Faraj al-Shamie, described Thursday’s terror attack as a “heinous act, which targeted peaceful, innocent civilians” in a statement in which he said his family wished to “fully distance” themselves from the atrocity.It was later reported that Faraj al-Shamie – who has worked as an emergency trauma surgeon for several non-governmental organisations in conflict zones including South Sudan, Afghanistan and Mali – had previously posted on his Facebook page in support of the 7 October attacks on Israel, claiming they had been perpetrated by “men of God on Earth” and describing the attacks as a “miracle by all standards”.Keir Starmer visited Manchester with his wife and offered “a very humble thank you” to the emergency services, but the response of the armed officers at the scene on Thursday is set to be under the spotlight.On Friday morning the Greater Manchester police chief constable, Stephen Watson, issued a statement saying a Home Office pathologist had provisionally determined that one of the victims died of a gunshot wound.One of three people receiving treatment in hospital for serious injuries is also said to have received such an injury, leading to the conclusion that both were close together keeping the synagogue door shut to the attacker when officers opened fire.Watson said: “It is currently believed that the suspect, Jihad al-Shamie, was not in possession of a firearm and the only shots fired were from GMP’s authorised firearms officers as they worked to prevent the offender from entering the synagogue and causing further harm to our Jewish community.“It follows therefore that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end …“We have also been advised by medical professionals that one of the three victims currently receiving treatment in hospital has also suffered a gunshot wound, which is mercifully not life-threatening.“It is believed that both victims were close together behind the synagogue door as worshippers acted bravely to prevent the attacker from gaining entry.”At a vigil close to the synagogue, Lammy, who was appointed deputy prime minister last month, told a crowd that the country “stood in solidarity with the Jewish people, because an attack like this is never felt alone”, but he received a hostile reception from the start of his address.As he began with the word “friends”, there were scoffs and laughter and a cry was heard of “stop the marches”. Lammy had to pause several times as the shouting continued.Joanne Sheldon, 61, from Radcliffe, Bury, said she turned her back when Lammy began to speak. She said: “We didn’t know he would be speaking here and when we found out we just thought: why is he here? Jewish people don’t feel it’s safe in Britain now.”Her friend Hayley Lawson, 49, said hatred was being stirred up by pro-Palestine marches.Ahead of a planned demonstration against the ban on Palestine Action this Saturday, Starmer wrote in the Jewish Chronicle that protesters should recognise that this was a time of mourning.“Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy – and there is justified concern about the suffering in Gaza – but a minority have used these protests as a pretext for stoking antisemitic tropes,” he wrote.Walker, the rabbi, spoke of the shocking moment the attacker attempted to force his way inside the building.He described the “very, very brave men” who helped him hold the doors as the attacker repeatedly tried to get inside while brandishing a knife and shouting threats.He told ITV: “When I first arrived at the synagogue there was some kind of incident outside the gates. Someone behaving suspiciously and aggressively.“Half an hour into the prayers I heard an almighty bang from outside, shouting. Someone was trying to get in with a knife. When he tried to get inside the synagogue, there was a large number of us trying to hold him off.”Walker became emotional as he recounted the abuse shouted by the attacker as he tried to get inside.Explore more on these topicsManchesterGreater ManchesterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The officer has since been bailed and suspended from duty.A force spokesperson said: “The allegation relates to an incident that took place at Charing Cross police station on 2 October and is linked to matters disclosed in BBC Panorama.“The investigation is ongoing so it would not be appropriate to go into further detail at this time.“The Independent Office forPoliceConduct, which is independently investigating allegations in relation to Charing Cross, has been informed.”Deputy assistant commissioner Andy Valentine said: “We have been extremely clear we will be unrelenting in our approach to tackling issues at Charing Cross, and anywhere else across the Met.“This fresh matter came to light through our internal reporting mechanisms and we continue to encourage and support all our officers and staff to report allegations of criminal and misconduct behaviour so we can act swiftly.“Professional standards officers immediately acted to make the arrest and the officer has been suspended from duty.“We will not hesitate to take rapid action around any further allegations, as part of our deeper probe into corruption and ridding the Met of those who are not fit to serve the people of London.”Reacting to the documentary earlier this week, Keir Starmer said: “I’ve not yet seen the footage, but I’ve had it described to me, and it’s shocking, and I’m glad the commissioner is responding. He needs to be very robust in his response.”The Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, said people in London could trust the “vast majority” of its officers, and added he was “horrified” by the documentary.Nine serving officers, one former officer and one detention officer are under investigation for gross misconduct by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.Allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour.The documentary footage shows one officer, PC Phil Neilson, referring to an immigrant who had overstayed his visa, saying: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him. And the ones that shag women, rape women, you do the cock and let them bleed out.”While drinking at a pub off-duty, he also told undercover reporter Rory Bibb that Algerians and Somalians are “scum”, and claimed there was an “invasion” of the UK by migrants.Another officer, PC Martin Borg, bragged about a colleague stamping on a detainee’s leg and laughed about the suspect screaming.He also appeared to say he offered to fill in a false witness statement about the incident.Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeLondonPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain.”However, those protesting against the ban onPalestine Actionhave said cancelling Saturday’s event would “let terror win”, amid pressure from police and the government to call it off after the attack in Manchester.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood,added her voice on Fridayto calls to postpone the event, after police said they wanted to be able to focus their resources on protecting Jewish and Muslim communities. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Mark Rowley, said that continuing protests after the attack “will likely create further tensions and some might say lacks sensitivity”.The organisers, Defend Our Juries, said in a statement on Friday that supporters, including many Jewish people, wanted the protest to go ahead. It expected 1,500 people, including priests, vicars, pensioners and others, to take part in the event, which would involve them peacefully sitting holding cardboard signs saying “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action”.More than 1,600 people have been arrested at a series of protests in London and elsewhere since the proscription of Palestine Actioncame into effect on 5 July.“Our thoughts are with everyone who has lost loved ones in the horrific attack on Heaton Park synagogue and we stand in solidarity with the Jewish community across the UK,” Defend Our Juries said in a statement on Friday.It added: “Many Jewish supporters of Defend Our Juries have warned that postponing tomorrow’s action would risk conflating the actions of the state of Israel with Jewish people around the world, as [Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks to do – who bear no responsibility for Israel’s crimes, which could fuel antisemitic hatred and prejudice.“It couldn’t be clearer that tomorrow’s action – which is in Trafalgar Square and not near any synagogue – is about defying the government’s absurdly authoritarian proscription of Palestine Action and the government’s complicity in the genocide being committed by the Israeli government.”Defend Our Juries reiterated its condemnation of the attack and urged the police “to prioritise protecting the community, instead of arresting entirely peaceful protesters”.“Cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win. It’s more important than ever to defend our democracy, including our fundamental rights to peaceful protest and freedom of speech, and to take a stand tomorrow against killing and against oppression, and for peace and justice for all,” it added.Rowley accused Defend Our Juries of “drawing valuable resources away from the communities ofLondonat a time when they are needed most”.“People have been debating for the last two years whether pro-Palestinian protests are simply a call for peace, or have an implicit intention to stir up antisemitism,” said Rowley. “Continuing such protests within hours of Thursday’s awful terrorist murder of British Jews, when communities are most fearful, will likely create further tensions and some might say lacks sensitivity.”Rowley said the Met would call in support from forces across the UK to ensure it could arrest all those breaking the law in support of Palestine Action, while the police also provided protection to communities. Additional resources will be deployed in the vicinity of mosques and in communities with larger Muslim populations.He added: “Some may ask why we do not ban the protest, but there is no power in law for us to do so. Nor is there even the possibility for us to apply to the home secretary to ban static assemblies in the way there is – in very limited circumstances – for protest marches.”However, the government-appointed official reviewer of terrorism legislation has told the Guardian that police should be given greater power to seek bans on political marches in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack.Jonathan Hall KC said the power should only be used to spare police resources, which would be under huge strain after an attack. Hall said: “If there is an urgent case where police need resources to deal with the aftermath of a terrorist attack, I am surprised there is no power to ban a march or assembly in these specific circumstances.”He emphasised any ban should be temporary and be justified because police resources were needed elsewhere, such as investigating an attack or to provide extra patrols.The Met has complained that having to police constant protests since the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel had placed it under significant strain.Speaking about pro-Palestinian protests that went ahead on Thursday, Mahmood said in an interview on BBC Radio 4: “I was very disappointed to see those protests going ahead last night. I think that behaviour is fundamentally un-British. I think it is dishonourable. I would have wanted those individuals to just take a step back.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionShabana MahmoodKeir StarmerMetropolitan policeLondonPoliceProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday, the company wasordered to pay back£122m to the government after it was found to have breached a contract to supply surgical gowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.The judge concluded that PPE Medpro had not complied with the legal and regulatory requirements to ensure the gowns, manufactured in China, were certified and validated to be sterile.In a statement, the company, which was ultimately owned by Mone’s husband, Doug Barrowman, claimed the couple had been made “scapegoats” for the then Conservative government’soverspending on PPE during the pandemic.Mone and Barrowman for yearspublicly denied through their lawyersthat they were involved in PPE Medpro, until in December 2023 they confirmed their involvement and Barrowman said he was the company’s ultimate beneficial owner.Several senior politicianshave called for Mone to relinquish her peeragefollowing the high court judgment, including Badenoch and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor.Badenoch told BBC local radio on Thursday that Mone had brought “embarrassment and shame to the party”, and should have the “book thrown at her”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farage has long been a critic of the ECHR and has pledged to leave it if he becomes prime minister.Badenoch said on Friday night that she had “not come to this decision lightly, but it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans and our citizens”.Critics of the ECHR claim it frustrates the government’s efforts to deal with illegal migration and deport foreign criminals.Others argue that pulling out of the treaty would damage the UK’s international reputation and breach the Good Friday agreement, which brought an end to decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Russia and Belarus are the only two European countries that are not signatories.Badenoch’s decision follows the conclusion of a months-long review by David Wolfson, the shadow attorney general, which found that the treaty “places significant constraints on the government” across a range of areas, including border control.Lord Wolfson, a commercial barrister, deemed other options, such as renegotiating or derogating from the treaty, “either unrealistic or ineffective”.He argued that leaving it was compatible with the Good Friday agreement and the Windsor framework negotiated by Rishi Sunak to ease post-Brexit trading arrangements.Badenoch’s announcement, which the Guardianreported on Thursdaywas coming, was made after the shadow cabinet met to sign off the policy.The Conservative party said: “Unlike Reform UK, who have made slapdash announcements with no consideration of the implications and no plan to deliver behind them, theConservativeshave done the serious work to explore the legal and practical considerations necessary to leave the ECHR in an orderly manner.”The ECHR was established in 1950 and sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries of the Council of Europe. It is a central part of UK human rights law and has been used to halt attempts to deport people who are deemed to be in the UK illegally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Badenoch argued that leaving the ECHR would not solve the UK’s problems, while Jenrick said his party would “die” if it argued to stay in.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochEuropean court of human rightsConservativesHuman rightsImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

He would now move on to the second phase of treatment.In a statement, he said: “Early this year I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. The good news is I’m responding really well to treatment, which meant I could be part of this incredible tour.“Now, I am having to take a planned break for the next phase of my care, so I’ll be missing the gigs in Seoul, Tokyo, Melbourne and Sydney. I’m really sad to be missing these shows but I’m feeling good and will be back ready to go in time for South America.“Have an amazing time if you’re going this month and I’ll see you back onstage with the band in November.”The Seoul show is scheduled for 21 October, followed by Tokyo (25-26 October), Melbourne (31 October, 1 and 4 November) and Sydney (7-8 November).In 2022, Arthurs revealed he had been diagnosed with tonsil cancer.He wrote then: “Just to let you all know I’m going to be taking a break from playing for a while. I have been diagnosed with tonsil cancer. But the good news is it’s treatable and I will be starting a course of treatment soon. I will keep you posted how it is going.”Arthurs was a member of the band the Rain with Liam Gallagher in the early 1990s before they recruited the singer’s brother, Noel, who later insisted they change their name.Arthurs recorded three albums with the group, including the era-defining Definitely Maybe and (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, before leaving in 1999 during the recording of the fourth album, Standing on the Shoulder of Giants.He joined Liam Gallagher’s bandBeady Eye, from 2013-14, and has frequently played live with Liam during the latter’s solo career, most recently at the Reading and Leeds festivals in 2021. He also formed the group Parlour Flames, and worked as a radio DJ after his time with Oasis.Explore more on these topicsOasisEnglandCancernewsShareReuse this content"

Hyacinth was a variation on the traditional stage battleaxe, with oddly sympathetic undertones, as when Routledge, riffling the net curtains, would cut across the horror of a new man staying next door with an aghast cry of, “We’ll have to move!” Clive Swift as her supine husband would grin and bear it and even suggest a delighted astonishment at her outbursts.In her second big BBC series, Hetty Wainthropp Investigates (1996-98), based on characters in aDavid Cooknovel, Routledge was paired with another meek spouse (Derek Benfield), while operating as a private detective, a Lancastrian Miss Marple, in tandem with a young assistant (Dominic Monaghan) she had saved from delinquency; here was the softer side of the actor, fuelled by an enthusiasm for social justice and a refusal to accept she was “past it”.Still, like her fellow damesThora HirdandMaggie Smith, she found subtler, sharper strings in her bow when performing the work of Alan Bennett. A solo turn as a clerical busybody exchanging her office for a cancer ward in A Woman of No Importance (1982) was a precursor to the author’s two series of Talking Heads (1988, 1998) in which she was blindingly good as both a serial letter-writer whose false and chatty accusations of child abuse land her in prison, and a department store clerk in soft furnishings whose affection for her podiatrist blossoms into foot fetishism.View image in fullscreenRoutledge with Prunella Scales in Alan Bennett’s Doris and Doreen, televised on ITV in 1978 – one of her many collaborations with Bennett.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockAlways superb in the high comedy of Richard Sheridan and Oscar Wilde – she was a resplendent Lady Bracknellat the Savoyin 2001, stately as a galleon and firing on all cylinders in a hat sprouting black feathers – she began her theatrical career in musical comedy and had a leading role on Broadway as early as 1968.That Broadway show, Darling of the Day, was an Edwardian snapshot of art dealers and pub crawlers. Routledge won alove letter of a reviewfrom Walter Kerr in the New York Times and a Tony award; she was an ebullient Putney widow who “kicks up her heels with a bunch of the boys” and marries the hero, played by an insecure Vincent Price in his one and only Broadway appearance. But the show closed after 31 performances, and the new musical which a thoroughly smittenRichard Rodgerssaid he would write for her never materialised. She returned home to the Chichester Festival theatre season of 1969.Routledge, born in Higher Tranmere, Birkenhead, Merseyside, was the second child of Isaac Edgar Routledge, a gentleman’s outfitter and haberdasher, and his wife, Catherine (nee Perry). She was educated at Birkenhead high school and Liverpool University. She took a degree in English in 1951, intending to become a teacher. But music was also a passion. The full, rich contralto voice she developed had started at Saturday morning lessons with a Miss Sleigh at the upright Steinway piano she possessed for the rest of her life.She played Hippolyta in A Midsummer Night’s Dream at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1952, signed up at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school in 1953 and went into rep in Guildford, Worthing and Windsor. Her London debut, at the Westminster theatre in 1954, was in a musical comedy rewrite of Sheridan’s The Duenna. Over the next 10 years she established her London profile in various revues and musicals, notably in the title role of an off-Broadway operetta spoof, Little Mary Sunshine, at the Comedy theatre in 1962, and in a 1963 musical version of John Vanbrugh’s The Relapse, Virtue in Danger, at the Mermaid (and the Strand). Lord Foppington in that musical was played byJohn Moffatt, and she paired with him again in the Mermaid’s delightful Noël Coward mélange Cowardy Custard (1972), co-devised and directed byAlan Strachan.She enjoyed another brilliant partnership with Alastair Sim in two Arthur Wing Pinero classics, The Magistrate (Chichester and the Cambridge theatre, 1969) and Dandy Dick (Chichester and the Garrick, 1973). Here again, opposite the visibly crushed and simpering Sim, she was a strong woman, to put it mildly.Her first television appearance had been in 1954 and she even popped up in five episodes of Coronation Street in 1961, as the cafe owner Sylvia Snape. Before her TV ascendancy, she was a notable Dickensian in the mid-1970s as Mrs Micawber in David Copperfield, with David Yelland, Martin Jarvis and Arthur Lowe, and as the buxom dress designer Madame Mantalini in Nicholas Nickleby led by Nigel Havers.Her films belonged exclusively to the 60s, and included To Sir, With Love (1967), The Bliss of Mrs Blossom (1968), starring Shirley MacLaine, and 30 is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia (1968) with her comedy peersDudley Moore,John BirdandJohn Wells.In the 80s she was a monologist not only for Bennett but alsoVictoria Woodin the series Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV (1985-86), opening an address as a self-righteous spinster from Cheadle with, “Hello, I’m Kitty. I’ve given gallons of blood and I can’t stomach whelks.” And in the theatre she was an unforgettable member of the directorMichael Blakemore’s crack ensemble in Michael Frayn’s Noises Off (1982), as Dotty Otley, the TV star and principal investor in the disastrous play-within-a-play.She then joined the Royal Shakespeare Company for just one Stratford-upon-Avon and London season (1984-85) as an embittered “hag in a Lancastrian flag”, Queen Margaret, inAntony Sher’s Richard III, a role in which, “a living ghost of battles long ago and lost … she stretched her remarkable range,” said Michael Ratcliffe in the Observer.Routledge won an Olivier award to sit alongside the Tony as the Old Lady (with one buttock) inJonathan Miller’s revival of Leonard Bernstein’s Candide for the Old Vic and Scottish Opera in 1988. In this muted, stylish production, she showed her class in her solo turn and tango, I Am Easily Assimilated.View image in fullscreenRoutledge with Sarah Kants and Theo Fraser Steele in The Importance of Being Earnest at the Savoy theatre, 2001.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs Nettie Fowler, she graced Nicholas Hytner’s landmark National Theatre revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Carousel in 1992, leading the exuberant charge in June is Bustin’ Out All Over, stealing comically recuperative breathers, and giving glorious voice to You’ll Never Walk Alone while stripping the anthem of its well-worn banality.Just before Carousel, she teamed with Bennett in a staging of three Talking Heads at the Comedy, and reanimated two of his early television plays inOffice Suiteat Chichester in 2007. She performed several other solo shows in her later years, including the story of Dame Myra Hess and her wartime concerts in the National Gallery in Admission: One Shilling. She made her last major stage appearance in 2014, aged 85, as a slightly subdued Lady Markby in Wilde’sAn Ideal Husband– where else but in Chichester.She was appointed OBE in 1993, advanced to CBE in 2004, and was made a dame in 2017.Routledge lived in West Sussex. Although she admitted to being in love once or twice, and to having had an affair with one of her (married) stage directors, she was happy in later years with the companionship of the theatrical agent Patricia Marmont. Marmont died in 2020, and Routledge’s brother, Graham, also predeceased her.Katherine Patricia Routledge, actor, born 17 February 1929; died 3 October 2025Dames, snobs and gumshoes: Patricia Routledge – a life in picturesRead moreExplore more on these topicsTelevisionPatricia RoutledgeActingobituariesShareReuse this content"

Until Israel’s recent forced displacement order he lived in the ruins of his former home with his parents and brothers. He has now been displaced by the war 13 times and survived an Israeli strike in Rafah. He kept a diary for the Guardian over the past month.17 August 2025After two years, I’ve lost all hope. I don’t believe the news about [US President Donald] Trump ending the war. My father says we should move to Deir al-Balah in the south soon, before they force us out again. If it were anyone else, the UN would have stepped in. But for us, nothing. Now they talk about sending us to South Sudan – a country racked by civil war, already full of displaced people. There are 2 million of us, trapped in less than 20 sq km, just waiting to die slowly. And the world will shrug. [Former Israeli prime minister] Golda Meir once said: “[W]e will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons.” That says it all. Sometimes, I think Israel should be studied by psychologists – maybe then the world would finally understand the madness we live under.My life in Gaza: ‘Do you know the series Squid Game?’Read more18 August 2025I caught a ride to Deir al-Balah with a friend – it felt like an act of daring: cars altered to carry extra people, trailers clinging on like lifeboats. You hold on with everything you have, because if you don’t, you could fall into the open road and be lost.View image in fullscreenPalestinians flee Gaza City along Rashid Street towards the south of the territory.Photograph: Hassan Jedi/Anadolu/Getty ImagesNear al-Nabulsi Square I saw a “hizam nari” – a ribbon of fire across the sky. Fighter jets carved a line of explosions above Gaza City, one after another; ash clouds rose and everything below them was erased. I counted five, six rockets – then stopped counting because counting felt useless. I have to find shelter for my family – an apartment, a garage, any small place. My mind keeps slipping, I forget things, I forget plans – the chaos steals them. All I feel is a tight, small panic and the hollow hope that we will still be here the next day.19 August 2025Yesterday, I finally managed to get a garage – 1,500 shekels, about £335 a month. That’s the cheapest you can find, because demand is high while houses and buildings are bombed to the ground. This “garage” has almost no roof. The landlord even offered me a tiny apartment for 2,500 shekels – honestly, not even a flat in Dubai costs that much. In wars and crises people become more aggressive, more selfish, eager to profit from others’ misery. And maybe that’s “normal”, or rather the expected behaviour of someone who has lived through two years of forced displacement, expulsion, famine – especially inside the world’s largest prison.View image in fullscreenPalestinians rush to escape the missiles fired by Israeli warplanes on the tents of displaced Palestinians in Deir al-Balah.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesSo I began setting up my new home – cleaning, arranging, trying to make it livable. I cannot allow myself even a second to think about my old room before the genocide, my box-spring bed, my gaming desk, the air conditioner, our house … I cannot let nostalgia take over. I just keep moving. Forward, forward – never looking back.28 August 2025For a week now I’ve been without my parents. Despite what my father said initially, they cling to hope – or to denial – believing that all the back-and-forth between the Qataris, Americans, Egyptians and Israelis meansGazaCity won’t be evacuated. So they refuse to leave. For two years the world has done as it pleases while we drown, and we clutch at the smallest, most obvious lies – the little straws that keep us breathing. The cruel truth is the Israelis were never coy about their aims: “We will destroy Gaza.” They did. “We will resettle you.” They did. “We will cut off food and water.” They did. “We will enter Rafah.” All eyes turned there. [US President Joe] Biden said no – they did it anyway. What comes next? Gaza City, my home. It will be emptied, become a wasteland like Rafah. I’m stealing a few quiet days now – a brief, fragile peace I’ve earned.View image in fullscreenA camp for displaced Palestinians stretches among the ruins of buildings destroyed by Israeli bombardments in the west of Gaza City.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/AP9 September 2025My parents are finally with me. We turned the garage into a home – rooms, a little private space. Of course the walls are just plastic tarpaulins. I managed to get online for a moment. It has come to this: the IDFhas issued a forced displacement orderfor all of Gaza City, including the western part. People have no energy, no money, no will to leave their homes – many would rather die than go out.This afternoon our neighbour told us theIsraelis even bombed Qatar. OMG. They have no limits any more. Qatar – with the largest American military base in the Middle East – was reportedly hit by a power allied with the US. I think it’s clear what comes next and what it means for Gaza’s people: genocide until the last breath. They’ve been given carte blanche.View image in fullscreenPalestinians living in a tent camp on the beach in Deir al-Balah cool off in the Mediterranean.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP15 September 2025My mother’s birthday – another quiet celebration under inhuman circumstances. Things have eased a little, but this is not the life we were meant to live. My phone showed me photos from her birthday in 2022: a homemade cake and my favourite New York cheesecake. I remember giving her Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell – we burned it for bread at the end of 2023 because we had no gas or wood to bake. What would Orwell think of us now? I like to imagine he’d forgive us. I wiped my tears in secret and kept going. Deir al-Balah is getting fuller and fuller. People are exhausted: they don’t want to die, but many feel they already have.I held my mother’s hand, kissed it, and whispered “Happy birthday”. She has been sick for days. I wrote her a letter and apologised because I don’t have a single cent for a cake (which would cost about $70) or even a small gift.21 September 2025Countries like the UK and Australiahave recognised Palestine as a state– why now and to what end? Israel continues to bomb us, the genocide goes on. But now we can officially die as Palestinian people, we have a state. How nice.After all this suffering, so many countries that have denied for nearly two years that the systematic destruction of a population was taking place in Gaza are suddenly speaking up. Actors, singers and others join in because it’s become mainstream. Before, people would shrug and say, “Oh no, I don’t know enough about the Middle East, it’s too sensitive for me to comment.” Hypocrites.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian child waits patiently in the queue for water at a charity distribution point in western Deir al-Balah.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Shutterstock25 September 2025Same cruel routine, day after day – people die from hunger, from weakness, from the rockets that never stop. A man not far from us died recently. At first I thought it must have been the usual horror – a raid, a stray bullet. But no. He simply collapsed. His heart stopped. I still can’t believe how ordinary his death felt, how quickly a life can vanish and leave only a hollow silence. I was stunned, like I’d been anaesthetised to this kind of loss and suddenly woke up.My day is a map of survival: fetch water, scavenge for firewood, bake bread that barely fills a stomach. In the little time left, I search for scholarships – a small hope, it might be the only way out of this prison. But they ask for English tests; they know there are no test centres here. Online exams? Impossible: no stable internet, no valid passports to verify our identity. How can we prove who we are when the world has destroyed our papers and our connections?I am tired to my bones.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Minutes before he spoke, Keir Starmer had visited the synagogue, but Xander was not impressed.“Most of the people I’ve spoken to have believed that he’s Neville Chamberlain 2.0. He’s trying to appease everyone on every side of the political spectrum and unfortunately all it’s doing is alienating everyone.“I worry that the result is that we’ll then get, come the next election, a much more extremist party in power.“We’ve got Muslim neighbours who we’re concerned about who came over to us to check how we were doing. But with the way we’ve got the news cycle set up, with the advent of social media it’s a push for engagement – and the main thing that gets that engagement is anger and fear … and the idea that your neighbours are trying to kill you. I think until we deal with that as a society these things are going to keep happening.”Hours later, a short distance away at a vigil near the synagogue, a crowd booed and heckled the deputy prime minister, David Lammy, shouting: “Stop the marches!”View image in fullscreenThe deputy prime minister, David Lammy, was heckled as he addressed the vigil.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianLammy told the crowd that the country stood “in solidarity with the Jewish people, because an attack like this is never felt alone” but he received a hostile reception as he began his address.In the aftermath of tragedy this vibrant, but unassuming neighbourhood had the eyes of the world on it, with media from across the UK, the US, Australia, Japan and Israel.The chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, who had earlier said the attack marked a “very dark time” for Jewish people, and the president of the Board of Deputies, Phil Rosenberg, came to comfort their people.The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, expressed his sorrow. And on a stage in torrential rain, Rabbi Daniel Walker, whose synagogue was targeted, paid tribute to the “heroes of Heaton Park shul”, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, as the crowd cheered and applauded the emergency services and the Community Security Trust.For years, Cravitz worked at Halperns, a kosher supermarket close to Manchester’s border with Salford, at the heart of the Orthodox Jewish community.“Everybody that knew Melvin loved him to bits,” Uri said nearby. “He was never on time for shul. But on the day he was killed he was.”The crowd, packed tightly at the vigil, like the shoppers picking up groceries at Halpern’s, showed a community determined to carry on as normal; as normal as life could be with police outside synagogues and security patrol staff and volunteers in hi-vis jackets lining the streets, from the CST and Shomrim, the Haredi orthodox volunteer neighbourhood watch group.“I have been punched in the nose, I have had a black eye, just because I’m openly Jewish,” Abe, 34, said.View image in fullscreenAbe, 34, has decided to no longer allow his children to walk to the synagogue alone.Photograph: Chris Osuh/The GuardianHe had been putting off talking to his children about the “reality of being a Jew” for as long as he could, he said.“After 7 October, the kids said what’s happening in Israel got to do with us, thousands of miles away? I didn’t have the heart to tell them they hate us because we’re Jewish,” Abe said.After the synagogue attack, when they asked him why they could not walk home alone any more, he felt he could not put it off any longer.“We told them as Jewish people we have done nothing wrong, we’re peaceful, loving people, we would love to get on with our neighbours, but unfortunately, we’re not liked people.”Josh Aaronson, still in his pyjamas after being evacuated from his home near the synagogue, spent the night with his in-laws rather than at the local high school, which was offered as emergency accommodation.He described a scene of hope.“Last night I had a beautiful moment – one of my neighbours, Muslim, another neighbour, Christian, and myself were just hugging, saying this can’t be allowed to break our community.”It was a sentiment reflected at the vigil later, where the bishop of Manchester said: “Just the way we put our arms around each other, just the way we greet each other, just the way we take the effort to understand each other’s lives, to respect each other’s traditions. Those are the small acts of love that matter.”Rabbi Walker urged the crowd at the vigil to “strengthen your lives as Jews”, adding: “The only way to defeat darkness, the only way to defeat unholiness, is with goodness.“We did all the prayers at Yom Kippur and we continued this morning with Shabbos [the sabbath] and we’re going to continue over Shabbos.“Let it show that we are not cowards. As Jews we always rebuild, we always recover, we always return stronger and that is what we will do.”Isaac Freidlander,near Halpern’s, agreed. He said: “I grew up in a community in Stamford Hill where the Jewish community and the Muslim community are very intertwined. We live next door, we travel, we play football in the park together.View image in fullscreenIsaac Freidlander received a call from his Muslim friend in the aftermath of the attack.Photograph: Chris Osuh/The Guardian“And that’s never changed. It hasn’t changed since October 7. I have a Muslim friend. He messaged me last night apologising on behalf of, you know, a radical within his religion who’d probably use his book as an excuse.“I almost felt his embarrassment come through the message. Nothing changed. We’re going to break bread.”On Thursday, hours after the attack in Manchester, Levi Schapiro was mid-prayer during the observance of Yom Kippur at the Biala synagogue in Stamford Hill, north London, an area home to a large Orthodox Jewish community, when he was told police officers outside needed to speak to him urgently.When informed of the terrorist attack in Manchester hours earlier, that would mean tightened security and additional policing in the area, Schapiro had a dilemma, he said: “Do I tell people about it, do I not tell people about it? Obviously it could disturb the whole day. It’s a very important day for the community.”With colleagues, they decided against telling present observers and gathered the children playing in the front garden inside. When the news eventually spread, there were tears and disbelief, said Schapiro.“I think the last two years, since October 7, this was an accident waiting to happen. The question wasn’t if, the question was when,” said Schapiro, who is the founder of the Jewish Community Council, a body that represents parts of the strictly Orthodox Jewish community in Britain with more than 3,000 families.“Now is the time for unity and we must not let hatred defeat us,” he added.“It’s very painful, it’s very hard at the moment. It’s difficult times, but we must stand together stronger. We call on communities outside the Jewish community to stand in solidarity with us and stamp out antisemitism.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterGreater ManchesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The mood is febrile, with fears things could get worseByOliver LaughlandFri 3 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.45 EDTShareAt 5am on a warm September morning a small crowd of protesters assembles in the dark. They are gathering outside the Broadview immigration processing centre, a two-storey brick structure in theChicagosuburbs that has the ambience of a US outpost in a foreign war. Windows are boarded with plywood. Fences are lined with razor wire and black cloth. Masked Ice agents appear sporadically, dressed in military fatigues – tactical helmets, flak jackets and rifles.The protesters begin to heckle each time an agent turns up for work or leaves through a chainlink gate. “Quit your job!” they chant. “Take off your mask!”The centre is a focal point in the resistance to Donald Trump’s recent immigration crackdown in the city, portentously dubbedOperation Midway Blitz. It is here, following arrest, that hundreds of people targeted for deportation are brought to languish in squalid conditions before being sent to detention centres around the country.13:21How Chicago is resisting Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown - videoI expect to see civil disobedience. But the first people I meet are 22-year-old Milagros Pelayo and her sister, Yessenia Garcia, who is 16. They have been here at sunrise for the past five days, searching for information about their father, Rosalio, a janitor who was arrested by immigration officers at his home a week earlier. He is currently detained inside. “They won’t let us talk to him,” Pelayo tells me. “They won’t give us any information.”Still bleary-eyed, the siblings stand by the doorway waiting for answers – or an opportunity to say goodbye to their dad. “I thought America was the land of opportunity,” says Garcia. “But it doesn’t make any sense now.”View image in fullscreen‘They won’t let us talk to him’ … sisters Milagros Pelayo (left) and Yessenia Garcia outside Broadview, trying to find news about their father, Rosalio.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianSuddenly, things begin to unravel. About a dozen protesters start blocking government vehicles from entering and exiting the buildings. Masked agents appear from behind the fence and snatch people from the street. One young man is body-slammed and dragged inside the centre.As the sun rises, more people arrive. A dispersal order is played on repeat and immigration agents appear on the roof, looking out over a crowd of around 100 people. Two SUVs attempt to leave the building and protesters push back. The agents fire pepper ball irritants from above and teargas canisters are launched into the group. A small phalanx of officers appear, as if dressed for combat. A thick plume of gas envelopes the street. It is a remarkable and disproportionate escalation; a telling image of where the country is right now.I find Pelayo and Garcia in the aftermath. Both squint into the sun, their eyes still watering. A first experience of teargas while still in high school, for Garcia. “It was a burning sensation,” says Pelayo. “But we’re still here. We’re still fighting.”Chicago is among the handful of Democratic strongholds where Donald Trump has pledged to deploy the militaryamid false claims of rising crime. A mere mention of the city on rightwing cable news has long elicited a line ofpredictable tropes, branding it a failed liberal city ravaged by violence, corruption and economic decline. But it is also a window into the splitscreen of American life at this early inflection point in Trump’s second term – amidan assault on free speechand analarming rise in political violencein the wake ofthe murder of rightwing youth organiser Charlie Kirk.View image in fullscreenIce agents on the rooftop of Broadview.Photograph: Dave Decker/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThe 31-year-old, who was shot dead on a college campus in Utah in September, grew up about 20 miles away from Broadview, in a separate Chicago suburb. He founded Turning Point USA, his hard-right campus political group, at a small office a short distance from here. “One of the last things he [Kirk] said to me was: ‘Please, sir. Save Chicago,’”Trump said during a eulogy at the organiser’s memorial later in September. “We’re going to go into Chicago and we’re going to have Charlie very much in mind.”The troops may not be here yet, but to many in the immigrant community a federal government occupation has already begun.With the residue of teargas still on my shirt, I drive out to the village of Lemont, to the small converted garage where Kirk began his political movement. A steady line of mourners have been arriving all day and a sprawling tribute spills on to the pavement. “Fight for freedom or lose it,” says one placard.View image in fullscreenTributes to Charlie Kirk outside the converted garage in Chicago where he started Turning Point USA.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt’s a sincere gathering. Many have driven for hours to come and lay flowers. One man tells me he has watched the video of Kirk’s murder a hundred times. I wonder if replaying an act of such horrendous violence on repeat is good for anyone. “We must never look away from the atrocities,” he says. “It just showed me that the division between the people of this country will never be breached.”Others strike a more conciliatory note. A young woman weeps as she lights a candle. “I think he’s a modern-day martyr,” she says. “And sometimes it takes the darkest dark to bring the greatest good. I truly think he was the vessel for that.” Another young man, who neatly lays a white T-shirt with the word “Freedom” on it (the same design Kirk was wearing when he was shot), worries about the role social media plays in exacerbating polarisation. “The elites have designed this algorithm to basically make us fight,” he says.The sentiment here, away from the glare of cable news punditry, online polemic and Trump himself, is measured. But closer to Chicago the onslaught is inescapable.Ifirst meet Kat Abughazaleh at the Broadview protest, sat cross-legged at the entrance to the facility with other protesters. A 26-year-old Democratic candidate for Illinois’s ninth congressional district – and formerly a journalist with a focus on the far right – her approach to electoral politics is at odds with the establishment wing of the Democratic party, with itslurch to the right on immigration policyand perceived capitulation to Trump’s expanding authoritarianism.View image in fullscreenDetainees being processed at Broadview.Photograph: Dave Decker/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“I don’t think our representatives are doing enough to stand up against fascism,” she tells me at the protest. “I feel like Democratic leaders in particular have missed the moment. I think they are working from a playbook that is not in 2025. This is not a dry run.”Abughazaleh, who is 5ft tall, was shoved later that day by a federal agent and thrown hard to the asphalt.A video of the incidentspread quickly online and was picked up by Fox News, whose prime-time host Laura Ingrahamran a segmentdeclaring the officer had done a “good job”. The Department of Homeland Security’s official X account also acknowledged it, posting an absurd accusation thateffectively suggestsshe is “siding with vicious cartels, human traffickers and violent criminals”.When I visit Abughazaleh at her campaign office the following day, she is nursing bruises but remains resolute, despite the online barrage from some of the world’s most powerful institutions and media organisations.“Things are going to get worse, and that is why it is more important to have solidarity between elected officials and protesters, between anyone with power or a platform,” she says. “What this administration is trying to do is terrifying. They want to crack down on our basic human rights. They do not want appeasement, they want complete and utter submission.”“We need to stop underestimating these people, we need to stop assuming that they will follow this social contract that people say exists, because they are following a new one, and it only caters to Donald Trump.”She points tothe documented instancesof poor conditions inside the Broadview facility, which is overcrowded, has no showers or cafeteria and where there is extremely limited access to medical care. “Ice has shown us who they are. They will do anything, including throwing a 5ft woman to the ground, but they’ll do a lot worse stuff than that.”View image in fullscreen‘This is not a dry run’ …Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic candidate for Illinois’s ninth congressional district.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianTrump only returned to office eight months ago, but the popularity of his extreme domestic agenda already appears to be waning. Pollingpublished by the New York Times this weekindicates more than 60% of Americans believe the president has gone “too far” in pressuring media organisations that cover him unfavourably, while 53% oppose sending the National Guard into major cities.Cook County, the second most populous county in the US, and home to Chicago, is of course a staunchly Democratic jurisdiction where 70% of residents voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. Unsurprisingly, revulsion at Trump’s plans for military deployment and his ongoing immigration raids seem pervasive throughout the city – extending well beyond the frontlines of protest.In some areas, community groups have created their own informal patrols, where volunteers walk the streets, equipped with whistles and “know your rights” handouts. I join one of them, led by a local jiu-jitsu instructor named Elias Cepeda, in the city’s Pilsen neighbourhood.We walk along tree-lined streets, and head towards a local middle school in time for pick-up. Chatter fizzes with politics and history. Some people fear a return to 1968, when the city hosted the Democratic National Convention, and seven days of anti-Vietnam war protestssaw protracted clashesbetween police and protesters. Others point even further back, to the fight against fascism in the second world war.“It’s disgusting what they’re doing,” says one man standing by his stoop, who claims that Ice surveys the area on a daily basis. “They’re violating everybody’s rights.”Cepeda, who himself waslater detained and then released at another Broadview protestas they continue to escalate, fears even these informal neighbourhood patrols could come under suspicion. Last week, Trumpsigned a sweeping memorandumauthorising government-wide investigations into activists and non-profits broadly connected with “domestic terrorism” – he hasrecently labelleda decentralised, umbrella movement known as “antifa” with this classification.It is a movecivil liberty groups sayis simply an attempt to “investigate and intimidate his critics”.“They’re trying to criminalise speech,” says Cepeda. “And they’re trying to criminalise workingwithand giving resourcestoundocumented immigrants.”Like Abughazaleh, he remains undeterred.View image in fullscreenThe gates at Broadview.Photograph: Dave Decker/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockOn the day of Charlie Kirk’s memorial, which draws tens of thousands of attendees to a stadium in Arizona, I drive about 60 miles out of Chicago, to McHenry county – a Republican-leaning area dotted with cornfields and grain silos. I come to a tavern in the small town of Woodstock, which is airing the event on a large outdoor screen. I had expected, perhaps, a few dozen people. Instead, around 600 arrive.There are lavish motorbikes, patriotic clothing and extremely loud fireworks, which explode between prayer and song. A giant stars and stripes hangs from a crane, and some raise a single hand in prayer while holding a beer in the other.A local pastor offers his own invocation to the group. “We know that as one has fallen, millions and millions are rising up. We are truly a giant who has been woken from his sleep,” he says. “Bless this nation because of Christian people who are making a stand, who will not be pushed to the corner. Let us gain courage for the battle ahead.”As the afternoon wears on, the alcohol continues to flow and there is louder heckling as the speeches beamed in from Arizona become more and more political. “Fuck Obama!” one man shouts.View image in fullscreenThe memorial to Charlie Kirk at Niko’s Red Mill Tavern in Woodstock.Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The GuardianBut a thunderstorm also rolls through; pounding rain and wind leaves me soaked to the bone and a few gazebos blow away. The event empties out before Trump speaks. I listen to his chilling words on the motorway back to the city.“I hate my opponent,” Trump says – drawing a line between himself and Kirk. “And I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry.”His shortcomings as a leader have perhaps never been so clear. And the consequences are likely to intensify in Chicago and far beyond.Explore more on these topicsAnywhere but WashingtonCharlie Kirk shootingIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationChicagoUS immigrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But a visit to the Ice field on Thursday afternoon showed that, far from being “under siege” by militants, there were fewer than 10 protesters on the sidewalk, nearly outnumbered by journalists.Now residents, frustrated with the president’s false claims that Portland is “war ravaged”, are showing a different side of their city from the one depicted by Trump and Fox News.A raft of Instagram and TikTok videos from Portlanders are poking holes in Trump’s claim that life in their city is “like living in hell”, showcasing verdant hiking trails, trees in rich fall colors and a thriving food scene. Plans are also being drawn up for the most Portland of all possible responses: anEmergency Naked Bike Rideagainst “the militarization of our city”.View image in fullscreenPowell’s City of Books in Portland, the world’s largest independent bookstore.Photograph: Jack Sullivan/AlamyOn a rainy Thursday in the city, the kitchen at Kann, Portland’s award-winning Haitian restaurant, was busy preparing for dinner. Jokes about Trump’s war were shared at Coava, a cafe with a single-origin coffee menu that changes seasonally which is popular with Japanese tourists. Business was brisk at Powell’s Books, the downtown icon which inspired the new protest slogan: “Portland isn’t a war zone; it’s a bookstore with a city around it.”The parking lot was full at Providore Fine Foods, a culinary marketplace whose owner, Kaie Wellman, said she was concerned about how Trump’s “threats against our city” could be “devastating for local businesses” like hers, which worked so hard to survive the pandemic only to be hit first by Trump’s tariffs and now his “100% false” portrayal of a minor protest at the Ice field office in the city’s south waterfront district. “It’s really profoundly upsetting,” she said.Wellman, a fifth-generation Oregonian, is opening a bistro this month in the Portland Art Museum’s new Mark Rothko Pavilion, a $110m expansion that has taken a decade to complete. “It really is such a cornerstone for our community, for downtown Portland, to have such a significant new building,” she said. She describes her leap of faith in opening a new restaurant just blocks from where the 2020 protests for racial justice took place as “a love letter to Portland and what a vibrant community we are.“One of the main reasons that we’re opening up this cafe downtown, and do what we do here in town, is because of our deep love for the state and for the city. And to see it portrayed anything less than what it is, you know, is just so frustrating. It’s a place that people want to come and live and raise their families. And it’s kind of unmatched in beauty,” Wellman said.View image in fullscreenWith Mount Hood in the background, the sun sets over downtown Portland, on 6 November 2024.Photograph: Jenny Kane/AP“Yes, we’ve had issues here, but we’ve had the same issues that basically every other city around this world has had. And we’re coming at these issues from a thoughtful place and not trying to sweep them away. But the issue that’s being portrayed right now does not exist in this town.”Asked about Trump’s claims of lawlessness, Wellman said it was “not the case at all”. “And I am in the south waterfront at least two to three times a week because my 92-year-old mother lives in the south waterfront,” she added. “So I can tell you firsthand what’s been happening down there. And what I have seen, at the quote-unquote very worst, it’s still been peaceful protests. Maybe there’s been some strong words thrown around.”“I would say right now, if there is any disturbance that’s been going on, it’s Black Hawk helicopters that are circling around a neighborhood that is filled with many retirees and older people … causing all of them fear and a lack of sleep,” she added.View image in fullscreenAmanda Cochran, a US army veteran, protested the deployment of federal troops to Portland, Oregon, outside an Ice office in the city, on Thursday.Photograph: Robert Mackey/The GuardianBack at the Ice field office protest, Amanda Cochran, a US army veteran, was holding a homemade sign that read “Vets Against Militarization” on one side, and “Immigrants Are Not the Enemy’ on the other. She wore a tour shirt for the Canadian rock band Three Days Grace with the lyrics “Let’s start a riot.”“I’m here because I’m really fed up with the fact that Trump is talking about using the military to go into cities and to train the forces,” she said.“I served in the US army for six years and this is my first time ever protesting,” she said. “I just felt really strongly that if we don’t stand up and say something then this could easily become a militarized country and the citizens will be under the control of the military, and I don’t think that that is OK, and that’s not what I fought for.“Us veterans, we have the privilege of being able to express our opinions because we’re out, and hopefully we can kind of give those soldiers that don’t want to be there a voice. If enough of us show up, maybe Trump will back off,” she added.Across the street, the Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin, who has been reporting from inside the facility, prepared fora live hitout front, accompanied by three men with covered faces who appeared to be private security guards.Just to their left, a young protest organizer, Jack Dickinson, who achieved a measure of viral fame this week for the chicken costume he wears to mock Trump, was being interviewed for the local news.Why a chicken? One of the advantages of the costume, Dickinson explained, is that “it disarms people.“We’re dealing with a real influx of rightwing agitators right now,” he continued. “It becomes difficult for them to interact in certain ways, I think, when there’s the chicken suit, but not just the chicken suit, it’s then somebody who tries to have a conversation with them about the soybean situation that we’re facing right now,” referring to the collapse in crop prices for US farmers due to Trump’s trade war with China.View image in fullscreenA demonstrator dressed in an inflatable frog costume stands in front of law enforcement officers during a protest outside of Ice headquarters in Portland, on Thursday.Photograph: Carlos Barría/Reuters“We do not want this to escalate,” he said, agreeing with local officials who suggest that Trump wants to provoke a response from the protesters.“There is definitely a desire for a response. We saw this most clearly on Sunday night because for that protest, we had 30 people that were down here associated with rightwing Twitter accounts or rightwing YouTube channels,” Dickinson said. “There is a clear desire to get somebody reacting in a way that they can frame as a justification for what they are doing.

Within seconds of it streaming, fans had deduced that the song Girl, So Confusing was probably about Lorde: all it took was the line “people say we’re alike / They say we’ve got the same hair”, riffing on a 2014 video where Charli and an interviewer did a bit about people confusing the two. In the song, Charli laid bare her anxieties about their relationship and admitted: “Sometimes I think you might hate me.” Exactly two weeks later camethe Girl, So Confusing Featuring Lorde remix, brokered by the pair over text and voice note in the days after Brat came out. On Lorde’s verse, she owned up to ghosting on dinner dates with Charli and exposed the self-hate, projection and industry-fuelled sense of pop-girl-on-pop-girl rivalry that had made her shy away from the friendship. Charli’s response to the text containing Lorde’s astonishing verse fairly summed it up: “Fucking hell.”It established an immaculate playbook – for pop, celebrity meta-narrative, harnessing the speed of online discourse in a way that showed total fluency in how stans talk. That nimbleness is just one reason that the Charli diss song on Taylor Swift’s new album feels like such a terrible relic.On the Brat song Sympathy Is a Knife, Charli sang about how anxious she felt being around Swift when the latter wasbriefly dating 1975 frontman Matty Healyin early 2023; Charli was dating (and has since married) the band’s drummer/producer George Daniel. “This one girl taps my insecurities,” she sang. It was obvious that these irrational fears were rooted in Charli’s perceived inferiority and her awe at Swift, amenable and crowdpleasing where Charli is stubborn and prickly: “’Cause I couldn’t even be her if I tried,” Charli sang in a frustrated yelp. “I’m opposite, I’m on the other side / I feel all these feelings I can’t control.” It’s not about active disdain for Swift, but theughgut-punch of poor self-comparison.Charli xcx: Sympathy Is a Knife – videoAlmost 16 months after Charli released Sympathy Is a Knife, Swift has made it about her. There’s no mistaking who Actually Romantic is aimed at: “High-fived my ex and then said you’re glad he ghosted me / Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face,” she sings. She suggests that Charli has spent undue amounts of time and effort hating her. (Maybe she has been poisoning the well in secret, but if so, no trace has leaked above ground.) “Some people might be offended / But it’s actually sweet, all the time you’ve spent on me,” Swift sings. That reframing is presumably intended to come off as Swift taking the high road, but she still sticks the knife in: “I heard you call me ‘boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave,” she sings, and likens Charli to “a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse”.“That’s how much it hurts,” she sings, somewhat unconvincingly given that she’s bothered to write a song about it several pop light years later – and given that in June 2024, in the week Brat set Sympathy Is a Knife loose, it was widely perceived that Swift released six new UK-exclusive deluxe reissues of her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department (largely about the short-lived Healy fling), in orderto prevent Brat from debuting at No 1(a move she previously pulled on Billie Eilish in the US). It worked. The potatoes, they are so, so tiny.Actually Romantic sounds a lot like Pixies’ Where Is My Mind?, a question Swift might ask herself. As Alexis Petridis writes inhis two-star review of The Life of a Showgirl, there is no way to interpret Swift, the biggest pop star of all time, attacking another female pop star as anything but punching down. The world has done its best to forget her terrible 2019 single You Need to Calm Down; Swift has also seemingly forgotten its revelation about the pointlessness of fomenting beef with other female artists (in that instance, Katy Perry). The “you’re so obsessed with me!” angle also has tangs of Mean Girls’ Regina George (when Swift learned to drive, she used her fledgling pop-star cashto buy the same model of Lexusas George drives in the film, to spite the girls who picked on her).View image in fullscreenNo more beef … Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.Photograph: BMGThis queen-bee spite pales in emotional intelligence next to the self-scouring insight, compassion and awareness of Lorde’s response to Charli. Recent Swift songs such as Mirrorball and The Archer show she’s capable of it when she wants to be; imagine hearing her own inner dialogue about how she compares to a more audacious, zeitgeist-defining peer. Perhaps most damningly, the drawn-out torture of it all makes her look old-school, a stately ship turning slowly next to her speedier, risk-taking peers. Should Charli choose to dignify it with a response, we will not be waiting 16 months to hear it.As Swift leans into her taunts in one of her fabled middle eights, she reframes Charli’s so-called hate campaign as “talking dirty” and sings – and I am sorry to have to write this – that “it’s kinda making me wet”. (Upsettingly, the moment is more convincing than Wood, the song about her fiance’s dick set to Bruno Mars-lite.) It unwittingly reveals so much of Swift’s current MO: eroticising hate, still getting off on it when her foes are long past participating.Time was that having an antagonist spurred Swift’s greatest work: from the entirety of Speak Now, written entirely solo to counter those who doubted her authorship, to the gimlet-eyed dances with her media-confected “boy-crazy” persona on 1989, to the panto villain of Reputation who leaned into the worst of what critics said about her. On Folklore, she wrote beautiful, thinly veiled songs about her former label owner Scott Borchettaselling her first six albums to foe Scooter Braun, then wrote several more notably worse ones – including her new album’s Father Figure. Long after most people acknowledged that she really was done dirty by Kim Kardashian and Kanye West and won that war, she still released the Tortured Poets bonus track thanK you aIMee (pointed capitalisation Swift’s own). And while the Showgirl song Wi$h Li$t is all about Swift’s dreams of a quiet suburban life with her fiance, it’s one that contrasts her simple hopes about kids and basketball hoops with conspicuously Kardashian-like venal desires (“a fat ass with a baby face”) to make her point.Showgirl also raises questions about which figures get a pass. Over the gothic thunder of Cancelled!, Swift welcomes social pariahs into her circle – the friends she likes “cloaked in Gucci and in scandal” – because her own post-1989 backlash taught her what it’s like to be tossed aside for perceived infractions. What may appear compassionate also functions perfectly as a rallying cry for the many scoundrels of our age: any comedian, actor, politician or otherwise who’s been confronted with the consequences of their actions and found community among those who see “wokeness” as a scourge. It’s hard to tell who it’s meant to be about – but it’s also easy to imagine it as an anthem for triumphant bad actors in the Teflon era of Trump 2.0.‘She’s leaning into the idea that her image is a gilded fantasy’: how Taylor Swift embraced the showgirlRead moreThe Swift album that Showgirl most resembles thematically is Reputation: both are divided between songs about those who seek to bring her down and ardent love songs about a guy who saved her life. But, ascritic BD McClay wrote in a great recent essay, “the meta-story of Reputation was that by trying to take everything away from her, The Haters gave her her great love.” There are no such stakes in The Life of a Showgirl. It comes off the back ofthe biggest tour of all time, which made Swift the biggest pop star of all time,lifting economiesand binding together giddy tweens and “actually she can really write songs!” dads in a link of friendship bracelets that could wrap around the world several hundred times. She isnewly engagedto a very famous American football player who has become infinitely more famous for their association, realising her youthful dreams of fairytale romance and total cultural domination. Not only did the Taylor’s Versions re-recordings stratospherically devalue Braun’s investment in her first six albums,she also got those albums back this year.There are no more foes to vanquish; like a new phase of Marvel movies, you get the sense of her scraping the barrel for conflict to mine, sucking the IP dry, lacking the imagination to explore and analyse tensions beyond rote hero/villain drama. The Life of a Showgirl was billed as going behind the scenes of Swift’s life on the Eras tour. One imagines her backstage, alone with her grindstone and axe, getting that thing really good and sharp.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockCharli xcxcommentShareReuse this content"

Long before the economy-lifting, paradigm-shifting global domination of her Eras Tour, Swift had cultivated a uniquely intense and personal relationship with her fans, even within the reverential world of pop music. That relationship, sustained through Easter eggs, years long parasocial narratives and arguably her own metaverse, can be real and special and nutritive, a steady raft through life’s storms – I’ve been there. But years into her imperial era, Swift’s cyclical feeding of the fan base has started to seem less like an act of mutual devotion and more nakedly exploitative, the many one-off re-releases and special vinyls and limited-edition Target drops like a billionaire’s tax on her most loyal.Taylor Swift’s Charli xcx hit job misses the point – and underscores her tedious obsession with conflict | Laura SnapesRead moreThe latest of these is the Life of a Showgirl movie – or, more accurately, a “launch event” film for her new albumThe Life of a Showgirl, out this Friday. Officially billed as the Official Release Party of a Showgirl, it’s a collection of song explainers, behind-the-scenes snippets and one music video (played twice!), unceremoniously packaged into one 90-minute sitting. It’s the type of stuff any other artist would put on YouTube, but which Swift, having already asserted box office domination with her Eras Tour concert movie, has decided to put into theaters from 3-5 October. With a projected $30m opening in the US, it will almost certainly be the highest-grossing film of the weekend – which is a shame, given that it barely qualifies as a visual aid to the album, let alone one worthy of note in her vast universe of content.As a cinema experience, The Official Release Party of a Showgirl at least mirrors the album it celebrates – rote, tinnily light, with the lazy execution and first-draft quality of someone up against a deadline. Further evidence of what critic Spencer Kornhaber hastermedSwift’s burnout era. In a low-fi intro filmed direct to camera, Swift, humbly awkward and self-deprecating as ever, bills the cinematic event as “sort of a journey of what inspired these songs” representing an “electrifying, exhilarating time”.But save for a behind-the-scenes featurette on the Fate of Ophelia music video spliced into 5-minute sections, the event is predominantly videos that spell out the lyrics for each track over a snippet from said music video shoot on loop. That’s fine for background viewing at a party, but an issue as the main event for an album that is best absorbed from a distance, its tepid soft-rock and hall-of-fame cringe lyrics allowed to wash over you in one unread flush. Perhaps one needs to be drunk; aside from one holler for the astoundingly un-self-aware Cancelled!, it was crickets at my sober, child-friendly 3pm screening.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl review – dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzledRead moreSwift accompanies each track with a short explanation of her thought process – always welcome, not even a hater can claim it’s uninteresting – though they basically amount to generalizations, professed enthusiasm and covering her bases (yes, she got permission from the George Michael estate to interpolate Father Figure). Swift has always played coy about songs whose targets are glaringly obvious, but the vagueness here feels especially disingenuous. There is no mention of the album’s muse, her fiance Travis Kelce, though she has been uncharacteristically forthcoming about their domestic bliss in promotional interviews this week. The much-discussed andwildly miscalculatedCharli xcx diss in Actually Romantic gets described as “a love letter to someone who hates you”. (Somehow, a biting “attention is affection and you’ve given me a whole lot of it”, makes it worse.) The lusty, pun-heavy Wood, starring [redacted]’s “redwood tree”, is billed as “a song about superstitions” with one child-proof, suggestive look to the camera.Swift somehow remains adept at suggesting relatability from the highest perch in pop music; she’s a chatty and compelling narrator, if an unreliable one on her own music. (This is not the album of bangers so advertised on New Heights.) That especially shines in work mode; the film’s best moments, by far, are when she cedes space to her many collaborators – Mandy Moore, the choreographer, and Rodrigo Prieto, the cinematographer, among others – and to the taut metronome of a music video shoot. These peeks behind the curtain – a clip of Swift on a Zoom call, jokes with her dancers, refining a take – are as fascinating as they are brief and tantalizing. They glimpse both the community and the machinery behind Taylor Swift industries, the real grist behind showgirl life.Perhaps assembling more, in a way both strategic and revealing, was an order too tall for Swift’s punishing schedule of diminishing returns. And perhaps diehard fans of the album – I know there are some – will find something in this bare minimum collection of Target treats worthwhile. But topping the box office with so little doesn’t make for a pop victory. It makes for another lucrative product in her empire.Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl is out in cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s the bit whereKate Hudson’s vampy wellness CEO makesElisabeth Mossmasturbate with a giant vibrator while making her stare in the mirror. There’s a cold open starring ex-Showgirl Elizabeth Berkley tearfully hacking off shells that have grown on her skin before getting slaughtered by a masked killer. There’s Hudson serving an elegant dinner of her discarded skin to enthused guests. And then there’s Kaia Gerber turning into a giant lobster …Good Boy review – crafty supernatural horror leads with a heroic dogRead moreIf only Shell was as outrageously fun as that all makes it sound, but there’s something oddly flat about it, actor-turned-director Max Minghella struggling to bring the luridly indulgent pleasures that something as silly as this so obviously needs. It’s never quite obvious what or why Shell is and who it might be for, a cheaply made lark with very little to offer those who weren’t involved in the production, feeling even less necessary given its unfortunate resemblance toThe Substance. Both focus on an LA actor struggling to get the attention and work she thinks she deserves in a cruel industry, unfairly critiqued for her looks who is then seduced by a game-changing procedure that provides instant rewards but has horrifying side effects.Even if Fargeat’s version hadn’t premiered last year at Cannes, four months before Minghella’s was unveiled at the Toronto film festival, the comparison would still not be kind. While I was not a particular fan of The Substance (a garishly made, overlong and empty act of provocation mildly saved by a killer lead performance) it had an undeniable stickiness, easily finding its deserved place within the culture (expect it to be one of the most parodied films in next year’s Scary Movie 6). Shell has about the same level of depth to its and-then-what commentary (beauty standards for women are impossibly punishing!), but it can’t match its over-the-top body horror, the film ultimately resembling the kind of no-budget rip-off that would have followed The Substance to the video store back in the day (the Orca to its Jaws, the Critters to its Gremlins etc).It’s strangely led by Moss, an actor not known for her lightness, miscast in a role that requires someone more willing to lean into the absurdity of the territory. She worked with Minghella on The Handmaid’s Tale (one can understand why they both might crave a break from that show’s punishing grimness), and he was so desperate for her to lead that he decided to work around her being noticeably six months pregnant, cue the star being distractingly hidden in a lot of big hoodies and jackets. As an insecure actor seeking to elbow her way into Hollywood with the help of a crustaceous skin routine, she might not really convince, but as the slithering 68-year-old CEO of a life-threatening beauty brand, Hudson is in far greater control.The actor, who remains a perennially underrated force, is again a joy to watch, mastering a specifically LA brand of faux-earnest fakeness backed up by something genuinely sinister and it’s in her all-too-brief scenes that we see what the film could have been. Matched with a more comfortable sparring partner and a sharper script, the film could have played like a deliriously nasty cross between a 50s “woman’s picture” and an 80s creature feature, something Death Becomes Her did so wonderfully well.But the script, from Jack Stanley, who also wrote the similarly limp action thrillerLou, is never as acidic or as smart as it could be, satire kept to its most obvious (the finale hinging on the use of an NDA is funnier in concept than execution). Minghella doesn’t seem confident in what he’s really trying to make, his film as plainly, ploddingly shot as a daytime soap with an equally rubbishy score. If he’s trying to do a knowing carbon copy of a bottom shelf VHS horror, then he hasn’t gone far enough into studied pastiche to sell it as such. Shell should take us all the way over the edge, but it’s too scared to make the jump.Shell is available to rent digitally in the US, in Australia on 30 October and in the UK on 7 NovemberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsElisabeth MossKate HudsonScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

As well as revealing just how terrified the whole world is of the prospect of institutional collapse, it also – somewhat more positively – underscored what a globally connected industry TV is in 2025. Streaming networks, satellite channels, YouTube and hooky pirate streams can instantly serve up local content from every continent (Antartica excepted, though I’d love to hear if there’s a penguin mob drama from King George Island that I’ve missed).Still, as intermingled as TV is these days, there are still so many programmes that will probably never reach our shores despite being absolutely massive with their domestic audiences. So this week we wanted to shine a light on those shows by asking some of the Guardian’s foreign correspondents and contributors what people are watching in the countries they cover. Read on for tales of Jamaican breakfast telly, Brazilian telenovelas and Japanese red bean paste-based superheroes.Brazil | Vale TudoView image in fullscreenTaís Araujo and Bella Campos in Vale Tudo.Photograph: globo.comEven if Brazil’s longstanding love affair with telenovelas has beensomewhat affectedby streaming and by competition from K-dramas and Turkish equivalents, the most talked-about and most watched TV show in Latin America’s largest country is, unsurprisingly, a soap opera. Vale Tudo (“anything goes”) is a reboot of a production considered one of the most important of the genre and a massive success in 1988 and 1989, when Brazil was still recovering from the brutal two-decade military dictatorship, and revolvedaround the question: “Is it worth being honest in Brazil?”The new version – launched at a moment ofprofound political polarisation– has shed much of the original’s political focus, but has drawn strong ratings and sparked heated online debates. While many viewers enjoy the reboot, with clipsgoing viralon social media, there has also been criticism ofchanges to the original plotand of thereproduction of stereotypesoften associated with Black women in relation to one of the protagonists.Tiago Rogero,South America correspondentNigeria |Big Brother NaijaYou could write a compelling dissertation on Nigeria’s relationship with neighbourly boundaries and the nation’s continued interest in monitoring more than two dozen strangers locked in a shared home. The latest season of Big Brother Naija is on now, and it still manages to drive more conversation, especially on social media, than any other pop culture event that isn’t Premier League football.BBNaija enjoys the sort of cultural breakthrough that makes the drama difficult to avoid even if you don’t watch it, while contestants can still expect to leverage their appearances into a life (however temporary) of fame and brand deals. This will endure for as long as the producers maintain their incredible ability to select the perfect mix of contestants who all seem born for the 24-hour stage.Dipo Faloyin,author andcontributor toThe Long WaveJapan | AnpanAccording to the latest figures available, Japan’s highest rated regularly scheduled programme is Anpan. It’s the latest in a long series of 15-minute dramas, calledasadora, broadcast in the morning Monday through Saturday by public broadcaster NHK. Anpan is based on the life of Nobu Komatsu, whose husband, Takashi Yanase, created theAnpanman(literally, Bean Paste Man) pictures books and animated series that have amused and enthralled generations of Japanese kids.Anpan tells the grit-through-to-glory story of a young woman who experiences the horrors of the second world war and, with her husband, creates a gentle-spirited picture book series in the 1970s whose hero Anpanman – a red-bean-filled pastry with a cape – selflessly helps those in danger and need, even giving pieces of his soft, sweet head to feed the starving. Like mostasadora, Anpan is visual comfort food, with a heartwarming, uplifting story that soothes the unsettled mood of the moment.Mark Schilling, Tokyo-based entertainment writerskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So you will get viral dance and pilates tutorials, intriguing interviews with a Jamaican Michael Jackson impersonator and the makers of a new canned curry goat, but also discussions on Jamaica’s firearms laws and the tough subject of suicide prevention after the nation was rocked by the death of former Miss Universe Jamaica contestant Tyra Spaulding at just 26.

Still, much of Poland will be glued to their screens for the next three weeks after the twists and turns of the latest edition of a prestigious piano competition celebrating Poland’s composer and virtuoso, Fryderyk Chopin.The 19th edition of theInternational Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competitionstarted yesterday. It will see 84 pianists from 20 countries – narrowed down from more than 640 submissions – contending for the top prize, often seen as a golden ticket to play in the world’s greatest concert halls.The event, resembling the Olympic Games for pianists, takes place every five years and draws thousands of classical music lovers to the Polish capital, with tickets selling out a year in advance. This time the host nation has 13 participants, but the US pianist Eric Lu, Canada’s Kevin Chen and Korea’s Hyuk Lee areseen as some of the favourites.The competition is broadcast by Poland’s public broadcaster, TVP, and streamed online bythe Chopin Institute, and the winner’s show concerts start on 21 October.Jakub Krupa, Guardian Europe live bloggerIf you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterTelevisionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Instead, it panders to viewers’ basest instincts by lingering gleefully over the worst depredations humanity can commitLucy ManganFri 3 Oct 2025 11.11 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 11.13 EDTShareYou’ve seen Psycho, The Silence of the Lambs and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, maybe you’ve even read the books that the first two films were adapted from – now come and meet the guy behind Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill and Leatherface! The one, the only Ed Gein! Yay!The opening two seasons of Ryan Murphy’s anthology series Monster dealt first with Jeffrey Dahmer (you gotta open with good name recognition, right?), and then with the Menendez brothers (bit classier, li’l bit more niche, get the real dedicated true crime fans to commit). Now it’s time for the Butcher of Plainfield – or, if you prefer, the Plainfield Ghoul – to take his turn in the spotlight. It’s only fair. He may not have the same brand recognition as Dahmer, Bundy or even John Wayne Gacy, and he only killed two people, but he desecrated so many female graves and corpses with such gusto and inventiveness that to this day if you find yourself watching anything involving mutilated corpses, flayed bodies or homewares made out of skin, the chances are it’s been inspired by this guy’s exploits more than 70 years ago. And they say that people don’t know history any more!Do I sound flippant? Well, it’s clearly the way everyone behind Monster: The Ed Gein Story wants it. I’ve rarely seen a drama that lingers more gleefully or lasciviously over the worst depredations a man and – when it comes to the substantial narrative strand given over to Nazi atrocities – mankind can commit with little or no possible justification.Structurally and stylistically, it’s great. Can’t fault the pacing, the clever interweaving of the past (in which Charlie Hunnam as Gein commits the murders, the grave robberies, and assembles his collection of female body parts) and the present (in which the details of his crimes are pored over again by Alfred Hitchcock, Robert Bloch and Anthony Perkins as they create Psycho from Bloch’s Gein-inspired novel). The same applies to the real (Gein’s life dominated by his fervidly religious mother; his increasing obsession with women, dead or alive, who resembled her) and the unreal (lurid, fetishistic scenes of Gein’s other great passion: Ilse Koch, the Butcher of Buchenwald who was said to have killed Jews to make lampshades out of their skin). Those party scenes at the SS officers’ houses where the hosts’ children shave terrified prisoners’ heads and guests chase others round the house with whips are really well shot.What it lacks, and unforgivably so – even if we in this country weren’t watching in the wake of the antisemitic murders at Heaton Park synagogue – is any kind of moral dimension or commentary to outweigh the lingering, loving shots of Gein’s own depraved acts. We see his vibrant fantasy life and how he is positioned as a man entirely at the mercy of first his mother on their isolated farm together, and then a would-be girlfriend who shares some of his early morbid fascinations and brings him some photos of concentration camp victims and his first Ilse Koch comic. What, seems to be the message, is a poor, schizophrenic guy to do? Over dinner with Hitchcock (Tom Hollander in a performance almost as bad as the prosthetics he is buried under), Bloch surmises that had Gein never seen the photographs “he would have stayed a small town simpleton”.Now, you could argue that a drama from the Ryan Murphy stable (he is executive producer here – it’s directed by Max Winkler and written by Ian Brennan), known for its glossy, frequently high-camp productions, is the wrong place to be looking for insight into the human condition. But The People v OJ Simpson was a brilliant commentary on the transition of America into the media age and the ramifications playing out now. The Assassination of Gianni Versace had things to say about fame and the celebrification of culture. And Impeachment examined embedded and internalised misogyny, even if it didn’t entirely escape accusations of perpetuating it. So it can be done, and Murphy can do it.But not here. The Ed Gein Story feels like it is interested only in bringing an underexploited piece of true crime estate to market, and in demanding sympathy for the man behind the skin masks and boxes of carved out trophies. It is not an exercise in understanding how he might have been created – beyond the glib and asinine “religious ma, whatcha expect?” offering – and therefore how new Geins might be prevented. It is nothing but a voyeuristic pandering to the basest instincts of viewers. Lovely lighting in the Nazi bits, though. Gotta give the boys that.Monster: The Ed Gein Story is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewRyan MurphyTom HollanderreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was claiming the prize forClash of the Comics, the bombastic night that throws comedians and pro wrestlers into the ring, when Ed Gamble stormed in, knocked everyone out, and swanned off with the belt. “Well,” corrects the comedian and Clash co-founder Max Olesker, “we were knocked down by his henchman.” Hulking pro wrestler Bullit was the one to clothesline him and his comedy partner, Ivan Gonzalez. “I think I could have taken Ed if he’d been on his own,” huffs Olesker.The popularity of pro wrestling has fluctuated since its golden era in the 1980s. At the start of this year, WWE made the leap on to Netflix with an eye-watering $5bn (£4bn) deal, inching the skimpily clad, heavily muscled combat sport higher in the public consciousness. In Britain, it has a rich working-class history, growing from the grassroots to raising some of the greatest international contenders such as Will Ospreay and Zack Sabre Jr. Now, wrestling is dipping a greased-up toe into the theatrical limelight, with a smattering of productions across the UK welcoming new audiences through alternative performance lenses, from comedy to queer cabaret to a living sculpture that uses bondage to suspend disbelief.View image in fullscreenRope work … A Still Lives performance in Melbourne in 2022.Photograph: Tim CarrafaOlesker, who used to be the UK’s youngest pro wrestler as Max Voltage, was the one to introduce Gonzalez to wrestling, putting on a match in the student union at university. “The atmosphere was electric,” Gonzalez remembers. “It’s this larger-than-life pantomime: good versus evil.” Forming a comedy duo together as Max & Ivan, the pair decided to blend the art forms for a show at the Edinburgh fringe, convincing pro wrestlers that they weren’t making fun of them and persuading comedians to throw themselves off the ropes.The Wrestling, as it was then called, won the Edinburgh comedy award and has rocketed in popularity since.Renamed Clash of the Comics, the brutal showdown that saw Rosie Jones defeat Greg Davies at the O2, as part of the 2023 Just for Laughs festival, is about to take over the Hammersmith Apollo, west London, where for the first time it will stand outside a wider comedy festival. The lineup includes pro wrestlers Simon Miller, Cara Noir and La Cyclonica, with comedians Aisling Bea, Flo & Joan and James Acaster, who has issued an open challenge to any comedian or wrestler willing to take him on. And, naturally, Wang needs to win his championship belt back from Gamble. Commentating from the sidelines, Nish Kumar will be cheering for the rule-breaking baddies, Sara Pascoe will support the good and righteous, and Greg James will give an impartial play-by-play.Comedyis key to the night, but the show’s success relies on the spectacles in the ring. “They’re both performance art,” Olesker considers. “You travel the world, you react to an audience. It’s a real meeting of disciplines.”Logistically, the event is a nightmare. The comedians are sent to wrestling school to make their transformations possible. “I guess in the same way that Strictly Come Dancing teaches the celebrities not to become professional dancers, but to dance a very specific dance,” Gonzalez says, “we teach our comedians to wrestle for one specific moment.” The comics often come with ambitions of spectacular moves, which the team do their best to realise. “And much like Strictly,” Olesker adds, “all our wrestlers and comedians are having affairs with one another.” He keeps a straight face. “It just makes the whole thing fly.”Wrestling is drag – you have an alter ego, you’re getting the audience on your sideWrestling walks a constant tightrope between reality and pretence. “You’re training your body to be an athlete,” says Heather Bandenberg, who runsFist Club, an LGBTQ+ cabaret night pitched as “Wrestling but gayer”. Melding queer performance and pro wrestling, the night features back-flipping drag kings, anarchic performances from pro wrestlers and an openness to the types of bodies that tend to be excluded from the mainstream. “You’re training to be a gymnast and you’re doing elements of stunt,” Bandenberg says. “It hurts.” One of the early moves a wrestler learns is how to “bump”, the classic move where they throw themselves on to the floor in order to imitate the impact of being thrown by someone else. The impact is real, even if the weight distribution and choreography lessen the pain. “There is an element of danger,” says Bandenberg. The liveness exaggerates this, as shows teeter between planned and improvised. “It’s one of the few performance art forms where the reaction of the crowd informs what will happen,” says Olesker. “People won’t do an extra scene in a Shakespeare play if people are really into it.”Bandenberg stumbled upon wrestling by accident, quickly falling for the space it allowed her to take up. “WWE has never been a great place to be a woman,” she says. “I saw the main world of wrestling and was like: This isn’t for me. But I found I wasn’t the only person who felt like this.” She formed the event with pro wrestling drag kings Rich Tea and Rocky Rhodes. For them, the collaboration between wrestling and cabaret seemed obvious. “Wrestling is drag,” Bandenberg says. “You have an alter ego. You’re getting the audience on your side.”Run for queer and female wrestlers, Fist Club leaps between venues across the UK and sells out fast, with some audience members having been persuaded to start wrestling themselves. Primarily featuring smack-talking drag kings, the night has a quota of 10% of straight male wrestlers: “Because that’s what it’s like to be a woman or queer person on a normal wrestling show.” The audience of their last show included a vicar in her 60s, who apparently had a glorious time. “We want it to be open to people who have never seen wrestling before,” Bandenberg says.A successful match relies on the sell: the performance. “You’re trying to make the audience believe you’re actually getting, you know, completely totalled in the face,” Bandenberg explains while miming knocking herself out. All the hosts are careful to make everything as safe as possible for their shows, but injuries aren’t uncommon. Olesker broke his ankle in the first show. In training, Bandenburg jumped off the top rope and broke both her big toes. “But I’ve got off lightly,” she shrugs.View image in fullscreenDrag place … A Fist Club event in May this year.Photograph: Rob Brazier/The Head DropIn Glasgow, the speed of a typical wrestling match is being frozen in time for a new piece of performance art. Luke George and Daniel Kok are the artists behindStill Lives, an installation using shibari, a rope-knotting bondage technique typically used in kink practice, to construct still images in the air. Adapting the piece to every city it moves to, they wrap people up, heave them high and suspend them, creating these breathing images with Australian rules players in Melbourne and rugby union players in Auckland. They are particularly interested in using underrepresented bodies. It’s not always sport; in Venice they wrapped up a gondolier. “We’re looking for something that can give us a sense of what life is like in that city,” says Kok.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Audiences will watch as the pair are carefully tied and hauled up, then slowly brought back down and undone. Coming from dance and performance backgrounds, the artists are invested in endurance and what the body is capable of. “We’re working with degrees of discomfort and endurance,” George says of the physical demands on the participants, “but it’s not sitting in pain for an hour.”Bondage drags with it certain assumptions about violence and dominance, yet both shibari and wrestling delicately navigate care, consent and power. “It’s about trust and communication, about listening to each other and watching for cues,” George says. They’ve been surprised by the similarities between the art forms, with each relying on watchful adjustments throughout. “Wrestlers have ways to communicate when there’s a certain narrative arc they’re trying to achieve,” Kok says, “so they’re looking out for each other even while they’re fighting.”Wider popularity for wrestling may come in waves, but for the truly dedicated, commitment is unrelenting. Months are spent organising getting the Clash of the Comics comedians to wrestling school. The Fist Club fighters train multiple times a week, with Still Lives capturing this devotion by stretching out the patient endurance of preparation. Through their chosen styles, these artists want to celebrate the sport, welcome new supporters and show that wrestling doesn’t belong to a single gender, shape or style.“There’s so much happening live,” says Bandenberg, “done by people who love it. They’re not getting rich off it, they’re just seeing it as a creative art form that brings joy.”Clash of the Comicsis at Hammersmith Apollo, London,8 October; Fist Club is atColour Factory, London, 11 October, andLost Horizon, Bristol, 8 November;Still Livesis at Tramway, Glasgow, 25 October.Explore more on these topicsWrestlingComedyPerformance artGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stay calm. The advice from Virgil van Dijk and Curtis Jones was Zen-like in its reassurance in midweek as Liverpool digestedback-to-back defeatsfor the second time under Arne Slot.Slot remained relaxed and upbeat on Friday too, sprinkling his press conference with several unprompted reminders that the team he was defending from rare criticism are top of the Premier League. Again. But behind the soothing messages and positive league table there are undeniable issues with Liverpool’s form that, according to Slot himself, run deeper than the opening 10 games of the campaign.Curtis Jones calls on Liverpool to improve basics in order to correct formRead moreThe Premier League champions have not been struggling to create chances from open play or to turn dominant possession into convincing victories since August, their head coach insisted. They have been struggling to do both since the middle of last season, once opponents adjusted their tactics to stifle Liverpool, and are yet to find solutions. It was some admission from the coach of a team that cruised to the title with four games to spare in April and has been enhanced bya £420m summer spending spree. And, yes, that investment does increase scrutiny as well as expectation.“We were very happy winning the league,” said Slot. “But we didn’t shut our eyes for the second part of the season to how many times we needed a set piece [to win]. That is not something bad because Arsenal and Chelsea areneeding a set piecealmost every single game at the moment. We’ve brought in a very different midfielder than we had last season [Florian Wirtz], which we think we needed because there was a big, big difference between the amount of goals we found from open play in the first part of last season and the second part of last season.”View image in fullscreenMidfielder Alexis Mac Allister (left) is not yet at 100% as he recovers from a groin injury.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAStatistics back up Slot. In the first 19 league games of his debut season Liverpool scored 47 goals with 40 (85.1%) coming from open play. Over the final 19 league games Liverpool scored 39 goals, of which 27 (69.2%) were from open play. The drop-off has been corrected this term, over a small sample size admittedly, with 10 of Liverpool’s 12 league goals scored from open play (83.3%). But Slot’s side stayed out in front over the final 19 games of last season thanks in no small part to eight set-piece goals (20.5% of the total), excluding penalties. This season’s set-piece tally, excluding penalties, is one (8.3%).But Liverpool’s performances this season, notably the defeats at Crystal Palace and Galatasaray in the space of four days, cannot be attributed to a decline in set-piece prowess alone. Even their seven-game winning streak before heading to Selhurst Park was often accompanied by the caveat thatLiverpool won lateand/or despite an inconsistent display.Wirtz is yet to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League and is a £100m talent that Slot is still trying to accommodate to maximum effect. Liverpool’s new full-backs, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, werestaunchly defendedby their head coach before the Galatasaray defeat but are not currently at the levels of the players they replaced, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson. Alexander Isak is not match sharp having spent the summer on strike at Newcastle, and Ibrahima Konaté’s form has deserted him. The list goes on. Only Hugo Ekitiké, Van Dijk, Alisson, who will miss Saturday’s trip to Chelsea with a hamstring injury, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch have performed consistently well this term.Liverpool desperately need Alexis Mac Allister to regain full fitness and his influence over their rhythm, composure and penetration. The Argentina international was left out of the final two games of last season to start his recovery from a persistent groin injury and return fit for pre-season. At least that was the plan. The midfielder’s rehabilitation took longer than anticipated, pre-season was frequently interrupted as a consequence, and a vital cog in Slot’s machine has not completed 90 minutes for his club since the1-0 win at Leicesteron 20 April. “You say he’s playing catchup,” Slot said. “In Holland we say he walks behind the music.” Liverpool will be a different proposition once Mac Allister is conducting midfield alongside Gravenberch again.Slot has extolled the virtues of flexibility in his new-look squad, with the summer arrivals Wirtz, Ekitiké, Isak and Frimpong able to play in a variety of positions, but a team in transition could do with more consistency in selection to speed the process. Slot insists his changes in personnel have been enforced and there will be no change in his approach.View image in fullscreenArne Slot: ‘There are things we definitely have to improve.’Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters“I don’t think we do things differently but I see teams doing a lot of things differently against us,” he said. “Jürgen [Klopp] gave me a lot of gifts but one of the gifts he gave me was ending up third the year before and fifth the year before that, and him being so well-known that a new manager came in and everyone thought: ‘Oh, let’s start to play against Liverpool.’ Teams played in a completely different way in the first half of the season against us than they did when we were top of the league after half of the season.“It is purely about how teams play against us in style and mentality. In Istanbul, [it looked as if] Galatasaray won the Champions League. If you look at Palace, you look at Galatasaray, how much they throw themselves in front of a ball, these things make it harder for us to score from open play than it was in the first part of last season. This is something I already saw last season. That’s why we had the window we had: sometimes to replace, sometimes to add a certain quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the meantime, we almost won every single game, right? But the margins are not the same any more as the first part of the season: 3-0 Brentford at home, 6-3 Tottenham and 5-0 West Ham.”Liverpool possess enough world-class talent to correct their unconvincing form, as Jones stated this week, but Slot admits the solution is more complex than waiting for Wirtz and Isak to hit their stride. Stamford Bridge would be a good place to start, however.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It’s a combination of things,” Slot said. “How do we find our wingers? Do we find them often enough and in promising situations like we did against Galatasaray? This is what we have to work on and this is what we have to do better than we’ve done until now.“We unlocked teams in the second half of last season by scoring from seven corner kicks. The team we face tomorrow [Chelsea] have scored more than 50% of their goals from set pieces, although they are on eight points. The No 2 in the league [Arsenal] has scored 60% of their goals from set pieces. So they have the same issues if they face a low block, but the way to unlock a low block is to do better.“We have to find ways of unlocking that, maybe scoring the first chance we get or from a set piece. I think there are enough positives to take from this season. If you talk about open-play goals, we’ve done much better in the first part of this season than the second part of last season. But there are things we definitely have to improve. I’m the first one to acknowledge that.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, in the end, there was an all too familiar outcome to a bristling derby as the reigningSuper Leaguechampions moved to a place in the Grand Final and the verge of yet more history.Wigan Warriors’ stunned the rugby league world on Wednesday morning with a statement alleging that the Leigh Leopards’ owner, Derek Beaumont, wanted to withdraw from this game in a row over ticket allocations, merely adding an extra layer of intrigue to the playoff semi-final.Wigan v Leigh Super League semi-final set to go ahead after ticket allocation furoreRead moreHowever, the Leopards shrugged off any controversy surrounding their owner to play their part in a thrilling semi-final that never really looked settled or decided until the final moments. However, what this Warriors side are so good at is producing their best rugby in the biggest moments. That proved again to be the case on Friday night.Leigh were much the stronger of the two sides in the opening quarter and, roared on by nearly 5,000 away supporters, would have been quietly confident it would be them progressing to Old Trafford for the first time. However, led by the impeccable Bevan French and Jai Field, Wigan edged the critical moments on the night in appalling weather conditions to make it three Grand Finals in a row, and move the Warriors to within one game of a third straight league title.They have not quite hit the same heights this year as they did in 2024, when they clinched an unprecedented four trophies. But whether it is Hull KR or St Helens who emerge from Saturday’s second semi-final, they will not fancy the prospect of ending this era of dominance from Matt Peet and his men.View image in fullscreenWigan’s Patrick Mago (centre) attempts to get past Leigh Leopards’ Jack Hughes (left) and Owen Trout during the Super League playoff semi-final.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA“There’s a common trait at this time of the year where we really tighten things up,” Peet said after watching his side record their sixth straight win.Having been second best for large stretches of the opening quarter, they were able to go ahead against the run of play when an error from the Leopards allowed Adam Keighran to collect a loose ball and feed French, who slid over unopposed to break the deadlock.You wondered if Leigh’s heads would drop at that stage but, instead, they came back strong again. They deservedly levelled proceedings when Edwin Ipape’s superb pass put Robbie Mulhern through from short range by the Wigan posts to make it 6-6. But in truth this semi-final was decided in the two minutes before half-time.Ipape took French out off the ball to hand Keighran a simple opportunity to make it 8-6 in favour of the Warriors. Then, with seconds remaining of the half, Wigan broke from deep courtesy of Field and French – undisputedly Super League’s best player – did the rest. Suddenly, a game that had been 6-6 was 14-6 in favour of the champions. It was a seismic couple of minutes.Quick GuideWigan 18-6 Leigh teams and scorersShowWiganField; Miski, Keighran, Wardle, Marshall; French, Smith; Byrne, O’Neill, Thompson, Walters, Farrell, Ellis.InterchangeHavard, Nsemba, Mago, Leeming.TriesFrench 2, Walters.GoalsKeighran 3.LeighHodgson; Brand, Hanley, Niu, Charnley; O’Brien, Lam; Ofahengaue, Ipape, Mulhern, Halton, Trout, Liu.InterchangeHughes, Tuitavake, Davis, Dwyer.TryMulhern.GoalO’Brien.RefereeChris Kendall.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The key moment in the game is the Ipape penalty and that set after,” the Leigh coach, Adrian Lam, said. “Those two minutes broke my heart.”Lam insisted the saga in the week concerning his owner did not affect the buildup of his players and their performance, and the effort that his side produced, would certainly back up that assertion.But you always felt they had to score first after half-time to stand any chance and they were not able to break down the Warriors again. But goodness, they came close. With 15 minutes remaining, Owen Trout was freed and seemed destined to score but for a world class tackle from Field to deny him.It was another of those critical moments in a big game that the Warriors always seem to be on the right side of and it took the wind from Leigh’s sails.The Warriors were then able to close out a victory with minimal fuss and they were even able to score a third try after the hooter as French – who else? – provided a stunning pass for Sam Walters to stroll over from close range. Nobody would back against this side making it three titles in a row next Saturday.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueWigan WarriorsLeigh LeopardsRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

At long last their long-awaited stadium redevelopment looks likely to happen and, on the field, the champions are two from two after the first couple of weekends. With Finn Russell due back in action next week to pick up the fly-half baton, it is going to take a seriously good side to steal their crown.On a wet and windy night in Somerset, even so, they were made to work extremely hard for it by a stubbornSaleteam who stuck in the fight and refused to go away. It was only with three minutes left that Max Ojomoh slid in to score his side’s bonus-point try and maintain his squad’s perfect start to the campaign.This was Sale’s fourth successive loss on their opponents’ ground and the manner of it was largely familiar. Bath make a virtue of squeezing teams in the latter stages of games and, towards the end of a taut final quarter, Ben Spencer’s little chip eventually gave Ojomoh the chance to secure the maximum five points.Bath’s head coach, Johann van Graan, does have some potential injury headaches after Charlie Ewels, Quinn Roux and Ted Hill limped off but he headed home far more satisfied than a frustrated Alex Sanderson, Sale’s director of rugby. “The big rocks are there but small things and poor discipline let them in,” lamented Sanderson. “Against the best teams banging people isn’t enough, is it? You’ve got to be more than that.”There was also plenty to ponder for the watching England head coach, Steve Borthwick, with Ollie Lawrence and Henry Arundell both looking sharp. Sale’s Nathan Jibulu claimed a second-half try and is clearly a young player on the rise while the generalship and kicking accuracy of the composed George Ford stood out in testing conditions.View image in fullscreenGeorge Ford stood out for the visitors despite the loss.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockIt was another of those sodden nights when a roof on the open temporary stand would have spared its soaking inhabitants. Their tickets can still cost £100 but a reprieve is finally on the horizon. After decades of arguing, planning permission has been given for an 18,000-capacity stadium, with both Unesco and the secretary of state having given the decision their blessing.That merely leaves Bath awaiting formal signed approval which the club hope will materialise within a couple of months. And as and when Bath do finally have their own riverside palace to complement their extraordinary squad depth, life is going to become no easier for future visitors.Not that Sale were in any mood to be intimidated in a physical if slightly staccato first half. Their scrum was strong throughout but Bath dug in and registered the game’s first try. Just when Sale were threatening they were unzipped down the left by Lawrence before the speedy Arundell whizzed around Tom O’Flaherty to score his first home Prem try for his childhood club.It was to be the story of the half; encouraging visiting flashes only for Bath to strike with devastating effect. The game was still less than 30 minutes old when they scored again, Miles Reid slicing clear from a home lineout and feeding Cameron Redpath on his inside to finish exuberantly.Luckily Sale still had the outstanding Ford to keep them in touch via a finely judged penalty and a smart drop-goal and the England No 10 then nailed another inch-perfect drop before Beno Obano, from close range, claimed Bath’s third try with Sale’s skipper, Ernst van Rhyn, absent in the sin-bin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a credit to Sale’s resolve, then, when they worked Jibulu over from close range just seven minutes after the restart to puncture any home complacency.Usually that is the signal for Bath to shift up a couple of gears but this time the Sharks were forewarned. They made their own raft of changes and, at 21-16, it required a stunning tackle from Sam Underhill to halt the seriously hard running Marius Louw. A massive hit by Tom Burrow also forced Hill to leave the field prematurely but where it really counted, up on the scoreboard, Bath always find a way these days.

For the neutral it was a good draw and a high level of quality from both teams.”Manchester United v Chelsea: Women’s Super League – liveRead moreThe quality level certainly was high and for a game played between the teams with the two best defensive records in the WSL last term, and which had conceded the fewest goals this season before kick-off, the game began in a surprisingly open fashion as both attacked early on. The contest opened at such a fast pace that it could easily have been 2-2 inside the first six minutes, with Hannah Hampton saving with her feet from Elisabeth Terland, Catarina Macario’s effort being blocked by Maya Le Tissier, Jess Park firing narrowly over the crossbar and then Aggie Beever‑Jones following suit when she seemed certain to score.Chelsea did then provide the goal that the early flurry of attacks had threatened, as Wieke Kaptein met Macario’s clever back-heeled pass and slotted in a neat, clinical finish low into the corner, as the hosts conceded a league goal for only the second time this season.Manchester United had lost 10 of their previous 11 WSL meetings with Chelsea, but this confident version of Skinner’s team were unwilling to roll over. Inspired by the dribbling of Park, who seemed determined to skip her way past as many defenders as possible and was the driving force of her team’s adventurous play, they continued to create chances and they were soon level when Anna Sandberg scored her first goal for the club. She could hardly have caught her strike any sweeter, angling her foot perfectly over the ball to arrow a half-volley powerfully past Hampton from just outside the area.View image in fullscreenWieke Kaptein gave Chelsea an early lead.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockIt was Park that drew Skinner’s highest praise after the game as he said: “She’s electric. She twists, she turns. She was incredible. I think her and Tooney [Ella Toone] have brought each other to life.”The game was played amid Storm Amy, which brought swirling rain and gusts of wind, and started with a minute’s silence after the terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday, with the home side also wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. This was the ground where Chelsea clinched last season’s title, but this looks like a much improved United team and they continued to threaten in the second half, with Fridolina Rolfö’s deflected effort looping on to the top of the bar before Park’s swerving effort flew narrowly over. Melvine Malard, on as a substitute, dragged a low shot wide with 21 minutes remaining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m not happy tonight, even if I’m smiling, just because we didn’t win the game. I don’t care about our unbeaten run.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester United WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They had suffered in the wind and rain only to take the lead through Ryan Sessegnon’s well-crafted goal. Silva’s substitutions had turned the game in Fulham’s favour, Samuel Chukwueze combining with Sessegnon almost as soon as he arrived into a pitched battle of a contest.Step forward Antoine Semenyo, one of the Premier League’s players of the season so far. His slaloming run down the byline and drop of the shoulder confounded Bernd Leno to score from the narrowest of angles. Next, the Ghanaian sent Justin Kluivert away to smash in a gorgeous long-range strike. Semenyo’s injury-time second, from a trademark warp-speed counter, supplied by another sub in Ben Gannon-Doak, completed a sweet home win. Bournemouth climbed tosecond in the table, only Liverpool above them. Just when Fulham were set for fourth time lucky they were denied by Iraola’s expert in-game management, greater depth of resources and a match-winner in Semenyo.Premier League team news: predicted lineups for the weekend actionRead more“He is incredible,” said Kluivert, no slouch himself, of Semenyo. “He shows it every game now. He is just world class.”Iraola said: “He has been improving every season, every season he has got better. I make him not look too much at the numbers. If we are playing well collectively, the numbers will arrive.”For a sodden Silva, clad all evening in a light sweater that would have needed to be wrung out because of the inclement conditions, his kingdom for a striker. An injury crisis among his centre-forwards meant Josh King, Fulham’s shining star this season, was pushed into an unfamiliar, withdrawn striker/false 9 role unsuited to the teenager’s skill set at this early stage. “This moment of the season is very difficult for us,” Silva said.Despite the elite’s asset-stripping of last season’s team, Iraola’s squad is now more robust. His changes when chasing the game provided testament. “We have lost some important players but we have connected well since the start of the season,” Semenyo said. “It has been a great start and a great environment to be part of.”Second-half substitutes Ryan Christie, Kluivert and Alejandro Jiménez each arrived to play a part in Bournemouth’s decisive, deadly acceleration away from Fulham. The Basque manager’s brand of high-pressing football will cause wear and tear, and where last winter Bournemouth could barely field a team, he currently has the luxury of rotation and tactical switches. The results so far are almost as glowing as his reputation. “When you are losing, you have to try to change the game,” said Iraola.View image in fullscreenJustin Kluivert scores Bournemouth’s second goal.Photograph: Ian Walton/ReutersAt Bournemouth last season a clerical error meant Fulham subbed the wrong player – Sessegnon rather than Sasa Lukic. Silva did not contain his rage when the latter suffered an early muscle injury. His team’s inability to hold the ball in the first half further darkened his mood. “We had moments to punish them and missed the last pass,” said Silva.Bournemouth were equally blunted, as can happen with a team whose best football comes when Iraola’s players build to crescendos. There can be flat spots. Amid night air filled with drizzle courtesy of Storm Amy, there was frustration. Evanilson, Bournemouth’s striker, struggled for supply. A half of three shots on target, Alex Iwobi scuffing the last, ground to a soggy, merciful halt. “Not a lot was happening,” shrugged Iraola.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Things could only get better? Certainly. When Evanilson’s flying volley hit the side-netting, he inadvertently triggered the Vitality video screens into errant goal celebrations. Real excitement would come soon enough.Jiménez and Kluivert arrived on 60 minutes, Iraola asking the Milan loanee to overlap from right-back, Kluivert to get closer to Evanilson than Marcus Tavernier, who had departed. Silva’s fresh arrivals were the summer additions Kevin and Chukwueze.Did we need to talk about Kevin? It was Chukwueze’s smart exchange with Sessegnon that broke the deadlock. “The 1-0 was a great collective goal from us and then after two individual moments they decide the game,” said Silva.Iraola’s response was to gamble again, take off defensive-minded players in Marcos Senesi and Tyler Adams, and replace them with Gannon-Doak and Christie. “You have to take a risk, there is no other option,” he said. That fresh injection of the talent his squad continue to boast set the stage for Semenyo to further Bournemouth’s rise.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A video on social mediashows Shaw, wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, shouting for help as the swarm of officers move to apprehend him.The 35-year-old from Dallas, Texas, is facing the possibility of the death penalty or a long spell behind bars. He was a key member of Prawira Bandung, who won the Indonesian Basketball League (IBL) in 2023, and hehas scoredmore than 1,000 points over three seasons in the country. But now he is languishing in pre-trial detention and is banned for life from the IBL.“I use cannabis as a medicine,” he told the Guardian over the phone from a prison just outside Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, in his first comments to the press since his May arrest. “I havean inflammatory condition called Crohn’s disease that’s incurable. There’s no medicine apart from cannabis that stops my stomach from aching.”During the off-season Shaw lives in Thailand, where cannabis is subject tomore liberal laws. He says he had endured the pain of going without cannabis in previous campaigns in Indonesia but says that health reasons spurred him to import the intercepted supply of 132 gummies this year. “I made a stupid mistake,” he says.But that mistake should not warrant the death penalty or a long spell in prison, he says. “There’s people telling me I’m about to spend the rest of my life in prison over some edibles,” he says. “I’ve never been through anything like this.” In the first two months after his arrest, he was at “the lowest point in [my] life” and in a “really dark mental place”.“I felt helpless and alone,” he says. “I didn’t want to wake up again.” But through prayer and his faith, as well as access to a prison gym, he is starting to feel himself again, even while the 6ft 11in athlete shares a cramped cell with a dozen men. “I just turned 35 but I still feel young,” says the former Utah State basketballer, who has played in Argentina, Japan, Turkey, Thailand and Tunisia. “I would love to continue my basketball career.”Shaw, who plays as a center or power forward, says cannabis helps ease his anxiety and depression, as well as insomnia and the pain from Crohn’s. “I don’t use it to have fun and go party,” he says. “With my stomach condition, sometimes it’s hard for me to keep food down or go to the toilet. It just soothes the pain a little bit.”Indonesia takes a hard line on drugs and carried out executions in 2016,by firing squad, of an Indonesian and three foreigners convicted of drug offenses. More than 500 people – including almost 100 foreigners – are on death row in the country, mostly for drug-related crimes.Indonesian police have said that Shaw sent text messages to his teammates saying that he would share some of the cannabis candies with them. “What they consider drugs, I consider medicine,” says Shaw. “It’s just different cultures.”After Shaw’s arrest, Ronald Sipayung, the Soekarno-Hatta Airport police chief, told reporters that the American could face life in prison or even the death penalty if found guilty. “We are still running the investigation to uncover the international drugs network behind this case and to stop its distribution,” Sipayung said.Shawwas swiftly paradedat a press conference, appearing with his hands cuffed wearing an orange prison-issue T-shirt and a black face mask. He stood with his back to the audience as police chiefs exhibited the cannabis gummies, which weigh 869 grams in total and are worth $400.He said that to charge him with possession of almost a kilo of cannabis is unjust and “sick”, given that most of the weight is made up by the gummies themselves rather than the cannabis content. “I’ve been charged for almost a kilo,” he says. “I didn’t have anything near that.”Shawis fundraisingto cover his rising legal fees. He has not yet appeared in court despite being arrested five months ago, and he is still waiting for a first appearance date. “They’re making it seem like I’m this big drug dealer,” he says. “Why would I bring the candy here to sell? It was for personal use.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Around the world, people are serving extreme sentences for non-violent cannabis offenses that pose no threat to public safety.” Even in the US, she added, tens of thousandsremain incarceratedfor cannabis offences despite recreational legalization in almost half of states and a medical greenlight in all but two. “These punishments run counter to international human rights standards,” Shepard said.The potential efficacy of cannabis on Crohn’s disease is understudied but in September the journal Nature Medicinepublished a paperon a study which found that cannabis can ease chronic lower back pain without serious side effects. It came as Donald Trumptalked upthe benefits of cannabis-based medicines.There are parallels between Shaw’s case and that of Brittney Griner, the decorated American basketball player who was imprisoned in Russia for 10 months in 2022 after authorities found cannabis vape cartridges in her luggage.Griner was eventually releasedas part of a prisoner swap involving a Russian weapons trafficker.“Jarred has always been one of the most generous and selfless people you could meet,” his friend, Bree Petruzio, said on Shaw’s fundraising page. “Jarred made a mistake. But I don’t believe that mistake should cost him his entire future.”The US embassy in Jakarta says it is aware of Shaw’s case but would not comment further.Donte West, an advocacy assistant at LPP who is handling Shaw’s case, said: “Cannabis can’t kill you, but possessing it can. We must get as much attention on this case in the hope that a positive resolution will set a powerful precedent. I’m dedicated to making sure Jarred gets home to his mother.”The Indonesian National Police did not respond to a request for comment for this story.Explore more on these topicsBasketballUS sportsCollege sportsIndonesiaAsia PacificDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

United have won two of their opening seven matches in the current campaign, which includes aCarabao Cup exit at Grimsby, and theirdefeat by Brentford last Saturdayextended Amorim’s search for his first back-to-back league victories since arriving 11 months ago. Sunderland visit Old Trafford on Saturday and another defeat would put Amorim under greater scrutiny.Time to be brave: the tactical tweaks Amorim needs to make at Manchester United | Daniel HarrisRead moreAmorim, asked whether he would consider resigning, said: “No, that is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard, not to create the momentum. It’s so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, something happens. That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here. But that is not my decision and I think it would be really hard to leave if I don’t do everything to follow my career here.“It’s a dream to be here and I want to continue here and I want to fight for this. But the problem is now what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job. You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don’t have that feeling.”The 40-year-old also launched an impassioned defence of his 3-4-3 system, which has been the focus of much criticism. Amorim has used the formation in every game and it is yet to provide the consistency craved.“Nobody here is naive,” Amorim said. “We understand that we need results to continue the project. We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it’s hard, the balance is really hard. What I want is to see my team – winning or losing – playing the same way and we are not doing that.”Amorim pointed out that United had played in different systems under previous managers, also without success. “We need to play the same way, with the same power, with the same intensity, with the same focus. If we do that, it doesn’t matter what the system is.”He confirmed plans to play lucrative mid-season friendlies to help boost funds lost by not qualifying for Europe. “We have to do it and we knew it when we miss Europe,” he said. “We have our fans and our budget and we want to be with our fans around the world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet that loyalty caused an inevitable stir when he decided not to restore some of his ­biggest creative talents on Friday. There was no place for ­Bellingham, who has started only once for Real Madrid this season, and no return for Phil Foden despite the attacker’s resurgence at Manchester City.Tuchel was partially able to put Bellingham’s absence down to ­fitness. However, it was clear to the German that the Madrid midfielder wanted to be called up when the pair spoke on the phone. Tuchel apologised to Bellingham in August for saying that the player’s “edge” can come across in a waythat “can be a bit repulsive”. This time Tuchel was keen to stress there is no problem between him and the 22-year-old but he came ready to defend the omission of England’s player of the year for 2024-25.Quick GuideEngland squadShowGoalkeepers: Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), James Trafford (Manchester City)Defenders: Dan Burn (Newcastle United), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal), Jarell Quansah (Bayer Leverkusen), Djed Spence (Tottenham Hotspur), John Stones (Manchester City)Midfielders: Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest), Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest), Jordan Henderson (Brentford), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Milan), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa)Forwards: Jarrod Bowen (West Ham United), Eberechi Eze (Arsenal), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle United), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Marcus Rashford (Barcelona, loan from Manchester United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We’re building the best team,” said Tuchel, who was even more forthright when it was put to him that sides who win the World Cup tend to pick their most dangerous ­forwards. “Do you have proof of that?” he said. “It doesn’t count what we did in the last camp? I have proof that last camp was our best camp. I stick with the squad.”Tuchel believes the win over ­Serbia provided enough evidence not to pick Bellingham and Foden. ­Everton’s Jack Grealish was also left out.“Don’t you think that ­behaviour on the bench, support from the bench, support from training, the ­competition, the ­togetherness ­enables the 11 to play like they played?” he said. “I strongly believe that. I felt it in ­Belgrade, behind me on the bench. It’s not against Phil, it’s not against Jack, it’s not against Jude. Even if you can turn it around and say it is, it is not. It is for the guys who were in camp and who performed at this kind of level.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Bukayo Saka celebrates with Martin Ødegaard after scoring against Olympiakos.Photograph: Nigel French/Getty Images/AllstarTuchel indicated that the ­situation might have been the same if ­Bellingham was fully fit. “It would have been a different basis, but it could have been the same ­outcome,” he said. Emphasising he has no ­personal issue with Bellingham, he said: “To make it fully clear, we can have the same harmony, the same level of performance with him.”England have plenty of options at No 10 – Morgan Rogers excelled against Serbia, Eberechi Eze and Morgan Gibbs-White have retained their spots – and Tuchel pointed out he had to reward those who have proved themselves to him.“What would be my ­explanation to leave them out and also be ­authentic in my words?” he said. “After the ­Serbia match I went into the dressing room and I told them what I told you. Imagine then I have a phone call and leave four ­players out. What would you think as a player? For credibility as a coach you need to walk the talk.”The only change was enforced, the injured Madueke dropping out for Saka, who has recovered from a ­hamstring strain. Tuchel, who insisted this squad should not ­automatically be read as a sign of his intentions for next summer’s World Cup, is keeping his players on their toes. He said there was a chance Saka would have missed out if Madueke were fit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palmer has been unavailable for five of the past seven England camps, raising the prospect of him falling out of Tuchel’s plans given that there are only two camps before the World Cup after this month. Tuchel said he did not expect Palmer to play for Chelsea against Nottingham Forest on 18 October.Tuchel says he’ll be ‘brave’ enough to omit big names if it’s right for EnglandRead moreTuchel did not name a direct replacement at full-back for the injured Tino Livramento. John Stones is back at centre-back after pulling out last month. Tuchel spoke to Foden, Grealish, Adam Wharton, Trevoh Chalobah and Curtis Jones about leaving them out but did not call Burnley’s Kyle Walker about his second consecutive omission.Tuchel said he was in favour of England’s games at the World Cup kicking off as late as possible because of concerns over heat in Canada, Mexico and the US, even though fixtures starting in the small hours or middle of the night in the UK would cause complications for domestic supporters and broadcasters.“I know the fans will not like it but for us it’s better if we play later,” Tuchel said. “For everyone it’s better to play later. If you do a run at 2pm in Charlotte then you know. We have put the players first. The players are the game and we have to protect the game.“Midnight here, I understand that it’s bad for our fans, it’s bad for the children, bad for the young people who go to school, very bad. There will be a lot of drop-outs the next day at school.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelJude BellinghamnewsShareReuse this content"

Withstanding the pressure may yet prove the difference between McLaren’s Lando Norris andOscar Piastrias the title battle ratchets up with every race.Including this weekend’s meeting in Singapore at the Marina Bay circuit, seven grands prix remain and the championship is finely poised. Piastri leads his teammate by 25 points. Both are free to race each other and with Max Verstappen still a distant 69 in arrears, it is a head-to-head battle, with little to choose between them.Aston Martin chief claims Horner is ringing ‘every team owner’ in F1 for a jobRead moreF1’s most experienced and successful drivers know this scenario all too well. In 2007, when Lewis Hamilton narrowly missed winning the championship in the final race at Brazil in his debut season, it taught him the unique challenge of a title tilt.“I remember the buildup to those races at the end and the pressure was there,” he said. “That was not needed. If I knew then what I know now, I would have easily won that championship, I think. I have learned not to add pressure that’s unnecessary.”Welcome then, Norris and Piastri, to the cauldron. The advantage thus far has swung between them. Norris has five wins to Piastri’s seven and the pair have barely been off the podium in aMcLarenthat has been the class of the field. Piastri has been more consistent, with his British rival struggling to adapt to a lack of feel for grip from the front axle. Nonetheless, they have dominated, the difference between them often only which could deliver flawlessly, across qualifying and the race.In this regard Norris has been found wanting,small errors were costly in China, more so after a poor qualifying in Bahrain and worse still when losing the championship lead aftercrashing out in qualifying in Saudi Arabia. Then, worst of all, over-eagerin Canada he hit his teammateand went out, an enormous blow.Piastri, in only his third season in F1, has been more comfortable. For some timesliding off at the season opener in the wet in Melbournewas his only fault and one which was forgivable in the sudden rain. Later, the Australian was also caught out and passed by anopportunistic Verstappen at Imola, while his misjudgment and penalty for “erratic braking” under the safety car atSilverstone cost him a likely win.View image in fullscreenMcLaren’s title hopefuls, Oscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris, could learn a lot from looking at how Lewis Hamilton (right) handled the pressure in his early title victories.Photograph: Anton Vaganov/ReutersHowever, these were minor hiccups against something of a debacle atthe last round in Baku. In Azerbaijan, Piastri crashed out in qualifying leaving him ninth on the grid, only to follow it with a false start, the car entering anti-stall and dropping him to the back of the field.Chasing places on the opening lap, he misjudged the grip and ended in the barriers, an uncharacteristic sequence of errors that he acknowledged he could ill afford in Singapore this week.“Baku was quite a good reminder of how quickly everything can change,” he said. “There’s some lessons about how I can deal with that better and lessons on risk I guess is the best way to put it. There’s nothing revolutionary that needs to change or that I am going to change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The opening years of Hamilton’s career were exceptional, but he also made his fair share of errors. Piastri could take note ofBahrain in 2008, the year the seven-time champion took his first title but which was marked by other mistakes as he found himself in an intense fight with Felipe Massa.On the grid in Manama he had failed to correctly set the launch control on his McLaren and it went into anti-stall, dropping him down the grid. Shortly afterwards, chasing places, he clipped the back of Fernando Alonso’s Renault and had to pit with a damaged front wing. He finished 13th after a race he described as “a disaster”.Similarly Verstappen’s early career was marked by misjudgments as he learned his craft. After one costly crash in Monaco in 2018 then team principal Christian Horner publicly demanded his driver demonstrate more discipline.Verstappen, too, took it on board, the waywardness all but gone when he began winning titles. “This has just been character-building,” he said at the time. “Throughout my life there have been periods of character-building and this was another step. Sometimes, it is not enjoyable but sometimes you need it.”Norris and Piastri are not up with Hamilton and Verstappen yet but they are under the same pressure and learning the same lessons. As Niki Lauda noted, the first title is always the hardest. Closing this one out is the biggest challenge of their careers and will probably fall to the one who can best handle the heat.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarennewsShareReuse this content"

How are things now, your ladyship?Marina HydeAfter a company she was linked to was ordered to repay £122m it made from pandemic deals, the baroness has embarked on a masterclass in victimhoodFri 3 Oct 2025 10.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.06 EDTShareBy their own accounts, there have been two Westminster-adjacent victims of inflammatory language this week. One is the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, hurt to the point of requiring smelling salts by some politically commonplacewords spokenby the prime minister. And the other is legally besieged bra baroness Michelle Mone, who has always been performatively sensitive, with chaos as her rising sign.Alas, far from their shared victimhood drawing our two snowflakes closer together, in Michelle, we may have finally found the Tory from whom Nigel would not accept a defection to Reform. Which really means something, considering Britain’s would-be next prime minister currently has precisely zero peers in the House of Lords. Like thePPE she providedduring the pandemic, Michelle would be deemed incredibly expensive and absolutely unusable.Not that you’d get that vibe from theletter she sentto Keir Starmer this week, claiming that Rachel Reeves reportedly mentioning a “vendetta” against her retaining her peerage was a security threat. This began, amazingly, with the words: “I am writing to you … first as a wife, second as a mother, and lastly as a baroness …”Surely writing at least second-and-a-halfly as a Range Rover driver? After all, in an earlier statement this week, Michelle had battled to get the public on side with a helpful analogy about the wrongness of the judge who had just ordered a company to which she and her husband, Doug Barrowman, were linked to repay £122m to the Department of Health for providing some defective surgical gowns. “To use a simple analogy,” her ladyship began promisingly in a diatribe against the “establishment”, “if a car looks, feels and drives like, say, a Range Rover, then unless you can show how the car is assembled by the manufacturer, it’s not a Range Rover.”Nope, I’ve read that 15 times and I’m still no clearer. Maybe we would be on safer ground if we just pictured the specific Range Rover. I’m getting strong notes ofOverfinch L460, maybe customised with monogrammed quilted leather and Swarovski crystal wheel caps. I also sense we peasants wouldn’t even be allowed to touch it unless we were wearing protective clothing – obviously sourced from a firm where it actually worked.That said, and partly because she can’t help herself, it does feel as though we focus more on Michelle than Doug Barrowman, the person whose wife she’s firstly speaking as. If you can’t immediately picture Doug, he’s a striking confection of tweed and Turkey teeth, and it’s fairly difficult to get past the fact that his house boasts a new-build amphitheatre. But then, the Mone-Barrowmans always wanted to tell us how very, very rich they were, and how very, very well they were doing. They gave theirfirst joint interviewto Hello! long before they were engaged, pictured standing not just in front of their Isle of Man McMansion, but in front of their Ferrari. “I feel like I’m in a fairytale,” revealed Michelle, “a beautiful dream I don’t ever want to wake up from.”Oh dear. Flash forward to the last time the couple attempted a spirited defence of their Covid antics, during an absolute helicopter crash of a BBC interview two years ago, and we findDoug saying: “There’s a reason why I live in the Isle of Man. I don’t want anyone in the press to know of any business activity or anything that I get engaged in.” Again: oh dear.So these are testing times over at Hubris Towers. Whither the yacht Michelle posted a picture of herself on during the pandemic? Caption: “Business isn’t easy. But it is rewarding.” Apparently the good ship Lady M has now been sold, as Doug has liquidated anestimated £80m of thingslike a private jet and a £41m Caribbean villa. This reportedly happened shortly after a separate£75m of the couple’s properties and accountswere frozen as part of a National Crime Agency investigation (Mone and Barrowman deny any criminal wrongdoing). But don’t get your hopes up – it feels unlikely lawyers will ever “pierce the corporate veil” and get all the money back from such personal assets.If you liked Brexit, you’re going to love what the Conservatives want next | Polly ToynbeeRead moreAs for the wider context, it’s strange. No one more than the Conservative government of the day encouraged us to think of the pandemic as a war. You’d think the possibility of mass viral death was a sufficiently horrifying novelty not to require a metaphor to bring it home. But war they called it, andbattle languagewas everywhere. Unfortunately, instead of Winston Churchill, we had Boris Johnson, and instead of remembering the revulsion towards profiteers in the wake of the second world war, we had something called “the VIP lane” for Covid contracts. This went … badly. If you haven’t watched ITV’s new documentary on the Covid contracts,Follow the Money, I strongly recommend it as a faultless roundup and exploration of what one contributor classes as “probably the biggest misspending scandal in the UK of all time”, from PPE to Covid tests, with particular emphasis on that VIP lane.The people who jostled their way into this lane for a grotesquely outsize cash bonanza and then boasted abouthelping the nationwere profiteering, plain and simple – and there were a lot more of them than just Michelle Mone. She isn’t being scapegoated, as she claims. But so many others have got away with it.Michelle doesn’t know where the profiteer bodies other than her own are buried, or she’d be out there digging them up with her bare hands so she wouldn’t be the only one in the limelight. But the people who did it do. How relieved they must be that their misdeeds are buried in the Covid bad-memory hole, stuck in the mind-wipe warehouse like the ark at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A structure that, ironically, does not look like it would be remotely big enough to hold all the useless stuff purchased – or all the money they fleeced off this country.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Tories’ new proposals will end the party for goodFri 3 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 08.48 EDTShareBrexit is never over and it’s about to get a bit worse. As the moribund Tories assemble this Sunday, it’s still their only tune, as if they haven’t noticed how the public mood has changed. Brexit is the root cause of all their woes, with almost all the 61% of those people who call it a failureblaming the Conservatives the most.But instead of recanting, rethinking, questioning their recent history, they double down, with Kemi Badenoch now following Robert Jenrick deeper into the Farage darkness witha pledgeto leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR). That double dose of Brexit will sink not save them.If people needed reminders of what Brexit has done to us all, 12 October will come as a jolt. That’s when the EU finally begins its long-delayed stricter border checks, witha new entry-exit system (EES). At the border, the system will take not just passports, but fingerprints and photographs, storing data to enforce the rule that no Britons can stay in the Schengen area formore than 90 out of any 180 days. (Take note,opponents of digital IDs: it’s already there for anyone holidaying on the continent.) A€20, three-year visais due to come in next year. Thank you, David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.Expect delays and gridlock, especially in Dover and Folkstone. But it will be worst for those crisscrossing the border often. Road hauliers are among occupations urging the government on in its EU negotiations to make exceptions for professions that need to travel frequently. Checks will come on top of the monumental paperworkBrexithas made hauliers take with every pallet.Coaches taking people on EU holidays (bar Ireland and Cyprus) or children on school trips will be badly disrupted. Jason Edwards, a coach operator in Pontypridd, is distraught: “We have primary school kids, often travelling in the early hours, who sleep through. Now they’ll have to all get out at 2 or 3am, and queue to be checked with their ID.” He says Dover last summer was already a logjam.He has 20 coaches staffed by 70 drivers, two of whom travel to the continent every week on 14-day tours, before resting and setting off again. They are restricted by their 90-day limit. “We need the EU to give us a special worker’s permit,” he said. The effect of Brexit, “has stopped a lot of our growth potential”.Along with the movement of goods and people, services – Britain’s biggest export category – are severely restricted by the time limit. Take Rolls-Royce: it doesn’t just sell engines, but services planes, too, sending engineers back and forth across the English Channel all the time, says John Springford of the Centre for European Reform. He lists consultants and accountants going back and forth to clients in the Schengen area, as well as UK events companies transporting performers and orchestras to venues around Europe. He says they are losing out massively to EU operators. Nothing can bring back lost trade exceptrejoining the customs union and the single market, he adds.Here’s theOffice for Budget Responsibility assessment: “Our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK imports and exports will both be 15% lower than if we had remained in the EU.” That 15% loss in trade leads to “a 4% reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy”.It takes time to negotiate when 27 countries have to agree – and frankly, why would they push British deals and British concerns up their crowded agenda? Especially when they can see Nigel Farage and the Tories advocating an ever-widening Channel. They can see how leaving the ECHR would be a repeat of the trauma caused by Brexit. Catherine Barnard, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge, warns of the consequences: leaving the convention would end any prospect of better deals for animal and plant trade. The price of food and other goods would rise, she believes, as trade falls. There’s more: she thinks the Good Friday agreement would fall apart overnight; the ECHR runs through it “as in a stick of rock”. And the fallout in retaliation would include losing data exchange on crime, and the ability to extradite criminals.You might expect business to speak out against the prospect of leaving the ECHR. But so far, barely a murmur. The CBI supported aBrexit reset last May, and has said the Tories’proposed abolitionof the Climate Change Act would be “a backwards step”, but has not said anything about leaving the ECHR. The Institute of Directors likewise – as in its catastrophic silence in the EU referendum. It would seem that some of the latter’s members are divided ideologically, and some fear a boycott by rightwing customers. Its members will pay a price if Reform UK ever comes to power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not because I have finally found my (spectator) sport – my patriotic and competitive instincts remain unstirred regardless of which sex is playing and with what shaped balls – but because, as an older sister, I am always here for first-borns asserting their God-given right to mess with the rest (the intruders, the interlopers, the destroyers of peace and maternal patience, call them what you will).And here Chris Dow, the brother of wing wonder and arch-finisher (I have stolen these terms from sports reports and hope they are correct) Abby Dow, has been delivering in spades. From the semi-finals onwards, he turned up in costumes supporting his baby sister’s opposing team: against France he was,naturellement, dressed as Napoleon and in the final against Canada he was in full Mountie regalia.As I have always told my own younger sister as I’ve set out to ruin her birthday parties, first visits home with boyfriends (they’re my favourites) and assorted other occasions of importance to her, this is how we show love and support. It’s oblique, sure. But heartfelt. So stop crying. God, MUM, will you TELL her?TuesdayA new capsule hotel, the Zedwell, has opened in London’s Piccadilly. It offers a bed for the night – and a shared bathroom down the hall – in the centre of town for just £30 a pop for people in the capital and on a budget.This is the dream. I always thought I’d have to build it myself but now the introverts’ hotel is here. Because what do we – who will crawl over broken glass to get home to our own beds after any extended period of socialising – need far more often than a place to crash overnight? We need a dark, silent pod for a few hours in which to be alone, recover our poise, cry, maybe nap, probably read a book, sometimes just stare at a wall.But costs have, until now, been prohibitive and we have always had to struggle through an entire day in the throbbing metropolis without any escape. Now, for roughly the price of a Pret croissant, you can have a 2m x1m x1m room of your own instead. Split the cost with other misanthropes and take it in two-hour shifts and it costs pennies to each save your sanity. This is a great day, my non-claustrophobic friends. A great day indeed.View image in fullscreen‘Wait, what? “Cut the half-time oranges”? Is that what he’s talking about? Hold my flag …’Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesWednesdayPinch, punch, first day of the month, no returns! The kind of people who say this – especially with the accompanying actions – are a large part of the reason I wish to seal myself in hotel pod at any given moment, of course, but the fact remains, October is here. Or, as it is now more widely know,Stoptober. Or Sober October. It has become the month where everyone tries to prove we’re not a nation of functioning alcoholics and can lay off the booze any time without difficulty.Don’t. Do it in November. Keep drinking this month while there are plenty of designated drivers around, and enjoy yourself. In November, you can lay off the sauce and repay the favours, reaping by your very rarity a fuller harvest of gratitude and obligation that will pay off in its own turn in December. Thus you will be able to stay cocooned in a snug, mulled-wine haze throughout peak festive season. Almost as good as a pod, trust me.ThursdayThere is so little in the news not to care about these days that I cherish stories that fall into this disappearing category like the rare jewels they are. So then, to the tale of Windsor Great Park’s new exclusion zone.The Prince and Princess of Wales, you may have heard, have eschewed the palace lifestyle on offer to the heir to the throne and are moving – or have moved (because who cares! You see?) – into their eight-bedroom “forever home” in the great park instead. In order to protect their privacy, however, a fenced border has been set up around the house. Cross that and you’ll be off to the tower.No, not really. But you’d think so, from the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth that’s going on. Dog walkers object to having less space to walk their dogs. Car parkers are objecting to having less space to park their cars. Those who fall into both groups are probably on tranquillisers.For the rest of us: a beautiful nothing of a story in the papers. Something to read and feel not the slightest scintilla of emotional disturbance in your veins. A safe place to rest your eyes. A gift. Enjoy.View image in fullscreen‘You’ve broken it, George. You became too handsome at last and you broke the lens with your beauty. Occupational hazard, don’t worry about it.’Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/ShutterstockFridayA friend has introduced me to the concept of defining your age by much more useful metrics than simply years. For example, we determined that we are both old enough to think forever that lattes are pretentious and vegetarianism faintly absurd, because we came of age before these things were commonplace. If you remember a practice taking hold in your lifetime, you will never take it truly seriously.I’m also old enough to boggle at the sight of my child pouring himself a drink of orange juice from the fridge as if it were nothing, to feel slightly anxious at being out and about without an emergency 10p for the phone, and to think of applying anything more sophisticated than deodorant and Nivea to my person as the last word in sybarism.It’s a much more effective way of finding your people than going by birth date alone, allowing for a little bit more connection (young conservative types can bond with aged normals, for example) and a little less wasted time on small talk. And who, especially at our age, doesn’t want that?Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekEngland women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

The shock was that it was over £5.Coffee hasn’t really been cheap for ages, forcomplex reasons– post-pandemic inflation, a Russian war pushing up energy prices, a climate crisis having an effect on coffee bean growth, last year’s budget tax hikes – that capture the bitter flavours of the last few years in a cup. Less predatory capitalism, more global problems coming home to roost. But still, north of a fiver, for caffeinated cereal juice? I felt like the eight-year-old whoseoutraged reactionto ice-cream van prices – “NINE POUND FOR TWO?” – went viral last summer on TikTok.This isn’t going to be a column about how millennials could all be homeowners if they bought fewer flat whites, nor an invitation to play the world’s smallest violin for the not-that-squeezed middle classes when so many people are properly on the breadline. Rather, it’s about the strangely mood-dampening effect of little everyday treats beginning to feel unjustifiable, even for people who aren’t watching every penny; how that makes life feel more grey and drab, undermining any optimism about how the country is doing more broadly. For many gen Xers it feels oddly like sliding back towards the land of our childhoods, where eating out was strictly for the most special occasions, your mum took a Thermos of Nescafé along on every outing, and normal people painted their own nails rather than getting them done on the high street. Were the consumer boom years of our 20s and 30s not in fact a new bountiful norm to which we’ll eventually somehow return but, in retrospect, more of a blip?It’s not just coffee. This week Gregg’sannounced price rises, blaming the recent rise in employers’ national insurance – and if you don’t see why the cost of breakfast is politically salient, you have forgotten that half a million people signed a petition protesting against George Osborne’spasty taxin 2012 – while Tesco CEO Ken Murphy observed that its customers seem to be sticking with cost-of-living crisis habits, such as eating in instead of going out. “Do you feel sad at being priced out of little luxuries?” asked a plaintiveMumsnet threadrecently, in which users talked about giving up the little dopamine hits that used to brighten the day: a glossy magazine to read in the bath, meeting a friend for a glass of wine, cinema tickets, fresh flowers that aren’t a £1 bunch of supermarket daffodils. Small things, but important precisely because they’re small, which makes them the sort of things people in not flashy but solid full-time jobs ought to be able to do and have. Things that make the difference between just treading water financially, and living. It might or might not be entirely a coincidence that 23% of Mumsnet users polled in September said they weren’t sure how they would vote in an election, giving “don’t know” a lead over every other party.As the veteran consumer journalist Harry Walloppointed out this week, lunch for a family of four at an ordinary chain restaurant – a Pizza Express or a Bella Italia, somewhere you might take the kids at half-term – is now routinely through the psychologically important £100 barrier without booze or puddings, while the £20 pub main course is no longer confined to London. Market researchers Savanta say so-called “bill shock”, or going out for a meal that’s nothing terribly fancy and reeling at the card reader, is measurably on the rise: 43% of diners surveyed across 160 well known high street chains admitted to experiencing it, up from 30% in 2017. Bill shock is normally what happens when our inbuilt sense of what things “ought” to cost can’t quite keep up with inflation. Food-price inflation has now risenfor five months in a row, and a hospitality industry visibly anxious about this November’s budget insists that the real culprit is recent rises in employers’ national insurance and in theminimum wagebeing passed on to customers.Reeves had a wholly reasonable case last autumn for raising business taxes – ithelped her find the moneyto settle the doctors’ strike and create more hospital appointments – and successive chancellors have had, if anything, a morally stronger one for a measure putting money into the pockets of some of the people actually making £5 coffees and serving £20 pizzas. Arguably a lot of life’s little treats were in reality possible only because of cheap labour, and if the net cost of paying livable wages is that people often earning not much more than minimum wage can’t have so many nice things – well, maybe that’s what redistribution looks like in an era where chancellors are fresh out of easier options. You could even argue, as the economic gurus of what’s known as abundance theorydo, that the really joyful luxury in life isn’t retail therapy but things such as affordable homes or cheap green energy, and re-gearing economies to provide more of the latter will mean less of the former.But all that said, it’s an uphill slog to generate a feelgood sense of life getting better under Labour when quite ordinary things increasingly feel to ordinary people like guilty extravagances. Right now, it’s difficult to see how Rachel Reeves breaks out of this trap in November. But it might be time to get a Thermos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Divisive politics are openly back on the ballot paper. Labouris capitulatingto the anti-migrant talking points of Reform, all while talking the language of decency and fairness. It makes my toes curl.But I am here to do what others won’t. To tell the truth about what makes our country great and what makes it not so great. While others thrive on creating scapegoats, I am here to tell you a different story.The tapestry of cultural life in Britain is what makes our nation strong. From the doctors, nurses and carers who staff our NHS and who look after our elderly people, to the entrepreneurs, artists and teachers who enrich our culture and economy.Migrationis our DNA as a country, it is our superpower.Britain has always been built on the contribution of people who’ve arrived here to build a better life, and our future depends on us embracing that truth, not denying it. Until we do this, we will always be handwringing and trying to ineffectually factcheck Nigel Farage’sclaims about migrants.But we also need to understand the fears and worries that sit at the heart of Reform’s rise in popularity. Our rents are high and our wages are low. Our services are crumbling while our debt is growing. But these crises weren’t caused by migration. They were caused by political choices made in Westminster. It was austerity that stripped our communities bare, privatisation that handed public goods to people seeking profit, and tax breaks that showered wealth on the very richest.And yet, what makes this moment even more dangerous is that Labour, thoughclaiming to challengeReform’s poisonous narrative, is in fact echoing and enabling it. From Keir Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, for which he apologised andclaimed ignoranceto its similarity with the language of Enoch Powell, to Shabana Mahmood’s new stricter conditions on people’s right to remain in this country, Labour is indulging a politics of fear.Meanwhile, in villages, towns and cities across the UK, people are facing the same problems. Families wondering how they’ll pay the rent or the gas bill. Tenants living in mouldy homes terrified of another rent hike or eviction notice. Pensioners cutting back on heating while energy companies rake inastronomical profits.Labour directs them to be angry at those who have less than them – making demonstrably false claims that “cheap overseas labour” is driving down wages. I say the opposite. We are now one of the most unequal countries in Europe. The richest 1% hold more wealth than the bottom70% combined. Public services are stretched to breaking point, butprivate shareholders keep cashing in. It is not a lack of resources. It is a lack of political will from the very politicians who take money from the richest 1%.There is an alternative. One set out this weekend in Bournemouth, where a record number ofGreen partymembers are expected to attend our annual conference. A wealth tax on the richest 1% to fund public services. An end to rip-off privatisation so water, rail and energy work for people, not shareholders. Universal free childcare, to give every child the best start, and every parent real freedom. Rent controls and investment in warm, affordable homes. Real investment in green jobs and infrastructure, and a Green New Deal that doesn’t just cut carbon but transforms communities, lowers bills and creates opportunity.This isn’t just possible. It is essential.And that’s why the elections in May 2026 matter so much. Because when Farage’s politics of division are rising, and whenLabouris too timid to resist, it falls to the Greens to fight for something better. To stand up for hope against fear. To make the case for bold investment in people and planet. To celebrate those who choose to call Britain their home and who help to make us the great country we are.The truth is simple: Britain is not broken because of migration. Britain is broken because of inequality. Because of an economy that allows billionaires to hoard wealth while millions struggle to get by. Because of a political class that has lost its nerve and forgotten its purpose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Talk about an immaculate misconceptionFri 3 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 10.15 EDTShareIt hit me hard, out of nowhere.I’m never going to have children.I’m 55 years old; that ship has sailed. It disappeared from my biological horizon years ago – a once fertile landscape that held so much hope, promise and seemingly endless possibility.A horizon that, sadly, I took for granted.Did I forget to wind my biological clock? I admit to hearing it ticking, but at some point the throes of everyday life and loss drowned out the alarm until it eventually perished in the menopausal desert.Game over.I should have switched to a digital clock at some point but I’m a proud gen-Xer – we grew up on analog: rotary phones and winding our Swatch watches.You’d think I would have woken up at some point, but I didn’t.I missed the baby boat, and now I’m left standing on the midlife dock with my Hokas, a sensible hat, a comfortable mattress, and an electric toothbrush with my internal Jekyll and Hyde – the menopausal dynamic duo that have commandeered my emotional remote control and can’t agree on a channel.Just pick something already, I’m exhausted!I toggle between sadness and fury – one minute I’m weeping while watching a video of a baby elephant learning to swim with her mother, and the next I’m angry, cursing myself for not deleting Instagram and cursing Instagram for sending me the damn videos I feel compelled to watch at 2am while weeping (although at this point I’d take baby animals over wall pilates and posture-correcting bra reels any day).I say it hit me “out of nowhere”, but that’s not entirely true. What hit me was the certainty, the finite gusto of the wallop, as if someone was hammering down the final nail in theit’s never going to happen so get over itcoffin.I’m 55; of course I’ve thought about it over the years.But naively, I always figured it would just happen at some point.Talk about an immaculate misconception.I never planned tonothave children, I just never planned to have them.Herein lies my newfound remorse, and I have nobody to blame but myself.I’ve spent so many years mourning the loss of my parents, and now I’m mourning the loss of the children I never hadSince my mom passed away, I’ve missed our relationship with an excruciating pang deep in my soul, one that usually culminates in tears whenever I see a mother and daughter duo interacting (throw a grandmother in the mix and I’m a goner). At cafes, grocery stores, parks and theaters, I find myself unabashedly staring at unsuspecting strangers (one of the few upsides of menopause is theI don’t care what people thinkattitude, which is both a blessing and a curse, as I often leave the house in questionable attire). I observe their dynamic with a quiet longing – watching them laugh, chat, argue or quietly exist in each other’s orbits with the tender familiarity that I so intensely miss.I had always seen myself as the daughter in these candid scenarios, but recently the roles have been recast and I imagine myself as the mother, and if there’s a grandmother in the dynamic, I see my mother in her role (I always thought my mom would have made such a wonderful grandmother).I’ve spent so many years mourning the loss of my parents, and now I’m mourning the loss of the children I never had, and of the grandchildren that my parents would never meet.These interactions stir up an already bubbling caldron of menopause-infused emotions, and I can’t help but feel a touch of envy for the maternal bond I won’t get to experience. “You just have to meet a partner with kids, Shanti,” a friend suggested, as if it were that easy.More like grandchildren at this point, but I’m open.In these daunting days of internet dating, it’s hard enough to meet someone without piling extra condiments on to my online profile wishlist.“Menopause is about purging,” my friend suggests. “You’ll eventually come out the other end lighter, refreshed and feeling better than ever.” “Lighter” and “refreshed”? I’d say more like plump, overheated and in need of a really long nap.As many times as I’ve heard the spiel about how I’m going to emerge from this mythical “menopause chrysalis” like a butterfly ready to take on midlife heaven, when you’re on the hot flash seat with no eject button, it feels more like being stuck in hell.“This too shall pass.” I hear my mom’s voice whispering words of maternal wisdom in my ear, and I realize that she never left.Maybe my friend is right, and I am “purging”, but coming to grips with the enviable is challenging at any age, and I’m still waiting for AARP to send me a midlife roadmap.And although I’ll never give birth, I’m forever thankful for all of those mothers who did.Shanti Nelson is a writer and photographerExplore more on these topicsAgeingOpinionParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

This is misguided – Irish is a portal to a world of imaginationFri 3 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.04 EDTShareAmid a boom in Irish culture across music, literature, film and fashion, the Irish language – Gaeilge – is also experiencing a revival. Once the majority’s native tongue, it was assailed and diminished as a daily, working, spoken language under British colonialism and became largely confined to rural west coast districts for much of the 20th century, kept alive by generations of families. But over recent decadesthe number ofschools teaching the national curriculum exclusively through Irish has risen significantly, from fewer than 20 in the 1970s, to more than 200 today. The 2022 census showeda 6% increasein the number of people able to speak Irish compared with 2016. Irish is a core subject on the curriculum and compulsory in all schools.Yet in the academic year of 2024-25, a record number of pupils –14% of the post-primaryschool population – were granted exemptions from studying Irish, a record number. This makes me sad for the young people who will miss out – not just on the growing professional opportunities it provides, but the richness of the language and the window into Irish culture it cracks open.The number of Ukrainians now attending school in Ireland explains at least some of the rise in numbers seeking to opt out. There areclose to 7,000 Ukrainian pupilsin post-primary schools across the country. Exemptions can only be sought if a student was born outside Ireland, was educated outside Ireland for a significant period, or has needs that affect learning a language.And yet many Ukrainians are of course learning and studying Irish – along withsignificant numbers of Poles and Latvians.The broader issue is a longstanding and systemic one, where the language – despite its growing popularity – is still not seen as a priority by some Irish parents, or is perceived as overly challenging or even superfluous. Some parents, focused on exam points their children need to access university courses, argue that Irish should be optional.How the language is taught in schools has been a matter of debate since the foundation of the state a century ago. For decades, the same grievances have been repeated, with some justification: primarily that while Irish language, literature and poetry are studied, there isn’t enough emphasis on everyday usage, meaning young people can be “learning” Irish for a decade, yet many still emerge without basic conversational skills. Pupils take an oral test in their final exams, yet stock phrases and rote learning remain a feature of schooling.I attended a post-primary Gaelscoil (Irish-medium school) in Dublin in the 1990s into the 2000s. This was not perceived as fashionable. Studying one’s entire curriculum through Irish was sometimes viewed as idiosyncratic or nationalistic. But the language was a shared code among my school friends, and I maintained it on leaving school. It opened up opportunities. I presented a music show for Ireland’s Irish-language television broadcaster, TG4, and this year, for the first time, I am writing in Irish for print, as the Irish Times launched a weekly Irish-language supplement, calledScéal(Story).Although I still struggle with rustiness and confidence in speaking and writing the language, “keeping” and not “losing” my Irish is probably the greatest gift I have given myself. Irish is a portal, a lyrical language intrinsically connected to the natural world. Early Irish literature is among the oldest vernacular literature in westernEurope. As a spoken language, Irish predates English by a millennium. Its early writing system, Ogham, written vertically as a series of lines and strokes, has an alphabet based on trees. The first letter isbeith, meaning birch. There’sdairmeaning oak,coll, meaning hazel, and so on.Nature and the environment permeate the language viscerally. The word for photography,grianghrafadóireacht, literally means to make a chart of the sun. English has nothing on the spirit of Irish phrases, and the fun, evocative, poetic journeys they can take. Many of these were given new life when the writer and documentary maker Manchán Magan (who sadlydied this week) published his landmark book,Thirty-Two Words For Field, in 2020.So if you wanted to playfully yet emphatically berate someone, you could say “go n-ithe an cat thú, agus go n-ithe an diabhal an cat” (“may the cat eat you, and may the devil eat the cat”). There are dozens of words for penis in Irish, includingbliúcán(a wild carrot). One of the terms for menstruation isblathscaileadh, meaning the release of flowers.Enter theKneecap effect. Many younger people – inspired by the Belfast and Derry rap group – are now embracing Irish. Kneecap themselvesrepurpose old terms for a hard-partying present.Snaois, meaning snuff, becomes cocaine.Dúidín– a small clay pipe for tobacco – is their word for a spliff. “3CAG” stands fortrí chosan agus guta, three consonants and a vowel, meaning MDMA.Kneecap’s reinvention of antiquated words is especially playful, but it’s their declaration of Irish as a punk language and part of a process of personal decolonisation that has become a motivating and mobilising cultural and political force.

Even my local pub in Dublin offers a euro discount when you order a drink in Irish.But perhaps the most revelatory moments happen in private. During the pandemic, myself and my wife – who grew up in the Irish-speaking area of northwest County Donegal, but “lost” her Irish over time – began speaking it more frequently at home. Having moved to Dublin in the late 1980s, she had also lost her Donegal accent. But Gaeilge has dialects and accents (canúint) that instantly identify one’s specific geographical roots. When she spoke Irish, I heard her true accent for the first time. With it, came the unique vocabulary of her home county’s landscape and culture. An oral artefact, as though preserved in amber, suddenly – or as we say, “go tobann” – was alive again.Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish TimesExplore more on these topicsIrelandOpinionLanguagesEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

The talent pool was shallow. The contest winner, Kemi Badenoch, said nothing to suggest she was equipped for the challenge of renewing her party as a potential force of government. So it has proved.Mrs Badenoch goes into her first party conference as leader with the Tories in worse shape than they were in a year ago. Their opinion poll rating isconsistently lowerthan the 23.7% they managed under Rishi Sunak in the general election.One MP has defectedto Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. More will follow if they don’t see a route back to power under their current leader.The Tory leader has made her job harder by adopting a shallow, ideologically blinkered analysis of the challenge. She started from the premise that her party had “talked right but governed left” – a perverse revision of history given that she was describing prime ministers who implemented austerity, a hard Brexit, a sequence of increasingly draconian anti-immigration laws and, in the case of Liz Truss, a wild tax-cutting mini-budget that detonated the economy. In no sensible framing of political debate does that count as a legacy of leftwing government.Viewing the Conservative predicament through such a warped lens leads Mrs Badenoch into strategic misjudgments. Since she doesn’t hear anything in radical rightwing rhetoric around Brexit and immigration that might alienate mainstream voters, she has no understanding of why the Liberal Democrats wereable to winscores of seats in what had once been her party’s affluent southern heartlands. Her belief that Britain is suffocating under the dead hand of woke bureaucracy prevents her engaging with the real causes of inadequate public service provision and the role that budget cuts played in voter discontent when her party was in charge.Following a faulty compass in a quest for ideas that might capture public attention naturally leads to terrible policy choices. Hence, for example, this week’s announcement that a Conservative governmentwould repealthe 2008 Climate Change Act. That is a retreat from climate leadership – abandoning Britain’s responsibility and handing the green industrial future, and its economic upside, to other countries. It also signals alignment with a fanatical rightwing agenda associated with Reform UK, and heavily influenced by Donald Trump’s Maga movement, where denial of climate science is rife. Threatening toquitthe European convention on human rights is similarly reckless posturing – trading legal stability and international credibility for cheap nationalist applause.But if Mrs Badenoch wanted to police the boundary between traditional Conservatism and fanatical rightwing demagoguery, she would have disciplined Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, who strikesanti-immigrant posturesthat cross the line into aggressive nationalism and who is obviously angling to replace her at the top of the party. Mr Jenrick undermines his leader’s authority with impunity because she lacks a coherent alternative programme to the craven tribute to Mr Farage that he represents. Mrs Badenoch needs a credible plan to give her party some more worthwhile purpose if she is to stand any chance ofkeeping her jobfor long, let alone leading the Tories into a general election. It is possible. Her record over the past year suggests it is unlikely.Explore more on these topicsConservative conferenceOpinionKemi BadenochNigel FarageImmigration and asylumRobert JenrickReform UKDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But the human connection of great acting can never be replacedFri 3 Oct 2025 12.47 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.17 EDTShareThe threat to human creativity from technology took another step closer this week with the appearance of Tilly Norwood, the first 100% AI-generated actor. Unsurprisingly, her unveiling at the Zurich film festival in a comic sketch calledAI Commissionercaused anoutcry. Emily Blunt described the film as “terrifying” and the actors’ union Sag-Aftra condemned it as “jeopardising performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry”.There is much that is problematic about Norwood, not least the message her “girl-next-door vibe” sends to young women. But the more serious point is that her face has been made from those of real actors without their knowledge or consent. Her lighthearted debut masks the fact that she is part of anew model of media productionthat rides roughshod over longstanding norms and laws governing artists and their work.Hollywood has been anticipating Norwood’s arrival for some time. Films such as the 2002 sci-fiSimone, about a film director who creates the perfect actress on a computer, and 2013’sThe Congress, in which an ageing star is digitally scanned by her studio, were remarkably prescient. Last year’s body horrorThe Substance, starring Demi Moore as a waning celebrity who spawns a younger clone, similarly satirised the industry’s obsession with youth and beauty. Now, Victor Frankenstein-like, the film world is staring the “perfect actress” in the face.Norwood’s creator, the actor and writer Eline Van der Velden, defended her as “not a replacement for a human being”, but “a piece of art”, describing AI as a new tool, like a paintbrush. According to its advocates, AI will democratise film, since everyone will be able to make movies without the resources of a big studio.From the Gutenberg press to talkies and TV, all creative revolutions have been feared and reviled. There wasn’t always an Oscar for visual affects, after all. And AI is already part of film-making, especially in animation and sci-fi genres. Two of last year’s Oscar-winning films – The Brutalist and Emilia Perez – used AI toenhance voices. Dead actors including Carrie Fisher have been resurrected for posthumous cameos.But while some welcome such possibilities, as well as the prospect of AI actors slashingproduction costs by 90%, workers in the film industry are justifiably alarmed. The 2023 Hollywood writers’ strike resulted in apartial victoryagainst the use of AI. And while A-listers’ views on Norwood have been widely reported, as always it is less influential people whose jobs are most at risk – background and voice actors, makeup artists and production teams.AI actors are an inevitable product of a culture awash with social media slop, cosmetic surgery and fakery. As yet, Norwood can’t act or interact. She can’t empathise, because, it hardly needs to be said, she is not a person. She is not “art” either; she is data. The human connection is the true magic of movies, and that cannot be artificially generated. We watch films to see real people in real locations, feeling real emotions. We do not want perfect vibes.But while warnings that Norwood is a doe-eyed existential threat to the film industry might be exaggerated, at least for the moment, that doesn’t mean there is nothing to fear. Legislation is slow and clunky, while technology advances dizzyingly fast. More must be done to protect performers and film crews, and the value of human creativity.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionTilly Norwood (AI character)Film industryeditorialsShareReuse this content"

How did we all miss the bacteria taking over her body?, 28, September). Patrick says he feels guilty, but he is not to blame: the NHS has failed them.In the absence of clear explanations and effective solutions, it is entirely understandable that families may turn to a variety of for-profit, fringe medicine options. While Patrick’s faith and optimism may indeed help Milly recover, there is no reliable evidence linking a chronicBorreliainfection to her symptoms; and the effectiveness of long-term antibiotics has not been demonstrated.Milly’s exhaustion is typical of a group of conditions known as “persistent physical symptoms”. They arise when biological defence systems, evolved to keep us safe, go awry. Approaches that work for many are based on knowledge of how the brain, thoughts, feelings and activities interact. This knowledge is explained to patients in a dialogue, relating stressors to brain-generated danger signals; and this becomes integral to a negotiated, bespoke rehabilitation plan. This approach has been shown to be effective, including in two well-conducted, recent trials from Norway, one for people withthe post-Covid condition, and one for people with “medically unexplained symptoms”.Unfortunately, it seems that Milly’s mind-body approach was implemented in a suboptimal way. This led her to feel responsible for her symptoms, rather than understand that they arise from the body’s natural responses. Such feelings of guilt can hinder recovery, and should have been carefully addressed.Prof Paul GarnerLiverpool School of Tropical MedicineDr Maria PedersenOslo University Hospital and University of OsloDr Alastair MillerFormer lead, neurological infection service, Liverpool Royal University HospitalIt was heartbreaking to read Patrick Barkham’s account of his daughter’s illness, initially diagnosed as ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), later found to beLyme disease. I was diagnosed with ME/CFS in 2019 and know too well the challenges faced with medical gaslighting and ineffective treatment options. However, the article states that they “were given the usual advice about pacing – gradually increasing exercise – which is challenged by some ME patient groups”. This conflates pacing (a recognised and helpful energy-management principle) with graded exercise therapy (aimed at gradually increasing a patient’s physical activity limits).The latter is a flawed treatment principle that is no longer part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencetreatment guidelinesdue to there being no proven clinical evidence of benefit, and – worse – patients frequently reported that it caused them harm.Tom PondLondonI was intrigued that Patrick Barkham acknowledged his interest in nature as a cure in his writing. I grew up in Canada during a spate of the West Nile virus, meaning we were aware of mosquito bites being a serious health threat. As an adult I contracted chikungunya while living in Cambodia, a debilitating mosquito-borne disease that mimics rheumatoid arthritis.At present, I live on the Oxford canal, which thrums with mosquitoes at dusk. As the UK gets warmer, we are more likely to see incursions of mosquitoes, including those carrying tropical diseases. Ticks are also increasing. Alongside this we have a new culture of rewilding green spaces, but I never hear any consideration of the changing climate that means this could eventually become a medical risk.Tropical diseases carried by insects have historically been ignored by medical research. However, consideration of how we can let biodiversity thrive while also considering what interactions with invertebrates might mean for our health is crucial.Allison DeVriesKidlington, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromBrian AllenFri 3 Oct 2025 12.59 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.37 EDTShareAfter reading your moving obituary of Tony Harrison (28 September), tributes to him from Ian McMillan and others (Classics with added Yorkshire class, 28 September), and the article by Mark Lawson (‘The man who came to read the metre’: Yorkshire poet Tony Harrison was the National Theatre bard, 27 September), I’d like to add a personal postscript.As a visiting poet, Tony became my tutor for my final year at Newcastle University (1969-70). My tutorial partner was the urbane Bostonian wife of the England cricketer Mike Brearley. When she told us about her father’s library, she didn’t mean anything like the little prefab on our council estate, but a designated room in their colonial-style home.I was a slightly lost working-class scholarship girl, coming, like Tony, from a grammar school in Leeds. If his fierce knowledge and passion for classical literature often intimidated me, his insistence on always being true to your northern roots gave me solace. During that year I learned you could write dazzling poetry in a language that belonged to usLoiners(residents of Leeds), that I’d missed out on all the “mucky sex” going on in the 1960s, and that there were ways of defying and denouncing the rotten class system from within.When I began to wonder why someone like me would even be at university, he bundled me off to the library to write about Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience – “from your own experience!” I cried when I read the “more power to your elbow, lass” he’d scribbled across the bottom of my essay. It was the first I’d ever written where it felt it might be fine to just be me.Last year, aged 75, I was awarded a PhD, looking at class and gender from the point of view of a first-generation working-class woman in the arts and academia. As I walked across that Dublin stage to collect it, I whispered Tony’s words to myself. More power to your elbow, Tony. You did all us Loiners proud.Dr Chrissie TillerLondonBlack Daisies for the Bride (1993) was an award-winning TV drama documentary for whichTony Harrisonwrote the script. It has stayed with me ever since I first saw it, and I later used an extract in training NHS staff in person-centred care of people living with dementia. While the setting is dated (the former High Royds hospital in West Yorkshire), the words, music and images tell a powerful and timeless story, featuring some residents living with dementia, as well as staff and visitors.Brian AllenRetired former NHS chaplaincy team leader, north-east EnglandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In 1939 he read Prolonging Life, a pamphlet promising a lifespan of 150 years, by Aleksandr Bogomolets, a haematologist famous for his rapid-healing serums and blood transfusion methods.Bogomolets promised to prolong life with cytotoxic proteins, herbs and transfusions of young blood. Stalin made him a Hero of Socialist Labour and gave him generous research funding, but was dismayed when he died aged 64 in 1946 (this was hardly Bogomolets’s fault – as a boy in Tsarist times, he visited his mother, a revolutionary serving a sentence of hard labour in a Siberian prison, and caught tuberculosis).Donald RayfieldEmeritus professor, Queen Mary University of LondonAleks Krotoski says dictators and US techno-billionaires are striving for immortality. They should read After Many a Summer byAldous Huxley, a novel about a Hollywood millionaire who tries to achieve immortality, but regresses to an ape‑like creature in the process.The book is partly seen as reflecting science showing that embryo development takes a foetus through stages resembling a worm, a fish, a tailed rodent-like creature etc. Hence returning an adult human body to a younger stage might reverse this evolutionary process. But the book has also been seen as reflecting the narcissistic obsession with eternal youth in the US that Huxley had moved to.So has anything changed in the intervening century?

The study by the charity Radiotherapy UK found 181,023 cancer patients should have received radiotherapy but only 120,569 did, leaving 60,455patients a year without any radiotherapy at all.Regional inequalities are rife. In south-west England, 36% of patients receive radiotherapy, meaning around 7,200 patients miss out, while in the south-east, 33.7% receive treatment, with more than 10,100 missing out.The leading oncologist and chair of Radiotherapy UK, Prof Pat Price, said: “Thousands of cancer patients risk dying prematurely either because they are not getting radiotherapy at all or because of huge delays in starting radiation treatment.”She added: “Radiotherapy is one of the most cost-effective and curative cancer treatments we have. It is not a ‘nice to have’, this is a life-saving treatment.”The government needed to urgently invest in more machines and staff and widen access to the treatment. “Otherwise, the UK will remain stuck at the bottom of the cancer survival league tables, and patients will die needlessly.”Sunbeds should be banned in UK, skin cancer experts sayRead moreThe findings follow a 2024 study of 780,000 people, comparing treatment for eight different cancers in each UK nation, Norway, Australia and Canada. TheInternational Cancer Benchmarking Partnershipfound that people in the UK were less likely to receive radiotherapy and faced considerably longer waits for treatments.Latest NHS England figures show that in July 2025,61% of patients waited longer than two monthsto begin treatment, including radiotherapy, and only 39% of patients in England began radiotherapy within 62 days of referral, less than half the national target of 85%.Three in four English hospitals failing to hit two cancer targets in league tablesRead moreAlison was 64 when she was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer. Faced with a 15-week wait for surgery at her south coast hospital, Alison decided to use her savings and go private. When she found out after the operation that she would have to wait up to six months for the radiotherapy on theNHS, Alison decided to see if she could be seen quicker somewhere else, as she couldn’t afford any more private treatment. Her consultant referred her to the Christie cancer centre in Manchester, where she received her radiotherapy at the end of June.Alison praised the Christie for the care she received, but said having to travel more than 200 miles for her treatment was a traumatic experience. “You know, I’ve been through a lot in my life, but the mental anguish that I was put through cannot be overestimated,” she said. “Really, it’s horrendous.“I spent a week in Manchester going for radiotherapy every single day. I had to ring the little bell for the end of my treatment on my own, over 200 miles away from my family. That is wrong.”Staff shortages on top of increased demand are behind the delays. According to the Royal College of Radiologists, in 2024, seven in 10 cancer centre leaderssaid staff shortages were putting patient safety at risk. Experts report that radiotherapy machines are sitting idlein a number of trusts, or are unable to be used at weekends, because no staff are available to operate them. One head of radiotherapy from a large trust in the east of England said the “devastating reality” was that the workforce was at breaking point.“After 35 years in the radiotherapy profession, I can say with certainty that the situation we face today is the worst I’ve ever seen. Across the country, radiotherapy treatment machines sit idle. Not just because of technical faults, but because there simply aren’t enough staff to run them,” they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I never thought I’d hear myself saying that.”Dr Stephen Harden, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said most patients faced “agonising radiotherapy delays”.“Amid soaring demand for cancer care, staff shortages and patient delays will only get worse if nothing is done to increase the workforce. While the government has invested in new Linac radiotherapy machines, staff shortages at some cancer centres mean they can’t offer treatment on evenings and weekends.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said:“Too many cancer patients are waiting too long for radiotherapy treatment. This government is taking decisive action to get the NHS diagnosing cancer earlier and treating it faster.“We have already invested £70m in replacing outdated radiotherapy machines across the NHS with cutting-edge technology that will speed up treatment for thousands of patients. We are also addressing workforce shortages, with over 5,800 doctors now working in clinical radiology – almost 200 more than a year ago. Since July 2024, 160,000 more people had cancer diagnosed or ruled out on time.“Our forthcoming national cancer plan will include further details on how we will improve outcomes for cancer patients, including setting out comprehensive improvements to radiotherapy care for patients, such as how we canharness artificial intelligenceto speed up treatment.”Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSEnglandHealthHospitalsCancer researchInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

The bodycam video obtained by local networkTHV11shows police accusing Raghu of having an illegal substance in his vehicle.“You got a vial of opium that was in your center console,” an officer told Raghu. “Go and take a seat.”“I was not doing anything wrong when he pulled me over. I was following all regulations,” said Raghu,who told the Saline Courierthat he was making a food delivery when he was stopped.Ashley Mays, Raghu’s wife, arrived at the scene and said: “I’m confused on why he’s going to jail.”The Arkansas State Crime Lab concluded that the substance in the bottle was perfume, not opium, but still Raghu spent three days in the Saline county jail, where authorities found an “administrative/legal error” showing his visa status had expired, according to his attorney.Ice officers took Raghu into custody and sent him to a federal immigration facility in Louisiana, where he was detained for 30 days.“She used to call me every night,” Raghu told THV11, speaking next to his wife. “Crying, and my stepdaughter putting a Bible on her chest, crying. My stepdaughter was crying a lot. And she [Mays] was planning to sell her cars and move to some other country where we can live happily.”While the charges against Raghu were officially dropped by a district court judge on 20 May, the Ice detainment put a blip on his journey to becoming a permanent citizen. Mays said in afundraising pageto cover legal fees and basic expenses that Raghu’s work visa was revoked.“It is my understanding that, though released, Kapil now has a ‘deportation’ status, meaning he can be immediately deported for any minor offense, even jaywalking,” reads a statement sent by Laux. “But, more crucially, this classification bars him from working and earning money for his family, which has been devastating for them.”Raghu sent a letter to Ice’s legal office this week, explaining his case and asking whether his immigration status could be resolved through proper legal channels.In the letter, Raghu said that his immigration attorney had “failed to timely file the required paperwork before my visa expired, which left me vulnerable and placed me in my current situation”.“My wife, who has always been my greatest support, is carrying the entire financial burden alone, as I am currently unable to work,” reads the letter by Raghu. “The mounting legal fees and the pressure of not being able to contribute have created a difficult situation for our family, and it has become increasingly challenging to manage.”The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Ice, did not immediately provide a comment about Raghu’s case.Explore more on these topicsArkansasIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

This is the second suit filed against the car maker this week alleging a design flaw in its vehicle is to blame for the deaths of the passengers involved in the accident, according to court filings.The parents of Jack Nelson allege that the company that helpedElon Muskbecome the world’s richest man knew about the flaw for years and could have moved faster to fix the problem but did not, leaving the passengers trapped amid flames and smoke that eventually killed them.“This case arises from catastrophic design defects in theTeslaCybertruck that turned a survivable crash into a fatal fire,” reads the complaint, which was filed on Thursday in Alameda county superior court. The Nelsons are being represented by the firm Walkup, Melodia, Kelly & Schoenberger.Tesla did not reply to a request for comment.Asimilar suit was filed against Teslaon Thursday by the parents of Krysta Tsukahara, another victim of the crash. Tsukahara, 19, and Nelson, 20, were traveling in the back of the Cybertruck on 27 November 2024, with one other passenger and the driver. The car smashed into a tree at high speed and caught on fire, according to aCalifornia highway patrol report.When power to the truck’s electric doors was shuttered by the fire, the passengers were locked inside with no way out. The driver also died. The fourth passenger was pulled from the car after a rescuer broke a window.“The four young people in the Cybertruck were close friends and outstanding individuals, each on the verge of making meaningful contributions to the world,” Todd and Stannye Nelson, Jack’s parents, said in a statement. “They were all victims of Tesla’s unsafe design. Their deaths and injuries have devastated everyone who knew them.”The new legal threats to Tesla come just weeks after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the car maker about its electric door handles, which are built to be flush with the body of the vehicle.The agency is also looking into complaints by drivers that said after exiting their cars, they could not open back doors to get their children out and, in some cases, had to break the window to reach them.Tesla door handles have been at the center of several other crash lawsuits because the battery powering the unlocking mechanism can be destroyed in a fire and the manual releases that override that system are difficult to find.“The backup mechanical release for that door was concealed beneath the liner of the map pocket at the bottom of the door – hidden, unlabeled, and impractical to locate or use in the smoke and chaos of a post-crash fire,” said the Nelsons. “As a result, the Cybertruck’s design left Jack and the other occupants with no practical way to escape.”The Cybertruck lawsuits follow several others that have claimed various safety problems with Tesla cars. In August, a Florida jury decided that Tesla must pay $243m in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who was killed by one of its vehicles operating in Autopilot mode.Explore more on these topicsTeslaCaliforniaWest CoastElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Four Italian MPs among the 40 Italian nationals taking part in the flotilla are expected to return on a scheduled flight toItaly.Footage from Thursday night showed the final boat of the flotilla crewed by six people, including three Turkish citizens, a German and an Omani. Speaking via a video call with flotilla organisers, the Australian captain of Marinette said: “We have a bunch of very tough Turks onboard … we’ve got a lady from Oman and myself, and we’re just going to continue in the direction.”Hannah Claire Smith,a flotilla spokesperson, said Marinette had joined the flotilla late after bad weather had forced it to return to port in Barcelona.1:18Moment IDF soldiers board Gaza aid flotilla vessels – videoIt was probably because of the delay that it managed to surprise the Israelis. The boat was intercepted in the early hours of Friday morning when GSF estimates it was 42.5 nautical miles from theGazacoast – the first time since Israel imposed a naval blockade in 2009 that an unauthorised humanitarian mission had come closer than 70 nautical miles to Gaza.Previous attempts by activists to break the naval blockade on Gaza were stopped by force by the Israeli military. In 2010, 10 Turkish activists were killed by Israeli commandos whoraided the Mavi Marmara shipas it led an aid flotilla towards Gaza.According to theflotilla’s live tracker, a sailing boat named Mikeno also appeared to have crossed into Gaza’s territorial waters, idling 9 miles off the coast before being intercepted.GSF said it had no firm information, however, as the organisers had lost contact with Mikeno’s crew hours earlier.“It could be a tracker error or a technical issue with the monitoring,” said Smith. “We will only have confirmation after speaking with the Mikeno crew, which is impossible right now as they are currently being held by the Israelis.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In September, Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, revealed that Russia had been tracking two Intelsat satellites used by the German military.“They can jam, blind, manipulate or kinetically disrupt satellites,” he said at a space conference in Berlin.In response to growing international tensions, the UK and the US last month conducted their first coordinated satellite manoeuvre in space, in what defence officials hailed as a major step forward in allied cooperation.Between 4 and 12 September, a US satellite was repositioned in orbit to inspect a UK satellite and confirm it was functioning properly. The test was part of Operation Olympic Defender, a joint military framework aimed at improving satellite defence and resilience.“Expertly executed with USSpaceCommand, I could not be more pleased or proud of the rapid progress we are making with our allies,” Tedman said.The escalation in space comes as tensions with Russia continue to rise.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper,warned last week that Britain was “ready to act”after the US president, Donald Trump, publicly urged Nato allies to shoot down intruding Russian aircraft.In a speech to the UN in September, Cooper condemned Moscow’s “provocative and reckless” violations of Nato airspace in recent weeks, including incidents over Estonia, Poland and Romania.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In the UK the fast-moving raptor, which was hunted to virtual extinction and only began to recover in rural regions in the 1960s, is still widely persecuted on shooting estates and grouse moors.In other parts of Europe, the goshawk is thriving – even in bustling capitals such as Berlin, Amsterdam and Prague. From Berlin’s Viktoriapark, where a large nest sat in the crown of a tree less than 100 metres from a large war memorial, the “phantom of the forest” hunts pigeons in the street and even perches on rooftops.The birds have adapted to the busy traffic – although tall glass buildings still pose a threat – and are far more at ease with the steady stream of dogwalkers, runners and schoolchildren than their forest-dwelling counterparts would be with humans.View image in fullscreenPaul O’Donoghue: ‘This is just like any park in the UK, that’s the magical thing.’Photograph: Ajit Niranjan/The Guardian“This is just like any park in the UK, that’s the magical thing,” said O’Donoghue, the director ofRewildingUK, which plans to bring goshawks to Chester and London in the first stage of a project introducing them to cities. “It proves this can be done quickly – without much fuss, but with so much excitement.”O’Donoghue is planning to submit a proposal for the “assisted colonisation” of the northern goshawk to regulator Natural England in the coming weeks; the plan foresees the release of 15 birds in each of the two cities, sourced as chicks from wild European nests and UK breeders.He hopes they will come to the rescue of Britain’s beleaguered garden birds by preying on mesopredators such as crows, magpies and jackdaws, whose populations have grown unchecked and threatened birds further down the food chain.View image in fullscreenFledgling goshawk in Berlin.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyTheir presence should have an immediate effect on the “brazen” mid-sized birds that peck off smaller ones that people love, says O’Donoghue, pointing to a similar effect documented in wolves. “It’s what’s called an ecology of fear. Everybody knows the big guys are in town.”Rewilding efforts across Europe have facedfierce resistancefrom farmers and far-right groups in recent years, as big carnivores such as wolves and bears have returned to lands now populated by people. As their populations have grown, they have begun to eat sheep and in some cases attack humans.The introduction of the goshawk into urban England is unlikely to spark a similar backlash – the birds already live in other parts of the country, and pet-owners and urban gardeners have little to fear from them – but the species has caused tensions even in cities it has long called home.In Berlin, where an estimated 100 breeding pairs represent the highest-known concentration in the world, and other German cities, goshawks have become the focus of pigeon and chicken breeders whose birds are being eaten.Manuela Merling de Chapa, a scientist at the Hessian Agency for Nature Conservation, Environment and Geology, who hasstudiedgoshawk adaptation to urban environments, used GPS transmitters to track 60 goshawks as part of her PhD, and says that although there could be potential benefits from using goshawks to regulate mesopredators in UK cities, chicks taken from rural nests may struggle to adjust to urban life and stressed the need to include all stakeholders early on. “Overall, it’s a risky business.”Ian Henderson, an ecologist at the British Trust for Ornithology, who hasstudiedgoshawk behaviour in rural England, said it was unclear if the birds would choose to stay in cities and unlikely that the proposed numbers would be enough to have a significant positive effect on garden bird populations. “What will happen to those 15 birds?” he said. “My guess is they’ll probably disperse into the nearest countryside.”O’Donoghue is nonetheless upbeat about the project’s chances. The conservationist, who has previously been awarded a licence to tag the Scottish wildcat and was a scientific adviser for a project that brought the great bustard back to the UK, argues that approaching reintroductions in a “welfare-based manner” is the key to success.View image in fullscreenThree young goshawks sit in an eyrie in the district of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Berlin.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyO’Donoghue’s first attempt to reintroduce lynx to the UK wasrefusedby the environment secretary on Natural England’s advice in 2018. A draft application for a trial reintroduction has also met resistance, although the chair of the nature body recentlyexpressed enthusiasmabout the prospect of reintroducing lynx during his two-year term.If the goshawk project goes ahead, the birds will be fitted with GPS transmitters – an endeavour expected to account for almost half of the estimated project cost of £110,000 – and be given a steady supply of food for as long as is needed after being released. In Berlin, O’Donoghue stressed the psychological benefit of city-dwellers being able to spot a predator as elusive as the goshawk while they go about their lives, rather than placing rewilding projects only in rural areas.“It’ll inject such excitement,” he said. “People go to the park to feed pigeons. Soon they’ll be going to see goshawks.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsRewildingAnimalsWildlifeLondonChesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jeanne Martin, co-director of corporate engagement at the responsible investment group ShareAction, described it as “bitterly disappointing”.She said: “Senior bankers need to be far more courageous in this decisive moment for all our futures and must use their influence to push up standards for accountability on climate if we are to stand any chance of making the clean energy transition happen.”Global financial sector dropping key green pledges as Trump takes officeRead moreBut Lucie Pinson, the director of Reclaim Finance, said she “won’t mourn” the demise of the NZBA. “Like other financial alliances of its kind, it brought little – if anything – to the climate, and was doomed to fail,” she said. “Its purpose was never to take real action, but to create the illusion of measures in order to ward off the risk of regulation.“At least its demise brings clarity: the institutions genuinely committed to containing global warming will continue to act. But the massive reallocation of financial flows toward solutions cannot happen without intervention from policymakers and regulators. Their action is essential to limit climate change and the systemic risks it entails. For both, the priority remains ending the financing of fossil fuel expansion.”On paper, the NZBA, which was convened by the UN Environment Programme finance initiative but led by banks, encouraged members to slash the carbon footprint of their investments and help drive the transition to net zero emissions by 2050.The group counted nearly 150 members at its peak but began losing members late last year, when Donald Trump was re-elected on promises to deregulate the energy sector, dismantle environmental rules and “drill, baby, drill”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

HSBC had alreadydelayed key parts of its climate goals by 20 yearsand watered down environmental targets.The NZBA said its guidance and supporting documentation would “remain publicly available” and that “individual banks worldwide” could still use them. A spokesperson said no interviews would be offered “at this point”.Explore more on these topicsBankingClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

We are frightened. We are angry. The rising tide of antisemitism has been plain for all to see yet is too often explained away,” he wrote.“British Jews are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for the same thing every family, of every faith, should expect: to live and worship freely, without fear. That means, tragically in these times, police on the ground. It means protecting our schools and synagogues. And it means leaders in every party and community calling out antisemitism wherever it appears.”He said stepping up protections for Jewish communities was the right response but it “cannot be the end of the conversation”.“The focus will not just be on security and justice but on how we can bring communities together to heal from this. This government is determined to build a country where no minority has to live in fear and where antisemitism is confronted without hesitation, without qualification and without excuse.”Starmer issued a message to Jewish people on Thursday night pledging to “wrap arms” around the community in the wake of the attack.In a recorded message, Starmer said: “I know how much fear you will be holding inside of you. I really do … Nobody should have to do that. Nobody.“And so I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community. I promise you that over the coming days you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love.”Starmer, whose wife, Victoria, is Jewish, made tackling antisemitism inLaboura major priority after he became party leader.Explore more on these topicsRichard HermerLabourAntisemitismJudaismnewsShareReuse this content"

The entry, registered in April 2025, lists the hospitality as support for “attendance at a conference”.The company presents itself as a lucrative route for landlords to enter the asylum system accommodation market. On its website, Living Redefined says it has provided the Home Office with 84 properties offering 352 bedspaces across the Midlands and east ofEngland, usually with lease agreements under five years.The company boasts on Instagram of turning a two-bedroom house in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, into a five-bed HMO, claiming the conversion generated an annual profit of £27,000 equivalent to a 32% return on investment.The firm describes itself as working “closely with the Home Office” on accommodation supply. But in response to questions from the Guardian, Living Redefined said it did not hold any Home Office contracts. A spokesperson said the company “matches landlords with social housing providers to provide homes for social use” and had invited Hollinrake in his then capacity as shadow housing secretary to attend the international property conference MIPIM in Cannes.The spokesperson added: “Attendees included developers, investors, architects, local authorities and property professionals, as well as policymakers, which this year included metro mayors including Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham.“As an organisation that matches landlords with social housing providers to provide homes for social use, it gave us the opportunity to raise the profile of what we do and discuss our services with the many local authorities present.”Many landlords may find this attractive given they could secure long-term contracts and steady rental income from the demand based on the asylum backlog.Hollinrake, the MP for Thirsk and Malton inNorth Yorkshire, is responsible for Conservative fundraising, campaigning and relations with activists in his role as Tory party chair. His acceptance of hospitality from this company, in his role as shadow housing secretary, may raise eyebrows given his party’s repeated pledges to cut migration numbers.The Home Office has faced criticism over the increasing use of temporary accommodation, including HMOs, for asylum seekers as claim numbers reach record levels. Two cabinet ministers have repeatedly raised private concerns that rapid conversions of family homes are inflaming community tensions.Several Labour MPs have also pressed ministers on the scale and cost of outsourcing accommodation contracts to private landlords and companies.Reform UK has made housing asylum seekers in HMOs a political target. Its MPs have attacked the issue as a symbol of a broken migration system. In her maiden speech earlier this year, the Reform MP Sarah Pochin alleged that HMOs used for asylum housing were “breeding grounds for organised crime gangs” and urged the government to clamp down on them.Hollinrake, a former businessman who founded the estate agency Hunters in York, has previously spoken about the need for a fair rental market and has championed small landlords.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2022, Hollinrake opposed plans to convert a former RAF base at Linton-on-Ouse near York into a large reception centre for asylum seekers. At the time he described the proposal as unsuitable and said local communities had not been properly consulted.Accommodation for asylum seekers has become a sharp dividing line of this parliament. Ministers say their approach saves money and eases pressure on hotels.Asked whether it had worked with Living Redefined, the Home Office declined to comment. Hollinrake has not responded to requests for comment.A Conservative party spokesperson said: “Labour’s utter failure to grip the small boats crisis has turned the housing crisis into a housing catastrophe. As shadow housing secretary and now as chairman Kevin Hollinrake has continued to hold the government to account for their failures and the impact this has on the British public. Only theConservativeshave a plan to end this crisis.”Sources close to the chair added Hollinrake had attended the MIPIM built environment conference, citing the fact that government ministers and Labour councillors had also attended the conference, and in order to do so had accepted hospitality.Explore more on these topicsConservativesImmigration and asylumHousingNorth YorkshireCommunitiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

And it’s made this party too,” said Polanski, who changed his surname from Paulden to Polanski when he was 18, reversing the anglicisation his relatives adopted when they arrived from eastern Europe.Polanski, whowon the electionto lead the party in England and Wales last month, cited his background and those of the party’s deputy leaders, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward.“I’m one of five Jewish people to lead a British political party in the last 100 years,” he said. “And that also means that I do want to spend a moment to mark yesterday’s awful attack. As a Jewish man raised in north Manchester – I feel this deeply and my heart is with the community.“More widely I am the product of migration. It’s why defending migrants matters so much to me. It’s a common Jewish experience – a tale as old as time.”His ancestors, who moved to England from Latvia via Ukraine and Poland, still faced antisemitism in the UK, he said: “They changed their name to sound more English – and I changed it back, knowing that real pride comes from no longer hiding who you are.”His deputies, Polanski went on, were Ali, the son of a steelworker whose parents came to the UK from what is now Bangladesh in the 60s, and Millward, who “has family roots tied to England as far back as she knows”.He said: “One brought up Jewish. One raised Muslim. One a child of the church. A leadership with three different backstories, in a country enriched by people from all over the world.”With Green membership having risen rapidly since Polanski’s victory and climbing to more than 80,000 for the first time, he told the event that it was time for the party to be ambitious.“Everything we do between now and the next election must be bold,” he said. “We have a vision for this place we call home. Boldness means connecting with how hard it is right now for so many people. It means listening, not just finger-pointing.“At every opportunity, from the doorstep to the TV studio, our message is that theGreen partywill bring down your bills, cut the cost of living and protect our NHS.”In a series of attacks on the government, Polanski said it had no apparent answers to the problems created by austerity and inequality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our future depends on embracing that truth, not denying it | Zack PolanskiRead morePolanski particularly took aim at Starmer for, he said, trying to copy Reform, including over migration and asylum,“When Farage says jump, Labour might say, ‘How high?’” he said. “But the Greens won’t dance to the tune of a Trump-loving, tax-avoiding, science-denying, NHS-dismantling corporate stooge. We will say it loud, and we will say it clear: migrants and refugees are welcome here.”The arrival of the media-savvy Polanski, who won an overwhelming 85% of the membership vote against a joint bid by two of the party’s MPs, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, has brought the Greens new members and extra attention, with more journalists attending the gathering in Bournemouth than the party’s previous conferences.Polanski said the time had come for the party to take the fight to Labour. “It’s why Labour councillors are defecting. It’s why Labour members are joining. It’s why thousands upon thousands of ex-Labour voters are saying enough is in enough and putting a cross next to the Green party for the first time. Labour’s arrogant assumptions that it is entitled to people’s vote ends today.”Explore more on these topicsGreen partyZack PolanskiLabourReform UKGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She will legally become the archbishop at a ceremony in Canterbury Cathedral in January, followed by a formal enthronement service at a later date where members of the royal family are likely to be present.The appointment of a woman as the archbishop of Canterbury had been widely anticipated as this was the first time the role has been chosen since the Church of England allowed women to become bishops in 2014.In her first address at Canterbury Cathedral, Mullally acknowledged her new role would be “complex and challenging”. There would be “much talk” about this as “a historic moment – a joyous one for many”, she said. She shared in that joy “not for myself, but for a Church that listens to the calling of God and says: ‘Yes, we will follow you.’”Some would ask what it means for a woman to lead the Church of England, she added, saying: “I intend to be a shepherd, who enables everyone’s ministry and vocation to flourish – whatever the tradition.” She thanked “all the men and women, lay and ordained deacons, priests and bishops who have paved the way for this moment, and to all the women that have gone before me.”She pledged to confront the safeguarding failures that led her predecessor to step down. The church had “too often failed to take seriously the misuse of power in all its forms”. She would to “listen to survivors and the vulnerable”.“Our history of safeguarding failures have left a legacy of deep harm and mistrust, and we must all be willing to have light shone on our actions, regardless of our role in the Church,” she said.Of the “horrific violence” of Thursday’sattack on a synagogue in Manchester, she said: “We are witnessing hatred that rises up through fractures across our communities.” The church had “a responsibility to be a people who stand with the Jewish community against antisemitism in all its forms. Hatred and racism of any kind cannot be allowed to tear us apart.”Britain was “wrestling with complex moral and political questions”, she added. “The legal right of terminally ill people to end their own lives, our response to people fleeing war and persecution to seek safety and refuge, the pressures on communities who have been overlooked and undervalued, the deep-rooted question of who we are as a nation, in a world that so often seems on the brink.”Mullally’s name was passed to Downing Street by the Crown Nominations Commission, chaired by Lord Evans of Weardale, a former director general of MI5, after months of deliberation by the 20-member panel, of which 17 are voting members and 12 must agree. After agreement, a name by tradition is given to the prime minister – in this case Keir Starmer – and then passed to the monarch.Welcoming her appointment, Starmer said the Church of England was of “profound importance to this country”. The archbishop would “ play a key role in our national life”.Buckingham Palace said: “His Majesty congratulates Bishop Sarah on her appointment as archbishop-designate, a role which is of such importance in the UK and across the global Anglican Communion.”The appointment of a woman will be seen as a defining moment. For many liberal members of the church it will serve as an important acknowledgment of just how far women have come within the institution. The first female bishop was consecrated in 2015. But it will probably anger more conservative wings of the institution, which also represents Anglican churches outside the UK.Before being ordained Mullally, who is from Woking, worked as a cancer nurse in the NHS, and became the government’s chief nursing officer for England, aged 37. She was made a dame in recognition of her outstanding contribution to nursing. She is married to Eamonn Mullally and they have two grown-up children, Liam and Grace.She takes on the role as the Church of England tries to tackle key issues, including that of same-sex marriage, declining church attendance, restoring trust after abuse scandals as well has how to respond to Christian nationalism on the far right.The global role played the archbishop as head of 85 million Anglicans worldwide means previous holders of the position have walked a tightrope between conservative churches in African nations, where homosexuality is outlawed in some places, and more liberal voices in the west.The campaign group for equality for women in the Church of England, Watch, has said it would welcome the announcement of the first female archbishop of Canterbury, and hoped it would lead to further equality for women in the church. It claimed there were still eight bishops who would not receive communion from the new archbishop as it published a list of 587 churches on its website that it claims limit women in the church.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismChristianityReligionSarah MullallynewsShareReuse this content"

Hegseth gave few details about the boat or the evidence that it was carrying narcotics, other than saying the US had confirmed it was carrying drugs.“The strike was conducted in international waters just off the coast ofVenezuelawhile the vessel was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics – headed to America to poison our people,” Hegseth said on X.Trump officials push claim that US in ‘armed conflict’ with drug cartelsRead more“Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route,” Hegseth said.The latest attack on a boat comes as theTrump administrationprovided a notification on the issue to Congress in the form of a memo that attempted to legally justify the increasingly expansive use of military force against alleged Venezuelan drug boats.The notification was provided by senior Pentagon officials as part of an attempt to explain the Trump administration’s legal arguments for the strikes. It also included a classified briefing to members of the Senate armed services committee that took place on Wednesday.Hegseth’s post claimed the boat was “affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations”, a term the administration introduced for the first time in a confidential memo sent to Congress that attempted to legally justify the strikes. The Guardian reviewed a copy of the memo.Until this week, the administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTO. Legal experts suggested that simply characterizing drugs cartels as an FTO did not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force.White House officials have sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article II powers, which allows the president to use military force in self-defense in limited engagements.The self-defense argument revolves around Trump’s designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.The administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro – and so the presence of the cartel’s members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.The strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats have largely been overseen by Miller and Tony Salisbury, his top lieutenant at the White House homeland security council (HSC),the Guardian has previously reported.Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Donald Trump’s second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.That was the case, for instance, with the second Venezuelan boat hit with hellfire missiles on 15 September. While the White House was informed the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.The previous strikes trikes on three boats in theCaribbeanhave killed 17 people and triggered widespread international outrage. Hegseth added in his social media post: “These strikes will continue until the attacks on the American people are over!!!!”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryVenezuelaUS foreign policyPete HegsethAmericasTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They come with a prize amount of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m).Trump has said several times that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, although experts say his chances are very slim.The US president has proposed slashing the budget for the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, and wants to dismantle the Department of Education, in a bid to shrink the federal government’s role in education in favour of more control by the states.His administration has also said it would prioritise giving grant money to programmes that focus on “patriotic education”, and demanded that schools cap international undergraduate enrollment at 15%.“For research, it’s going to be a big dip in what the American scientists can do and what they are allowed to do, what they can publish, what they can get money for. So this is going to have big effects,” said Engstrom, who is chairperson of the research policy committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Trump reportedly called Norwegian minister ‘out of the blue’ to ask about Nobel prizeRead moreThe White House said in an emailed response that the United States was the largest funder of scientific research in the world.“The Administration’s targeted cuts to waste, fraud, and abuse in both research grant funding and visa programs are going to strengthen Americans’ innovative and scientific dominance,” it said.Trump has also been wrangling with several prestigious universities – some of whose faculty may be among the Nobel prize winners in coming days – threatening to withhold federal funds over issues including pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s war inGaza, campusdiversityand transgender policies.British-born American economist Simon Johnson, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2024 for his studies of how institutions affect prosperity, said that Trump’s actions would certainly hamper economic growth.“These policies are absolutely, unambiguously very negative and particularly for job creation,” Johnson, who is a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said.“All engineering and science-type activities, I think, are going to be affected,” he said. “Life Sciences is a particularly dynamic sector at the moment and NIH is, for whatever reason, being targeted with truly massive cuts.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationNobel peace prizeIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

He wants Nato and the EU to handle Ukraine.“We don’t have the money here for our people. Our programme is for a better life for Czech citizens … We are not in Ukraine,” Babiš, 71, said in a debate on Wednesday on CNN Prima News.Polls point to Babiš’s ANO party winning more than 30% of the vote, about 10 points more than Fiala’s Spolu coalition. But, even with a small ally called Motorists, it will probably not get a majority in the 200-seat lower house of parliament.ANO’s sour relations with Spolu and its allies mean the party may need support from anti-EU and anti-Nato fringe parties – the far-right SPD and the far-left Stacilo! – for its preferred one-party cabinet.Babiš has rejected any steps towards exit from the EU or Nato, including calls for referendums, countering accusations by the current government that he would drag the country off its democratic, pro-western course.East or west? Czechs split over where possible return of ‘Trumpist’ could leadRead moreAt a Babiš rally in Kralupy near Prague this week, Martin Klihavec, an entrepreneur voting ANO, said: “This fearmongering will scare many voters, but that is a pity as it is not based on the truth. Under Babiš’s previous government, I was better off.”Babiš must overcome other hurdles to become prime minister. As the owner of a chemicals and food empire, he needs to find a way to comply with conflict-of-interest laws. He also faces a trial on fraud charges related to drawing an EU subsidy more than 15 years ago, charges he denies.Spolu and its allies could retain a majority if some small parties fail to meet the 5% threshold needed to get into parliament, a scenario that helped them in the last election but looks unlikely to be repeated, according to pollsters.Polls will be open until 10pm (8pm GMT) on Friday and from 8am to 2pm on Saturday, with results expected that afternoon.Explore more on these topicsCzech RepublicEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Inside Sally Wainwright’s joyous, raucous TV show about menopausal punksZoe WilliamsThe Happy Valley creator has turned her darkest hour into a rebellious tale of midlife women uniting in musical anarchy. The team behind the highly awaited drama talk vodka, rock’n’roll and hot flushesFri 3 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTShareRiot Women, Sally Wainwright’s hotly awaited new drama, will be billed as a menopause show, and that’s fine – a show can be proud of such a shorthand in 2025, and besides, there’s a lot of menopause in it. Lorraine Ashbourne stars as Jess, a smart-mouthed pub landlady, leading her best life (house full of grown kids and grandkids, a boyfriend who does literally everything she says. “I have, in Jerry, written a weak man,” says Wainwright, contemplatively, as if it’s the first time that’s ever happened. “But he’s very likable”).Nonetheless, Jess is overwhelmed – like all of us – by the state of the world, and decides to start a rock band for a refugee fundraiser. She needs bandmates, naturally, so enter Tamsin Greig as Holly, a retiring police officer, Joanna Scanlan as Beth, a ground-down teacher andAmelia Bullmoreas Yvonne, a midwife with a stick up her arse. They’re joined by Rosalie Craig as Kitty, a very hard-living shoplifter, significantly younger than the others – she’s late 30s/early 40s in this role, the others are all mid-to-late 50s – but also menopausal. Her USP is incredible charisma and a stunning voice, belted out at pub karaoke with vivacious rage, when she isn’t drinking neat vodka straight from the bottle or vandalising cars.Riot Women, the band, come together at once – the show starts off with the energy of a one-last-heist drama. They’re planning to do an Abba cover, until Beth rebels. She’s absolutely done with being nice. She’s been a competent pianist, accompanying school choirs all her life; she wants their music to express what they’re actually feeling. The songs they end up with – composed for the show by indie-punk two-piece ARXX – land in the bit of the Venn diagram where punk meets the menopause: an absolutely uncompromising “fuck you”.View image in fullscreenHands in the air … (from left) Amelia Bullmore, Rosalie Craig and Tamsin Greig in Riot Women.Photograph: BBC/Drama Republic LtdNo question, this is an unflinching look at the realities of the Change (sorry, I still love the euphemism – it sounds so satanic). Its plotlines include Kitty having a hot flush while she’s being arrested for wreaking havoc in a supermarket. Yet Riot Women is also about ageing parents, dealing with dementia, workplaces that have changed their sensitivities but only for some people, the long arc of feminism and who got screwed by it, plus adult children and why they are a pain in the neck.It’s also about music: the entire cast learned their instruments, some from scratch. The battles over their setlist drive a lot of the drama. The unlikely relationships, especially that between compliant Beth and delinquent Kitty, are forged at the keyboard. They all learned separately before a studio date where they had to get together and perform as a band. Because they’re playing their own instruments, the songs were written to reflect both their gutsy mood and their technical rustiness.Bullmore remembers: “Even when you can’t play, it still sounds so good. We had this date we were working towards … I can’t remember a date looming as big since having a baby!”“Riot Women is about women, at a certain age, when menopause is one of the things that’s happening to you,” says Wainwright. “But you’re dealing with a lot that you didn’t see coming, or that you knew was coming and you’d chosen to ignore. I wanted to find a way to talk about it that was energising and uplifting and offered a solution. For me, it started when my mum developed dementia. I was menopausal; I started to feel invisible.” I raise an eyebrow at this – it was peakGentleman Jack, she had a global fanbase, I interviewed her back then and she looked magnificently visible. But that’s not how it felt: “You know, your career’s big and you’re pulled in a lot of directions, and in the middle of all that, I was turning into this little old lady.”The show opens with Beth about to take her own life, under the pressure of a mother with dementia and an entirely unfeeling brother and boss. Wainwright says, understatedly, that when she started writing it, “I was quite low. And I wanted that journey, of two women who’ve reached the same point. Because Kitty’s trying to kill herself [through vodka] as well, in a more flamboyant way. Beth’s going out with a whimper and Kitty’s going out with a bang. I wanted to start with two women who are really low, and allow them to find something they never imagined was going to happen.” I suggest to Wainwright that Kitty is a bit of an idealised portrait of addiction – because alcoholics, in real life, tend not to be so charismatic. She simply smiles enigmatically at this, but Craig says later, “Sally would always say: ‘I don’t think Kitty is an addict. I just think that she’s self-medicating.’ She always fought Kitty’s corner.”Scanlan is such a fascinating actor – you feel what she’s feeling even in the most slapstick moments ofThe Thick of It– and here there’s a scene at the secondary school, where she discloses that she’s considered suicide, and her boss brushes her off because he’s reprimanding her for speaking sharply to a colleague, that I still feel vividly indignant about. “When I wrote that scene,” Wainwright remembers, “the women I was working with all had similar anecdotes: you’d been in a situation where you’d said something you didn’t realise was wrong, but at the same time, nobody’s looking out foryourmental health, as you’re accused of upsetting someone else’s.” The older woman as someone who can be asked to do everything but whose needs never have to be considered – a beast of burden, if you like – is in large part what all these characters are rebelling against.Scanlan says: “It’s specific to our generation of women. Punk came along in 1976 but it was probably 77 or 78 before it got to a girls’ boarding school in north Wales. I had this drama teacher, Jan Morris, handing me a copy of [feminist magazine]Spare Riband encouraging me to stuff a sponge up my vagina instead of using Tampax. A generation of women were liberated by 70s feminism, which was then completely and utterly suppressed by the feminism that happened during the Thatcher years.”Those broad social expectations – that you had to be liberated one way one minute, then unburn your bra and comply to a different kind of liberation the next – have been mirrored, naturally, in menopause discourse, so that it was “a shameful word until very recently,” Scanlan says, “and then it was expressed as a crisis. You’re [talked about as] a survivor. That’s not my experience of growing older. The wisdom-of-the-crone idea I find rather appealing.”It has been a mountain to climb, says Greig, in the creative industries as much as anywhere else. “The conversation is only moved on by you moving it on, bit by bit. I was working on a job, it was one of those really hot days, and it was unbearable. Nobody was saying anything. And of course, with my menopause head on, I was getting hotter and hotter, then flushes, then the brain fog, and then I had to remember the lines, and I just said: ‘No, it’s actually impossible to do this.’ And people said: ‘Yeah, it’s hot isn’t it?’ and I had to say: ‘Yes itishot, but for a menopausal woman, being this hot means that I cannot do my job.’” Greig doing an impression of herself, yelling at you, is comically endearing – nothing like the stock image of menopausal rage, because (newsflash)life isn’t.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As part of her research, she spoke to Louise Newson, the doctor who’s really raised the profile of hormone treatment, “and she said: ‘Tell me something about your life, your mum.’ I said: ‘She’s got dementia, she’s got osteoporosis.’ And she said: ‘That’s two reasons why you should be on HRT already.’”Riot Women isn’t all about hormones, except in so far as life is; and the ensemble is so strong there’s no real main character, apart from, in a way, the punk band itself. While the show is “a rallying call for women to fight for visibility”, as Ashbourne says, the music serves “to reignite their passion. Riot Women reminds us that joy isn’t something we outgrow … and it’s something worth fighting for.”Riot Women starts on 12 October on BBC One at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSally WainwrightTamsin GreigAmelia BullmorefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The podcast on which Taylor Swift announced the release of her 12th studio album – her fiance Travis Kelce’s ordinarily sports-focused New Heights – garnered half a billion views, breaking a record set by Donald Trump’s appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience in the process. A “launch event” film, featuring the kind of lyric videos and backstage footage that anyone else would release on YouTube, is instead set for a theatrical release in more than 100 countries: in the US alone, it sold$15m worth of ticketsin 24 hours. The album itself has beenpre-saved more than 5m times on Spotify,breaking another record in the process. “I’m immortal now,” Swift sings on the title track, which seems less like an extravagant boast than a statement of fact.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl.The excitement has been amplified because a newTaylor Swiftalbum seemed unlikely. Even given her famously Stakhanovite work rate and her keen understanding of pop’s constant churn and unceasing clamour for content, you might have expected her to take a break after the Eras tour, which lasted nearly two years. But no: not 10 months since it wrapped, here is she again, bearing a new album trumpeted as an artistic handbrake turn.In contrast to last year’sThe Tortured Poets Department– which by the time she’d finished releasing expanded editions and bonus tracks, was nearly two and half hours long – it offers a crisp 12 songs in 40 minutes. Her recent collaborators Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner are nowhere to be seen. Swift made The Life of a Showgirl in between Eras dates with Max Martin and Shellback, the Swedish duo who co-wrote and produced her most forthright pop bangers of the 2010s: Shake It Off, Blank Space, Don’t Blame Me, Bad Blood.‘She’s leaning into the idea that her image is a gilded fantasy’: how Taylor Swift embraced the showgirlRead moreBut anyone anticipating something similar from Showgirl is in for a shock: the fizzing electronic pop of Reputation and 1989 is conspicuously absent. Instead, its primary currency is breezy, easy-on-the-ear soft rock: acoustic guitars, misty synth tones, subtle orchestrations and breathy backing vocals. Wood’s laid-back take on disco recalls not the sweaty hedonism of the dancefloor but the late 70s moment where four-to-floor rhythms and chicken-scratch guitar temporarily invaded the oeuvres of west coast singer-songwriters.More startling still is the distinct lack of undeniable hooks and nailed-on melodies. The songs are well turned, but in terms of genuinely memorable moments, Showgirl evinces just one killer chorus (Elizabeth Taylor), some impressively unexpected key changes on Wi$h Li$t and the authentically heart-tugging Ruin the Friendship, which finds Swift returning to her home town for the funeral of a high school boy she regrets not dating. There’s a fantastic chord sequence on Actually Romantic, but, alas, 37 years ago Frank Black wrote a very similar one for Where Is My Mind? by Pixies, a song you can literally sing along to Actually Romantic. The rest floats in one ear and out the other: not unpleasantly, but you might reasonably expect more given the amassed songwriting firepower behind it, and Swift’s claims of “keeping the bar really high”.Taylor Swift’s Charli xcx hit job misses the point – and underscores her tedious obsession with conflictRead moreThe lyrics– supposedly inspired by her life on and off-stage on the Eras tour– occasionally do the stuff one expects a Taylor Swift album to do. Actually Romantic eviscerates a nameless pop rival, dropping enough clues along the way that anyone can work out it’s a response to Charli xcx’s Brat song Sympathy Is a Knife. Cancelled! deals with the Kim-and-Kanye-adjacent controversies that beset Swift in 2015 and 2016, and Father Figure concerns former label boss Scott Borchetta, both in needless-to-say-I-had-the-last-laugh style. There are some spiky lines here and there – “you made a deal with this devil / turns out my dick’s bigger” snaps Father Figure – but they don’t really click. Perhaps that’s because Cancelled! and Father Figure revisit very well-trodden ground, while eviscerating a rival when you’re the world’s most successful pop star is, by default, punching down, even if she did apparently call you “boring Barbie” behind your back.But the album’s real lyrical thrust is Swift’s relationship with Kelce, which turns out to be very much a mixed blessing. You could claim that Wi$h Li$t’s dreams of suburban domestic contentment reflect Swift growing older alongside her audience – the high school kids who heard their daily lives reflected in Love Story or Fifteen are now well into their 30s and may also be reflecting on the possibility of “two kids” and “a driveway with a basketball hoop”. But despite her estimated personal fortune of $1.6bn she declares herself uninterested in success and materialism – “that yacht life under chopper blades … those bright lights and Balenci’ shades” – which rings a bit hollow when, minutes previously, she was likening the distinctly five-star circumstances of her fiance’s courtship to the love life of Elizabeth Taylor; dropping in references to the Plaza Athénée, a Paris hotel where the cheapest room will set you back £2,000 a night; and singing of getting “the best booth” at fabled Hollywood restaurant Musso & Frank.Taylor Swift’s romantic travails were the soundtrack to mine. What does her engagement mean for fans’ love lives? | Hollie RichardsonRead moreThen there’s Wood, a song that, metaphorically speaking, drunkenly clambers on a table in a Wetherspoons pub with a skew-whiff bridal veil on its head and an L-plate around its neck and favours everyone in earshot with a loud paean to the size of her fiance’s penis, which it variously describes as his “magic wand”, his “redwood tree” and his “hard rock” (there is also a regrettable degree of punning on the word “cocky”). Of course, Swift is perfectly entitled to write about whatever she wants, TMI or not, but there’s no escaping the fact that comparing her partner’s knob to a magic wand constitutes weak writing from someone who made her name, at least in part, by being a sharper, wittier, more incisive lyricist than her peers.In fairness, Wood is one clanging misstep on an album that isn’t terrible: it’s just nowhere near as good as it should be given Swift’s talents, and it leaves you wondering why. Perhaps romantic contentment simply writes whiter than vengeful post-breakup bitterness, or perhaps it wobbles your judgment. Perhaps it was rushed. Or perhaps its author was just exhausted, which would be entirely understandable. Even the immortal, it seems, sometimes need to take a break from pop’s constant churn and unceasing clamour for content.This week Alexis listened toMildred – Green CarA beautiful song that might have been designed for autumn: slow-paced, it gradually washes over you, infused with a weary sadness.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s Alan (Partridge) review – nothing else on TV has this many laugh-out-loud momentsThe fictional broadcaster remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, as he returns with this hilariously sloppy look at mental health. Is anything as joyous as watching his blunders? Surely notJack SealeFri 3 Oct 2025 04.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.37 EDTShareAlan Partridge is in crisis! But then, who isn’t these days? Last time he was on television, Alan was melting down live on air while hosting the light magazine show This Time, ending the series quite literally locked out of the BBC. At the start of his new, self-produced project, the light documentary How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge), the broadcaster reveals he’s since hit another low by fainting into the lap of a female interviewee during a corporate event for Norfolk agribusiness stalwarts Bannroyd Animal Feed. Tough times, but personalities of Partridge’s calibre know how to bounce back: tie your troubles to a national trend and see if you can get a series out of it.How Are You?, then, sees Steve Coogan’s immortal alter ego in roving factual mode, looking into an epidemic of anxiety, stress and loneliness that he feels is worsening: “If I can use an outdated term, it’s just got mental!” The journey will see him experiment with religion, reconnect with friends from school and take a lot of restorative country walks, as well as confronting his recent past. Episode one builds towards a hostile but cathartic reunion with “Sidekick” Simon Denton (Tim Key), Alan’s former colleague on This Time and North Norfolk Digital radio, and as this new series goes on, we’re shown unseen clips from Alan’s stints on both.‘Partridge is more popular than me – that’s a given!’ Steve Coogan on Alan’s glorious returnRead moreFor Coogan and his long-term writing/directing collaborators Neil and Rob Gibbons, How Are You? is a sideways move. Whereas This Time pushed Partridge into new territory, How Are You? often retreads it: as well as directly reviving old formats, the whole piece resembles the mockumentaries of the 2010s,Welcome to the Places of My Lifeand Scissored Isle. And, as Alan’s private life bleeds into his investigations, we’re most strongly reminded of the podcast seriesFrom the Oasthouse.That presents a small problem. There are two Alans: Winning Alan (currently has a big paid presenting gig) and Wilderness Alan (doesn’t), and although Wilderness Alan was the star of the faultless TV sitcom I’m Alan Partridge back in 1997, a more wistful Wilderness Alan has recently taken flight, in books and From the Oasthouse. How Are You? places us inside the oasthouse and casts Katherine Kelly as Katrina, Alan’s wildly unsuitable paramour from the podcast. But that tragic tale – Alan is in denial about Katrina cheating on him with his friend and local tanning-centre mogul, the unseen Darryl Flench – feels like one that would have benefited from the slower pace of audio-only Alan, where the listener’s imagination can co-write the comedy. When we can’t see him, Wilderness Alan has room to breathe: television nowadays feels more suited to putting Winning Alan under pressure and watching him implode, as happened onThis Time.These, however, are quibbles in the face of one large, undeniable fact: whatever medium he inhabits, Partridge remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, and even placeholder Partridge has more laughs-out-loud per half-hour than anything else on telly. How Are You? is produced and directed by Alan, as well as starring him, which opens up his genius for sloppy errors and poor editorial decisions. If he thinks Britain’s mental health problems are best illustrated by an aggressively edited montage of exploding fruit, that’s what we’re getting, and there’s nobody to tell him that he’s accidentally used the word “tastistics” or the phrase “mental bealth henefits” in his voiceover. The slight grimace we regularly catch as he strides out of shot, knowing on some level that that piece to camera was another balls-up, never stops being funny, and nor do the idents he’s made to fit between segments, the best of which sees him attempt to fix us with a sympathetic smile while simultaneously swallowing a mouthful of humble British tea.Is there anything more joyous than Alan grunting as he squats down next to a skip, or apologising to an off-screen passenger for sweeping biscuit crumbs too forcefully from a train table? Surely not. Visually he’s a feast too, with his new dye job several shades too light to be plausible, and his 2025 wardrobe featuring mustard chinos, black-and-white pundit pumps, an arsenal of body warmers and an enthusiastic overreaction to the news that rugby shirts are back in fashion.Plus, the subject matter here allows for the glimpses into Alan’s soul that have been there ever since the Gibbons brothers took over co-writing duties. More than once the series pulls off flashes of pathos, where Alan’s lack of self-awareness reveals a sadness that almost has us crying tears of emotion, before the persona snaps back in and we’re crying from laughter again instead. That can happen because we’ve loved him for so long: any version of Alan Partridge is always welcome back.How Are You?

In a sense, the meeting was a surprise: as Cooper notes, Springsteen was known for “saying no to every overture about making a film of his life since 1986”. But something about the screenplay Cooper had written had clearly piqued his interest. It was based on Zanes’ book Deliver Me from Nowhere, not a traditional career-spanning biography, but a forensically researched history of Springsteen’s 1982 album Nebraska, which Zanes calls “the greatest left-turn performed by someone who is operating at the top of the charts in musical history”.Released between Springsteen’s first US No 1 album, 1980’s The River, and the world-conquering Born in the USA in 1984, it was a stark, lo-fi collection of demo-quality home recordings made in the singer’s bedroom while he was battling depression. Its songs were haunted by the ghosts of the 1950s teenage serial killer Charles Starkweather and the Italian-American mobster Philip Testa, and by Springsteen’s strained relationship with his father, a remote, hard-drinking blue-collar worker, whose paranoid schizophrenia was only diagnosed later in his life.Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere review – solid biopic both embraces and avoids clicheRead moreIts echo-laden sound occasionally bore less resemblance to the heartland rock that had made Springsteen famous and more to the notoriously confrontational electronic punk duo Suicide. Springsteen’s manager Jon Landau’s first reaction to the album was to suggest Springsteen seek “professional help” from a psychiatrist, which he subsequently did. He also declined to promote the album, refusing to give interviews or tour. It was, unexpectedly, a top five hit on both sides of the Atlantic.It’s an intriguing story, albeit one fraught with challenges for a film-maker: after all, as Cooper notes, it is essentially the story of someone writing and recording an album alone, in their bedroom. “How do you capture the writing process in a cinematic way? How do you capture what a man is dealing with when he’s alone in his bedroom? How do you make the silence cinematic? How do you make a story about a man who is very interior, and who is unravelling, cinematic?”Still, the omens for their meeting augured well. Springsteen seemed enthusiastic. Moreover, he appeared to be in good spirits, despite suffering from a peptic ulcer, greeting them with some cheesesteak sandwiches that, Zanes wryly suggested, seemed to speak loudly of a career that’s involved selling more than 140m records: “very high-quality steaks with some sharp cheddar melted on them, held between two slices of toasted artisanal bread – no one stopped at Subway to pick these up.”View image in fullscreenTormented … White as Springsteen in Deliver Me from Nowhere.Photograph: Macall Polay/20th Century StudiosBut fancy sandwiches notwithstanding, Cooper found the experience “nerve-wracking”. For one thing, he’d been a huge Springsteen fan for decades: he had got into the habit of listening to Nebraska and 1995’s similarly stark The Ghost of Tom Joad while writing screenplays. “I listened to them while I wrote two films I made with Christian Bale, Out of the Furnace and Hostiles, because they’re about men who are at times afraid to say out loud what they’re dealing with, what they’re capable of in the dark, things that give voice to their pain, and [the albums] speak to the loneliness that American men are enduring and a kind of spiritual devastation.”For another, he now had to read the script out in front of Springsteen and Landau, “who are both cinephiles. Before he was Bruce’s manager, Jon Landau wasn’t just a rock critic, he was a film critic, he was married to Janet Maslin from the New York Times for years. These men know movies. So I’m at Bruce’s house, and I’m reading the screenplay aloud, all the dialogue and all of the action. Every so often, Bruce or Jon would say something and I’d quickly jot it down, just to correct something I’d written, make it more authentic. And then, at the end of it, I remember Bruce hugging me and saying: ‘This is it – let’s go.’ At that point, I knew we were off and running.” He laughs. “Once I’d regained my sea legs.”View image in fullscreenSpringsteen in London, 1982.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/ShutterstockIndeed, Springsteen’s enthusiasm for Deliver Me from Nowhere is hard to miss. Unlike Bob Dylan, who gave last year’s acclaimed biopic A Complete Unknown his blessing, then a very wide berth indeed (he didn’t even attend the premiere), Springsteen has turned up at film festivals to promote it, telling the audience at Colorado’s Telluride festival that he’d finally broken the habit of a lifetime and agreed to the making of a biopic because “I’m old and I don’t give a fuck what I do now”, jumping on stage in New York in order to praise the actors’ performances, launch another of his broadsides against Donald Trump and sing his 1999 track Land of Hope And Dreams.Long before that, he was a regular visitor to the film set – obsessive Springsteen fans being what they are, you can find an itemised list of dates he showed up online. Cooper says his presence helped “ensure authenticity every step of the way”. Odessa Young, who plays Springsteen’s fictional love interest Faye, was absolutely delighted by his appearance. “I got to hang out with the greatest musical idol of my life and ask him a bunch of questions,” she says. “To see him walk into [legendary New Jersey club] the Stone Pony on the day we were shooting there and reach behind the counter and crack a beer, and just be like, a guy in his hometown – it was amazing.”Nevertheless, it’s perhaps worth sparing a thought for Jeremy Allen White. The star of The Bear was Cooper’s first pick for the movie’s starring role. He talks about him as “one of the greatest actors of his generation”, with a combination of “humility and swagger” that mirrors the film’s subject: without wishing to sound mercenary, the fact that The Bear helped make White a huge and immediately recognisable star – the New Yorker described the response toWhite’s ad campaign for Calvin Klein as “a frenzy”– doubtless doesn’t harm the film’s commercial appeal.View image in fullscreenWhite as Springsteen with Odessa Young as Faye.Photograph: 20th Century StudiosWhite was a non-musician prior to taking on the role of Springsteen – he says he spent “month after month” taking lessons, beset by the thought that “there’s no way I’m capable of this and this is never going to come together”. Having finally mastered both the guitar and a hugely impressive evocation of Springsteen’s singing voice, he found himself in the unenviable position of having to pretend to be Bruce Springsteenin front of Bruce Springsteen.“There is an incredible weight to playing any real and especially living person,” he says. “That sense of responsibility is always going to be stronger and larger, especially when you are dealing with someone like Bruce who is known and loved by so many. I think in the beginning I was almost too concerned with my understanding of Bruce or the public’s understanding of Bruce and it was kind of paralysing at the start.“After getting through that initial fear, I realised the only way to go about it and get in was to take Bruce Springsteen out of it and approach it as a young man who is a musician on the brink of this global stardom, who is trying to make a record and be inspired, while visiting his past and his home and his relationship to his family dynamics and trying to figure out what the future would hold … In order to get started, I almost had to forget him for a moment.”There is an incredible weight to playing a real living person, especially someone like Bruce, who is loved by so manyOf course, forgetting Bruce Springsteen is easier said than done when Bruce Springsteen is literally watching what you’re doing. “I think in the first week, it was difficult for me because I think my job as an actor is to try and shake the fraudulence that you might feel. It’s difficult to shake that stuff when you’re faced with the man you are playing. It’s hard to get lost and pretend at times and sync into your own reality and fake environment, however beautifully it’s crafted. That first week was tough, but then he became a sort of guide, even in silence with me. I thought he was there to tell me what was right or wrong about how things happened, but as time went on, I realised that he was there to give me and Scott and all of us permission to make the film. I also quickly realised, however fragile I was feeling at times having Bruce there, how Bruce felt just as fragile, if not more, witnessing the recreation of those moments that he experienced in isolation and loneliness.”White says Springsteen rarely interacted with him on set, but in the evenings would text him, “picking out the smallest of moments, a glance, the way I was seated or listening to someone else, just moments that were particularly true or honest to him. At the end of the [working] day, I would feel pretty beat up and doubtful oftentimes. So that all went a long way.”Whatever their interactions, the performance worked: White has been tipped for an Oscar, for his role in a film that, in one sense at least, is very much a period piece, an evocation of both a moment in Springsteen’s career and an era in pop music that have both long receded into history. As Zanes points out, Nebraska was released into “the dawn of the digital era”, a world where the compact disc was about to be launched, and MTV was just beginning to gain traction – two developments that Nebraska chafed against, with its rough sound, cover featuring a photo not of Springsteen but a dark landscape through a car window anda video for single Atlantic Citythat Springsteen only acquiesced to on condition that he didn’t appear in it.View image in fullscreenWhite, Cooper and Springsteen on the set of Deliver Me From Nowhere.Photograph: Bobby Bank/GC ImagesMeanwhile, the doubts its author felt in 1982 about the prospect of superstardom had clearly been banished by the time he released Born In The USA in 1984, with its pop-oriented sound and iconic videos prominently featuring a newly muscled-up Springsteen: it was the first compact disc manufactured in the US for commercial release, became the bestselling album of 1985 and turned Springsteen into the global megastar he’s been ever since.And yet, Zanes says, period piece or not, something about Nebraska and its making seems to speak to a more modern era. For one thing, he sees it as an album with a huge impact on subsequent rock music, that made “people open to the possibilities of stepping out of the commercial recording facility and seeing where else”: his book quotes Matt Berninger of the National calling it “the big bang of indie rock that was about making shit alone in your bedroom … every band that went after a lo-fi, DIY kind of thing – Pavement, Silver Jews, Guided by Voices, all the early indie stuff. It’s like when [Bon Iver] made For Emma, Forever Ago – I’m sure they were trying to make their version of Nebraska.”For another, Zanes suggests the story of Springsteen labouring away in his bedroom, and the unvarnished album that emerged as a result, has a broader resonance in 2025. “I look at my own kids and what they’re listening to and everything has tuned vocals – I’m not talking about autotune, I’m taking about what happens in studios with engineers looking at waveforms so even if they can’t hear an imperfection, they can see it, and who isn’t going to fix something that looks wrong. We’re all fixers … the world of social media, online dating – you can really tweak your profile and avoid the risk of turning red, being seen wearing the wrong thing, having your hair look a little fucked-up. And the problem with all of this is that we’re putting layers between ourselves and the next person.“But Nebraska is this emblem of ‘this is me, this is where I am at, and due to its imperfections, it’s going to be a little closer to the truth of my moment’. So it’s a story about 1982, but it’s also a story about right now. I hope one thing the movie does is make us all think about going out the door less than perfect and slightly more human because of it.”Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhereis released in the UK, US and Australia on 24 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsBruce SpringsteenJeremy Allen WhiteSpringsteen: Deliver Me from NowherefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then, the very different losses of two friends brought out a newfound sense of furyFri 3 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareSilvana Estrada spent 25 years “not knowing how to get angry”, she says. “That cost me so much energy and dignity.” Sadness, though, she had always understood: “I live with her very close to me.” Now 28, the Mexican singer-songwriter grew up outside Veracruz, a city on the Gulf of Mexico, “witnessing violence from so many angles”: rampant femicide, narcoculture, environmental attacks on the coffee plantations and rivers of her home. As a lonely teenager, she discovered Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald. They helped guide the darkness she felt and introduced her to vocal improvisation. Estrada, born to a family of luthiers, started making her own music, played on a four-string Venezuelancuatroand inspired by Mexicanson jarocho(folk music). The title of her acclaimed 2022 debut,Marchita, translates to “withered”; the record offered a spare, devastating, deeply poetic account of first love gone awry.“I consider her one of the richest artists of our time,” says her peer and mentor, the Mexican songwriter Natalia Lafourcade. “Her voice is freedom, it is birds of paradise, it isMexicoand Latin America. It reflects a deep connection to love, nature and human relationships.”This album is like a pendulum between beauty and terrorEstrada still loves that album, she says today, sitting in a New York cafe. It earned her a Latin Grammy for best new artist and critical raves. But afterwards, she says, “I really wanted to do something with my humour. After Marchita, I was a little bit trapped in this character that issadanddark, very eloquent, very solemn. That is also me, but I wanted to show myself in a way that’s even closer to how I really am.” Estrada talks with tender humour about that serious young girl, so animatedly that her sparkly rose-shaped earrings swing. Some of Marchita’s songs dated back to when she was 18, she says: “All this eloquence, darkness, I see it as so much naiveness because I thought that was the only way to talk about love and dreams.”View image in fullscreenEstrada playing at La Onda festival in June 2024, in Napa Valley, California.Photograph: Christopher Victorio/ShutterstockHer second album, she decided, would be poppier, lighter. But then unexpected losses forced her to get acquainted with an even darker side of her personality. Estrada’s new lyrics are stark with recrimination and brutal despondence: for ex-lovers who couldn’t reciprocate; for a friend who ditched her “because he couldn’t stand that my career was” – she shoots her hand upwards – “and his wasn’t. I got so depressed after that. I thought, ‘I cannot believe that I’ve been loving you as my brother all these years and you don’t want to see me because you feel small?’ That shocked me so much.”She channelled her indignation into Good Luck, Good Night, a fabulously melodramatic, comic kiss-off for something as pathetic as “el ghosting”. Every line feels as though it should be accompanied by the wayward slosh of a glass of wine. “Sometimes our lives are like a telenovela – infinite drama and suffering,” she says, referencing the high-octane Latin American soap operas of her youth. “Which is true, to be alive is to suffer, but being ghosted, the fact that someone who is alive decides to be a ghost for you – it’s so miserable!” She still sounds offended. ‘It’s funny because I guess it shows how small we can be.”During the process of writing, “I was like, wow, anger is really helpful,” she says. “Anger is this energy that really wants you to be responsible for your needs and your limits. It’s beautiful, strange, uncomfortable, almost like a grandmother telling you: ‘What are you doing? You don’t want this.’ We need anger, actually, to fight for our lives and the lives of others.”But Vendrán Suaves Lluvias (Soft Rains Will Come) doesn’t sound angry; it’s one of the year’s most unabashedly beautiful albums. After futile attempts to make the record with four other producers, Silvana decided to do it herself. She realised: “‘You’re the only one that knows what you want.’ It was so irresponsible to let in other people, to ignore my own desire.” She augments hercuatrowith swooping flourishes of strings, piano and woodwind, her commanding voice brimming with compassion. The bright, dewy Como un Pájaro (Like a Bird), nominated for best singer-songwriter song at next month’s Latin Grammys, is as fresh as a spring morning. She was surprised by the joyful melodies that came out of her. “As I get older, I understand the importance of pleasure and joy, even during hard times. This album is like a pendulum between beauty and terror.”The insult of being ghosted paled next to the tragedy of losing her best friend and fellow musician, Jorge, who was brutally murdered alongside his brother and uncle in December 2022. “This is a little bit embarrassing, but I didn’t value friendship very much when I was growing up,” she says. “I was a little bit weird. I liked music that nobody was listening to. I was very isolated. Even the friends I had were super mean to me. I’m supersensible[sensitive].” Her first real friend, Jorge taught her what friendship was. “Someone that loves you, accepts you, who has the generosity of telling you: ‘Hey, you did this and I didn’t like it,’ or, ‘This is amazing, I love you.’ We were inseparable.”When Estrada wanted to move to Mexico City, her parents were unsure until they heard that Jorge was going too: “They loved Jorge so much. He was like an older brother to me.” When she started touring, he came too. “I enjoyed so much feeling loved, not so like this super lonely child.”With Jorge, says Estrada: “I could be a child again. My heart was so light. And now my heart is heavy. I’m getting used to it.” Grave and sharpened by sudden bursts of strings, Un Rayo de Luz (A Ray of Light) is her tribute to him. It was written during a residency at the house of the late singerChavela Vargas, her hero, and interpolates her words: “¿Cómo será de hermosa la muerte que nadie ha vuelto de allá?” (How beautiful must death be when no one has returned from it?) “I really want to believe that,” she says.The killers were caught. “They’re gonna die in jail,” says Estrada, “but justice is the minimum. The state, everybody, failed us. I can’t even believe in jail. I believe in reintegration.”Estrada has always been vocal about justice: one of the earliest online hits for her is a 2018 video supporting Mexican abortion rights, three years before they were legalised. In 2022, she released the song Si Me Matan (If They Kill Me) after the student Mara Fernández was murdered by a ride-share driver. “I try to use the voice I have and the space that has been given to me as an example of empowerment, especially for little girls,” she says.Lafourcade was that example for Estrada. She returns the compliment. “She is undoubtedly the voice of young generations, with a soul and heart of great sensitivity,” says Lafourcade. “I see her as an old soul and wisdom within a young body full of vitality and beauty in every sense.”‘Doubt is exciting’: cellist Mabe Fratti on chaos, curiosity and climbing volcanoesRead moreIn 2023, Mexico’s then president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, played Estrada’s music as part of an effort to deter young people fromcorridos tumbados, the genre of regional Mexican trap popularised byPeso Plumathat has been accused of glorifying drug cartels and stoking violence. Estrada says she was “honoured”, but feels otherwise conflicted. Instead of cancelling this kind of music, she says, “we should talk about why people are admiring people who are killing us, killing our freedom, killing all the things we love.” She adds: “In Mexico, there are so many things we need to start talking about, and we need to involve everybody. Conversation is important to change your reality.”Listening to herself helped Estrada become accountable to her own feelings. Writing the ultimatum Dime (Tell Me), she realised she didn’t want an ex to stay;shewanted to leave. “It was such a useful thing to realise you can always turn around and walk away,” she says. “For me, it was hard to understand that I could just say no.”She links it to Greek mythology, specifically the Furies: goddesses of vengeance depicted with horrifying facial features. “My interpretation is that they were angry because of all the injustice on Olympus. Nobody wants to feel connected to the Furies because they’re ugly – it’s a reallymachista, misogynist conception of female fury. But I actually feel much more connected with their spirit than the rest of the goddesses: OK, I’m gonna have snakes instead of hair and one eye in myfrente– I don’t care: I just want to be whatever makes me happy, or more alive, or better.”Vendrán Suaves Lluvias is released via Glassnote on 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicMexicointerviewsShareReuse this content"

Debut Saltspreader married a jackhammer industrial beat – bandmember Will Wiffen has occasionally been spotted on stage wearing a T-shirt that bears the logo of industrial metal pioneers Godflesh – with vintage-sounding synthesisers and a guitar riff that vaguely recalls the Stooges’ garage rock perennial I Wanna Be Your Dog, before dissolving into a wall of disquieting noise. Its intended effect, the trio have suggested, was to evoke motorway travel, “the grinding circulation of vehicles 24-hours a day over huge distances … orange lights at night”.Its follow-up, Mr Invisible, sits somewhere between club music and left-field alt-rock. On one hand, the track’s rhythm, layers of hypnotic electronics, and vocals that arrive either psychedelically smeared or hypnotically looped in a way that recalls Dubnobasswithmyheadman-era Underworld all point towards the dancefloor. On the other, its forceful live-sounding dynamics, edge-of-chaos quality and distortion – “making everything sound crunchy is a lifelong ambition,” Wiffen has said – mark it out as very much the work of a band rather than a bedroom-bound producer. They’ve been playing around south London’s DIY scene for less than a year, “anywhere that will turn the PA up loud”.But both are exciting and different enough – from each other and anything else around at the moment – to make you wonder what Ashnymph might do next. Whatever it is, on the evidence of Saltspreader and Mr Invisible, it’s unlikely to be boring.Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenBeguiling … Dry Cleaning.Photograph: Max MiechowskiDry Cleaning – Hit My Head All Day“I simply must have experiences”​, Florence Shaw decides on her band’s beguiling return, but across six minutes – with human breath marking time – you get the sense that she can’t work out why.BBTDanny L Harle – Azimuth (ft Caroline Polachek)Welding Evanescence goth drama to peak 90s trance – right down to the lyric “and I ask the rain” – Azimuth suggests dusting off your best Cyberdog wear and heading south west to rave, stat.LSRobyn – Acne Studios mixRobyn’s soundtrack for the Swedish designer’s SS26 show previews her TBA ninth album, including Soulwax-worthy grinding guitar, Benny Benassi-style thrust and the lyrics “my body’s a spaceship with the ovaries on hyperdrive”.

These nocturnal hours are the influencebehind her new album Listless: all seven tracks were composed and recorded after midnight, while the artwork features the spindly flower of the Japanese snake gourd, a plant that only blooms after dark. But there is little trace of the chaos of her late-night schedule here: instead, the record embodies a quiet calm that is sometimes blissful, sometimes eerie.View image in fullscreenDania: ListlessMeeting somewhere between trip-hop, shoegaze and ambient, with a touch of pop, the textured tracks slink along dreamily, propelled by washes of synths and, for the first time, drums. A new addition to Dania’s usual setup, they lend a gentle downtempo kick to several of the songs. The shuffling, murky beat in Personal Assistant recalls the late-90s groups Scala and Seefeel, while Car Crash Premonition is the closest things get to urgent. Written after an unnerving taxi journey to her studio one night, it is both brooding and woozy, fit for a film montage.Other tracks, such as I Know That and Write My Name, are more reminiscent of Dania’s past work: stripped back and amorphous. The closing track, A Hunger, has a subaquatic quality, with bubbling and beeping electronics that sound like hospital monitors, interwoven with distorted answerphone-style vocals.Dania’s soft, murmuring voice is featured through almost the entirety of the record. The lyrics are almost imperceptible as her vocals are suspended, looped, layered, sometimes barely there at all. Growing up in a household where singing was frowned upon, she’s said it’s something she’s always felt private about. But it’s also an inspired choice, augmenting the dream-like haze on this gorgeous, intimate album.Also out this monthBitchin Bajasdraw four tracks out to nearly 40 minutes onInland See (released byDrag City). Across these extended compositions (including an epic 18-minute closer), the Chicago trio present another masterclass in lush, wandering minimalism, with chugging loops and effervescent jazz flourishes.

Inspired in part by her own experiences of agoraphobia and claustrophobia, Fobia (Other People), the new album by Argentinian sound artistAylu,is suitably intimate, sometimes stiflingly so.

Lead single Bodhidharma rides a riff fit for a biker gang, then a burst of static and screaming heralds a sad post-rock middle eight. The maligned art of the widdly-woo solo is spectacularly resurrected by guitarist Richard Chowenhill, whose soloing here and on highlight Flea will have you levitating with joy – but then the calm ballad Hallelujah features falling guitar notes played with childlike simplicity.Micah (5.15.am) and Serenity are high-speed hardcore punk, but Dan’s Love Song is drum free and has glacial Sunn O)))-style distortion rumbling underneath its dream-pop loveliness. Black metal melodies can often be either nonexistent or overly fussy, but Agriculture’s riffs and hooks are bright and original, and closer The Reply even recalls a much heavier Radiohead.Fans of post-metallers Deafheaven will probably love all this dynamic shifting and unabashedly gorgeous noise, particularly since Agriculture also have two divergent vocal styles, split here across two vocalists. Dan Meyer adds occasional soulful, clean singing, but the star is Leah Levinson, her voice trembling on Bodhidharma but splenetically caterwauling elsewhere.In typical black metal fashion, it’s hard to make out her lyrics, but they’re worth seeking out: the stories she sings about suicidal friends and anti-LGBTQ bigotry are devastating, as is her quest for meaning in a world that inexorably bends towards violence.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Her science fiction is full of journeys to different worlds, and many of these poems reference journeys too, both in this world and into the next. After the Death of Orpheus imagines Orpheus, after being torn apart by the Maenads, casually making his way down the track to the underworld, where he sees a slight figure waiting for him, Euridice. Other poems are more earthly, focusing on cattle, birds, a mouse killed by her cat, but even this smallest of creatures, as it’s carried to the trash, is given a soul by Le Guin. Cows calling for their calves from the train that takes them to the abattoir are “your sisters”. Landscapes are here too, sometimes under threat, sometimes evoked with beautiful simplicity, as in Autumn: “gold of amber / red of ember / brown of umber / all September”. Images of death in nature inevitably lead back to age and mortality, sometimes accepted as part of the natural process, elsewhere angrily resented, as in the poem about the death of Le Guin’s mother Theodora. Yet it is her own impending death which increasingly takes centre stage in the closing meditations on “extreme age”, hope mingling with despair as the body declines, approaching the end where “the wire / gets higher / and they forget / the net”.View image in fullscreenThrumsby Thomas A Clark (Carcanet, £12.99)A nature poet of minimalist tendencies, Clark’s career spans more than 50 years; during that time he has developed a style that by stripping away some of the hallmarks of the lyric – the personal voice, the argument, the rhyme – returns poetry to a purity of perception that gives us not poems about nature, but nature itself. The poet, all but absent, is like a sounding board for his environment, and he reports back to us about his encounters: “be one who / when the lightest breeze / thrills through you / takes note”. There is no moulding of the material into a personal experience here, there is no epiphany, rather the body becomes a vehicle for absorbing its surroundings, and as it leans into the rain, the self dissolves into the landscape: “a part of you on the rocks / a part of you in bog cotton / a part of you snagged on wire / a part of you unravelling”. Glimpses of gossamer, willowherb, deer, and owls are delicately interlaced with the language of music – the thrums of the title – which lulls us into a state of unfolding perception, caught in the moment before it is processed by thought. The poems figure environmental damage as well as beauty: “who cares for the dune gentian / who cares for the barn owl / who who who”. Yet by metamorphosing the repeated question “who cares?” into the cry of the barn owl – “who who who” – Clark shows us that by identifying with nature, of which we are always already a part, we might find a way.View image in fullscreenScullingby Sophie Dumont (Corsair, £12.99)If you like getting into a canoe, but sometimes struggle getting into contemporary poetry, this could be the book you have been waiting for. The title refers to the act of propelling a boat using two oars, one in each hand, but also brings to mind skulls; boats, death and water mingle together into a heady concoction. Holding an oar, for Dumont, is like holding a pen, and in To Kayak we are reminded of the parallels between poetry and kayaking – for just as on a river we might “know a town from the echo of its bridges”, poetry likes to look at the world differently. The Curse describes Dumont’s apprenticeship at a canoe club, which she soon comes to see as a “sanctuary for the cursed”: “One man broke both his legs …Another drowned … [the coach] died at twenty by aquaplaning into a tree and I left the club”. This is a tightly knit collection, and subsequent poems continue the theme of water – there’s a stunning memory map of Exeter quay, instructions on how to right a kayak, botanies of the riverbank and a universal declaration of river rights. You won’t get wet reading this book, unless, likeDylan Thomas, you combine your poetry reading with serious drinking, but you will emerge cleansed, and reminded that human beings are 60% water.Magadhby Shrikant Verma translated by Rahul Soni (And Other Stories, £14.99)Like Italo Calvino in Invisible Cities, Verma explores mythical cityscapes, here conjured from the ancient Indian kingdom. Its palaces and fountains, its temples and streets, its markets and beggars, are now silent or have turned to dust, and it is inhabited by fading memories, the scents of courtesans, malevolent spirits that reanimate corpses, and revenants, who pace the ruins: “Here I see Magadh, / here it disappears – /…/ this is not the Magadh / you’ve read about / in books, / this is the Magadh / that you / like me / have lost”. This world of cadavers is conjured in a language that itself is stripped to the bare bones, as in Heaney’s bog poems, yet which paradoxically oozes life, colour and pathos. In one poem, a soldier shuttles aimlessly back and forth between ruins: “Why does he play out the same scenes / over and again?” First published in Hindi in 1984, two years before Verma’s death, and here published for the first time in the UK in Soni’s luminous translation, this haunting and haunted masterpiece resonates louder than ever in our own times, with its stark images of cities pulverised by invading armies: “… nothing / remains // except a pile of rubble / that every now and then / shouts / Who / created me”.Explore more on these topicsPoetryPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

The mode is reminiscence: we hear about a lost childhood friend from the council estate where he grew up in 1970s North Ayrshire; about former colleagues at the London Review of Books, where O’Hagan made his name in the 1990s; about his adult daughter’s bygone imaginary friend. He considers why actors, politicians and Republicans make bad friends, why the novelist Colm Tóibín makes such a good one, and how the experience of friendship is shaped by bereavement and the internet.The latter, for O’Hagan, is more damaging than the former, which maybe isn’t surprising for a writer who likens friendship to “a set of loyalties that turn in the head like old records”, and worries that people no longer go to pubs because they’re too busy shopping online. “In the age of the internet, what exactlyisa friend? … Can you swear by someone whose voice you’ve never heard …?”, he asks, not seeming to mind terribly much – strangely, for an author so companionable on the page – that this isn’t really a feature of online life so much as writing itself; Gutenberg, not Zuckerberg.In these pages, friendship liberates where family constricts. Growing up with three brothers, O’Hagan’s household was a “zone of adversities”, a “palace of stress”, with an unloving father who once had their dog deliberately driven out into the countryside and set loose, never to be seen again. At primary school, respite lay in tooling around wastelands with Mark, a neighbour his own age. “A great friend can summon a new world order, and, best of all, the beginnings perhaps of a new person for you to be, tugged from the constraints of home.” Later, O’Hagan revises the formula to call another friend’s fellowship “a passport to being the kind of person you wanted to be”.Metaphors of migration and rebirth feel potent in a book suffused with implicit wonder at the distance O’Hagan has travelled since boyhood. On one page, he’s stacking shelves as a teenager at his local Tesco in Ayrshire; on another, he’s at a party for a new girlfriend at “the Donna Karan store on Park Avenue”. He makes no bones about being an inveterate name-dropper – clubbing with the Stone Roses, whisky with Christopher Hitchens.But while a lot of life happens in these pages, it’s no tell-all. O’Hagan knows that friendship is rarely just a bowl of cherries, yet he’s discreet, even coy, about the subject’s shadow side: snubs, misunderstandings, fallings-out (“I know a famous actor who wanted me at his wedding, but he didn’t even reply when I invited him to mine”). The level of access, of disclosure, only goes so far: while there’s a brief mention of his aborted attempt to ghostwrite Julian Assange’s memoir (the WikiLeaks founder struggled “to befriend himself”, says O’Hagan, diplomatically), there’s nothing about his lengthy reported piece for the LRB on the Grenfell Tower fire, interesting in this context if only because the ensuing furore must have reminded him who his friends were.Partly for these reasons, the most intriguing item here concerns the late Irish novelist Edna O’Brien, whom he first met in London in 2009 after leaving Seamus Heaney’s 70th birthday party. When he invites her to lunch at the Wolseley in Mayfair (“Perfect … ask for the corner table, Lucian Freud’s table”), it’s the beginning of a 15-year friendship during which “we called upon each other to complete thoughts we were unable to have alone”, in O’Hagan’s curious phrase, glancingly elaborated on when he later recalls “the soft sonatas we used to listen to while I helped Edna with her manuscripts”.Of the various names dropped in these pages, she’s the only one permitted an insight into O’Hagan himself. In most of his anecdotes, he’s the guy who comes out best – whether as a schoolboy weeping over Charlotte’s Web when cruder classmates laughed, or as a hardy reveller who is nevertheless earliest to rise the morning after a big night out – so your ears prick up a little when, apropos of nothing, O’Brien tells O’Hagan (observed, for once, rather than observing) that she can see he’s “a wounded man who handles it very impeccably and very plausibly”.For a memoir – which is what On Friendship is, however piecemeal – that would seem to leave money on the table, to say the least. Ultimately, these memories and musings – in appealingly slimline hardback, eminently gift-ready – leave you wondering about the larger autobiography O’Hagan might write, if and when he chooses.On Friendship by Andrew O’Hagan is published by Faber (£12.99).

Steffan Donnelly’s finely detailed production casts the Montagues as Welsh speakers and the Capulets as not. It’s a neat dramatic conceit that in its most successful moments finds striking new fissions within the familiar stage traffic.View image in fullscreenEasy swagger … Steffan Cennydd as Romeo and Owain Gwynn as Mercutio.Photograph: Marc BrennerIsabella Colby Browne’s Juliet is often playfully petulant, complemented by Steffan Cennydd’s easy, prepossessing swagger as Romeo. Eiry Thomas’s commanding Ffrier Lorens makes an impression and Llinor ap Gwynedd’s excellent turn as the Nyrs, mostly English-speaking but with a broad Welsh accent, is imbued with a new dramatic complexity within the bilingual conceit. After Capulet strikes the Nyrs, calling her a “mumbling fool” for having uttered a Welsh sentence, all kinds of violent prejudices are bracingly exposed in a single, pithy sentence.Similarly, in the seclusion of her cell, the Ffrier and Romeo privately confer in Welsh, but respond to intrusive knocks from the outside world in English. All of this is evocatively staged on Elin Steele’s set of staircases and alcoves, which uses water to great effect – cleansing while also portending catastrophe.While the ambitious concept opens the possibility of exploring linguistic identity, intertwined with familial and class allegiances, its impact feels nebulous when the deployment of different languages is not underpinned by dramatic logic and instead seems arbitrary. The experience can feel discordant and the scenes performed mostly in one language or the other (and one particularly elegiac sequence with no words at all) are more compelling.Staged in association with the Globe, the production’s tour will end on the bank of the Thames where perhaps such conceptual dissonances will be less of an issue to audiences unfamiliar with the Welsh language. As a production, it clearly speaks from thecalon. But as well as that heart, you yearn for more logic.AtSherman theatre, Cardiff, until 3 October.

Dancers strewn across the stage, moving in sporadic tugs and jerks, or writhing flesh-to-flesh or just flat out on the floor, dressed only in nude-coloured pants and knee pads. Sweat and exhaustion is the mood.This is Andrea Peña’s Bogotá. Peña, from Colombia and now based in Montreal, has a background in design but is now an award-winning choreographer. And hers is the opening show of this year’s Dance Umbrella festival, which is bringing new voices in dance to the UK.Bogotá is inspired by mythology, spiritualism and magical realism. It’s about how bodies hold memory, grief and post-colonial identities – or that’s the blurb anyway. The setting is a kind of “no place”: some scaffolding, plastic sheeting hanging from the ceiling, stuff you might find backstage. In the opening voiceover, Peña says something about building bonds and imagining new futures, but it’s difficult to bond when the mood is alienation. This is more like revolt than rebuilding, moving towards anarchy. At one point, the powerful dancer Frédérique Rodier stands atop a speaker stack giving the middle finger to the sound of an operatic chorus. It might be an “up yours” to colonialism (I’m guessing the struggle for Indigenous land and rights in Colombia is part of this, but we’re grasping in the dark really).View image in fullscreenFlat out … Andrea Peña & Artists: Bogotá.Photograph: Raphaelle Bob GarciaWhen they actually dance, in surprisingly organised sequences, the movement has raw energy, punch and power, and sensual stretch. There’s one point where they gather as a pack at the front of the stage, moving as one like a nest of vipers.There’s a strand of contemporary dance where the dancers are really going on a journey, it’s a trip, a ritual of transformation. You can see it when they come to at the curtain call, dripping with sweat, eyes blinking in the light. But is it enough to be a witness to that? What’s in it for us in the audience?And yet. There is something bold, visionary even, in committing to an alternative world on stage, where you have to let go of time and any other expectations – whether that’s satisfying viewing or not.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 3 October.Dance Umbrella festival continues until 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

This Shakespearean classic now marks the maiden voyage for Robert Hastie as the venue’s new deputy artistic director. His production is elegant, fluid and full of clever ideas and updates. Hamlet (Hiran Abeysekera) wears a cool black suit or leisure wear, addressing the audience directly in his soliloquies, sometimes sitting at the edge of the stage to implore and make eye contact.But the most unusual twist to this modern-dress version is its comedy. The usually morose Dane is anything but in Abeysekera’s hands. He draws out the physical humour of his part, seeming already antic before he assumes that disposition. It is as if he has been ascribed the job of Shakespeare’s universal wise fool, complete with ruff collar when the Players arrive.Abeysekera is no stranger to this stage (he performed at the National in Rubasingham’s The Father and the Assassin in 2023) and he has a sure, limber presence, making for a cocky young prince. He jumps and whoops when he sees the vision of his dead father, who commands him to avenge his murder (the opening few scenes are brilliantly ghostly), he jiggles on the spot and makes guns with his fingers.View image in fullscreenAn astonishing portrayal … Francesca Mills as Ophelia, front, and Tessa Wong as Horatio.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHe also speaks at a rapid-fire speed. To undercut the too famous soliloquies? To create bathos? Sometimes, the words and meanings get swallowed up and his meditations on life, death and revenge are lost in the jumble.Polonius (Geoffrey Streatfeild) mines his part for more overt comedy, his children, Laertes (Tom Glenister) and Ophelia (Francesca Mills), even joining in with the speech in which he imparts life advice, as if he has said it too many times before. Rosencrantz (Hari Mackinnon) and Guildenstern (Joe Bolland) are satirised preppy types.Hamlet has been played as an outright comedy before,in Sean Holmes’s 2022 production at Shakespeare’s Globe. That was audacious and flawed. This seems more like a halfway house, tonally, and when it swings to seriousness the drama begins to carry you. Hamlet’s rejection of Ophelia feels charged and when Abeysekera slows down his delivery, such as in the “quintessence of dust” speech by the graveside, he is magnificent, but these are glimpses of a slower – better – pace.View image in fullscreenFluid … Hiran Abeysekera (Hamlet), Tom Glenister (Laertes) and Mary Higgins (Osric) in Hamlet.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt is Mills who steals the show with her astonishing portrayal of Ophelia, which is a feat given her dearth of lines. Mills maximises their effect, bringing strength, sarcasm and her own intelligent brand of comedy to one of the play’s most emotionally fragile characters and the scene in which Ophelia unravels with grief feels truly dangerous in her hands.This play’s still the thing! Hamlet at the National Theatre – in picturesRead moreYou wish for the same bolshie intensity from others. Claudius (Alistair Petrie) and Gertrude (Ayesha Dharker) do not have enough of a frisson between them. There is an emotional vacancy whenHamleturges her to turn away from her murderous husband; the scene is played neither for its oedipal undertones nor its aggression.The framing of the story contains no wider politics either, or real-world resonances. So it seems simultaneously modern and unrelated to our world. Most of the action takes place on a single set designed by Ben Stones – an opulent room which gestures towards the past with a backdrop of Renaissance-era angels and cherubim, but marking the present, too. It is ingenious and ravishing, as is Jessica Hung Han Yun’s lighting design.So, a well-put together, beautifully choreographed production but one with a frustrating emotional vacuum at its centre.At theLyttelton theatre, National Theatre, London, until 22 November andin cinemasfrom 22 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreNational TheatreHamletWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

But while the new movie has a director and writer attached, we’re still none the wiser as to who will play the super-spyBen ChildFri 3 Oct 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 11.24 EDTShareIt’s James Bond Day this Sunday, if you didn’t know – 5 October is now a celebration of all things 007, thanks to this being the date of the world premiere of Dr No, the very first Bond film, starringSean Connery, in 1962. Imagine it as a bit like Star Wars Day, with fewer Wookiees and Ewoks and a whole lot more tuxedoed swagger.This year though, the advent of JBD (as no one has ever called it) is bit of a damp squib. It hasn’t been that long sinceDenis Villeneuve was announced as the directorof the next Bond film (June, in fact) and even less time sincePeaky Blinders’ Steven Knight was hired to write the script. But there’s been little to no sign since then of the new 007 actually being revealed, and even less sense of where this venerable franchise is going next. All we have arewhisperings on the wind via the Hollywood tradesto the effect that the film-makers will be looking for a relatively youthful (in his 20s or 30s) Brit, who could be a person of colour but is not going to be a woman, a franchise star, or anyone we’ve vaguely heard of.This is, of course, disappointing news for the hordes of online bookmakers who have been making a pretty penny for months now out of trying to convince punters that it is a race between Callum Turner,Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Henry Cavill, Theo James, Leo Woodall and that hunky guy in Saltburn who’s secretly Australian.Intriguingly, the last time the movie franchise actually went for a complete unknown was in 1969, whenGeorge Lazenbybriefly took up the Walther PPK. Before that, Connery himself certainly wasn’t a star: he had had a few minor film roles and done a bit of stage and modelling work (he was famously in the chorus line of the touring version of South Pacific) as well as working as a bodybuilder and milkman in Edinburgh before taking the lead role in Dr No. Producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman specifically didn’t want a household name; they wanted someone fresh whom audiences would accept as Bond himself, rather than as an actor playing Bond.Repeating this trick could turn out to be an ingenious move, just as it was in the early 1960s.But getting Villeneuve involved means that there is no get-out clause at all if this new Bond turns out to be a stiff. Dialling up the exploding pens and innuendo is no longer an option when your new director is a solemn auteur of genre film-making best known for ponderous sci-fi epics where the loudest sound is the audience’s own existential dread.View image in fullscreenA bruiser in a dinner jacket … Daniel Craig in 2006’s Casino Royale.Photograph: Sony Pictures/AllstarAnd yet, in many ways, hiring Villeneuve tells us everything we need to know about the new post-Daniel Craig direction. There are not going to be any invisible cars or double entendres, and we probably won’t be getting Sheriff JW Pepper back any time soon either. All of this is, of course, absolutely fine if you like your 007 with a modern twist. But it doesn’t tell us how Villeneuve’s take on Britain’s suavest state-sponsored assassin will stand out from the 007s who immediately preceded him (especially if the new era doesn’t choose to take the whole story back to Ian Fleming’s original 50s and 60s setting).Craig was immediately recognisable as a new kind of dapper super-spy when he arrived on the scene in 2006’s Casino Royale, a bruiser in a dinner jacket who would never be caught dead in an invisible car, or trading sex puns with Denise Richards while defusing a nuclear warhead. He made Pierce Brosnan’s gadget-addled smoothie, who only a few years previously had been considered by some as the best Bond since Connery, look like a karaoke Connery left too long in the microwave. Not that this is anything new. Lazenby (briefly) followed Connery, Brosnan followed the underrated Timothy Dalton, and cheesy late-era Roger Moore followed brilliantly dead-eyed and callous early Roger Moore. Every era of 007 redefines the last one, yet they are all in their own way James Bond 007, and worth raising a glass to. It’s just a little weird, as we apparently celebrate this year’s Bond Day, that we are being invited to toast one who doesn’t even exist yet.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekJames BondThrillersSean ConneryPierce BrosnanGeorge LazenbyDaniel CraigfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now the city of her birth, Antwerp, is hosting a major exhibition to place her in the modernist pantheon, alongsidePiet Mondrian,Amedeo Modiglianiand Alexander Archipenko, the Ukrainian sculptor who was her mentor, as well as romantic and creative partner.The exhibition, which opens on Saturday at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts (KMSKA) in Antwerp, showcases 55 of her works, from cubist paintings in warm colours, shimmering impressions of textiles, to flatter abstract pieces. Donas is in the company of Archipenko and La Section d’Or, a pan-European association of artist and writers, who aspired to promote modernism without cliques or manifestos.View image in fullscreenHet Prentenboek (The Picture Book) by Marthe Donas.Photograph: Marthe Donas Foundation, Gent, 2025The show reveals a different side to modernism, neither shocking likeMarcel Duchamp’s urinalnor stark likeKazimir Malevich’s black square. For Donas and Archipenko, “a sense of abstraction goes hand in hand with elegance”, the curator Adriaan Gonnissen said. “There is a real drive for renewal, for innovation … but there is also this incredible thirst, a hunger for classical beauty.”Unlike Duchamp orJackson Pollock, La Section d’Or were not radicals, Gonnissen said.One of the most prized works on display is The Dance, which Donas painted in 1918-19. The work was considered lost, until discovered in Japan in preparation for this exhibition.Donas was born in 1885 to a well-to-do French-speaking family in Antwerp. Her grandfather had been a realist painter, but Donas’s father was not keen on his daughter following this path; he removed her from art school in 1902 after a month.A decade later Donas enrolled again, determined to be an artist, after a life-changing accident. She fell off a roof while trying to catch a glimpse of King Albert I, who was visiting Antwerp, smashing through a glass ceiling on her way down. Her studies were then interrupted by the German invasion of 1914. While her family fled to the Netherlands, Marthe went to Dublin, where she enrolled in art school and learned how to make stained glass. After a spell in Paris, which was pivotal for her art but drained her savings, she went to the French Riviera as a drawing instructor to a rich lady.Donas met Archipenko in Nice in 1917. The pair soon clicked. He described her as “my best student” and began to promote her work. Donas created her shaped paintings, works that shunned traditional rectangles for uniquely shaped pictures that highlighted their cubist distortions.View image in fullscreenDetail from Stilleven (Still Life), 1917, by Marthe Donas.Photograph: Hugo Maertens/Marthe Donas Foundation, Gent, 2025While modern shaped paintings are often attributed to the Hungarian artist Peter László Péri, Gonnissen believes Donas was the first of her generation to pioneer this “totally different art form”.But her contribution was overlooked. At the time, cubism and abstract art were seen as male preserves; too intellectual, too rational, for sensitive women.More than a century later, Donas is slowly gaining recognition. KMSKA, which reopened in 2022 aftera far-reaching renovation, wants to promote female artists in the collection. Before the revamp, the museum had only one of Donas’s works, which was not always on display.The exhibition reflects a growing movement to recover long-neglected female masters, such as the Italian baroque artistArtemisia Gentileschior her near contemporary from the southern Netherlands,Michaelina Wautier.Other exhibitionshave brought out of dusty storerooms the works of theAmerican impressionist Mary Cassattand the Spanish modernistMaruja Mallo.Peter Pauwels, an art historian, has spent two decades trying to bring attention to Donas, who he admires for “the elegance, the colours, the originality and the beauty” of her work. A specialist in Belgian modernism, Pauwels knew Donas’s work because his grandparents collected it, but she was otherwise unknown in the Flemish art world 20 years ago. A co-curator of the exhibition, Pauwels criticises the condescension of Donas’s contemporaries. She wasn’t “a young pupil” when she met Archipenko, but a 32-year-old artist in her own right, he said.The relationship between Donas and Archipenko had ended by mid-1921. Donas married and moved to the Walloon countryside; Archipenko emigrated to America. Then Donas dropped off the artistic map for two decades from the late 1920s, after she unexpectedly became a mother aged 45. Decades later, Donas played down the connection with Archipenko, claiming she had only spent “a few months working at the sculptor’s studio”.This exhibition reveals a much more intense creative spark. It ends with two works: a composition by Donas that appears to have been inspired by an Archipenko sculpture she kept after the break-up. The vivid colours and curves of the two works are in harmony, but Pauwels said “she does something of her own, she never copied”.Donas, Archipenko & La Section d’Or.

As he struggles to reach the hospital where his mother lies dying, he is angry and afraid, tormented by memories of their changing relationship. He recalls the moment the phone rang with the command to hurry to her bedside, the moment he witnessed a fatal attack during the conflict that drove them from their home, the moment he ceased to recognise his mother’s face, calling her only “the woman with the blond hair”, such – we gather – was the traumatic impact of exile on them both.Wahab’s reminiscences loop, falter, intertwine. The resulting spoken monologue, adapted by Wout van Tongeren from a novel by Lebanese-Canadian writerWajdi Mouawad, runs almost continuously through the work. In Oum’s UK premiere, it was a tour-de-force delivered by Dutch actorNadia Amin, who conjured the unthinkable on the nearly empty stage of Barbican Hall as she ran and froze, stamped and cowered.But the narrative is also haunted by music. There is no chance that Wahab’s mother (his “oum”, in Arabic) will die soundlessly. WithinBushra El-Turk’s score – part opera, part soundtrack, part commentary on the unfolding story – the work’s fleeting silences are shocking in their intensity. Amin was amplified but still periodically swamped by the waves of delicate trills and tremolo, long curling lines of unison melody and brief, catastrophic dissonances of the music.View image in fullscreenNadia Amin (left) as Wahab in Oum – A Son’s Quest for His Mother.Photograph: Mark AllanBorn in Britain to Lebanese parents, El-Turk often stages dialogues and tensions between different musical languages. Oum is scored for the culturally hybrid forces of theAmsterdam Andalusian Orchestra, whose players (strings, percussion, flutes and accordion plus theoudandqanunof traditional Arabic music) switched between ornamental filigree and searing lyricism, the accordion providing single, ethereal sustained notes and harsh cluster chords in alternation. A trio of singers, sliding virtuosically between Middle Eastern and European operatic idioms, echoed some of Wahib’s English phrases but otherwise sang in richly melismatic Arabic. Towards the end, the trio’s smoky, velvet-voiced contralto Ghalia Benali performed the song that underpins El-Turk’s score:“Al Atlal” (The Ruins), one of the signature numbers of mid-century Egyptian superstar singer and Arab national treasureUmm Kulthum. While many in the audience hummed and clapped, Japanese conductorKanako Abe, who had energetically coordinated passages of improvisation and intricate scoring alike, put down her baton to nod along, smiling in appreciation.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

A man in a T-shirt cradles an infant, a kid in sneakers sits glumly in the foreground. Overhead in the towering clouds, the Lamb of God stands on a white altar amid the clustering gleam of golden pendulous stripes evoking the presence of God.The scene, humane and magnificent, is a part of what is perhaps the most significant new piece of public art in today’s riven America.From a Utah church to a Denver museum: the man who found 75 pyramids in the USRead moreTitled What’s So Funny about Peace, Love, and Understanding (after the Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello song), the 25ft-tall multi-part mural by New York artist Adam Cvijanovic celebrates the church and city’s tradition of welcoming immigrants. In this particular time of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents dragging people off the streets, it constitutes a prodigious rallying cry – a luminous affirmation of empathy and solidarity.“What I want people to realize from the mural,” declares the artist, “is that we’re all in this together. And to have this enormous platform to say something like that is an extraordinary privilege.”St Patrick’s, known as “America’s parish church,” serves about 2.5 million New York Archdiocese Catholics. It’s one of the two most important cathedrals in the country and by far the most visible with 5 million visitors a year. What’s So Funny about Peace, Love, and Understanding represents the largest permanent artwork commissioned by the cathedral in its 146-year history. Prominent art adviser Suzanne Geiss curated the project.In Cvijanovic’s competition-winning vision, his mural realizes archbishop cardinal Timothy Dolan’s longtime wish to commemorate the celebrated apparition of the Virgin Mary, with Joseph, St John the Baptist, the Lamb of God and angels, at a little rural church in Knock, Ireland, in 1879, the same year St Patrick’s was consecrated.View image in fullscreenAdam Cvijanovic in front of his mural.Photograph: Richard Drew/APCvijanovic expands that commemoration to include Irish immigrants of yore – St Patrick’s was the New York church of Irish immigrants – and New York’s broader multicultural immigration. He further honors New York figures notable for their service, both religious and non-religious.The mural’s long west wall, flanking the cathedral’s main doors, features a quintet of historic local Catholic notables on one side and on the other, a quintet of modern-day uniformed first responders. Over each grouping hovers a monumental angel in a setting again of those gleaming stripes evoking God’s presence. On the north wall, the Knock apparition’s main holy protagonists float in lustrous glory above bygone Irish arrivals disembarking from a ship. The newcomers are rendered mainly in the whites and blue-grays of a faded photo or film. On the south wall across from them, in colors rich and bright, the throng of today’s immigrants includes in their midst Italian-born Mother Cabrini, the 19th-century patron saint of immigrants, and Cuban-born Father Félix Varela, a 19th-century activist for immigrants and the poor. Some of the newcomers look aloft, others gaze ahead resolutely; others seem to be waiting, perhaps listening. There’s a reverberation here, for this viewer, of the crowd at the Sermon on the Mount.For the five west-wall Catholic notables the archdiocese named Irish-born archbishop John Hughes, who commissioned the building of St Patrick’s; Dorothy Day, the ex-bohemian New Yorker turned social activist for the poor; and Pierre Toussaint, the former enslaved Haitian who became a New York society hairdresser and major Catholic benefactor. Cvijanovic added New York state’s 17th-century Saint Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American canonized, and picked Al Smith, the popular New York politico of the 1920s and 1930s, cigar in hand. The first responders were Cvijanovic’s idea too. He’d personally witnessed their brethren in action in the apocalyptic smoke at Ground Zero on September 11.The mural’s painting style is straightforwardly representational – a deeply purposeful choice.View image in fullscreenCardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, with Adam Cvijanovic.Photograph: Diane Bondareff/AP Content Services for the Archdiocese of New YorkBecause this is an American painting, Cvijanovic tells me, not a European one. “Europeans have hundreds of years of incredible ecclesiastical art,” he said. “They don’t need to do it that way any more. But we do.” The European sort of “anchor sanctuary art-faith places” don’t commonly exist in the US. So when thinking about making imagery for one of the country’s most important churches, Cvijanovic wanted the mural to be “foundational”.“From a European perspective, the painting is completely retrograde,” he says. “But from an American perspective, it’s needed to form a basis for other things to come out of.”The Americanizing showcases Cvijanovic’s melting pot of influences. He loves John Singer Sargent, evident in his dashing flair with an Irish immigrant’s complicated dress. John Ford is a “massive” influence – the movie director’s way with figures against a landscape. The lineups of Catholic notables and first responders mirror Eastern Christian iconostases – but posed as if in action-movie hero posters a la X-Men. Meanwhile the great angels in their spread-winged splendor are inspired by Byzantine masterworks.And why does the angel over the first responders cradle a firefighter’s helmet and police hat? It’s an emblem of succor and protection that Cvijanovic recalled from a statue of the Virgin Mary cradling a miniature fishing boat atop a seamen’s church near Boston. He even tucks in a little portrait of Mexico’s Diego Rivera (high up on the south wall), an artist’s homage to Rivera’s notoriously removed 1933 leftist mural across Fifth Avenue in Rockefeller Center.The 64-year-old Cvijanovic has become a leading practitioner of very large-scale art, with, among numerous examples, an epic mural sequence of empty American-involved battlefields for the Bean Federal Center in Indianapolis, and an extravagantly tumultuous depiction of a scene from DW Griffith’s movie Intolerance for a New York gallery. He grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, son of a Serbian immigrant architect who worked closely with Walter Gropius, the German immigrant master of the Bauhaus. Gropius gave him a set of colored pencils when he was a kid, Cvijanovic recalls. He didn’t go to art school. “I didn’t want to make art the way they would teach,” he says simply.View image in fullscreenAdam Cvijanovic’s mural in St Patrick’s Cathedral.Photograph: Richard Drew/APThe mural’s enormous labor involved about 30 people, including an eminent fine-art gilder for the (very costly) upper-mural stripes of gold leaf, platinum and heated titanium. It took Cvijanovic five months to sketch the work in his huge studio in Brooklyn’s Navy Yard, then nine months for the arduous painting – clambering up and down a scaffold to gauge things, and carrying sketches of the angels to the cathedral to assess them taped to the empty walls.I tell him that the final work, radiant and profoundly stirring in its grandeur and humanity, fits seamlessly into the cathedral. The gleaming stripes seem to merge into the pipes of the cathedral’s great organ above. “Well, my father was an architect,” he replies. “So I understood how to plan for the space.”As for Cardinal Dolan, who is retiring – and who controversially just nowcomparedthe murdered Charlie Kirk to St Paul – he declared at the mural’s presentation to the press: “Some have asked me, are you trying to make a statement about immigration? Well, sure we are, all right? Namely, that immigrants are children of God.”“We’re all in this together, “Cvijanovic repeats to me. “Whether we like it or not,” he adds. There are Trump supporters among the models. And multiple different religions. “But shared humanity means shared humanity,” he insists. “It’s not reserved just for whom you get along with.”Explore more on these topicsPaintingNew YorkArtUS immigrationIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

When I take my aids out to sleep, you could fire a gun next to my ear and I wouldn’t stir. But with them in I have fairly clear access to sound.I grew up in Hackney, east London, and had been fascinated by raving ever since I spied my older cousins coming home from illegal parties at six in the morning. On New Year’s Eve in 1993, I finally went to my first one. The second I walked through that door, I was hit by the lights and smoke, the throbbing beats, the bodies moving joyfully as one.I was hooked. I spent weekends bouncing about like a ragamuffin in airport hangars, basements and disused factories all over the country. I started learning to DJ, spending the wages I earned from working in a warehouse on UK garage and reggae records.Yet, despite being a dedicated raver for a decade, I hardly ever encountered other deaf people on those dancefloors. I think I met a grand total of two.I tried to convince friends from a deaf social group to come out with me. “Nah, that’s hearing culture,” they said. “It’s not for us.” I could understand: I’d once been turned away by a club bouncer for being deaf. But I wanted them to discover the same thrills I had. I also knew they’d appreciate a late night plus chances to bond with other deaf adults were thin on the ground. So I decided to set up the world’s first rave by deaf people, for deaf people.We’ve consulted on a vibrating floor at a nightclub and worked with a company making vests that tremble in sync to musicFinding a venue was a headache. Bookers were clueless about the concept. Some thought it was a joke. Others worried we’d DJ at dangerous volumes. Many deaf partygoers connect with music by feeling the bass thump through them, so wedoplay tracks with meaty basslines and amp up the deep beats, but not to a level that’ll get anyone a visit from the council for noise pollution, or damage any eardrums.Eventually we got a yes from the International Students House in central London. The date was set for May bank holiday 2003. My whole family slapped flyers everywhere, and 700 tickets sold like wildfire.Deaf culture is very visual; there also needed to be plenty to see, so I hired deaf dancer mates to breakdance on stage.I cried that inaugural night. I was so moved. Everyone was constantly hugging – not because of any pills, but because of the pure joy of being immersed in deaf community. Deaf people are usually the minority; atDeaf Rave, everyone was part of the same tribe.Drum’n’bass beats weren’t the only thing that got mixed and matched that evening – it was the start of a long legacy of Deaf Rave romances. Over the years, some ravers have got married, had babies, and settled down away from the club scene. They’re missed, but it’s the sweetest goodbye.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve expanded my crew – bringing in new members likeMC Geezer, a deaf rapper who signs BSL as he spits bars – and we’ve played major festivals, such as Glastonbury and Boomtown. We’ve consulted on a vibrating floor installed at the nightclub Fabric, and worked with a company that makeshaptic veststhat tremble in sync to music. We also travelled to Shanghai to perform as part of a deaf cultural exchange. I’m a quarter Chinese myself – plus Vietnamese, Guyanese and English – and am known asDJ Chinaman, so it was an especially poignant trip.In 2024, I was awarded an honorary master of the arts by Falmouth University, then earlier this year, I was made an MBE. The shock knocked me sideways. It’s given me the boost to keep supporting deaf identity, culture and community. We’vestarted working with children – we teach DJing workshops to deaf kids in schools, and are holding aDeaf Rave family day festivalin London this weekend. Whether we’re in the clubs, or in the classrooms, the deaf must be heard.As told to Alix FoxDo you have an experience to share?

Be like my 85-year-old buddy GerryFriendship falters due to the belief it should just happen on its own. The solution: make a conscious effort to be socialStephen MarcheFri 3 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 10.26 EDTShareIhave a friend named Gerry. I didn’t have much choice about being Gerry’s friend. If Gerry decides you’re going to be his friend, you don’t have much choice about it. He calls. He invites. He emails. If you don’t answer, if you can’t make it, if you make plans and then cancel, he doesn’t care. He keeps calling. He keeps inviting. He keeps emailing. The man is relentless in his mission to connect.And guess what? Gerry has a lot of friends.In a world where men suffer from unprecedented loneliness, Gerry is an extreme rarity: a man who works on his friendships. I can’t help wondering why he is so unique.Gerry is 85, which is 36 years older than me. One weekend, he invited me to his cottage with several other friends, most of whom were around his age.At one point after dinner, as a bit of a parlor game, they went around the room giving me advice as the younger, if not exactly young, man at the table. Much of their counsel boiled down to the fact that I will need to have more money in the future than I currently have, which I already knew.Gerry’s contribution at first seemed less hard-headed but was far more practical and has remained with me ever since: “Never lose a friend.”What if, instead of treating social life as something you inhabit, you treated it like something you made?When I later asked Gerry what he meant, he told me a story about a man we knew, a man who, when all is said and done, was an asshole. They were having some random fight about politics, and as it grew more and more heated, the asshole said: “I don’t think we can talk any more, we’re too far apart.”Gerry refused to allow him to end the friendship.“I’m going to call this week, and I’m going to call next week, and I’m going to call the week after,” he said. “You can answer or not but I’m going to call.”That’s what I mean when I say you don’t have much of a choice about being Gerry’s friend. And his wisdom was truly life-changing to me. What if you took total responsibility for your own social life? What if, instead of treating social life as something you inhabit, you treated it like something you made?At this point, writing about the dangers of loneliness feels like writing about the dangers of smoking. Everyone already knows. The evidence is overwhelming; the debate is long over.Still, there is a small industry devoted to describing masculine loneliness, and how damaging its effects are. By oneestimate, being lonely has as much effect on your mortality as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Social isolation increases the risk of premature death by 29%. One 2024 survey found that only 27% of men had six or more close friends; in 1990, another survey put the number at 55%. Today, about 17% of men say they have no close friends at all.Researchers have been trying to figure out the source of the accelerating loneliness since Robert Putnam publishedBowling Alonein 2000. The answers are mostly vague and culture-based: there is a stigma against male intimacy, supposedly, and men, in the exhausting world of late capitalism, do not have the time and energy for friendships.That’s the idea, anyway.If there’s a secret to life, it’s bonding with othersThe directors of theHarvard Study of Adult Development, in place since 1938 and among the most methodologically sound sociological investigations ever undertaken, examined the lives of a huge array of men from a wide range of backgrounds, and came to a single overwhelming insight. “It’s the longest in-depth longitudinal study on human life ever done, and it’s brought us to a simple and profound conclusion,” they wrote in 2023. “Good relationships lead to health and happiness.”It’s kind of as simple as that. If there’s a secret to life, it’s bonding with others.The reason loneliness produces such harmful effects is that human beings are social animals. The need for society, for a group of friends, is essential to human nature. Today, people are reaching out tochatbots for therapy and companionship. That is like drinking salt water to slake your thirst. Imitation society will not suffice. Face-to-face contact is not a negotiable aspect of your humanity. If you deny it, you will suffer.Of course, you already know this. Men know it. They feel it in their bones. So why are there not more Gerrys in the world? Why don’t men work at their friendships?One reason male friendship falters is the lingering belief that it should just happen on its own. To work at it seems to betray the very idea of friendship. We are told connection should be effortless, so intentional socializing feels faintly embarrassing, even pathetic. Men go around pretending that they are not the kind of men who need other people, because expressing that need makes them vulnerable.Ask questions, practice and know when to make an exit: how to start a conversationRead moreBut everything human beings need makes them look ridiculous. In the 1960s and 1970s, exercise also seemed absurd and humiliating and artificial – why would you consciously work at tiring yourself out? In 1968, a Connecticut runner was stopped by the police for “illegal use of a highway by a pedestrian”. That same year, the New York Times gently mocked the emerging trend: “Today the majority of runners – or ‘joggers,’ thank you – seem to be securely middle-aged, that great awkward crowd of us too old for LSD and too young for Medicare.”The reason jogging took off in the 60s is that society required it. During the 50s, farm labour declined by 37%, and during the 1960s by a further 38%. If you’re baling hay or herding cattle, you don’t need to go to the gym. But suddenly, far fewer men were baling hay and herding cattle. Physical activity was no longer something that just happened. People figured out that their bodies needed movement.If you don’t move your body, you will be miserable. Physical activity is about1.5 times more effectivein treating mild-to-moderate depression, stress and anxiety than any treatment. Most people accept this reality.Socialization, like physical activity, also used to be something that happened to you: big families, school, maybe camp, then college or a factory, then church or synagogue or the mosque, plus community leagues, neighbourhood associations, hobbies where you used to have to gather. Once upon a time, it was a struggle to find solitude, to find a way out of the crowd.The format of contemporary existence has changed those accidental interactions – the internet, social media, working from home, etc. It should be no surprise that loneliness is accelerating. Why would it not be?There’s nothing more interesting than people, and even people who you think might not be superficially interestingGerryJust like exercise, the process of conscious socialization is not as complicated as finding the will to do it, at least in my experience. If I meet a guy I like, I go out for drinks with him. I organize get-togethers. I never take a cancellation personally. I have a friend – and I think everyone has a friend like this – who cancels plans at the last minute more times than not. I don’t care. I just keep rescheduling.I’m trying to be like Gerry. If I like somebody, they will have very little choice about the matter.So how did Gerry get so good at his friendships? “I’m not going to tell you I think I’m so good,” he told me. “I’ve always been a bit of a keep-in-toucher but I was never the kind of guy who wanted to be the class secretary.”For him, the process that seems so foreign to young men today came naturally, as an outgrowth of his curiosity. “There’s nothing more interesting than people, and even people who you think might not be superficially interesting. If you go out for lunch or dinner, you find out everybody’s got a story. The least obvious people have the greatest stories. It’s a really important form of intimacy when you share stories. And it’s not even confidential stories. It’s just they’re your stories. There’s a whole spectrum of confidences in life.”To be clear, I am not talking about networking. The use-value of a social life is not to advance your career down various paths of connection. That is why LinkedIn exists. The use-value is contact in itself. Simply being in the presence of somebody whose presence you enjoy is enough, but there can be big gains from it.If Gerry needs to know something about Canadian literature or the gossip about some journalist, he just calls me up and I tell him. And he has a guy like me foreverything. If there’s some controversy around a point of law, he calls up a former supreme court justice who’s a buddy. He probably has a guy who knows the Asian bond market. It’s not like Gerry and I share many political opinions, but he is invulnerable to disinformation. His effort at connection has plugged him into the facts.Tell us about your bad first date experiencesRead moreYounger friends and older friends are particularly valuable, I think. You can learn things from men of other generations that you just cannot learn any other way. I learned from the older men that no one should be in power over the age of 75, and that, after you reach a certain age, there is no such thing as an unhappy widow. My younger friends keep trying to find me a therapist, which is kind of them.I should also point out that I do not consider myself “good” at socialization. I am no Gerry. It’s a bit like when I started running. I ran for a bit, then walked for a bit, then ran for a bit. My lungs hurt and it felt unnatural. It’s the same with conscious socialization. At first it’s annoying and can be humiliating – you’re asking people for their time and you get rejected. Then it feels good and you notice that it feels good, then it becomes a cherished part of the day, and then it becomes a requirement for basic sanity.People are always interested in people who are interested in themGerryThere are regular embarrassments of course, just like with exercise. Sometimes, when I manage to pull my fat ass out for a run, I get passed by some elfin 20-year-old sprinting past me. I don’t judge myself and I don’t judge others. I’m operating at my level. Everybody has their own limits, their own preferences. Like almost everything that matters, 90% is just showing up.Embarrassment goes away pretty fast, I have found. The advantages outweigh the stigma so overwhelmingly. “At first you think everyone is staring at you – and they are,” a jogger told the New York Times back in 1968. “After a while you enjoy jogging so much that you don’t give a damn.” The mockery of jogging eventually stopped of its own accord. The people who made fun of it all died.“Not everyone I want to have lunch with wants to have lunch. They don’t like me. They find me annoying. Whatever,” Gerry says. Rejection does not dissuade him: “I do make the effort. Get out there. Be open. Join a club. Go to a book launch. Say hello to somebody you don’t know, ask them who they are. People are always interested in people who are interested in them.”‘Men seem to make life for women worse’: single US women share the woes of dating in 2025Read moreThat last remark, in particular, seems to me to be the key to Gerry’s success. It’s hard not to enjoy the company of people who enjoy your company.In 2016, the UK government ran a year-long Commission on Loneliness. Its final report was at least honest: government can’t do much. Loneliness seems like some kind of vague background force nobody can do much about, a nefarious social breakdown beyond anyone’s control.The only substantial plan is for men to take responsibility for their own socialization the way they take responsibility for their fitness. The gyms are full of men who work out because they know that, if they don’t, they will be less healthy and therefore less attractive and therefore less happy. The only solution to the crisis of loneliness is a similarly conscious effort in social life, what Gerry does. Loneliness is not insoluble. It just takes some solving.If you’re lonely, do you try?

That means it’s also time to start thinking about beauty Advent calendars.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It may still feel early, but our favourite brands and retailers have already released their 2025 calendars, many of which sell out long before the festive season starts. In fact, theSpace NK beauty Advent calendar, which was my top recommendation, sold out at the end of September.Offering a selection of high-end cosmetics for less than their usual price, beauty Advent calendars have become a holy grail for the beauty obsessed. There are dozens to choose from at wildly different prices, some focusing on specific product types, and some filled with a mixture of bestsellers.To help with choice paralysis, I’ve been trawling the shelves for calendars filled with cult favourites suitable for various skin types and preferences, narrowing down the nine best beauty Advent calendars of the 2025 season.While these Advent calendars can’t exactly be seen as a net positive for the environment, I also looked at their recyclability and for calendars with the broadest possible appeal, to avoid any wasted products.At a glanceBest beauty Advent calendar overall:CultBeautythe Classic Curation£240 at Cult BeautyBest value beauty Advent calendar:Lookfantastic beauty Advent calendar£105 at LookfantasticBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendar£205 at LushBest for essential makeup and skincare:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendar£150 at BootsBest for product range:Next 25 days of beauty Advent calendar£95 at NextBest entry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar£19.95 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI make a living testing health and beauty products, from hair masks andhairdryerstobody moisturisersand concealers. That means I’m more familiar with the best formulations than many beauty fanatics.Testing hundreds of products means I’ve become an expert in all things skincare, hair care and makeup – the main contents of beauty Advent calendars. I also have a certification in cosmetic science, so I know how to identify the best products for specific skin and hair needs. As someone with sensitive skin, I also know which ingredients are likely to irritate, so I’ve only selected calendars where products are suitable for most people – so that nothing goes to waste.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI judged each beauty Advent calendar on its product range, the broad usefulness of those products to most people, and the quality and sustainability of its packaging. I longlisted 25 of the most popular calendars from department stores and brands, narrowing down my options based on the contents of each calendar. I then shortlisted the 14 calendars with the best product range and value for money to test at home.Getting hands on with each calendar gave me a better idea of how it is packaged and delivered, its quality and feel, and the merits and size of the products inside. From a sustainability perspective, I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.The goodies inside the calendars generally came in packaging that can be recycled at home, but all can otherwise be taken to one of many cosmetic recycling schemes, where pumps, sprays and bottles can be recycled properly. These include Space NK’s collaboration withHandle, and theRecycle at Boots scheme, which gets you extra points on your Advantage card for every empty you return.Most Advent calendars are designed to have broad appeal, but I also assessed how useful each selection of products would be. For makeup, that meant looking for neutral, wearable shades, rather than wild fluorescent colours. For hair care, I looked for formulas that help condition and improve all hair, rather than a specific hair type. I also liked to see gentler skin care products that help with common skin concerns, such as dullness, hydration levels and barrier health, although I didn’t mind an occasional anti-ageing product or spot treatment as these also have a wide appeal.Testing 13 Advent calendars left me with more cosmetics and products than I could ever feasibly use. In instances where I wouldn’t or couldn’t use something from inside the calendars, I donated samples to theRedbridge Reach Outdomestic abuse service, where they could be given to women and young people seeking refuge. If you end up with products you won’t use, it’s always worth looking for a local beauty bank that will take donations or give items to friends and family.Here are the nine beauty Advent calendars that came out on top in my tests.Our favourite beauty Advent calendars in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest beautyAdvent calendar overall:Cult Beauty the Classic CurationView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£240 at Cult BeautyWith my original pick of the Space NK calendar out of stock, my next best pick is this equally bumper-size offering from Cult Beauty. With 34 products inside 25 drawers, this calendar has skincare favourites to help repair stressed-out winter skin, as well as a few standout makeup products to add to your kit.Why we love itIt’s beautiful to look at, and the recyclable packaging feels sturdy and luxurious. It comes with a solid selection of skincare that should help relieve dryness and plump up sensitive skin. That includes a Summer Fridays hydration mist, a Paula’s Choice barrier repair moisturiser and a Byoma Phyto-Mucin glow serum.Those looking for more targeted skincare will find the Elemis Pro-Collagen toning mist, a Medik8 C-Tetra advanced serum, and the spot-fighting Oil La La serum from Krave. All are useful when a spot pops up, or when your skin needs brightening up after a night on the fizz.For hair care you’ll find a scalp recovery serum from Philip Kingsley, a K18 Molecular Repair hair mask and Hair by Sam McKnight’s Love Me Do nourishing hair oil. Great for hair that’s been depleted by winter.This calendar doesn’t scrimp on makeup, either. Inside, you’ll find a powder blush duo from Patrick Ta, a blush from Saie and a Charlotte Tilbury beauty light wand. There’s also a mini By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra Powder, a translucent powder I recently fell in love with – it sets my makeup in place without drying out my skin.It’s a shame that …while most of the skincare in this calendar is good for sensitive and acne-prone skin, watch out for the Kate Somerville exfoliating mask – it’s highly potent, so it can cause irritation if you’re not careful.Number of products:34 (20 full size, 14 mini)Overall value:about £1,100Packaging:domestically recyclableBest value beauty Advent calendar:Lookfantastic beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£105 at LookfantasticMany of the Advent calendars in this roundup justify their steep prices by including high numbers of full-size products, while the cheaper options tend to be mostly stocked with minis. The Lookfantastic calendar bucks this trend, offering 17 full-size products and 11 minis for less than half the price of the Cult Beauty calendar above.Why we love itInside the drawers, you’ll find a balance of indulgent skincare, body care essentials, universally useful makeup, hair care and accessories. Highlights include a Medik8 Hydr8 B5 Intense serum, which gently hydrates and plumps winter-stressed skin, and the Ren CleanSkincareRadiance eye cream, which helps minimise the appearance of dark circles – perfect for mornings when you’ve burned the candle at both ends.There is a 75ml Color Wow shampoo and conditioner set, as well as a mini hydrating, smoothing Wella hair mask that helps nourish stressed-out hair. Makeup-wise, there are three subtle pink-toned lip products from Mac, a full-size Revolution eyeshadow palette and a creamy Glow Hub blush stick. These shades are pigmented enough to work on all skin tones, and can be set in place using the full-size Iconic London Prep Set Blur setting spray.Among these beauty goodies, you’ll find a Sol de Janeiro perfume mist and a White Company candle. I also love that you get two towelling wristbands, which I use to stop water dripping down my arms when I cleanse my face – essential in winter if you want to stop any wet sleeve-induced meltdowns.It’s a shame that …much of the full-size skincare in this calendar is for improving hydration – you won’t find many targeted retinol or vitamin C products here. That said, most people can benefit from extra hydration in the colder months, so this isn’t a huge pitfall.Number of products:28 (17 full size, 11 mini)Overall value:£655Packaging:domestically recyclableBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£205 at LushIf your favourite part of the day is bath time, or you’re hoping to buy an Advent calendar the whole family can enjoy, this colourful option from Lush is my pick. Lush releases a few calendars each year, but this refillable chest is my recommendation: it’s perfect for storing your Lush products, and can be refilled for less money (and packaging) when the brand releases its 2026 calendar next year.Why we love itLush is most known for its fun, freshly made bath bombs – this calendar comes with bombs and bubble bars. Some have sweet scents, others are spiced; all of them are vegan and cruelty-free. If you’re a Lush lover, you’ll have no trouble working your way through this haul.You’ll also get four festive shower gels, two body lotions – including my longtime favourite festive Lush scent, Yog Nog – two soaps, a perfume and a lip scrub. For cosy festive evenings, there are also Lush socks and a Christmas Eve scented candle – no prizes for guessing which door that is hiding behind.This year’s refillable calendar was designed in partnership with Artbox London, a charity that runs workshops for people with learning disabilities and neurodivergent artists. Artist Shruti Gadhvi, who designed this year’s box, took inspiration from the practice of meditation, positive affirmations and the flowers and colours she sees on her travels.It’s a shame that …it’s quite expensive and it’s difficult to calculate the overall value since 10 items are exclusive.Number of products:25Overall value:not statedPackaging:refillable or domestically recyclable (bar the ribbon, which can be reused)Best for essential makeup and skincare:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£150 at BootsBoots’ Advent calendar has a good range of full-size products from big-name brands, such as Drunk Elephant, Nars and Estée Lauder. It may not seem cheap at £150, but it’s filled with buzzy skincare products and makeup most beauty fanatics will want to try. The products inside are worth £612.50.Why we love itIt really looks the part, with a circus-themed chest design that opens to reveal individually wrapped goodies for every day until Christmas Eve. Despite its substantial design, it’s still fully recyclable.Highlights include a full-size viral Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide cream and an Estée Lauder cleansing gel. There’s also a mini-size Elemis cleansing balm – used together, these three make an effective, gentle evening skincare routine most people will love. You’ll also find crowd-pleaser fragrances from Sol de Janeiro and Floral Street.But it’s the makeup that really makes this calendar standout. There are seven full-size makeup products inside: an Iconic London face powder palette, a Fenty liquid lipstick, a Too Faced shimmery lip oil, a Mac lip liner, a Laneige lip balm, Nars light reflecting hydrating primer and a Milk Makeup mini highlighter (the latter of which stretches the meaning of “full size” a little). There are also minis of the Benefit Hoola bronzer, Mac Velvet Teddy lipstick and Laura Mercier loose-setting powder. All staples that will make great additions to any makeup bag.It’s a shame that …there are only two hair care products, so if this is what you’re after, opt for a different calendar.Number of products:25 (17 full size, 8 mini)Overall value:£612.50Packaging:domestically recyclableskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Filled with 27 products, including hair care, skincare, nail care and makeup, it has a healthy dose of everything you need to upgrade your beauty routine.Why we love itRather than filling its doors with basic cleansers and moisturisers, this calendar features targeted skincare, such as a This Works brightening vitamin C serum, a Hello Sunday dark spot oil serum and BeautyPro’s retinol eye masks. Perfect if you already have your skincare basics nailed down.For makeup, the calendar offers a mini Benefit mascara, a full-sized Iconic London eyeshadow palette, a Pixi lip balm and a Delilah lip gloss. All of these are in neutral shades, so they should work with any skin tone and makeup collection.I also love that this calendar doesn’t forget about your nails. Inside, you’ll get an Opi nail lacquer in Bubble Bath and a Nails Inc repairing cuticle oil. The Nuxe multi-purpose dry oil is a particular highlight for me, adding a healthy glow to skin and hair. Throw in a body scrub, candle, perfume and more, and you’ve got a pretty perfect offering for the price.It’s a shame that …some of the skincare will be too niche. For example, if you don’t have dark spots, you’ll have little use for the dark spot oil serum. But the calendar has so much else to offer, it’s still a great buy.Number of products:27 (12 full size, 15 mini)Overall value:£385Packaging:domestically recyclableBestentry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£19.95 at W7£19.95 at AmazonThis Advent calendar from W7 is staggeringly cheap compared with the others here. Inside, you’ll find 24 boxes, each filled with bestsellers from the W7 range, including seven full-size products and 19 minis.Why we love itGood beauty Advent calendars are generally pricey, but the products included in the W7 Advent calendar can rival some of the best in the business.All in, the product selection here is pretty useful for most people – I can’t see any makeup lovers struggling to include these in their routine. I particularly love the brand’s lip liners – you’ll get two in this calendar – and its H2O loose powder sets makeup without causing dryness. Also included is a mini Honolulu Sun Rays bronzer, famously similar to the Benefit Hoola bronzer. Another highlight is the Edgy mascara, which has a curved wand to help lift and curl the lashes as well as biotin, castor oil and vitamin B5 to condition the lashes.The travel-size eyeshadows, primers, lip balms, eye creams and liquid blushes are perfect if you’re just starting out with makeup and want to try new formulations and styles without remortgaging your home. For the cost, this calendar is perfect for those hoping to try out new, budget-friendly products.It’s a shame that …it’s mainly filled with travel minis, though this is perhaps expected given the price.Number of products:24 (7 full size, 17 mini)Overall value:about £50Packaging:domestically recyclableThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSentier Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99 at SentierBest for:fragrance loversThis 12-day calendar (designed for the 12 days of Christmas, so not strictly Advent) from Sentier comes with a range of perfumes and candles to see you through the festive season. It’s beautifully designed and surprisingly well priced considering how long-lasting and potent the scents are.Sentier describes the box it comes in as “meticulously crafted”. It’s certainly the most distinctive calendar of the lot, with doors and drawers opening in unexpected directions to reveal what’s inside.In the box, you’ll get six 10ml alcohol-free scents in pretty glass bottles. In my experience, each scent was distinct, wearable and versatile enough to layer, making them perfect for popping in a handbag. You’ll also get six scented candles, each 60ml in size. I found that these wafted scent around my flat beautifully.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s a soft foam included in the bottom of each drawer, to keep the candle safe. This isn’t recyclable, despite the box being mainly made from card.Number of products:12;overall value:£516;packaging:not fully recyclableBamford ultimate Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£300 at BamfordBest for:self-care and wellbeingIf you’re into baths and self-care rituals but have more refined taste (and a higher budget) than Lush, this celestial-themed Advent calendar from Bamford is a more indulgent option. It comes with a whole host of Bamford favourites, including 13 full-size products and 11 minis to help you wind down during the hectic festive period.In the full-size collection, you’ll find the brand’s bestselling perfume mist, two candles, body oil, bath oil and relaxing bath salts. In mini-size, you’ll find a range of body washes, lotions and hair care – less environmentally friendly perhaps, but handy to take on your travels over Christmas.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s very expensive. And its ratio of full-size to mini products could be better, considering the price.Number of products:24 (13 full size, 11 mini);overall value:about £600;packaging:domestically recyclableDiptyque Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399 at DiptyqueBest for:luxury fragranceDiptyque is the first brand that comes to mind when I think of luxury fragrance, and its 2025 Advent calendar has a huge selection of its bestselling fragrances packed in. That’s both mini and full-size candles, seven different perfumes, a hand cream, an oil and soaps to make your festive season smell great.It’s also one of the most beautiful designs I’ve tried out this year, with a book-shaped box that opens to reveal 25 smaller boxes adorned with book illustrations and the signature Diptyque cat. It will look great surrounded by Christmas decorations throughout December, though its good looks come at a luxury price point.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive, with more reasonably priced competition, and there’s no indication of the calendar’s overall value. That said, perfume fans with deep pockets will love it.Number of products:25;overall value:not stated;packaging:about 90% recyclable; only one drawer has polystyrene in itWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianAre beauty Advent calendars worth it?This depends. If your beauty routine is in need of a refresh and you want to try lots of new products, beauty Advent calendars allow you to do that for a reduced price.Case in point: the Cult Beauty listed above has 34 products with a total value of £1,100. It costs £240, so in theory saves you £860.However, if you have a set beauty routine that works, then the mixed calendars might not be worth it. In this case, a scent-based or body-care Advent calendar may be more suitable as the products are less specific; a series of treats to enjoy rather than a whole new routine.How much should you expect to spend?Beauty Advent calendars can cost anything from £20 to £500 (or more), so there’s something to suit every budget. At the lower end of the scale, you can expect to find calendars from high-street brands, often with mini-size products inside. The packaging on these calendars is likely to be flimsier.Move up to the £100-£200 price range and you can dip your toes into high-end brand calendars, or the department store Advent calendars, which contain a mix of bestselling products from a range of brands. The latter might work best if you’re buying a calendar as a gift, especially if you don’t know which brands the recipient likes best.At the top end of the scale, you’ll find beauty Advent calendars from exclusive high-end brands, usually containing mostly full-size products. Packaging for these calendars is typically more sculptural and eye-catching, but they also come with a high price tag of more than £200.Why are beauty Advent calendars released so early?Planning, organising and launching an Advent calendar takes a long time. Think about how many products are included in the major beauty retailers’ calendars. Then think about how much organisation it takes to coordinate with each brand on products to fit in each Advent calendar window. Add on to that marketing materials and imagery, and you’ve got a project that starts production almost as soon as the new year hits.Typically, brands release their calendars so early because it allows them to anticipate how much stock they need to order. As I’m writing this piece in August, many have already opened their waitlists, which helps them gauge how much interest there is in the calendar before it drops. When calendars go on sale in the autumn, it’s usually the case that when stock sells out, it’s gone for good.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who can’t quite believe she gets to spend her days reviewing beauty products.

Wear and enjoy them for as long as you can, then recycle them if possible.How to choose more eco-friendly fabricsDon’t buyMost sustainable fashion experts agree that it’s better to avoid human-made fibres that are petroleum-based, non-biodegradable and notoriously low-quality. “The worst offenders are virgin polyester and acrylic,” says Bianca Alleyne, founder ofSustainably Influenced. “Both shed microplastics and have a huge carbon footprint.”Do buyView image in fullscreenOrganic cotton is considered among the environmentally sound fabrics.Photograph: Tarzhanova/Getty Images/iStockphotoLook for natural fibres such as linen, organic cotton and wool, with recognised certifications such asGots(Global Organic Textile Standard). “I am a bit obsessed with working with cotton and how much you can do with it,” says Natalie Hasseck, creative director at the brandRise & Fall. “You can make it contemporary and almost architectural, or wispy, soft and gentle.”Alleyne is a fan of linen, among the least impactful fabrics to produce because it’s derived from flax, which requires no pesticides, minimal water, can grow in poor soil, and gets softer and more enjoyable to wear with age. It’s also worth keeping an eye out for branded semi-synthetic viscose fabrics such asTencelandEcoVero, which areless carbon and water intensive to producethan regular viscose. Meanwhile,Circuloseis made using 100% recycled cotton textile waste.What’s the beef with polyester?An estimated57% of all fibre produced globally is polyester. It’s cheap and mimics more premium fabrics. So what’s so bad about this ubiquitous fibre? “From a wearer’s perspective, polyester doesn’t breathe,” says Alleyne. “It traps heat and sweat, which can make clothes uncomfortable.”Polyester is created from oil, meaning it has a huge environmental impact, and it releases microplastics with every wash. “In order to extract it and transform it into fibre, it has to go through an extremely chemical-laden process, from spinning through to dyeing,” saysLeigh Morris, a sustainability and product development consultant who has worked in fashion and retail for more than 20 years and now educates on its environmental and social impact. “Polyester takes hundreds of years to decompose, all the while leaching toxins and chemicals into the soil.”How to spot red flags“If something has been marketed as a natural fibre, check the care label to see if it has been mixed with plastic synthetics (polyester, nylon, acrylic). This is a common tactic with high-street and fast-fashion brands in order to achieve ‘the look’ while reducing the cost price of the raw materials to max out their profit,” says Morris, who adds that mixing plastic fibres while marketing the natural element is a form of greenwashing. Meanwhile, Hasseck warns consumers to look out for anything that sounds too good to be true, such as “‘vegan leather’ that is actually polyurethane or ‘eco’ polyester. Brands bamboozle customers into thinking that ‘vegan leather’ means a step forward or a more sustainable choice, when in reality, it’s often just plastic by another name.

Luxury brands often use blends but label and price their products as though they are pure,” says Hasseck.Polyester is easy to blend. “This leaves the high street with a significant opportunity to maximise its profit by mixing it in with other more premium fibres, or completely swapping out [the premium fibres],” says Morris. “While this may sound like common sense from a business perspective, you’re actually being sold a subpar product, and the impact on the environment is huge.”Beware of knitwearView image in fullscreenWool-substitute synthetics eliminate all the benefits of the real thing.Photograph: Tetiana Kolubai/Getty Images/iStockphotoHave you noticed that knitwear isn’t always wool? Retailers substitute wool for synthetics as a cost-cutting exercise. “Brands will reason that this is done to make clothing prices as financially accessible as possible, but the real reason is profit maximisation – we see these switches even at £200-plus price points,” says Morris. “Wool is naturally breathable, body-temperature regulating and incredibly durable, with antibacterial and hypoallergenic properties, while also being biodegradable. Switching out to synthetics eliminates all of these benefits.” A good natural vegan alternative to wool is cotton knitwear.So where should you shop?Besides mid-priced brands such asRise & Fall, many others are using natural fibres to make quality clothing that lasts with a lower environmental and social impact. Alleyne recommendsNinety Percentfor quality basics.“To be budget conscious but still access great-quality natural fibres, try secondhand platforms likeVintedandeBayand preloved businesses likeGoldie Vintage,Nearly New CashmereandReloved Again,” says Morris. She also advocates for shopping at Patrick Grant’sCommunity Clothing, which focuses on keeping British clothing manufacturing alive, and circular brandRapanui, one of the few companies that accepts back its worn-out garments to be recycled into new clothes. Of course, we should all be buying less in general, so it makes sense to invest in fewer, better-quality pieces that will last, and that can be responsibly disposed of at the end of their lives.Hannah Rochell is a fashion features journalist who specialises in writing about – and experiencing – slow, comfortable style and living on her Substack,SlowetteExplore more on these topicsEthical and green livingThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for the adventurous, the menu may be about to get wilder. How about a spoonful of ant yoghurt?Making it does not involve milking any ants. Instead, the unfortunate insects are dropped into a jar of warm milk, which is tucked into an ant mound and left to ferment overnight. The fermenting tradition originating from Turkey and Bulgaria is now being resurrected in the name of science.Dr Veronica Sinotte and her colleagues at the University of Copenhagen became interested in the practice after being approached by research and development chefs at the city’s two-Michelin-starred restaurant the Alchemist in the hope of learning more about how this fermentation process worked.“Ants are a somewhat commonly used ingredient in high-end gastronomy in Copenhagen. They’re an ingredient chefs like to play with,” said Dr Leonie Jahn, a senior researcher at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Biosustainability in Lyngby, who supervised the project.“The [former] head of Alchemist’s R&D was very keen on science-driven food innovation and quite excited about the acidity of the ants. He wanted to explore that.”View image in fullscreenAdapting the methodology from Dr Veronica’s iScience paper, Linda Geddes experiments with ant yoghurt.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianBut was it the ants’ formic acid that turned the milk into yoghurt, or something else?To investigate, the researchers visited a village in southern Bulgaria, where a co-author of the research, Sevgi Sirakova, had family ties. Though the villagers no longer made ant yoghurt themselves, some remembered older generations’ methods and helped reconstruct a makeshift recipe: milk a cow, warm the milk until it “bites” your finger, add four red wood ants, cover with cheesecloth and bury the pot in an ant mound overnight. The mound provides warmth, and possibly additional microbes that fall in through the cheesecloth.The next day, Sinotte sampled the results: “It was at this early stage of a nice yoghurt – fermentation was dropping the acidity and there were some tiny flavours and herbaceous notes.”Back in the laboratory, the team ran further experiments under controlled conditions, using a related red wood ant found inDenmark. According to Sinotte, this yoghurt tasted a little different – it was thicker, with more lemony notes – perhaps because of differences in the quantity and composition of the ant starter culture.Their findings, which are published in the journaliScience, suggest the fermentation is a collaborative process between ant and microbe: the insects’ formic acid lowers the milk’s pH, enabling their acid-loving microbes to thrive, while ant or bacterial enzymes break down milk proteins to produce a yoghurt. Notably, only live ants had the correct microbial community.View image in fullscreenThe findings of the Danish research suggest the fermentation is a collaborative process between ant and microbe.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianAs a keen “fermentista”, I found the urge to try making my own ant yoghurt hard to resist. Sinotte and colleagues advise against this: some ants can carry a parasite, a type of liver fluke that is harmful to humans. Plus, red wood ant numbers are declining across wide parts of Europe, making large-scale harvesting of the insect unsustainable.I spent a good hour fretting over the ethics, but curiosity won out – helped by finding a supplier that funds red wood ant reintroductions. With a relative experienced in ant-keeping to care for my remaining colony, I also hoped to offset the loss of the four ants I planned to sacrifice.Adapting the methodology from Sinotte’s iScience paper, I sterilised a pestle and mortar, heated 30ml of milk to 42C, added four crushed ants, then strained the mixture through a microbiology-grade sieve to remove any parasites or ant fragments, before incubating it in my regular yoghurt maker overnight.The result was a gelatinous yoghurt, with a surprisingly creamy taste. I did not detect any lemony notes, just a mild bitterness. It was actually rather nice.Curiosity aside, such experiments could give rise to practical applications. The researchers believe microbes from ants could serve as a toolkit for creating new foods such as plant-based yoghurts, or introducing novel flavours to existing ones such as sourdough.Prof Martin Blaser, a human microbiome expert at Rutgers University in the US, said he was excited by the research. “One consequence of the worldwide popularity of yoghurt is that there are a few industrial strains [of bacteria] that dominate yoghurt making,” he said.“Nutritionally, my guess is that ant yoghurt is more or less equivalent to industrially produced yoghurt. But for the discerning, this kind of approach could possibly broaden our repertoire of foods, giving us interesting and unique tastes.”Ants are not the only unusual ingredient historically used to make yoghurt. In Turkey and other countries, people have traditionally used plant material such as pinecones, chamomile and linden flowers, or nettle roots to kickstart yoghurt fermentations. Investigating these approaches could impart further textures or flavours – with the added benefit of leaving ants unharmed.

Plums are such an underrated fruit, because they’re so versatile and delicious. For these buns, they get cooked down with lots of fresh ginger into a warming jam that is then rolled into a simple enriched dough. Eat warm for maximum pleasure.Plum and ginger bunsPrep15 minMacerate30 minProve1 hr 30 min+Cook1 hr 30 minMakes7For the plum jam450g ripe plums,stoned and cut into small chunks20g fresh ginger, washed, peeled and finely minced160g caster sugarFor the dough320g strong white bread flour,plus extra for dusting40g caster sugar1½ tsp dried instant yeast½ tsp fine sea salt100ml lukewarm whole milk50ml lukewarm water1 large egg, plus 1 extra egg for the egg wash40g softened butter100g icing sugarStart with the jam. Put the plums, ginger and sugar in a wide saucepan, give them a good stir and leave to macerate for 30 minutes. Put a saucer in the freezer – you’ll use this later to test the jam is done.Bring the plum mixture to a boil, turn down to a simmer and leave to cook for 15-18 minutes, until the fruit is well softened. To test the jam is done, spoon some of it on to the frozen saucer, leave for a couple of minutes, then push it with a fingertip – if the jam wrinkles, it’s ready; if it doesn’t, cook for a couple of minutes longer, then retest. Pour the jam into a shallow dish or baking tray to cool down.For the dough, put the flour, sugar, yeast and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, and mix briefly to combine. Make a well in the centre, pour in the milk, water, egg and softened butter, and knead on medium-low for seven to eight minutes, until smooth and a little tacky but not sticky. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover and prove in a warm place for an hour or two, until nearly doubled in size.Knock out the air, then turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface. Roll it in to a roughly 30cm x 45cm rectangle, with one short side facing you. Spread 120g of the plum jam evenly on top; it might not look like enough, but trust me: if you add too much, it makes the dough much harder to roll up, plus the jam will spill out while it bakes. Starting from one of the long sides, tightly roll up the dough, then trim the ends and and cut into seven rolls. I find the neatest way to do this is with dental floss: slide a piece underneath the log, lift up both ends, cross them at the top, then pull.Put the rolls on a large baking traylined with greaseproof paper, leaving a bit of space between them. Cover loosely with clingfilm and prove again for 30-40 minutes, until puffy. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5.Brush the buns lightly with egg wash, then bake for 18-22 minutes, until lightly browned. While the buns cool, mix the icing sugar and a tablespoon of water to a smooth, thick paste. Drizzle over the warm buns before serving.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotAutumn food and drinkFoodBakingDessertSnacksFruitrecipesShareReuse this content"

Givenchy, the spiritual home of Audrey Hepburn and the little black dress, has an immaculate bloodline of glamour that runs from Paris to Hollywood, but it is a relative minnow as a business. Her recent predecessors had mostly leaned into streetwear and utility-coded metallic accents, but Burton is bringing back the glamour.View image in fullscreenThe Chinese actor Zhang Ruonan attends the Givenchy show in Paris.Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty“I wanted it to be erotic and sensual and to show skin,” Burton said backstage. “When we want to empower women we often reach for masculine codes, but I wanted to look at female emotional intelligence, and dressing and undressing.”There was covered-up allure, too, in an evening shirt in butter soft white leather. “Every woman is different,” Burton said. “Sometimes when I’m casting, a model puts on an outfit and I can just tell that she doesn’t want to wear a heel. So I change the look.”‘Dior is drama’: Jonathan Anderson goes for the jugular at Paris fashion weekRead moreGivenchy is re-establishing itself in red carpet dressing. Burton has dressed Timothée Chalamet in a butter yellow tuxedo at the Oscars, and Kaia Gerber in a vintage-feel ballerina gown of black lace at the Venice film festival.Schiaparelli, fashion’s house of surrealism, has been resurgent under the American designer Daniel Roseberry. Next year, the V&A will host the first major British Schiaparelli exhibition, looking at the work of Elsa Schiaparelli and the house she founded.Women who wear Schiaparelli don’t need an exhibition to tell them that these clothes are art. “You don’t buy Schiaparelli, you collect Schiaparelli,” Roseberry said backstage.View image in fullscreenFKA Twigs at the Schiaparelli womenswear spring/summer 2026 show at the Pompidou in Paris.Photograph: Cyril Pecquenard/Sipa/ShutterstockArt-adjacency is good for the bottom line – clothes come with gallery prices, with jackets starting at about £5,000. And revenue, as well as profile, is on the up. The venue for the show was the Pompidou Centre inParis, another reminder of how close this house sits with art.Roseberry revisited one of Elsa’s most famous collaborations with Salvador Dalí, the 1938“Tears” dresswhich will be in the V&A show. “This was about going back to the roots of the house,” he said.The “rips” in the original were painted on, but for the updated version Roseberry tore into the silk crepe itself. In both, the tears are chillingly evocative of flayed flesh.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Buttons in the form of fingernails and gold noses dangling as earrings are the visual grammar of the brand. The punchline of this show: faux fur made from paintbrushes.Surrealism pops up all over current fashion. Cracked-egg heels – walking on eggshells, geddit? – were a sellout at Loewe. Dali-esque wonky clocks have walked the catwalk at Moschino. But Schiaparelli owns this territory, and Roseberry presides over it.Schiaparelli clothes have “an extreme drama which sucks the air out of the room”, he said. A red gown was sliced with a triangular panel of flesh-toned mesh that sat roughly where a pair of knickers should, in a head-swivelling illusion of nakedness. The tension between wearability and theatre is all part of the show.View image in fullscreenA cocktail dress masquerading as a just-out-of-the-shower towel wrap at Loewe.Photograph: ShutterstockA merry-go-round of designer debuts has brought two darlings of New York to Paris. Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez have left behind the Proenza Schouler brand they founded in 2002 to helm Loewe, the Spanish leather house that grew into a $1.5bn (£1.1bn) alpha name under the tenure of Jonathan Anderson before his departure to Dior.The Americans looked delighted to be in Paris.Ellsworth Kellybrights brought a joyful pop art sensibility to the in-the-know art smarts for which Loewe now stands. Banana yellow loafers shook their tassels like Josephine Baker’s skirt; a red peplum jacket had the proud shiny curves of a ketchup bottle. And a cocktail dress masquerading as a just-out-of-the-shower towel wrap, fluffy as a freshly laundered bath sheet, captured the sweet spot where clever design meets fashion fun.Explore more on these topicsParis fashion weekGivenchySarah BurtonFashion weeksParisFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The city’s old town is on a hill, with every other building in the three main squares and the sidestreets seemingly a historic monument, dominated by the medieval Lutheran cathedral of Saint Mary. The characteristic design of attic windows makes it clear why Sibiu is called “the town of a thousand eyes”, and theTeutsch Hausprovides a brilliant history of the region and the Transylvanian Saxons. The old town is crammed full of restaurants and cafes, and down by the river there is a local market with giant aubergines, tomatoes and peppers. For an evening glass,Wine Nothas a vast selection of Romanian (and Moldovan) wines, and a black cat to talk to.Barbara ForbesWrocław, Poland’s buzzy student cityView image in fullscreenA view across the River Oder in Wrocław.Photograph: Ingolf Pompe 19/AlamyWrocław has the perfect mix of quirkiness and beauty to make for a cracking affordable city break. The hefty student population gives the city a real buzz, from the boat and beach bars along the River Oder (tryForma Płynnabeach bar), to the delicious Georgian bakeries (stop atPiekarnia Gruzińska PURI– on Facebook – for pastries on the way to checking out the painted backyards of the Nadodrze neighbourhood). While tourists concentrate around the huge central square, exploring the edge of the old town reaps rewards, likePub Drukarnia(delicious Litovel Czech beer) or Stacja Breslau bistro under the rail arches on Wojciecha Bogusławskiego street.Matt LuntProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Instead, Helsinki features green spaces, coastal views, accessible islands and world-class architecture. It’s the latter we came for: from a church built into rock to state-of-the-art community spaceOodi library; from the mid-centuryDidrichsen museumto architect Alvar Aalto’s organic modernism.

Warm weather, beaches, extraordinary street art, sea kayaking and amazing walking in the Calanques satisfied teenagers and parents alike. My favourites were theMucem(Musée des Civilisations de l’Europe et de la Méditerranée), the winding streets ofLe Panierand the sense of the place being a melting pot of cultures. We found the locals to be friendly as they encouraged our attempts to speak French, and there\\s a good transport system of trams, metro and buses. We got there easily on Eurostar and TGV train and stayed at theAparthotel Adagio.EvieBerlin’s hidden design gemsView image in fullscreenThe Ludwig Erhard Haus building designed by Nicolas Grimshaw.Photograph: Imago/AlamyAlthough I’ve been travelling to Berlin for nearly 20 years, I’m still making new discoveries. The headlines, like the Brandenburg Gate and the glass dome on the Reichstag, are definitely worth seeing, but there are also hidden treasures, such as the futuristicLudwig Erhard Haus, designed by Nicolas Grimshaw, whose steel-clad exterior is just the aperitif for some jaw-dropping architecture inside. Or the ruins ofSt Michael’s church, which was separated from its parishioners by the Berlin Wall. And try to bag a place on the tour of theESMT business schoolthat once housed East Germany’s elite. The socialist stained glass and GDR coat of arms mosaic are real showstoppers.James CarsonA dumpling and a beer in Vilnius, LithuaniaView image in fullscreenAerial view of the Three Crosses monument overlooking Vilnius old town.Photograph: Eloi Omella/Getty ImagesWe’ve just spent three nights in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius whose old town is easily walkable with plenty of churches, museums and other sights. We indulged in local specialities likekvass, a drink made from fermented rye bread, andcepelinai, which are potato dumplings shaped like airships and filled with minced pork. A half litre of beer (about €5) was ideal with moreishkepta duona, fingers of deep-fried black bread served with a garlic dip. A walk up hundreds of steps to the Three Crosses for views over the city burned excess calories.

Compact, largely flat (handy for an arthritic retiree) and utterly delightful. As a university town, we enjoyed the friendly, lively vibe but this did not distract from its charm and its history. The cloth market on Wednesdays and the bric-a-brac market at the weekend in the main square are amazing (we bought a milk churn!), the frites at the surrounding cafes were great and the beer was varied and delicious.Boekhandel Dominicanen(a bookshop in a converted middle-ages abbey) was certainly a highlight.Bruce HortonBeer spa in Olomouc, Czech RepublicView image in fullscreenOlomouc’s holy trinity column was built to mark the end of a plague in the early 18th century.Photograph: Adrian Wojcik/Getty ImagesOlomouc in the Czech Republic is an utter delight. Gleaming spires and domes, two old town squares, enchanting cobbled lanes, trams and its own astronomical clock. It also has a Unesco-recognised holy trinity column, which was built to mark the end of a plague in the early 18th century. A two-hour train ride from Prague, Olomouc is markedly less touristy than the Czech capital. Two great places to enjoy a beer wereSaint Venceslav’s brewery, where there is a beer spa with a sauna scented with hops; andTwinburg, next to the Moravian cycle path, which serves delicious craft ales. This is a city I felt had been put on Earth specially for me.Jack AndertonPolar nights in Tromsø, Norway’s ‘Arctic capital’View image in fullscreenA view of Tromsø from the Fjellheisen cable car.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyAs a Scot who once sought drawn-out summer nights, I now lean into the opposite with fervour. Winter in Tromsø, Norway – the “Arctic capital” – is for travellers who embrace the long, dark nights and are keen to meddle with their circadian rhythms. The polar night, when the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon, starts at the end of November and finishes in mid-January. Experience this unworldly extended twilight – the blue hour – from about 9am to 2pm. TheFjellheisencable car and silent whale-watching withBrim Explorerare two recommended activities.Aimee LawrenceWinning tip: blessed are the cheese markets in Alkmaar, the NetherlandsView image in fullscreenThe Molen van Piet windmill in the heart of Alkmaar, on the Singelgracht canal.Photograph: Pidjoe/Getty ImagesI recently visited Alkmaar, 35 minutes north of Amsterdam by train, which has waterways, picturesque pedestrian-friendly cobbled streets, chiming churches, excellent food (De Heeren Van Sonoy,Stadskaffee LaurensandPatisserie Elhorstinclude gluten-free options), and markets (don’t miss the cheese market for a true Dutch spectacle).

I don’t have children myself, so I don’t know – do schools still celebrate harvest festival?Traditionally scheduled to coincide with the annual appearance of the harvest moon – which is the full moon closest to the autumn equinox – harvest festival was a celebration of the busiest time in the growing season coming to a close. At this point in the year, when the wheat had been harvested and the fields were being cleared, rural communities would gather to give thanks for the food that would sustain them through the leaner months.Corn dollies – or harvest tokens or trophies as they’re otherwise known – are small figures traditionally woven from the last sheaf to be gathered. Dating back many hundreds – if not thousands – of years, these pagan creations were thought to embody the spirit of the corn, the spirit of the harvest. They were made in the hope they would carry the season’s fertility through the winter and then, having been ploughed back into the field come spring, coax another productive season into unfolding. Different regions have different traditions and different designs for their corn dollies.Perhaps there's a ritual that's calling to you as a way of marking the end of the season. There's still a few days left to plan your own harvest festivalI share this because I believe our land-working forebears were doing something essential when they made the effort to mark the point before autumn begins to shift towards winter. In taking the time to reflect on a busy growing season and give thanks for all it has yielded, we too can note how the shifting climate is affecting our plants, while acknowledging our good fortune – and learning from all that didn’t go so well. And, most importantly perhaps, it is a time to offer deep gratitude for the abundance that lots of us take for granted when too many around the world go without – especially as that abundance is often the result of the labour of workers whose names we’ll never know.Before the shortening days and colder nights, and the clearing of crops and mulching of beds pull you into more doing, perhaps there’s a ritual that’s calling to you as a way of marking the end of the season. With this year’s harvest moon set to rise on 7 October, there’s still a few days left to plan your own harvest festival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Hegseth gave few details about the boat or the evidence that it was carrying narcotics, other than saying the US had confirmed it was carrying drugs.“The strike was conducted in international waters just off the coast ofVenezuelawhile the vessel was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics – headed to America to poison our people,” Hegseth said on X.Trump officials push claim that US in ‘armed conflict’ with drug cartelsRead more“Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route,” Hegseth said.The latest attack on a boat comes as theTrump administrationprovided a notification on the issue to Congress in the form of a memo that attempted to legally justify the increasingly expansive use of military force against alleged Venezuelan drug boats.The notification was provided by senior Pentagon officials as part of an attempt to explain the Trump administration’s legal arguments for the strikes. It also included a classified briefing to members of the Senate armed services committee that took place on Wednesday.Hegseth’s post claimed the boat was “affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations”, a term the administration introduced for the first time in a confidential memo sent to Congress that attempted to legally justify the strikes. The Guardian reviewed a copy of the memo.Until this week, the administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTO. Legal experts suggested that simply characterizing drugs cartels as an FTO did not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force.White House officials have sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article II powers, which allows the president to use military force in self-defense in limited engagements.The self-defense argument revolves around Trump’s designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.The administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro – and so the presence of the cartel’s members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.The strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats have largely been overseen by Miller and Tony Salisbury, his top lieutenant at the White House homeland security council (HSC),the Guardian has previously reported.Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Donald Trump’s second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.That was the case, for instance, with the second Venezuelan boat hit with hellfire missiles on 15 September. While the White House was informed the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.The previous strikes trikes on three boats in theCaribbeanhave killed 17 people and triggered widespread international outrage.

Though he has a work permit and two of his children are American citizens, he has operated under the “administrative closure” of deportation orders for much of that time.Immigration officials put him on a plane at 4am on Friday morning, family members said.Immigration officials reopened the deportation case after his arrest on petty charges that were almost immediately dismissed while livestreaming“No Kings Day” protestsin June. His imprisonment is among the longest for any reporter arrested in connection with their work as a journalist in United States history.“This is the latest in a series of measures from this administration that really cut at the core of media freedoms,” said Katherine Jacobsen, the US, Canada and Caribbean program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).His arrest and deportation is more than an immigration issue, she said, given the extraordinary legal processes used byTrump administrationofficials to maintain his detention and force his deportation. “In reality, when we look at the whole picture and everything … it really is a threat to journalists and rights in this country.”Guevara’s defenders at CPJ, PEN America, Reporters Without Borders, the ACLU and the media and democracy group Free Press filed a brief on Wednesday with a federal appeals court, arguing that Guevara’s detention creates a “widespread and profound” chilling effect against free speech and journalistic practices, especially filming law enforcement activity.US appeals court orders deportation of Atlanta journalist detained by IceRead moreKatherine Guevara, Mario’s daughter, said he had been nervously awaiting the final word for days, keeping in touch with regular phone calls to his family and attorneys. The ordeal has been challenging for her and her siblings, one of which requires special care after an accident. Mario Guevara has never been apart from his family for long, she said.“I mean, I’m surviving, but it’s been a really difficult time,” she said. “You’re just expected to continue your life and come to work and follow your routine.”The arrest has affected the family’s financial resources. While Guevara has a popular Facebook page – more than 1 million people were watching his livestream of protests at the moment of his arrest – some sponsorships have been paused while he has been imprisoned. Guevara has penned missives from inside the immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, dictating his observations over the phone from inside a jail cell. But it does not substitute for the roving reporting on immigration enforcement that drew an audience of millions.“Throughout the course of Guevara’s time in custody, the government put forward arguments saying that he was being held because his livestreaming activity as a reporter posed a danger to law enforcement activity,” Jacobsen said. “These are the kind of kind of tactics that we see frequently in in other countries overseas, and I think it’s time for Americans to realize that these kind of bureaucratic methods of going after journalists and civil society actors are being used here.”CPJ is tracking other legal cases involving journalists, such as the misdemeanorconvictionyesterday of a student journalist in Kentucky who had been charged with failing to disperse while covering a protest. Charges like this have historically been unusual, given the necessity for reporters to be physically present while covering demonstrations.“This is not something that we usually see in this country. Other journalists in Chicago and Los Angeles have been assaulted by law enforcement while covering protests or being in immigration court. This is not normal and should be of great concern.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationAtlantaEl SalvadorIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One man was killed and two others were injured.While police have not confirmed the victim’s name, multiple Canadian media outlets have said the man killed was the convicted drug trafficker Charalambos Theologou, 40, also known as “Bobby the Greek”. Theologou was the leader of a gang called the Chomedey Greeks.Ian Lafrenière, Quebec’s public security minister, said: “Everything points to it being an act linked to organised crime.”Laval’s police chief, Pierre Brochet, told reporters Wednesday that while he could not comment on the investigation, he knows the man killed due to his “reputation”. “He is connected to organised crime,” he said.Surveillance footageobtained by Radio-Canadashows two men entering the Starbucks and then exiting quickly after the shooting.Theologou was first connected officially to criminal activity in 2005 when police in Montreal arrested him and six others in a drug trafficking investigation, according to the Montreal newspaper the Gazette. He ended up pleading guilty on drug-related charges and was sentenced to two years in prison.According to the Gazette, Theologou was arrested for a second time in 2009, again for drug trafficking, and was subsequently sentenced to another five years in prison.Valentin Pereda, an assistant professor at the the University of Montreal’s criminology school, said that organised crime in the area used to be characterised around exercising restraint over public violence and relied on a clear hierarchical structure.An audacious daylight murder at a coffee shop chain indicates there may not be a major player keeping order – as violence could affect business when it comes to drug trafficking, said Pereda.He said it was possible that the group which targeted Theologou simply “did not care” about the public display of violence in order to kill the gang leader.But Pereda said he believes more likely is there has been a loss of structure and control within organised crime in Montreal, related to major arrests of the alleged heads of Montreal’s mafia made in June.After a three-year investigation, police took into custody the alleged mafia leader Leonardo Rizzuto and charged him with first-degree murder and other related offences. Rizzuto is the son of the late mafia boss Vito Rizzuto, the CBC reported at the time.Vito Rizzuto, whom the Globe and Mail referred to in 2008 as the “top mafia boss in Canada”, was imprisoned in the US from 2007 to 2012 after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and racketeering related to killings that had occurred in New York City in the early 1980s. He died in 2013.The Rizzuto crime family has long been notorious – and the arrest of Rizzuto was considered the final “nail in the coffin” for the Montreal mafia, said Pereda.It has left a hole that younger street gangs are looking to fill. Wednesday’s shooting was an indication of an unstable, fluid situation, Pereda said. “There is kind of this plethora of small, not super well-organised gangs … that are vying for control,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaOrganised crimeAmericasMafianewsShareReuse this content"

It has justified the military action as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US. But some lawmakers and human rights groups have questioned the legality of the attacks.The notice to Congress represents an aggressive escalation in the US government’s attempts to stop the flow of narcotics. The US government’s drug war in recent years has increasingly focused on political targets, and this latest escalation may be seen as an attempt by the administration to further place pressure on the Venezuelan government.On Thursday, Venezuelan officials said they discovered five US fighter jets flying about 46 miles (74km) from its Caribbean coast, CNN reported, citing the country’s government and defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López.Earlier this year, the Trump administration determined several criminal groups to be “terrorist” organizations. The designation by the administrationincludeda number of Mexican cartels, the MS-13 gang, the Venezuelan gangTren de Araguaand the Venezuelan so-called Cartel de los Soles.For years, the US government has accused the Venezuelan government of Nicolás Maduro of being involved in drug trafficking. The Trump administration earlier this year accused Maduro of directing the activities of Tren de Aragua, and used it as a justification to expel hundreds of immigrants to a notorious Salvadorian prison under the Alien Enemies Act.Stephen Miller takes leading role in strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boatsRead moreIntelligenceassessmentshave determined there is little proof of Maduro’s links to Tren de Aragua.Maduro and members of his cabinet and military also stand accused by the US of running the Cártel de los Soles and seeking to traffic cocaine to the US. The infrastructure of the cartel has been disputed, with drug trafficking analysts and experts saying that the Cartel de los Soles is aloose networkof lower-ranking military officials without a strict hierarchical structure.Earlier this year, the US governmentraisedits bounty for Maduro to $50m. There is an active indictment in a Manhattan federal court related to the Cartel de los Soles case. A co-defendant and former top Venezuelan military intelligence chiefpleaded guiltyearlier this year to narco-terrorism crimes.The three vessels that were targeted by the US in recent weeks were traversing through the Caribbean. Trump administration officials, without proof, have said the vessels were carrying members of Tren de Aragua with drugs destined for the US.The administration has been adamant in escalating its fight against fentanyl trafficking into the US. However, fentanyl typically arrives across the southern US border from Mexico.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasCaribbeanUS politicsDrugsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A video on social mediashows Shaw, wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, shouting for help as the swarm of officers move to apprehend him.The 35-year-old from Dallas, Texas, is facing the possibility of the death penalty or a long spell behind bars. He was a key member of Prawira Bandung, who won the Indonesian Basketball League (IBL) in 2023, and hehas scoredmore than 1,000 points over three seasons in the country. But now he is languishing in pre-trial detention and is banned for life from the IBL.“I use cannabis as a medicine,” he told the Guardian over the phone from a prison just outside Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, in his first comments to the press since his May arrest. “I havean inflammatory condition called Crohn’s disease that’s incurable. There’s no medicine apart from cannabis that stops my stomach from aching.”During the off-season Shaw lives in Thailand, where cannabis is subject tomore liberal laws. He says he had endured the pain of going without cannabis in previous campaigns in Indonesia but says that health reasons spurred him to import the intercepted supply of 132 gummies this year. “I made a stupid mistake,” he says.But that mistake should not warrant the death penalty or a long spell in prison, he says. “There’s people telling me I’m about to spend the rest of my life in prison over some edibles,” he says. “I’ve never been through anything like this.” In the first two months after his arrest, he was at “the lowest point in [my] life” and in a “really dark mental place”.“I felt helpless and alone,” he says. “I didn’t want to wake up again.” But through prayer and his faith, as well as access to a prison gym, he is starting to feel himself again, even while the 6ft 11in athlete shares a cramped cell with a dozen men. “I just turned 35 but I still feel young,” says the former Utah State basketballer, who has played in Argentina, Japan, Turkey, Thailand and Tunisia. “I would love to continue my basketball career.”Shaw, who plays as a center or power forward, says cannabis helps ease his anxiety and depression, as well as insomnia and the pain from Crohn’s. “I don’t use it to have fun and go party,” he says. “With my stomach condition, sometimes it’s hard for me to keep food down or go to the toilet. It just soothes the pain a little bit.”Indonesia takes a hard line on drugs and carried out executions in 2016,by firing squad, of an Indonesian and three foreigners convicted of drug offenses. More than 500 people – including almost 100 foreigners – are on death row in the country, mostly for drug-related crimes.Indonesian police have said that Shaw sent text messages to his teammates saying that he would share some of the cannabis candies with them. “What they consider drugs, I consider medicine,” says Shaw. “It’s just different cultures.”After Shaw’s arrest, Ronald Sipayung, the Soekarno-Hatta Airport police chief, told reporters that the American could face life in prison or even the death penalty if found guilty. “We are still running the investigation to uncover the international drugs network behind this case and to stop its distribution,” Sipayung said.Shawwas swiftly paradedat a press conference, appearing with his hands cuffed wearing an orange prison-issue T-shirt and a black face mask. He stood with his back to the audience as police chiefs exhibited the cannabis gummies, which weigh 869 grams in total and are worth $400.He said that to charge him with possession of almost a kilo of cannabis is unjust and “sick”, given that most of the weight is made up by the gummies themselves rather than the cannabis content. “I’ve been charged for almost a kilo,” he says. “I didn’t have anything near that.”Shawis fundraisingto cover his rising legal fees. He has not yet appeared in court despite being arrested five months ago, and he is still waiting for a first appearance date. “They’re making it seem like I’m this big drug dealer,” he says. “Why would I bring the candy here to sell? It was for personal use.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Around the world, people are serving extreme sentences for non-violent cannabis offenses that pose no threat to public safety.” Even in the US, she added, tens of thousandsremain incarceratedfor cannabis offences despite recreational legalization in almost half of states and a medical greenlight in all but two. “These punishments run counter to international human rights standards,” Shepard said.The potential efficacy of cannabis on Crohn’s disease is understudied but in September the journal Nature Medicinepublished a paperon a study which found that cannabis can ease chronic lower back pain without serious side effects. It came as Donald Trumptalked upthe benefits of cannabis-based medicines.There are parallels between Shaw’s case and that of Brittney Griner, the decorated American basketball player who was imprisoned in Russia for 10 months in 2022 after authorities found cannabis vape cartridges in her luggage.Griner was eventually releasedas part of a prisoner swap involving a Russian weapons trafficker.“Jarred has always been one of the most generous and selfless people you could meet,” his friend, Bree Petruzio, said on Shaw’s fundraising page. “Jarred made a mistake. But I don’t believe that mistake should cost him his entire future.”The US embassy in Jakarta says it is aware of Shaw’s case but would not comment further.Donte West, an advocacy assistant at LPP who is handling Shaw’s case, said: “Cannabis can’t kill you, but possessing it can. We must get as much attention on this case in the hope that a positive resolution will set a powerful precedent. I’m dedicated to making sure Jarred gets home to his mother.”The Indonesian National Police did not respond to a request for comment for this story.Explore more on these topicsBasketballUS sportsCollege sportsIndonesiaAsia PacificDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has influenced me profoundly,” wrote a Weibo user.Xi Zhilong, the founder of Wild China Film, a conservation-focused production organisation, said Goodall had become “a guiding light, leading us forward”.“The green seeds she has sown across the world will bring hope to this beautiful yet fragile planet.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsJane GoodallChinaPrimatologyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Production is not directly affected [by the system dysfunction] but it has been halted because shipments are suspended.”Super Dry is a staple of Japan’sdrinking culture, with 73m cases sold last year, amid a decline in domestic beer consumption and intense competition between Asahi, Kirin, Sapporo and Suntory to launch new products aimed at younger drinkers.The news is a particular concern for Japan’s convenience stores. A spokesperson for Seven + I Holdings, which operates 7-11, said it would put up notices informing customers of the suspension in shipments, but added that the incident “had not yet caused major disruptions”.“We don’t expect [Asahi drinks] to disappear from all our stores at once, although it all depends on how sales will go at each of these outlets.”The hackers disabled Asahi’s ordering and delivery system, forcing the firm to postpone indefinitely the release later this month of a dozen new products, including soda and protein bars, media reports said.The company, which has reported the incident to the Tokyo metropolitan police departments, said no customer data had been compromised in the attack. Its overseas operations have not been affected.The disruption means Asahi is unable to process or deliver orders of food and drink, while its customer service desks have been suspended, the Kyodo news agency said. It is no longer able to receive emails from outside the company, forcing employees to take order over the phone and process them manually, Kyodo added.The Guardian has contacted the Asahi group for comment.Explore more on these topicsJapanBeerAsia PacificHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the policy, users aged 14 and over will need a SevisPass digital ID before they can log in to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and X.The government said the changes were needed to stop online abuse, fake news and scams.Social mediacompanies will also have to register in PNG and follow local laws, and a new national e-Safety Directorate will be set up to monitor harmful content.“We are in early discussions with Meta on enforcing age verification as a start,” PNG’s information and communications technology department secretary, Steven Matainaho, told the Guardian.Officials declined to comment further. A government source told the Guardian the cabinet had approved the social media policy and that it would be tabled in parliament when it sits next month.Meta did not respond to a request for comment.PNG to provide troops to Australia under first new alliance since AnzusRead moreThe proposed restrictions come as PNG’s southern neighbour, Australia, prepares to roll out its long-anticipatedunder-16s social media ban. Governments and tech firms are closely watching Australia’s efforts, which will likely rely on artificial intelligence and behavioural data to estimate the age of users, and not conduct blanket age-verification.Attempts to regulate online content and platforms has driven public concern in PNG about access to information and fears of censorship.“On paper it sounds like protection, but in reality it could silence people who rely on Facebook or TikTok to speak out,” Jonathan Makil, a political science student at the University of Papua New Guinea, said.Emmanuel Tipi, a comedian known as KabbageGang on Facebook, said the platform was “one of the most powerful tools for ordinary Papua New Guineans to share information, express themselves, and access news beyond traditional media.“If the government introduces heavy-handed regulations such as ID registration, it risks silencing voices, especially those who rely on humour and creativity to educate and engage,” Tipi said. “People may feel less free to interact, comment, or share because of fear of surveillance.”In March, the government prompted outrage when it temporarily shut down Facebook as a “test” to assess its capabilities to regulate online content. It did so under new anti-terrorism laws that gave the government powers to monitor and restrict online communication.Facebook is the most widely used social media platform in the Pacific nation of around 11 million people. It is most popular with 18–34 year-olds and commonly used for political discussions and activism, though the country also struggles with the spread of misinformation and violent content.The shutdown prompted widespread anger from users across PNG. The government said its actions were designed to protect young people from harmful content.Small business owner Sylvia Pascoe, who relies on Facebook to run her events management company, said the shutdown “disrupted everyone, yet no one has explained what it achieved or why it mattered. That only deepens the distrust.“Social media isn’t just for fun for most people; for many people, this is their shopfront and their only source of revenue for feeding their families,” Pascoe said. “The more they make life harder for ordinary people just trying to survive, the more that trust breaks down.”Technology expert and activist Yuambari Haihuie has spent over a decade advocating for good governance with Transparency International Papua New Guinea. He said the attempts by authorities to “silence discussion” on platforms, such as the Facebook shutdown, should not be the way to make social media safer.Haihuie said online media can be made safer “through education to promote safe conduct and media literacy in schools and on the platform itself.“We haven’t developed the same instinct for our digital freedoms on social media, which is the modern public space … this thinking needs to change,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPapua New GuineaPacific islandsSocial mediaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He wrote to supporters just as a statement announcing his resignation was released, saying he would speak his mind from the backbench.Ley said she expected solidarity from shadow ministers in public commentary and on parliamentary votes and that Hastie had indicated he would be unable to provide such a guarantee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are the wives, widows and children of slain or jailedIslamic Statefighters.About 34 Australians – 14 women and 20 children – have been held in the Roj camp near the Turkish border, most since 2019. Some of the children were born in the camp, and know no life outside it. A smaller number of Australians are understood to have been held in the al-Hawl detention camp nearer to Iraq.None of those in the camps has, at this point, been charged with a crime or faces a warrant for arrest.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSources with knowledge of the six Australians’ passage home say the informal and ad hoc escape to Beirut endangered the children and that the women had been arrested in Lebanon when trying to cross the border. Those sources argue that government sponsored and controlled repatriations are far safer, allowing for support services to be put in place for those returning, and for security services in Australia to be prepared for the returns.Australia should repatriate and investigate alleged crimes of Islamic state member found in Syria, experts sayRead moreAdvocates have consistently argued that Australian citizens held in the camps have a right to return to Australia, and that organised repatriations are better for all involved: leaving women and children to make their own way through an unstable Syria is dangerous for those travelling and leaves government services less prepared for their arrival in Australia.Conditions in the Syrian camps are dire, with widespread hunger, disease and outbreaks of violence. A recentUS state department reportdescribed a “volatile security” situation and a “health emergency”.“Unicef reports services within the displaced persons camps are limited and overstretched and shelters inadequate, with flooding and fires making life dangerous. Save the Children reports displaced youth experience complex, severe trauma and mental health problems and that psychological treatment is inadequate. Many children in the camp have no family, making them particularly vulnerable to Isis radicalisation and recruitment.”Human Rights Watch describes conditions in the camps as “life-threatening”. Al-Hawl camp,holding 30,000 people– more than half of them children – is regarded as particularlychaotic and violent.For years, the federal government has been under increasing pressure from families, lawyers, and advocacy groups to repatriate its citizens. The government has undertaken two limited repatriations: in 2019, eight orphaned children, including a pregnant teenager, were repatriated to NSW, and in October 2022, four women and 13 children were brought back, also to New South Wales.A federal court challenge from Save the Children to compel the government to return its citizens failed, with the court finding there was no legal obligation on the government.But the full bench of the court did find: “if the commonwealth has the political will to bring the … women and children back to Australia, on the evidence before the court, it would be a relatively straightforward exercise”.The chief executive of Save the Children Australia, Mat Tinkler said the reported return of the women and children would be “welcome news for their families and shows that there are no real obstacles stopping the federal government from repatriating those still trapped in Roj camp, there is only a lack of political will getting in the way”.He said previous government-run repatriations demonstrated they could be undertaken “safely and successfully”.“Every child deserves a life free of violence and fear. As conditions in the camps worsen and the region grows more unstable, we hold serious concerns for the wellbeing of the innocent children who remain there,” Tinkler said.The US, which funds the bulk of security operations across north-east Syria, through the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, wants countries like Australia to take their citizens back, and is even offering to help repatriate third-country nationals.Areport to Congressfrom the state department, argued: “the only durable solution to the acute humanitarian and security challenges in the detention facilities and DP camps is repatriation. That is why the United States encourages all countries to repatriate their nationals from north-east Syria, and why the United States assists in such repatriations on a case-by-case basis.”This year, the US has publicly announced it has assisted other countries, such asTanzaniaandAustria, in repatriating their citizens. The US haspreviously offered to assist Australiain repatriating its citizens from the detention camp, but state department officials have refused to comment on whether there is a standing offer to help Australia.An Australian government spokesperson said Syria was becoming “increasingly unstable”.“The Australian government is not providing assistance and is not repatriating individuals in Syrian displaced persons camps.“If any of those people find their own way to return, our security agencies are satisfied that they are prepared and will be able to act in the interests of community safety.”The spokesperson said the Australian agencies had “been monitoring these individuals for some time”.“We have confidence in our agencies.“Our travel advice continues to advise Australians do not travel to Syria due to the dangerous security situation and threat of armed conflict, airstrikes, terrorism, arbitrary detention and kidnapping – as it has been since these Australians travelled there.”One woman who was returned in the second repatriation, Mariam Raad, faced charges of entering Syria’s al-Raqqa province while it was under the control of the Islamic State. She pleaded guilty, and wasdischarged conditionally, without a conviction.The NSW deputy police commissioner, David Hudson, told a parliamentary estimates hearing in September that NSW police was “still working through the issue” of government-sponsored repatriations with the federal government.“Idon’t think the repatriation is imminent,” Hudson said.A Victoria Police spokesperson said police were aware Australian citizens in Syrian camps may look to return home.“Where required, Victoria Police works closely with state and federal agencies to facilitate the re-integration of women and children who return to Victoria from camps in Syria.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyIslamic StateAustralian politicsSyriaVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

Givenchy, the spiritual home of Audrey Hepburn and the little black dress, has an immaculate bloodline of glamour that runs from Paris to Hollywood, but it is a relative minnow as a business. Her recent predecessors had mostly leaned into streetwear and utility-coded metallic accents, but Burton is bringing back the glamour.View image in fullscreenThe Chinese actor Zhang Ruonan attends the Givenchy show in Paris.Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty“I wanted it to be erotic and sensual and to show skin,” Burton said backstage. “When we want to empower women we often reach for masculine codes, but I wanted to look at female emotional intelligence, and dressing and undressing.”There was covered-up allure, too, in an evening shirt in butter soft white leather. “Every woman is different,” Burton said. “Sometimes when I’m casting, a model puts on an outfit and I can just tell that she doesn’t want to wear a heel. So I change the look.”‘Dior is drama’: Jonathan Anderson goes for the jugular at Paris fashion weekRead moreGivenchy is re-establishing itself in red carpet dressing.

Next year, the V&A will host the first major British Schiaparelli exhibition, looking at the work of Elsa Schiaparelli and the house she founded.Women who wear Schiaparelli don’t need an exhibition to tell them that these clothes are art. “You don’t buy Schiaparelli, you collect Schiaparelli,” Roseberry said backstage.View image in fullscreenFKA Twigs at the Schiaparelli womenswear spring/summer 2026 show at the Pompidou in Paris.Photograph: Cyril Pecquenard/Sipa/ShutterstockArt-adjacency is good for the bottom line – clothes come with gallery prices, with jackets starting at about £5,000. And revenue, as well as profile, is on the up. The venue for the show was the Pompidou Centre inParis, another reminder of how close this house sits with art.Roseberry revisited one of Elsa’s most famous collaborations with Salvador Dalí, the 1938“Tears” dresswhich will be in the V&A show. “This was about going back to the roots of the house,” he said.The “rips” in the original were painted on, but for the updated version Roseberry tore into the silk crepe itself.

Buttons in the form of fingernails and gold noses dangling as earrings are the visual grammar of the brand. The punchline of this show: faux fur made from paintbrushes.Surrealism pops up all over current fashion. Cracked-egg heels – walking on eggshells, geddit? – were a sellout at Loewe. Dali-esque wonky clocks have walked the catwalk at Moschino. But Schiaparelli owns this territory, and Roseberry presides over it.Schiaparelli clothes have “an extreme drama which sucks the air out of the room”, he said. A red gown was sliced with a triangular panel of flesh-toned mesh that sat roughly where a pair of knickers should, in a head-swivelling illusion of nakedness. The tension between wearability and theatre is all part of the show.View image in fullscreenA cocktail dress masquerading as a just-out-of-the-shower towel wrap at Loewe.Photograph: ShutterstockA merry-go-round of designer debuts has brought two darlings of New York to Paris.

He wants Nato and the EU to handle Ukraine.“We don’t have the money here for our people. Our programme is for a better life for Czech citizens … We are not in Ukraine,” Babiš, 71, said in a debate on Wednesday on CNN Prima News.Polls point to Babiš’s ANO party winning more than 30% of the vote, about 10 points more than Fiala’s Spolu coalition. But, even with a small ally called Motorists, it will probably not get a majority in the 200-seat lower house of parliament.ANO’s sour relations with Spolu and its allies mean the party may need support from anti-EU and anti-Nato fringe parties – the far-right SPD and the far-left Stacilo! – for its preferred one-party cabinet.Babiš has rejected any steps towards exit from the EU or Nato, including calls for referendums, countering accusations by the current government that he would drag the country off its democratic, pro-western course.East or west? Czechs split over where possible return of ‘Trumpist’ could leadRead moreAt a Babiš rally in Kralupy near Prague this week, Martin Klihavec, an entrepreneur voting ANO, said: “This fearmongering will scare many voters, but that is a pity as it is not based on the truth. Under Babiš’s previous government, I was better off.”Babiš must overcome other hurdles to become prime minister. As the owner of a chemicals and food empire, he needs to find a way to comply with conflict-of-interest laws. He also faces a trial on fraud charges related to drawing an EU subsidy more than 15 years ago, charges he denies.Spolu and its allies could retain a majority if some small parties fail to meet the 5% threshold needed to get into parliament, a scenario that helped them in the last election but looks unlikely to be repeated, according to pollsters.Polls will be open until 10pm (8pm GMT) on Friday and from 8am to 2pm on Saturday, with results expected that afternoon.Explore more on these topicsCzech RepublicEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Four Italian MPs among the 40 Italian nationals taking part in the flotilla are expected to return on a scheduled flight toItaly.Footage from Thursday night showed the final boat of the flotilla crewed by six people, including three Turkish citizens, a German and an Omani. Speaking via a video call with flotilla organisers, the Australian captain of Marinette said: “We have a bunch of very tough Turks onboard … we’ve got a lady from Oman and myself, and we’re just going to continue in the direction.”Hannah Claire Smith,a flotilla spokesperson, said Marinette had joined the flotilla late after bad weather had forced it to return to port in Barcelona.1:18Moment IDF soldiers board Gaza aid flotilla vessels – videoIt was probably because of the delay that it managed to surprise the Israelis. The boat was intercepted in the early hours of Friday morning when GSF estimates it was 42.5 nautical miles from theGazacoast – the first time since Israel imposed a naval blockade in 2009 that an unauthorised humanitarian mission had come closer than 70 nautical miles to Gaza.Previous attempts by activists to break the naval blockade on Gaza were stopped by force by the Israeli military. In 2010, 10 Turkish activists were killed by Israeli commandos whoraided the Mavi Marmara shipas it led an aid flotilla towards Gaza.According to theflotilla’s live tracker, a sailing boat named Mikeno also appeared to have crossed into Gaza’s territorial waters, idling 9 miles off the coast before being intercepted.GSF said it had no firm information, however, as the organisers had lost contact with Mikeno’s crew hours earlier.“It could be a tracker error or a technical issue with the monitoring,” said Smith. “We will only have confirmation after speaking with the Mikeno crew, which is impossible right now as they are currently being held by the Israelis.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A low-pressure system that developed over the Mediterranean midweek moved north-east into south-eastern Europe on Thursday, bringing widespread showers, thunderstorms and prolonged rainfall.The system is expected to persist into Friday, with models on indicating 48-hour totals of 80-130mm of rain across much of the Balkans. Red weather warnings were issued for Serbia, south-west Romania, north-east Greece, and the Dodecanese and North Aegean Islands, highlighting the risk of flooding and threat to life. Strong winds also closed schools on Zakynthos in the Ionian Islands.Cold air drawn in from eastern Europe added to the severity, producing heavy snowfall across the Dinaric Alps, with some models forecasting depths of up to 80cm by the weekend.Earlier in the week, eastern Spain and the Balearics endured severe flooding as the remnants of Hurricane Gabrielle crossed the Iberian peninsula before stalling over the Balearic Sea. Valencia and Ibiza were worst affected; Gandia recorded 356.8mm in 12 hours – more than 10 times its September average – while Ibiza had 254mm in 24 hours, its wettest day since at least 1952.Roads, train stations, parks, and schools were forced to close, while one gauge near Aldaia measured 57mm in 35 minutes, causing the La Saleta ravine to overflow. The floods come almost a year after devastating inundations in Valencia in 2024 that killed more than 230 people.Typhoon Bualoi made landfall across central Vietnam this week, bringing heavy rain, strong winds, and huge sea swells. More than 300mm of rainfall was recorded within a 24-hour period on Monday, causing flash floods and landslides that blocked more than 3,000 roads and isolated communities across northern provinces. Dozens of flights were cancelled or delayed, and railway services between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were suspended.There have been 36 deaths and 147 injuries recorded, with 21 people still missing. More than 210,000 houses were damaged or flooded, with more than 51,000 hectares (126,000 acres) of rice and other crops destroyed. Vietnam’s government has estimated Bualoi has caused more than $350m(£260m) in property damage this week.Explore more on these topicsEurope weatherWeather trackerEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

What’s happening is far beyond the 7th of October,” Abdelatty said, referring to the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.What’s in Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza?Read moreSpeaking at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, he said Egypt “is coordinating with our brothers inQatarand with our colleagues in Turkey in order to convince Hamas to respond positively to this plan”.He added that while there were “a lot of holes” inthe Trump proposal, there was full agreement that “Hamas has no role in the day after”.Trump has given Hamas until Sunday night to reach an agreement on his plan to end the war inGaza, threateningthe group with “all hell” if it failed to do so.The US president posted on his Truth Social platform on Friday: “An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time. Every Country has signed on!. If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”The group is split over how to respond, with an official telling Agence France-Presse on Friday that it needed more time to consider the deal, prior to Trump’s announcement of a Sunday deadline.View image in fullscreenThe scene in Gaza City after Friday’s Israeli airstrike.Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPAIt would require Hamas to lay down its arms and exit politics, and return the remaining 48 hostages it has held since October 2023 – 20 of whom are presumed to be still alive – in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Israel would gradually withdraw its troops from Gaza while an international force replaced it, governed by a transitional authority headed by Trump.Most analysts agree the plan would spell an end to the group’s identity as an armed Palestinian resistance group, while Israel would make few concessions.The head of Hamas’s military wing, Izz al-Din al-Haddad, has objected to the plan, which he saw as being designed to eliminate Hamas whether they agreed to it or not, according to the BBC. There is doubt that Israel will adhere to the terms of the plan, particularly after the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a video that Israeli troops would remain in most of Gaza after the plan was implemented.Trump said on Friday that if the group did not agree to his plan, Hamas members would be hunted down. “Most of the rest are surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED, just waiting for me to give the word, ‘GO,’ for their lives to be quickly extinguished,” Trump said. “As for the rest, we know where and who you are, and you will be hunted down, and killed.”The plan places the onus on Hamas and relieves growing pressure on Israel to stop its military campaign. Israel has faced growing international condemnation of its conduct in Gaza in recent weeks, which has been deemed a genocide by the world’s leading association of genocide scholars.Israel continued its Gaza City offensive and bombardment of the wider strip on Friday. Eleven of the 28 people killed by Israeli strikes were killed in Gaza City, while the rest were killed in southern Gaza, including three by an Israeli drone strike in al-Mawasi, which it had previously designated as a safe zone.Israel issued itslast evacuation orderfor Gaza City on Wednesday, with the defence minister, Israel Katz, saying that anyone remaining in the city would be considered a terrorist or terrorist supporter, a designation contrary to international law.Hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in the city, many of whom cannot afford the journey to southern Gaza, which reportedly costs more than $1,000 (£750). The Israeli military has said the coastal route to southern Gaza remains open.“Many people are left to sleep along the roads until they can find shelter,” said Sarah Davies, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross. “There isn’t enough space or tents to house the people arriving from the north. The way evacuations are carried out matters.”The UN said on Friday there was no safe place for people fleeing Gaza City to go because the areas Israel had designated as “safe zones” in southern Gaza were “places of death”.“The notion of a safe zone in the south is farcical,” said James Elder, a spokesperson for the UN children’s agency, Unicef. “Bombs are dropped from the sky with chilling predictability; schools, which had been designated as temporary shelters, are regularly reduced to rubble, [and] tents … are regularly engulfed in fire from air attacks.”Israel regularly bombs areas it has deemed safe zones. On Thursday it bombed a food store in al-Mawasi, killing nine people, including a grandfather, his four sons and grandson.Al-Mawasi has become one of the world’s most densely populated places, the UN said, and is struggling to cope with the influx of nearly half a million people from Gaza City. Israel has said it has increased the flow of humanitarian aid to southern Gaza, but aid groups say it is not nearly enough to alleviate the famine afflicting parts of Gaza.Basic services were overwhelmed with the needs of displaced people and residents. According to Davies, hospitals in southern Gaza were under “severe strain”, and the Red Cross field hospital in the area was operating at more than double its capacity to accommodate the injured.On Thursday, al-Nasser hospital, one of the last remaining functional hospitals in southern Gaza, received 27 bodies of people shot dead by the Israeli military. When asked about the situation in the hospital, the head of paediatrics, Dr Ahmad al-Farra, said it was “very hard”.Israel was continuing to target hospitals and medical workers, theUN said.On Thursday, a nurse, Tasneem al-Hams, was “abducted” by Israeli special forces while travelling to work in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said. Hams’s father, Dr Marwan al-Hamas, a senior health ministry official, was detained by Israeli forces in July and is being held in an Israeli prison, as are at least 27 other doctors from Gaza, according to Palestinian Healthcare Workers Watch.Israel has previously claimed that arrested medical officials had connections to Hamas, without providing evidence.Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 62,622 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza health authority.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasEgyptGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Gusts of 60-70mph will be more widespread.In Northern Ireland, where an amber warning is in place until 8pm on Friday, schools in Antrim, Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh were told to close at noon, while the Foyle Bridge in Derry was closed because of strong winds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They include services between Cairnryan in Dumfries and Galloway and Larne in Co Antrim, and between Ardrossan on the Scottish mainland and Brodick on the Isle of Arran.TheRNLI saidthe strong gusts “pose a significant risk to safety” and appealed for people to “exercise extreme caution, particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts, piers and waterside paths”.The approaching storm has led to a number of event cancellations, including Friday evening’s United Rugby Championship match between Edinburgh and Ulster at Hive Stadium.Edinburgh’s managing director, Douglas Struth, said: “We were set to welcome a capacity crowd for tonight’s game. This decision has not been taken lightly.”The Forth Road Bridge, which connects Queensferry and North Queensferry across the Firth of Forth, was closed to all vehicles because of the storm, with drivers advised to use the nearby Queensferry Crossing instead.In Southend-on-Sea in Essex, Saturday’s annualApple Dayat St Laurence orchard was cancelled.All of Scotland, the north of England and the most western parts of Wales will fall under a yellow warning for wind until the start of Sunday.A long strip of Scotland from Dumfries to the northernmost part of the mainland will fall under a yellow rain warning to 3pm on Saturday.In Northern Ireland, a yellow warning for wind is in place until noon on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

The officer has since been bailed and suspended from duty.A force spokesperson said: “The allegation relates to an incident that took place at Charing Cross police station on 2 October and is linked to matters disclosed in BBC Panorama.“The investigation is ongoing so it would not be appropriate to go into further detail at this time.“The Independent Office forPoliceConduct, which is independently investigating allegations in relation to Charing Cross, has been informed.”Deputy assistant commissioner Andy Valentine said: “We have been extremely clear we will be unrelenting in our approach to tackling issues at Charing Cross, and anywhere else across the Met.“This fresh matter came to light through our internal reporting mechanisms and we continue to encourage and support all our officers and staff to report allegations of criminal and misconduct behaviour so we can act swiftly.“Professional standards officers immediately acted to make the arrest and the officer has been suspended from duty.“We will not hesitate to take rapid action around any further allegations, as part of our deeper probe into corruption and ridding the Met of those who are not fit to serve the people of London.”Reacting to the documentary earlier this week, Keir Starmer said: “I’ve not yet seen the footage, but I’ve had it described to me, and it’s shocking, and I’m glad the commissioner is responding. He needs to be very robust in his response.”The Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, said people in London could trust the “vast majority” of its officers, and added he was “horrified” by the documentary.Nine serving officers, one former officer and one detention officer are under investigation for gross misconduct by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.Allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour.The documentary footage shows one officer, PC Phil Neilson, referring to an immigrant who had overstayed his visa, saying: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him. And the ones that shag women, rape women, you do the cock and let them bleed out.”While drinking at a pub off-duty, he also told undercover reporter Rory Bibb that Algerians and Somalians are “scum”, and claimed there was an “invasion” of the UK by migrants.Another officer, PC Martin Borg, bragged about a colleague stamping on a detainee’s leg and laughed about the suspect screaming.He also appeared to say he offered to fill in a false witness statement about the incident.Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeLondonPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Farage has long been a critic of the ECHR and has pledged to leave it if he becomes prime minister.Badenoch said on Friday night that she had “not come to this decision lightly, but it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans and our citizens”.Critics of the ECHR claim it frustrates the government’s efforts to deal with illegal migration and deport foreign criminals.Others argue that pulling out of the treaty would damage the UK’s international reputation and breach the Good Friday agreement, which brought an end to decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Russia and Belarus are the only two European countries that are not signatories.Badenoch’s decision follows the conclusion of a months-long review by David Wolfson, the shadow attorney general, which found that the treaty “places significant constraints on the government” across a range of areas, including border control.Lord Wolfson, a commercial barrister, deemed other options, such as renegotiating or derogating from the treaty, “either unrealistic or ineffective”.He argued that leaving it was compatible with the Good Friday agreement and the Windsor framework negotiated by Rishi Sunak to ease post-Brexit trading arrangements.Badenoch’s announcement, which the Guardianreported on Thursdaywas coming, was made after the shadow cabinet met to sign off the policy.The Conservative party said: “Unlike Reform UK, who have made slapdash announcements with no consideration of the implications and no plan to deliver behind them, theConservativeshave done the serious work to explore the legal and practical considerations necessary to leave the ECHR in an orderly manner.”The ECHR was established in 1950 and sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries of the Council of Europe. It is a central part of UK human rights law and has been used to halt attempts to deport people who are deemed to be in the UK illegally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told the BBC: “I saw evil, and I saw hate. We will not allow that to beat us.”Alan Levy, the synagogue’s chair of trustees, said at one point during the attack he heard Shamie shout: “This is what they get for killing our children.”He told ITV News he had seen Shamie waving a knife outside the synagogue and ran inside to warn others. Levy then rushed to barricade the doors and described seeing the terrorist “with a big knife, banging his way into the glass, trying to get through”.He added: “The heroes of the congregation who saw what was happening then came to the doors because he was trying to break the doors down to get in.View image in fullscreenRabbi Daniel Walker speaking during a vigil in Manchester after the attack.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“We were barricading the doors between us with Rabbi Walker and a number of the other congregants. He couldn’t get in because we were holding the doors firm.”Walker said Adrian Daulby was among those helping to hold the doors shut. Daulby, 53, died after being accidentally shot by police as they tried to stop Shamie entering the synagogue.Melvin Cravitz, 66, also died in the attack.Greater Manchesterpolice said he was working at the synagogue as a security guard and “courageously stopped the attacker from entering the building”.Three others were injured, including one who suffered a gunshot wound, and remain in hospital. Walker said two of those injured had “blocked the terrorist” with their bodies.Levy praised the efforts of the congregation, as well as the police and passersby who tried to help.He said: “We need to pay respect to some non-Jewish people who saw what was happening and who stopped to try and help out. They tried to distract this man, to pull him away from the doors because they could see what he was doing.“We’ve been overwhelmed by the local community, Jewish and non-Jewish, who’ve offered help and support to us in this time.”Walker told Sky News that although the “pain is very raw”, the Jewish community was strong and would recover.“I still believe in hope, I still believe that we will come together and that we are better than this – and that we’ll be better than this,” he said.Levy echoed the sentiments: “We’re a strong community. We’re not going to be cowed by these terrorists. We’re going to be strong, we’re going to carry on.”He said the congregation continued their Yom Kippur service, which had been in progress when the attack started, at the police station while giving statements.Levy said: “We will be carrying on our services at another venue, and we’re going to carry on. We’re going to be strong, and we’re not going to let this defeat us in any way.”Explore more on these topicsManchesterGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

By keeping rates high, he believed, it caused a recession that led voters to punish the then vice-president. In 1972, he would not let that happen again.Staring at likely losses in the midterm elections next year, Trump is turning to Tricky Dick’s playbook to try to ensure a Maga Congress at least for the rest of his presidency by pushing interest rates down as far as he can.History shows us the likely impact. Under Nixon, the Fed repeatedly pulled back its disinflationary policies,pressured by the president and Congressto let the economy run hot. By 1974, inflation had risen above 12%. Bringing it back under 5% took another eight years.It may seem crazy for Trump to strong-arm the Fed at this stage, when the economy seems to be surprisingly solid and the stock market keeps toying with new highs. Most voters disapprove of Trump’sperformance on the economy. But the economic maelstrom threatened by the president’s capricious policymaking–including his tariff hikes, migrant raids and a vast tax cut that will add trillions to the federal debt–has not materialized.There are signs of economic weakness on the horizon. With the exception of IT equipment and software, business investment has been declining in recent quarters. Still, theUS economygrew 3.8% in the second quarter, the fastest pace in two years. Sluggish job creation in recent months is mostly due not to a weak economy but to a shortfall in the labor supply, caused by Trump’s crackdown on the foreign-born, which amounts to one in five workers.Moreover, the once-feared surge in inflation has been slow to arrive, suggesting to economists that while the barrage of tariffs Trump imposed on goods from around the world will raise prices, it may not seriously change people’s expectations and lead to persistent inflation.On the other hand, trying to take over the Federal Reserve carries real risks for the president. Financial markets are unlikely to be pleased if the Supreme Courteventuallyallows him to replace Fed governorLisa Cookwith another crony to side with his chief economic advisorStephen Miran, newly appointed to the board of governors. And markets are unlikely to react calmly if Trump somehow manages to oust Fed chairman Jerome Powell before his term ends next year.Trump asked for a full percentage point cut in short-term rates in June. Miran has called for rates to fall a percentage point by the end of the year, to three percent. But if the president manages to impose his will to goose the economy and pump the stock market, the markets could react much in the way they did on “Liberation Day” in April, when Trump’s tariff blast against imports from everywhere sent long-term interest rates sharply higher, as investors dumped US stocks, bonds and the dollar.For all this risk, however, Trump’s Nixonian gambit is not irrational. While the chances are that such a move would cause untold damage to the American economy over the longer term, a juiced-up economy in the months running up to the midterms could deliver on his overarching political goal – securing his hold over Congress.The experience of the 1970s should provide sufficient warning about the cost of allowing the economy to overheat. Paul Volcker, appointed Fed chairman in 1979 increased short-term rates above 20%, pushing the economy into a severe recession in order to subdue inflation. Unemployment at one point surpassed 10%.And yet Trump does not seem to care. Or maybe he believes he can manage them, at least in the short term. A collapse in Treasury bonds? Order the Fed to buy them. Bring mortgage rates down to bring good cheer to the housing market? The Fed could be instructed to directly buy mortgage-backed bonds.The last eight months offer solid evidence that the risk of doing severe damage to the American economy is no deterrent. Trump has whittled away at the fundamentals underpinning America’s economic success, from barring immigrants to blockading trade, from defunding research to pummeling universities and undercutting the rule of law.He may sincerely believe that trade deficits are inherently evil, the product of “unfair” behavior by other countries. Perhaps he truly thinks he can tax imports without raising their prices to businesses and consumers, or raid the labor force at no cost to employers or the economy. After all, he did once suggestinjecting disinfectantas a cure for Covid.In the political realm, however, one cannot discount Trump’s talent. He understands like no other the value of raw political power. His presidency is shaped like a single-minded project in pursuit of more. Taking over the Fed would serve this project. Even if the American economy ultimately goes haywire, succumbing to stagflation, Trump will profit as long as the bad news doesn’t flare up over the next 12 or so months.Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpEconomicsRichard NixonFederal ReserveanalysisShareReuse this content"

But theTrump administrationhas so far defied calls to publish the report.Employment growth has beenslowing for months. Donald Trumpfired the BLS commissionerin August, claiming without evidence that official data had been “faked”, as the labor market softened.Erica Groshen, who served as BLS commissioner during the Obama administration, said: “Without today’s jobs report and next week’s scheduled inflation release (the data for which are already collected), the Federal Reserve, US treasury, financial markets, businesses and households will be flying blind.“They will be less certain of current conditions at what may or may not be the beginning of a recession – precisely when their decisions are most consequential.”Earlier this week William Beach, who led the BLS for four years under Trump andJoe Biden, also said the jobs data for September “have been completely collected and processed” by the BLS. “The jobs report is likely written in final draft,” hewrote.According to a private jobs report from the payroll processing company ADP, US firms lost32,000 jobsin the month of September, contrary to expectations from Wall Street of job growth of 45,000 for the month.

Since the release is delayed, a big piece of the labor market puzzle is missing.”The Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren has called on theTrump administrationto release the jobs report and upcoming inflation data despite the shutdown. “The jobs data scheduled to come out this Friday has undoubtedly been collected and the President must release it,” she said. “Without it, the Federal Reserve will not have the full picture it needs to make decisions this month about interest rates that will impact every family across the country.“Donald Trump has the power to make sure the federal government can continue producing and releasing this critical information on Friday and beyond during his shutdown.”Under the shutdown, the BLS’s contingency plan calls for furloughing all employees but the acting commissioner at the agency.“In the event of a federal government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will suspend data collection, processing, and dissemination,” an agency spokesperson said in an email. “Once funding is restored, BLS will resume normal operations and notify the public of any changes to the news release schedule on theBLS release calendar.”Trump’s nominee to lead the BLS, EJ Antoni,withdrewhis nomination earlier this week after his selection drew bipartisan criticism over his lack of qualifications and consensus he was too partisan for the role.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Jeanne Martin, co-director of corporate engagement at the responsible investment group ShareAction, described it as “bitterly disappointing”.She said: “Senior bankers need to be far more courageous in this decisive moment for all our futures and must use their influence to push up standards for accountability on climate if we are to stand any chance of making the clean energy transition happen.”Global financial sector dropping key green pledges as Trump takes officeRead moreBut Lucie Pinson, the director of Reclaim Finance, said she “won’t mourn” the demise of the NZBA. “Like other financial alliances of its kind, it brought little – if anything – to the climate, and was doomed to fail,” she said. “Its purpose was never to take real action, but to create the illusion of measures in order to ward off the risk of regulation.“At least its demise brings clarity: the institutions genuinely committed to containing global warming will continue to act. But the massive reallocation of financial flows toward solutions cannot happen without intervention from policymakers and regulators. Their action is essential to limit climate change and the systemic risks it entails. For both, the priority remains ending the financing of fossil fuel expansion.”On paper, the NZBA, which was convened by the UN Environment Programme finance initiative but led by banks, encouraged members to slash the carbon footprint of their investments and help drive the transition to net zero emissions by 2050.The group counted nearly 150 members at its peak but began losing members late last year, when Donald Trump was re-elected on promises to deregulate the energy sector, dismantle environmental rules and “drill, baby, drill”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s time to take that seriouslyFri 3 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 07.49 EDTShareFor gen Z Americans, it’s hard to remember a version of the economy not defined by crisis. We finished our education online asCoviddevastated the world, only to graduate into highcosts of living,stagnant wagesand nowAI’s threat to entry-level jobs. We’ve come of age in a system that no longer feels fit for purpose.The result is a generation that’s lost faith in the traditional markers of stability. What once defined a secure life –home, family and comfortable retirement– feels out of reach. “A pension is out of the question,” one friend told me. “So staying in the same job no longer makes sense.” She’s not alone: jobseekers’ confidence in keeping or finding workdropped sharplythis spring, with a survey in June suggestingnearly 60% of graduateswere still looking for their first jobs.Trump wants to rebrand his tax bill as the ‘Working Families Tax Cut’. Don’t be fooled | Steven GreenhouseRead moreIt’s not just these markers of stability, but the economic web that once bound us to them. The financial commitments that tied previous generations to long-term careerism – having children, affordable mortgages, college debt – are largely unattainable. College, long considered a reliable pathway to success, hasrapidly diminishedin importance for Americans. Childcare costs are soprohibitivethat agrowing shareof adults say they’re unlikely to have children. And with housing prices rising atmore than twicethe rate of inflation since 1960,one in three gen Z-ersbelieve they’ll never own a home. Locked out of these futures – for better or worse – we’re no longer tethered to economic paths that once rooted people to jobs, and more importantly, to communities.Enter disillusionomics: the economics of a generation raised on promises thatnever materialized. It’s a reaction to a system where traditional benchmarks of success have become largely unattainable, and even if attained, don’t deliver the same security they once did. Functioning well, the economy is supposed to provide security and opportunity. But when hard workno longer guarantees mobility, and outcomes are increasingly defined by where yougrow up, gen Z is asking: why play by the rules of a game that no longer works?Every time a new gen Z trend surfaces, I bookmark it: theGen Z stare,salary dysmorphia,fast-yield dividend investments,treat culture. But taking each in isolation doesn’t quite touch on thewhy. Connecting the threads, we see a generation that is not entitled, not indulgent, but reacting to a political and economic climate we’re disillusioned by. These are survival strategies in an affordability crisis.Some are retreating into predictability, with the resurgence of traditionalmasculine– andfeminine– norms. Linear careers that promise predictability are hotly desired, withhalf of Harvard graduates in 2024 going into consulting, tech or finance. Others are leaning into risk-taking,citingpressures to stay afloat. Manyclosely watchthe markets: over half of 18-25 year olds nowinvest, and more thana thirdare considering cryptocurrency investments. With growingdebt burdens, gen Z see these choices as responses tomore challengingeconomic circumstances than prior generations experienced.Then there’s the rise in earning passive income. Knowing thatwageswon’t build wealth, gen Z pursues creative income streams: from the demure (subleasing partsof their apartments) to the extreme (OnlyFans). Everything can become commodifiable if it means buying the stability we need. This also explains gen Z’s rush into AI startups, as young people refuse to letshrinking entry-levelroles dictate their future. “Entrepreneur” has become themost admiredprofession among young men, wanting to work for ashared purposeoutside atraditional9 to 5 that no longer delivers on its promises.So, contrary to how gen Z is perceived, we are a generation deeply engaged in the economy. We’ve had to become hyper-aware of economic realities just to live securely. But we’re still hoping the system will change. Acrosspartisan divides, economic outcomes are the most important driver of our voting choices, explaining the appeal of figures offering alternative models, fromMamdanitoMaga. We’re searching for any solution that might change the current system.It’s no coincidence, then, that we’re increasingly polarized acrosspoliticsandgender. Much of it stems from divergent responses to the same problem. Years of economic crises have left younger people with downturn fatigue. We’ve become morelikelyto think in zero-sum terms, seeinglimited resourcesand feeling the need to beat others to them. Gen Z is taking economic innovation into its own hands, angry at a system that doesn’t work. Our anger is then directed at diverging sources, amplified byalgorithmic outrage, ultimately making it harder to relate to each other. And with division sown across the generations, the social contracts we have with work, government and each other will fray.So if the economy just isn’t serving (excuse the gen Z pun), what should Americans do? It starts with taking gen Z’s behavior seriously. Dismissing our concerns as quirky reactions to a system that worked for older generations risks polarizing us further. Zero-sum thinking like this makes collective solutions harder, as we refuse to see or understand each other’s different generational challenges.Young people offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ask: what is our labour reallyfor? And as digital natives, gen Zers see AI – used thoughtfully – as a chance to redefine the value of work itself. This generation no longer wants to be bound to extractive contracts or roles thatfeel unnecessary. Now it’s time to collectively, and apolitically, ask: what would it take to redesign the economy so it serves its citizens again?Alice Lassman is a policy expert with a focus on the global economy and gender.

She closed out the Fever series with a 35-point performance that was a block and steal away from also being a rare 5x5 stat line.Jakub Frankowicz... they rediscovered their defensive identity.After therecord 111-58 loss to Minnesotathat dropped them to 14-14, the Aces rattled off 16 straight wins to close out the regular season without conceding more than 87 points in a game. Notably, that dramatic shift in form coincided with Kierstan Bell moving into the starting five in place of Jewell Loyd, who has thrived coming off the bench.Bryan Armen GrahamNo one comes to watch the referees. But in the WNBA, they’re the story | Bryan Armen GrahamRead more… they fought for it.This is a team that everyone saw crashing out for most of the season, a team that came back from a morally draining 53-point loss, and a team that seemingly just had to flip a switch to start winning. They’ve been on the brink of elimination twice – first with the Storm, then the Fever – and battled back each time.Stephanie Kaloi… Chelsea Gray appears to have fully bounced back from last year’s foot injury.The offense hasn’t missed a beat with her running the point and new addition Jewell Loyd making timely contributions off the ball. There’s another player – checks notes – A’ja something or other. I understand she’s been a bright spot for the team, too.Andrew Lawrence… honestly, I’m not sure.When I made my playoff predictions, I didn’t expect much from the Aces. They’ve often looked disconnected, lacking chemistry on the court. Still, A’ja Wilson and Jackie Young keep dragging them through; Wilson hasn’t won four MVPs by accident. Even so, I’m surprised.

But nobody in their rotation is a slouch defensively. They are going to need to keep up the intensity if they hope to slow down the Aces.JF… they reinvented themselves on the fly, replacing departed legends with veterans Alyssa Thomas, Satou Sabally and DeWanna Bonner, who delivered in big moments. Backed by Mat Ishbia’s deep investment and a state-of-the-art practice facility, second-year coach Nate Tibbetts molded them into resilient road warriors who knocked off New York and top-seeded Minnesota.BAG… they’re tough as all get-out.Satou Sabally, Alyssa Thomas and Kahleah Copper always had potential to play together as well as they are right now, the team is fully healthy, and they’ve completely embraced the underdog mentality. They’re playing like they can’t lose, and it’s starting to feel like they’re absolutely correct.SK… Alyssa Thomas took out Naphessa Collier while gambling on a steal during the semi-finals.Also: Thomas has been brilliant all season and so has Nate Tibbetts about squeezing productive minutes out of all 12 women on the roster. (I guess that’s why they pay him thebig bucks.) Lastly: I had them as my surprise team goingintothe season!AL… they play harder and tougher than any other team.Watching the Mercury against teams like the Liberty and Lynx, their physicality stands out. The coach stays composed under pressure, even when trailing late. Alyssa Thomas drives the pace with relentless aggression, while Satou Sabally’s smooth, versatile game – effective both on the wing and in the paint – gives them a crucial edge..TRView image in fullscreenPhoenix’s Alyssa Thomas is a six-time WNBA All-Star who has been named to the All-WNBA first team in each of the last two seasons.Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesIs Napheesa Collier right that the WNBA has the ‘worst leadership in the world’?It’s definitely in the bottom half of leagues.It hurts the WNBA that Cathy Engelbert comes from outside the sports world. When they chose commissioners, the NFL, NBA and MLB picked from within, while NHL and MLS selected from other leagues. The NBA stake in the league also means the league experiences influence outside those involved in day-to-day operations.JFSort of.Collier’s critique reflects widespread frustration with officiating and structural shortcomings in resources. While “worst in the world” is hyperbolic, the league’s leadership has been reactive rather than proactive, especially on refereeing quality and player welfare. Collier’s comments underline that players feel unheard in a league enjoying historic growth but uneven governance.BAGI am not quite sure I would go that far, as there are quite a few poorly managed professional leagues around the world, but I absolutely agree with what Collier said and that it’s time for change. The WNBA has seen extraordinary growth this season, and needs extraordinary leadership to guide the league as a whole into the next chapter.SKTheworldmight be strong, given these “uncertain times”. But in the sports world? It’s hard to pin the W’s decades-long mismanagement on an executive who’s only been in the job for six years. But given that Engelbert’s era represents the highest inflection point on the W’s growth curve to date, her particular brand of consultancy-flavored leadership leaves much to be desired.ALNo.If these accusations keep surfacing – directly or through players and coaches – it’s hard not to see truth in them. When stars openly say the league’s schedule is burning them out and risking their health, that speaks volumes. Add grueling back-to-backs, poor officiating and low pay, and Engelbert’s alleged “grateful” comment feels out of touch. Poor leadership, yes – but not the world’sworst.TRView image in fullscreenBecky Hammon, right, and A’ja Wilson are taking aim at a third title in four years alongside one another.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesThe coaching advantage goes to ...The Aces andBecky Hammon. While Nate Tibbetts deserves a lot of credit for leading a team that is starting three players who joined the Mercury this year to a finals appearance, Becky Hammon has a winning pedigree in admittedly four years that is tough to pick against.JFBecky Hammonholds the edge. Her NBA-informed schemes and championship pedigree give the Aces a tactical backbone. She has proven adept at adjusting mid-series and managing stars. While Nate Tibbetts has energized Phoenix with pace and defensive buy-in, Hammon’s finals experience and ability to manipulate matchups tilt this category.BAGWithout a doubt,Becky Hammon. Nate Tibbetts has done an incredible job all season, and in many (many) ways surprised many of us with just how successful this team has been, but the finals are a different kind of beast and Tibbets hasn’t been in the tranches like Hammon has. She lives and breathes exactly this kind of basketball cinema.SKI’ll takeBig Shot Beckywith everything on the line any day, especially when she’s got No 22 on the block.ALMercury coachNate Tibbettsstays composed and focused every game, clearly in tune with the action.

How she is able to perform and if she can state out foul trouble will dictate if the Mercury can enforce their will in games, or if they have to adapt to counter Wilson’s dominance.JFKiah Stokes, Las Vegas.She doesn’t fill highlight reels, but her rim protection and offensive rebounding are critical in slowing Phoenix’s frontcourt. If she can stay out of foul trouble and control second-chance opportunities, she could swing pivotal stretches.BAGNatasha Mack, Phoenix.There are a lot of players putting in powerhouse seasons in 2025, but Mack is playing very strong basketball. She’s a great offensive rebounder and the Mercury have only benefitted since she’s been added to the starting lineup. She always seems to know where to be and exactly when she needs to be there.SKDana Evans, Las Vegas.A former sixth player of the year top finisher, Evans is playing great off the bench once again, with her regular-season averagesrisingto seven points and three assists.

Her versatility will allow Hammon to exploit Phoenix’s mismatches inside and out. If Las Vegas claim the title, Wilson’s impact on both ends ensures she’ll collect a second WNBA finals MVP trophy.BAGAlyssa Thomas, Phoenix.She’s put in arguably the strongest season of her career and was touted as a potential WNBA MVP for most of the season. When the Mercury have struggled, it’s never been because of her, and she’s shown all season that if her team trusts her, she will lead them right where they want to go.SKA’ja Wilson, Las Vegas.At this point they might as well rename the trophy in her honor.ALA’ja Wilson, Las Vegas.It’s rare for a player on the losing side to win WNBA finals MVP, but I predict Wilson will. She didn’t dominate this season in points or records, yet her in-season MVP shows the pull of her game and name. A four-time MVP already, she carries unmatched weight in women’s basketball.TRView image in fullscreenThe Phoenix Mercury celebrate after knocking out the Minnesota Lynx to reach the WNBA finals.Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesThe winner will be ...Phoenix in six.The Aces’ problem is their depth, and they’ve played two full-length series to get here. They’ve needed A’ja Wilson, Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray to be remarkable every night. Look for the Mercury’s rotation to beat out the Aces stars, especially as the series continues on.JFLas Vegas in six.The Mercury’s grit and Thomas’s relentless play will earn them a couple of wins, but the Aces’ balance of star power, depth and championship mettle should prevail. Wilson, Young and Gray simply provide too many answers, lifting Las Vegas to the WNBA summit for a third time in four seasons.BAGPhoenix in seven.The Mercury rebuilt following Taurasi’s retirement and BG’s departure, clearly put in the work to play well together, and have demonstrated the ability to stay cool no matter where they’re playing. They’ve been better defensively and more efficient all season, and a fully healthyPhoenix Mercuryare an eye-wateringly scary foe. As long as Sabally, Thomas and Copper are hitting shots, the series is theirs.SKLas Vegas in six.The Mercury make a valiant effort, but in the end the Aces are simply too strong, too deep and too experienced to be denied. With three titles in four years and four finals trips in five, thedynasty is back onand the Aces reclaim their rightful place as the league’s premier franchise in word and deed. The only thing that could really slow their momentum next season is a work stoppage, which could well be in the offing if the players keep grumbling about the state of play.ALPhoenix in seven.The Mercury’s intensity and perseverance make them a tough out, and if they win, it’ll take all seven games. Alyssa Thomas has been outstanding: worthy of MVP consideration, even if overlooked. Long disrespected, she summed it up best herself: “I think I’ve been so disrespected in my career that it doesn’t bother me anymore.”TRExplore more on these topicsWNBAPhoenix MercuryLas Vegas AcesUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stay calm. The advice from Virgil van Dijk and Curtis Jones was Zen-like in its reassurance in midweek as Liverpool digestedback-to-back defeatsfor the second time under Arne Slot.Slot remained relaxed and upbeat on Friday too, sprinkling his press conference with several unprompted reminders that the team he was defending from rare criticism are top of the Premier League. Again. But behind the soothing messages and positive league table there are undeniable issues with Liverpool’s form that, according to Slot himself, run deeper than the opening 10 games of the campaign.Curtis Jones calls on Liverpool to improve basics in order to correct formRead moreThe Premier League champions have not been struggling to create chances from open play or to turn dominant possession into convincing victories since August, their head coach insisted. They have been struggling to do both since the middle of last season, once opponents adjusted their tactics to stifle Liverpool, and are yet to find solutions. It was some admission from the coach of a team that cruised to the title with four games to spare in April and has been enhanced bya £420m summer spending spree. And, yes, that investment does increase scrutiny as well as expectation.“We were very happy winning the league,” said Slot. “But we didn’t shut our eyes for the second part of the season to how many times we needed a set piece [to win]. That is not something bad because Arsenal and Chelsea areneeding a set piecealmost every single game at the moment. We’ve brought in a very different midfielder than we had last season [Florian Wirtz], which we think we needed because there was a big, big difference between the amount of goals we found from open play in the first part of last season and the second part of last season.”View image in fullscreenMidfielder Alexis Mac Allister (left) is not yet at 100% as he recovers from a groin injury.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAStatistics back up Slot. In the first 19 league games of his debut season Liverpool scored 47 goals with 40 (85.1%) coming from open play. Over the final 19 league games Liverpool scored 39 goals, of which 27 (69.2%) were from open play. The drop-off has been corrected this term, over a small sample size admittedly, with 10 of Liverpool’s 12 league goals scored from open play (83.3%). But Slot’s side stayed out in front over the final 19 games of last season thanks in no small part to eight set-piece goals (20.5% of the total), excluding penalties. This season’s set-piece tally, excluding penalties, is one (8.3%).But Liverpool’s performances this season, notably the defeats at Crystal Palace and Galatasaray in the space of four days, cannot be attributed to a decline in set-piece prowess alone. Even their seven-game winning streak before heading to Selhurst Park was often accompanied by the caveat thatLiverpool won lateand/or despite an inconsistent display.Wirtz is yet to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League and is a £100m talent that Slot is still trying to accommodate to maximum effect. Liverpool’s new full-backs, Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, werestaunchly defendedby their head coach before the Galatasaray defeat but are not currently at the levels of the players they replaced, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson. Alexander Isak is not match sharp having spent the summer on strike at Newcastle, and Ibrahima Konaté’s form has deserted him. The list goes on. Only Hugo Ekitiké, Van Dijk, Alisson, who will miss Saturday’s trip to Chelsea with a hamstring injury, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch have performed consistently well this term.Liverpool desperately need Alexis Mac Allister to regain full fitness and his influence over their rhythm, composure and penetration. The Argentina international was left out of the final two games of last season to start his recovery from a persistent groin injury and return fit for pre-season. At least that was the plan. The midfielder’s rehabilitation took longer than anticipated, pre-season was frequently interrupted as a consequence, and a vital cog in Slot’s machine has not completed 90 minutes for his club since the1-0 win at Leicesteron 20 April. “You say he’s playing catchup,” Slot said. “In Holland we say he walks behind the music.” Liverpool will be a different proposition once Mac Allister is conducting midfield alongside Gravenberch again.Slot has extolled the virtues of flexibility in his new-look squad, with the summer arrivals Wirtz, Ekitiké, Isak and Frimpong able to play in a variety of positions, but a team in transition could do with more consistency in selection to speed the process. Slot insists his changes in personnel have been enforced and there will be no change in his approach.View image in fullscreenArne Slot: ‘There are things we definitely have to improve.’Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters“I don’t think we do things differently but I see teams doing a lot of things differently against us,” he said. “Jürgen [Klopp] gave me a lot of gifts but one of the gifts he gave me was ending up third the year before and fifth the year before that, and him being so well-known that a new manager came in and everyone thought: ‘Oh, let’s start to play against Liverpool.’ Teams played in a completely different way in the first half of the season against us than they did when we were top of the league after half of the season.“It is purely about how teams play against us in style and mentality. In Istanbul, [it looked as if] Galatasaray won the Champions League. If you look at Palace, you look at Galatasaray, how much they throw themselves in front of a ball, these things make it harder for us to score from open play than it was in the first part of last season. This is something I already saw last season. That’s why we had the window we had: sometimes to replace, sometimes to add a certain quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the meantime, we almost won every single game, right? But the margins are not the same any more as the first part of the season: 3-0 Brentford at home, 6-3 Tottenham and 5-0 West Ham.”Liverpool possess enough world-class talent to correct their unconvincing form, as Jones stated this week, but Slot admits the solution is more complex than waiting for Wirtz and Isak to hit their stride. Stamford Bridge would be a good place to start, however.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It’s a combination of things,” Slot said. “How do we find our wingers? Do we find them often enough and in promising situations like we did against Galatasaray? This is what we have to work on and this is what we have to do better than we’ve done until now.“We unlocked teams in the second half of last season by scoring from seven corner kicks. The team we face tomorrow [Chelsea] have scored more than 50% of their goals from set pieces, although they are on eight points. The No 2 in the league [Arsenal] has scored 60% of their goals from set pieces. So they have the same issues if they face a low block, but the way to unlock a low block is to do better.“We have to find ways of unlocking that, maybe scoring the first chance we get or from a set piece. I think there are enough positives to take from this season. If you talk about open-play goals, we’ve done much better in the first part of this season than the second part of last season. But there are things we definitely have to improve. I’m the first one to acknowledge that.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A video on social mediashows Shaw, wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, shouting for help as the swarm of officers move to apprehend him.The 35-year-old from Dallas, Texas, is facing the possibility of the death penalty or a long spell behind bars. He was a key member of Prawira Bandung, who won the Indonesian Basketball League (IBL) in 2023, and hehas scoredmore than 1,000 points over three seasons in the country. But now he is languishing in pre-trial detention and is banned for life from the IBL.“I use cannabis as a medicine,” he told the Guardian over the phone from a prison just outside Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, in his first comments to the press since his May arrest. “I havean inflammatory condition called Crohn’s disease that’s incurable. There’s no medicine apart from cannabis that stops my stomach from aching.”During the off-season Shaw lives in Thailand, where cannabis is subject tomore liberal laws. He says he had endured the pain of going without cannabis in previous campaigns in Indonesia but says that health reasons spurred him to import the intercepted supply of 132 gummies this year. “I made a stupid mistake,” he says.But that mistake should not warrant the death penalty or a long spell in prison, he says. “There’s people telling me I’m about to spend the rest of my life in prison over some edibles,” he says. “I’ve never been through anything like this.” In the first two months after his arrest, he was at “the lowest point in [my] life” and in a “really dark mental place”.“I felt helpless and alone,” he says. “I didn’t want to wake up again.” But through prayer and his faith, as well as access to a prison gym, he is starting to feel himself again, even while the 6ft 11in athlete shares a cramped cell with a dozen men. “I just turned 35 but I still feel young,” says the former Utah State basketballer, who has played in Argentina, Japan, Turkey, Thailand and Tunisia. “I would love to continue my basketball career.”Shaw, who plays as a center or power forward, says cannabis helps ease his anxiety and depression, as well as insomnia and the pain from Crohn’s. “I don’t use it to have fun and go party,” he says. “With my stomach condition, sometimes it’s hard for me to keep food down or go to the toilet. It just soothes the pain a little bit.”Indonesia takes a hard line on drugs and carried out executions in 2016,by firing squad, of an Indonesian and three foreigners convicted of drug offenses. More than 500 people – including almost 100 foreigners – are on death row in the country, mostly for drug-related crimes.Indonesian police have said that Shaw sent text messages to his teammates saying that he would share some of the cannabis candies with them. “What they consider drugs, I consider medicine,” says Shaw. “It’s just different cultures.”After Shaw’s arrest, Ronald Sipayung, the Soekarno-Hatta Airport police chief, told reporters that the American could face life in prison or even the death penalty if found guilty. “We are still running the investigation to uncover the international drugs network behind this case and to stop its distribution,” Sipayung said.Shawwas swiftly paradedat a press conference, appearing with his hands cuffed wearing an orange prison-issue T-shirt and a black face mask. He stood with his back to the audience as police chiefs exhibited the cannabis gummies, which weigh 869 grams in total and are worth $400.He said that to charge him with possession of almost a kilo of cannabis is unjust and “sick”, given that most of the weight is made up by the gummies themselves rather than the cannabis content. “I’ve been charged for almost a kilo,” he says. “I didn’t have anything near that.”Shawis fundraisingto cover his rising legal fees. He has not yet appeared in court despite being arrested five months ago, and he is still waiting for a first appearance date. “They’re making it seem like I’m this big drug dealer,” he says. “Why would I bring the candy here to sell? It was for personal use.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Around the world, people are serving extreme sentences for non-violent cannabis offenses that pose no threat to public safety.” Even in the US, she added, tens of thousandsremain incarceratedfor cannabis offences despite recreational legalization in almost half of states and a medical greenlight in all but two. “These punishments run counter to international human rights standards,” Shepard said.The potential efficacy of cannabis on Crohn’s disease is understudied but in September the journal Nature Medicinepublished a paperon a study which found that cannabis can ease chronic lower back pain without serious side effects. It came as Donald Trumptalked upthe benefits of cannabis-based medicines.There are parallels between Shaw’s case and that of Brittney Griner, the decorated American basketball player who was imprisoned in Russia for 10 months in 2022 after authorities found cannabis vape cartridges in her luggage.Griner was eventually releasedas part of a prisoner swap involving a Russian weapons trafficker.“Jarred has always been one of the most generous and selfless people you could meet,” his friend, Bree Petruzio, said on Shaw’s fundraising page. “Jarred made a mistake. But I don’t believe that mistake should cost him his entire future.”The US embassy in Jakarta says it is aware of Shaw’s case but would not comment further.Donte West, an advocacy assistant at LPP who is handling Shaw’s case, said: “Cannabis can’t kill you, but possessing it can. We must get as much attention on this case in the hope that a positive resolution will set a powerful precedent. I’m dedicated to making sure Jarred gets home to his mother.”The Indonesian National Police did not respond to a request for comment for this story.Explore more on these topicsBasketballUS sportsCollege sportsIndonesiaAsia PacificDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2007, when Lewis Hamilton narrowly missed winning the championship in the final race at Brazil in his debut season, it taught him the unique challenge of a title tilt.“I remember the buildup to those races at the end and the pressure was there,” he said. “That was not needed. If I knew then what I know now, I would have easily won that championship, I think. I have learned not to add pressure that’s unnecessary.”Welcome then, Norris and Piastri, to the cauldron. The advantage thus far has swung between them. Norris has five wins to Piastri’s seven and the pair have barely been off the podium in aMcLarenthat has been the class of the field. Piastri has been more consistent, with his British rival struggling to adapt to a lack of feel for grip from the front axle. Nonetheless, they have dominated, the difference between them often only which could deliver flawlessly, across qualifying and the race.In this regard Norris has been found wanting,small errors were costly in China, more so after a poor qualifying in Bahrain and worse still when losing the championship lead aftercrashing out in qualifying in Saudi Arabia. Then, worst of all, over-eagerin Canada he hit his teammateand went out, an enormous blow.Piastri, in only his third season in F1, has been more comfortable. For some timesliding off at the season opener in the wet in Melbournewas his only fault and one which was forgivable in the sudden rain. Later, the Australian was also caught out and passed by anopportunistic Verstappen at Imola, while his misjudgment and penalty for “erratic braking” under the safety car atSilverstone cost him a likely win.View image in fullscreenMcLaren’s title hopefuls, Oscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris, could learn a lot from looking at how Lewis Hamilton (right) handled the pressure in his early title victories.Photograph: Anton Vaganov/ReutersHowever, these were minor hiccups against something of a debacle atthe last round in Baku. In Azerbaijan, Piastri crashed out in qualifying leaving him ninth on the grid, only to follow it with a false start, the car entering anti-stall and dropping him to the back of the field.Chasing places on the opening lap, he misjudged the grip and ended in the barriers, an uncharacteristic sequence of errors that he acknowledged he could ill afford in Singapore this week.“Baku was quite a good reminder of how quickly everything can change,” he said. “There’s some lessons about how I can deal with that better and lessons on risk I guess is the best way to put it. There’s nothing revolutionary that needs to change or that I am going to change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The opening years of Hamilton’s career were exceptional, but he also made his fair share of errors. Piastri could take note ofBahrain in 2008, the year the seven-time champion took his first title but which was marked by other mistakes as he found himself in an intense fight with Felipe Massa.On the grid in Manama he had failed to correctly set the launch control on his McLaren and it went into anti-stall, dropping him down the grid. Shortly afterwards, chasing places, he clipped the back of Fernando Alonso’s Renault and had to pit with a damaged front wing. He finished 13th after a race he described as “a disaster”.Similarly Verstappen’s early career was marked by misjudgments as he learned his craft. After one costly crash in Monaco in 2018 then team principal Christian Horner publicly demanded his driver demonstrate more discipline.Verstappen, too, took it on board, the waywardness all but gone when he began winning titles. “This has just been character-building,” he said at the time. “Throughout my life there have been periods of character-building and this was another step. Sometimes, it is not enjoyable but sometimes you need it.”Norris and Piastri are not up with Hamilton and Verstappen yet but they are under the same pressure and learning the same lessons. As Niki Lauda noted, the first title is always the hardest. Closing this one out is the biggest challenge of their careers and will probably fall to the one who can best handle the heat.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportLando NorrisOscar PiastriMcLarennewsShareReuse this content"

Because you really know when you play why you play; and when you don’t play, you also deep down know why. The rest is …” and here he waffled, saying he preferred not to use a term he used last window (“bullshit”), while also offering no alternative.“The player wants you to justify; they want to know the evidence,” he continued. “If you explain, you are going to make the player happy. The players, they need to know. The players that were not called today, they need to be desperate to perform better [for] their clubs.”USMNT squad: Antonee Robinson returns as Pochettino calls up 26 for friendliesRead morePochettino spoke on the occasion of hiscalling up 26 playersfor friendlies with Ecuador on 10 October in Austin, Texas, and Australia on 14 October in Commerce City, Colorado. Which is to say that the 33 players who were previously called up in the former Tottenham, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager’s year in charge of the USMNT weren’t this time around, and won’t know why (with the exception of those that are injured and Tyler Adams, who will miss this window due to the upcoming birth of his second child).There are notable returns: Weston McKennie, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson, Aidan Morris, Tanner Tessmann and Haji Wright were all brought back for another look. James Sands will return to the US camp for the first time under Pochettino. Left out were Yunus Musah, Josh Sargent, and Joe Scally, all of whom have been playing well for their clubs.Some players will have been left out strategically; some are just out of the picture. Which is which, nobody knows but for one man and his staff. To everyone else, it’s unknowable. But the players, at least … maybe theyshouldknow.In September, inthe previous episode of the team’s angst-ridden road to the 2026 World Cup, the Americans slogged to a mirthless and panicky 2-0 loss to South Korea in New Jersey. But they followed this malperformance up with a spirited 2-0 win over Japan in Columbus, when a 3-4-2-1 system yielded ample scoring chances and some momentum and optimism at last.Fans and observers alike had hoped that this camp, with just two more full international windows to follow in November and March before the US assembles for the World Cup, would offer more definitive insight into Pochettino’s thinking for his first-choice squad.The USMNT’s 2025 has been tumultuous, but it deserves an optimist’s view | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreBut Pochettino continues to use his roster selections to send messages, as he has since the two-loss debacle at the Concacaf Nations League in March – the last time several erstwhile regulars, like McKennie, were seen in a US jersey.“It’s not because your name is one [thing] or another, you’re going to have a place for sure on the roster for the World Cup,” said Pochettino on Thursday. “That’s an idea that we were fighting in the last year to try to fix. To change the culture. To change the idea of, ‘OK, because in the past I perform in some way, or because I did well four years ago, now I am ready to come and to use my place because that is my place.’ I think that has changed a lot.“It’s an open system,” Pochettino added. “They need to convince us to come again. They need to come here and to perform, to follow the rules, to behave in the way that we want [them to] behave, and try not only to win the games but to think and to build something important.”Pochettino has also been pragmatic in his roster choices, deliberate in which players to pluck from their club environments and when. He has carefully managed the travel and minutes expected from players who have recently had major injuries, or high workloads, sometimes leaving players like Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson with their clubs in deference to their long-term fitness in a World Cup year.Robinson, who has played just 64 Premier League minutes for Fulham since returning from knee surgery, is in camp this time around, but likely won’t play anywhere close to 180 minutes. “It’s important that he can be with us, his teammates,” Pochettino said. “It’s not only about tactics; it’s about giving some benefits to our players. The challenge is to help him start to feel the confidence again.”In that same vein, Pochettino has let players who were settling in with new clubs stay there during the September window before calling them again. Forward Patrick Agyemang, midfielder Malik Tillman and goalkeeper Matt Turner have all returned to camp after remaining with their clubs last month in the wake of transfers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or at the very least, he’s operating in a way a club manager might appreciate.There is often tension between club and international coaches over players who aren’t entirely fit. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick was understandably upset when his teenage prodigy Lamine Yamal was reportedly called up to Spainin spite of an injury,injected with a painkiller and reportedly made to play against his wishes, only to return to the club with the injury aggravated.Then again, he’s also behaving like an international manager with the luxury of considering something beyond the short term. The US, after all, qualified for the World Cup automatically. And in his efforts to build depth and consider the players’ workload over an 18-month period – from his appointment through the World Cup – Pochettino has had the freedom, and relative absence of pressure, to worry about more than merely winning the next match.At times it’s paid off. Pochettino let Christian Pulisic sit out the summer (though not without some controversy), and the player has gotten off to a blazing start to the Serie A season. He is now the league’s leading scorer, helping Milan to first place through five rounds.“I think we can say that he is the most important player now for the national team,” Pochettino said of Pulisic on Thursday.Correlation might not be causation here, but chances are the time off helped refresh him and may well pay dividends for the US next summer. This is a calculation that Pochettino has made, that it’s better to manage his players than to assemble the full A-team at all times, no matter the issues that may ensue downstream.“We are preparing the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “We are not only preparing these two games.”Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

He doubled over in pain on the sidelines and appeared to have trouble breathing as he coped with cramp. He was also limping earlier in the game after absorbing several blows, including a big hit from Byron Young during the third quarter.“That’s what happens when you don’t practice for a couple of weeks so that’s my fault,” said Jones with a smile after the game. “I’m really proud of the defense, they played great.”Los Angeles marched down the field, and facing fourth-and-one at the San Francisco 11, coach Sean McVay elected to go for it. Marques Sigle and Deommodore Lenoir got credit for smothering Williams well short of the first down.Matthew Stafford passed for 389 yards and three touchdowns for the Rams, who lost despite racking up 319 yards after halftime. Los Angeles also had an extra point blocked, missed a field goal and fumbled twice deep in 49ers territory.Purdy sat out for the third time in four games with a toe injury. San Francisco also played without defensive star Nick Bosa, injured receivers Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall and tight end George Kittle – but Jones, Christian McCaffrey and a fired-up defense did just enough to reassert the Niners’ dominance in this matchup. McCaffrey had 139 scrimmage yards (57 rushing, 82 receiving) plus a touchdown for the 49ers.The game was another memorable edition of the California rivalry that has mostly tilted in the Niners’ favor since Kyle Shanahan and McVay got their jobs a month apart in 2017. San Francisco won nine of 10 from 2019 to 2023, losing only in a thrilling NFC championship game, before the Rams won the past three against a less-than-full-strength Niners roster.Explore more on these topicsNFLSan Francisco 49ersLos Angeles RamsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

His next target will be his second and third GM norms, and with them Abhimanyu Mishra’s world record as the youngest ever GM, within the next four months or so. He already has the World Cup in Goa, the European Club Cup in Greece, and a closed tournament in Argentina lined up.Mishra had made heavy weather of it in 2021, needing five tournaments in the US and eight in Budapest before he broke Sergey Karjakin’s 2002 record, and this brought significant norm factory ­criticism. However, that all changed last month when Mishra, now 16, proved himself the real deal by almost qualifying for the 2026 Candidates at the Grand Swiss in Samarkand.View image in fullscreen3992:Heikki Westerinen v Gudmundur Sigurjónsson, New York 1977.

Hence the portents for Oro’s eventual status in the chess pantheon are bright.Oro has strong PR support, and that could please chess media looking for a global role model when Carlsen, who has just become the father of a baby boy, eventually retires. Oro has a short and easily memorable surname, which counts for something when his actual and potential rivals include Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Ian Nepomniachtchi and the new Russian talent Roman Shogdzhiev.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the neutral it was a good draw and a high level of quality from both teams.”Manchester United v Chelsea: Women’s Super League – liveRead moreThe quality level certainly was high and for a game played between the teams with the two best defensive records in the WSL last term, and which had conceded the fewest goals this season before kick-off, the game began in a surprisingly open fashion as both attacked early on. The contest opened at such a fast pace that it could easily have been 2-2 inside the first six minutes, with Hannah Hampton saving with her feet from Elisabeth Terland, Catarina Macario’s effort being blocked by Maya Le Tissier, Jess Park firing narrowly over the crossbar and then Aggie Beever‑Jones following suit when she seemed certain to score.Chelsea did then provide the goal that the early flurry of attacks had threatened, as Wieke Kaptein met Macario’s clever back-heeled pass and slotted in a neat, clinical finish low into the corner, as the hosts conceded a league goal for only the second time this season.Manchester United had lost 10 of their previous 11 WSL meetings with Chelsea, but this confident version of Skinner’s team were unwilling to roll over. Inspired by the dribbling of Park, who seemed determined to skip her way past as many defenders as possible and was the driving force of her team’s adventurous play, they continued to create chances and they were soon level when Anna Sandberg scored her first goal for the club. She could hardly have caught her strike any sweeter, angling her foot perfectly over the ball to arrow a half-volley powerfully past Hampton from just outside the area.View image in fullscreenWieke Kaptein gave Chelsea an early lead.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockIt was Park that drew Skinner’s highest praise after the game as he said: “She’s electric. She twists, she turns. She was incredible. I think her and Tooney [Ella Toone] have brought each other to life.”The game was played amid Storm Amy, which brought swirling rain and gusts of wind, and started with a minute’s silence after the terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester on Thursday, with the home side also wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. This was the ground where Chelsea clinched last season’s title, but this looks like a much improved United team and they continued to threaten in the second half, with Fridolina Rolfö’s deflected effort looping on to the top of the bar before Park’s swerving effort flew narrowly over. Melvine Malard, on as a substitute, dragged a low shot wide with 21 minutes remaining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They had suffered in the wind and rain only to take the lead through Ryan Sessegnon’s well-crafted goal. Silva’s substitutions had turned the game in Fulham’s favour, Samuel Chukwueze combining with Sessegnon almost as soon as he arrived into a pitched battle of a contest.Step forward Antoine Semenyo, one of the Premier League’s players of the season so far. His slaloming run down the byline and drop of the shoulder confounded Bernd Leno to score from the narrowest of angles. Next, the Ghanaian sent Justin Kluivert away to smash in a gorgeous long-range strike. Semenyo’s injury-time second, from a trademark warp-speed counter, supplied by another sub in Ben Gannon-Doak, completed a sweet home win. Bournemouth climbed tosecond in the table, only Liverpool above them. Just when Fulham were set for fourth time lucky they were denied by Iraola’s expert in-game management, greater depth of resources and a match-winner in Semenyo.Premier League team news: predicted lineups for the weekend actionRead more“He is incredible,” said Kluivert, no slouch himself, of Semenyo. “He shows it every game now. He is just world class.”Iraola said: “He has been improving every season, every season he has got better. I make him not look too much at the numbers. If we are playing well collectively, the numbers will arrive.”For a sodden Silva, clad all evening in a light sweater that would have needed to be wrung out because of the inclement conditions, his kingdom for a striker. An injury crisis among his centre-forwards meant Josh King, Fulham’s shining star this season, was pushed into an unfamiliar, withdrawn striker/false 9 role unsuited to the teenager’s skill set at this early stage. “This moment of the season is very difficult for us,” Silva said.Despite the elite’s asset-stripping of last season’s team, Iraola’s squad is now more robust. His changes when chasing the game provided testament. “We have lost some important players but we have connected well since the start of the season,” Semenyo said. “It has been a great start and a great environment to be part of.”Second-half substitutes Ryan Christie, Kluivert and Alejandro Jiménez each arrived to play a part in Bournemouth’s decisive, deadly acceleration away from Fulham. The Basque manager’s brand of high-pressing football will cause wear and tear, and where last winter Bournemouth could barely field a team, he currently has the luxury of rotation and tactical switches. The results so far are almost as glowing as his reputation. “When you are losing, you have to try to change the game,” said Iraola.View image in fullscreenJustin Kluivert scores Bournemouth’s second goal.Photograph: Ian Walton/ReutersAt Bournemouth last season a clerical error meant Fulham subbed the wrong player – Sessegnon rather than Sasa Lukic. Silva did not contain his rage when the latter suffered an early muscle injury. His team’s inability to hold the ball in the first half further darkened his mood. “We had moments to punish them and missed the last pass,” said Silva.Bournemouth were equally blunted, as can happen with a team whose best football comes when Iraola’s players build to crescendos. There can be flat spots. Amid night air filled with drizzle courtesy of Storm Amy, there was frustration. Evanilson, Bournemouth’s striker, struggled for supply. A half of three shots on target, Alex Iwobi scuffing the last, ground to a soggy, merciful halt. “Not a lot was happening,” shrugged Iraola.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Things could only get better? Certainly. When Evanilson’s flying volley hit the side-netting, he inadvertently triggered the Vitality video screens into errant goal celebrations. Real excitement would come soon enough.Jiménez and Kluivert arrived on 60 minutes, Iraola asking the Milan loanee to overlap from right-back, Kluivert to get closer to Evanilson than Marcus Tavernier, who had departed. Silva’s fresh arrivals were the summer additions Kevin and Chukwueze.Did we need to talk about Kevin? It was Chukwueze’s smart exchange with Sessegnon that broke the deadlock. “The 1-0 was a great collective goal from us and then after two individual moments they decide the game,” said Silva.Iraola’s response was to gamble again, take off defensive-minded players in Marcos Senesi and Tyler Adams, and replace them with Gannon-Doak and Christie. “You have to take a risk, there is no other option,” he said. That fresh injection of the talent his squad continue to boast set the stage for Semenyo to further Bournemouth’s rise.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

United have won two of their opening seven matches in the current campaign, which includes aCarabao Cup exit at Grimsby, and theirdefeat by Brentford last Saturdayextended Amorim’s search for his first back-to-back league victories since arriving 11 months ago. Sunderland visit Old Trafford on Saturday and another defeat would put Amorim under greater scrutiny.Time to be brave: the tactical tweaks Amorim needs to make at Manchester United | Daniel HarrisRead moreAmorim, asked whether he would consider resigning, said: “No, that is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard, not to create the momentum. It’s so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, something happens. That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here. But that is not my decision and I think it would be really hard to leave if I don’t do everything to follow my career here.“It’s a dream to be here and I want to continue here and I want to fight for this. But the problem is now what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job. You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don’t have that feeling.”The 40-year-old also launched an impassioned defence of his 3-4-3 system, which has been the focus of much criticism. Amorim has used the formation in every game and it is yet to provide the consistency craved.“Nobody here is naive,” Amorim said. “We understand that we need results to continue the project. We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it’s hard, the balance is really hard. What I want is to see my team – winning or losing – playing the same way and we are not doing that.”Amorim pointed out that United had played in different systems under previous managers, also without success. “We need to play the same way, with the same power, with the same intensity, with the same focus. If we do that, it doesn’t matter what the system is.”He confirmed plans to play lucrative mid-season friendlies to help boost funds lost by not qualifying for Europe. “We have to do it and we knew it when we miss Europe,” he said. “We have our fans and our budget and we want to be with our fans around the world.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In this moment we have four or five defenders out, but we’re going to try to adapt and find the right solution.“It is difficult, but at the same time we trust the ones that are here.For sure, when you can change one player after four or five games, it’s better. The more you play together with teammates, the relationship becomes better. Sometimes you don’t even need to speak to do something on the pitch – they understand immediately. When you continue to change it’s more difficult.“But I really trust the young players. Not just the young players that we buy but also the young players from the academy. We gave games last year to Josh so that shows that I trust young players.”Maresca was on less sure ground when claiming to be unconcerned by Chelsea’s disciplinary record, with João Pedro’s sending-off in theirChampions League win over Benficathis week their third red card in as many matches after Chalobah’s dismissal and Robert Sánchez’s in the defeatat Manchester United.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When it’s a red card for bad intention or for bad discipline, it’s different compared to the United red card or the Brighton red card. In that case, it’s just a decision that you have to take in two seconds, three seconds. Do I do foul or not? It’s difficult.”Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

Yet that loyalty caused an inevitable stir when he decided not to restore some of his ­biggest creative talents on Friday. There was no place for ­Bellingham, who has started only once for Real Madrid this season, and no return for Phil Foden despite the attacker’s resurgence at Manchester City.Tuchel was partially able to put Bellingham’s absence down to ­fitness. However, it was clear to the German that the Madrid midfielder wanted to be called up when the pair spoke on the phone. Tuchel apologised to Bellingham in August for saying that the player’s “edge” can come across in a waythat “can be a bit repulsive”. This time Tuchel was keen to stress there is no problem between him and the 22-year-old but he came ready to defend the omission of England’s player of the year for 2024-25.Quick GuideEngland squadShowGoalkeepers: Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), James Trafford (Manchester City)Defenders: Dan Burn (Newcastle United), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal), Jarell Quansah (Bayer Leverkusen), Djed Spence (Tottenham Hotspur), John Stones (Manchester City)Midfielders: Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest), Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest), Jordan Henderson (Brentford), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Milan), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa)Forwards: Jarrod Bowen (West Ham United), Eberechi Eze (Arsenal), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle United), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Marcus Rashford (Barcelona, loan from Manchester United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We’re building the best team,” said Tuchel, who was even more forthright when it was put to him that sides who win the World Cup tend to pick their most dangerous ­forwards. “Do you have proof of that?” he said. “It doesn’t count what we did in the last camp? I have proof that last camp was our best camp. I stick with the squad.”Tuchel believes the win over ­Serbia provided enough evidence not to pick Bellingham and Foden. ­Everton’s Jack Grealish was also left out.“Don’t you think that ­behaviour on the bench, support from the bench, support from training, the ­competition, the ­togetherness ­enables the 11 to play like they played?” he said. “I strongly believe that. I felt it in ­Belgrade, behind me on the bench. It’s not against Phil, it’s not against Jack, it’s not against Jude. Even if you can turn it around and say it is, it is not. It is for the guys who were in camp and who performed at this kind of level.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Bukayo Saka celebrates with Martin Ødegaard after scoring against Olympiakos.Photograph: Nigel French/Getty Images/AllstarTuchel indicated that the ­situation might have been the same if ­Bellingham was fully fit. “It would have been a different basis, but it could have been the same ­outcome,” he said. Emphasising he has no ­personal issue with Bellingham, he said: “To make it fully clear, we can have the same harmony, the same level of performance with him.”England have plenty of options at No 10 – Morgan Rogers excelled against Serbia, Eberechi Eze and Morgan Gibbs-White have retained their spots – and Tuchel pointed out he had to reward those who have proved themselves to him.“What would be my ­explanation to leave them out and also be ­authentic in my words?” he said. “After the ­Serbia match I went into the dressing room and I told them what I told you. Imagine then I have a phone call and leave four ­players out. What would you think as a player? For credibility as a coach you need to walk the talk.”The only change was enforced, the injured Madueke dropping out for Saka, who has recovered from a ­hamstring strain. Tuchel, who insisted this squad should not ­automatically be read as a sign of his intentions for next summer’s World Cup, is keeping his players on their toes. He said there was a chance Saka would have missed out if Madueke were fit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palmer has been unavailable for five of the past seven England camps, raising the prospect of him falling out of Tuchel’s plans given that there are only two camps before the World Cup after this month. Tuchel said he did not expect Palmer to play for Chelsea against Nottingham Forest on 18 October.Tuchel says he’ll be ‘brave’ enough to omit big names if it’s right for EnglandRead moreTuchel did not name a direct replacement at full-back for the injured Tino Livramento. John Stones is back at centre-back after pulling out last month. Tuchel spoke to Foden, Grealish, Adam Wharton, Trevoh Chalobah and Curtis Jones about leaving them out but did not call Burnley’s Kyle Walker about his second consecutive omission.Tuchel said he was in favour of England’s games at the World Cup kicking off as late as possible because of concerns over heat in Canada, Mexico and the US, even though fixtures starting in the small hours or middle of the night in the UK would cause complications for domestic supporters and broadcasters.“I know the fans will not like it but for us it’s better if we play later,” Tuchel said. “For everyone it’s better to play later. If you do a run at 2pm in Charlotte then you know. We have put the players first. The players are the game and we have to protect the game.“Midnight here, I understand that it’s bad for our fans, it’s bad for the children, bad for the young people who go to school, very bad.

West Ham have been short of leadership and there is an acceptance in the squad that they played a part in Potter losing his job after eight months.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“I find a nice group of people,” Nuno said. “They are starting to realise that we have to change things. If we don’t change, things will be the same. They are willing to change. I can see it. So let’s embrace it and let’s change it.“It goes from technical, tactical, physical, mentality, respect, communication. Communication is such an important tool for us. We still don’t have it fully. It has to be a fair and clear communication that we share. They have accounted themselves responsible and are willing to go.”Nuno has hadlittle time to adjust. He does not have his backroom staff yet and the former Nottingham Forest manager is not thinking about what West Ham, 19th before visiting Arsenal on Saturday, can achieve this season. “My task is simple,” Nuno said. “It’s tomorrow.”A big concern for Nuno is improving his side’s defending at set pieces. West Ham have shipped eight goals from corners this season – the latest concession came in Nuno’s first game, Monday’s1-1 draw at Everton– and will be under sustained pressure from dead balls against Arsenal. The worry for Nuno is that it becomes a psychological issue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot is forgotten about the opening six months of Nuno’s tenure, when the team survived one place above the relegation zone and went through a period of winning once in 10 Premier League matches.Nuno had done the important thing of boosting morale and winning over the fans by defeating Newcastle away and creating excitement bybeating Manchester United at home, and no one was clamouring for style points. The City Ground was rocking in late December 2023, and no home fans cared too much that they saw only two more victories there for the remainder of the season.Nottingham Forest fans call for Postecoglou axe after 23 days following European defeatRead moreAnge Postecoglou is yet to taste success, becoming the first Forest head coach in a century to fail to win any of their first six games. There was a poisonous atmosphere at the City Ground on Thursday night as they succumbed to the second-best team in Denmark. When supporters are calling for your sacking after 23 days, it is fair to say things are not going well. On Friday there were no plans to dismiss Postecoglou but a defeat at Newcastle on Sunday could cost him his job.Everyone at the club accepted there would be a period of transition because the Australian’s style of play is almost a polar opposite to the one Nuno finely tuned there. The plan was evolving under the Portuguese but not at the speed Postecoglou is trying to implement.Starting with four away games was always going to be a difficult ask for Postecoglou. Opening at Arsenal meant building momentum from the first whistle was unlikely butlosing at Swansea in the Carabao Cupand drawing at Burnley put him on the back foot. The game at Real Betis appeared to be a turning point because the performance was impressive and fitting of expectations regarding Postecoglou’s style. The processes were correct and, but for a late Antony goal, takeoff would have commenced.Instead Forest remain grounded. If Postecoglou could have been forgiven for the away results, losing at home to Sunderland and Midtjylland was not part of the thinking. There was a degree of mitigation in the first City Ground defeat: a generous free-kick award that led to the winner and appalling finishing from Forest meant the points went back to the north‑east. Forest had almost two‑thirds of possession and 22 shots but outscoring an opponent on xG is meaningless.View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou and Neco Williams will want to turn Nottingham Forest’s fortunes around at Newcastle on Sunday.Photograph: Getty Images/Sportsphoto/AllstarThere was a hope that once the strikers found form, everything would be fine but poor finishing is only one of the problems facing Postecoglou. The robust defensive unit built by Nuno has been dismantled, leaving Postecoglou awaiting a clean sheet. Defending set pieces has been a problem, two of Midtjylland’s goals coming from them, and the other goal Forest conceded was from a counterattack, the sort that were a regular feature during Postecoglou’s time at Tottenham.Postecoglou was eager to return to work quickly after being sacked by Tottenham, especially with aEuropa League winner’s medalaround his neck. He wanted to prove people wrong and Forest offered that opportunity, with the added bonus of being in the competition he had won in May. The Greek connection with Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, helped make the appointment smooth and Postecoglou, despite his critics, does have the credentials required – but pragmatism was not likely to be involved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Finishing seventh and taking Forest into Europe made Nuno incredibly popular. Despite his complaints, a squad capable of finishing in the top half was assembled and plenty of money was spent. After far too much short-termism at Forest, they had a clear long-term vision and strategy, which included a team that suited Nuno. Now it feels as if a stepdad has moved into the house and the children are not happy.Trips to Newcastle and Bournemouth bookend the visit of Chelsea in the next three league games, suggesting life is only going to get harder. Marinakis made the appointment with his heart and is desperately hoping to avoid another sacking because removing Postecoglou would be an admission that he made two dreadful decisions in dismissing Nuno and selecting the replacement.Football is one big popularity contest and Nuno started winning his at St James’ Park. Postecoglou needs to do the same or he risks losing his for good.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestAnge PostecogloufeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, in the end, there was an all too familiar outcome to a bristling derby as the reigningSuper Leaguechampions moved to a place in the Grand Final and the verge of yet more history.Wigan Warriors’ stunned the rugby league world on Wednesday morning with a statement alleging that the Leigh Leopards’ owner, Derek Beaumont, wanted to withdraw from this game in a row over ticket allocations, merely adding an extra layer of intrigue to the playoff semi-final.Wigan v Leigh Super League semi-final set to go ahead after ticket allocation furoreRead moreHowever, the Leopards shrugged off any controversy surrounding their owner to play their part in a thrilling semi-final that never really looked settled or decided until the final moments. However, what this Warriors side are so good at is producing their best rugby in the biggest moments. That proved again to be the case on Friday night.Leigh were much the stronger of the two sides in the opening quarter and, roared on by nearly 5,000 away supporters, would have been quietly confident it would be them progressing to Old Trafford for the first time. However, led by the impeccable Bevan French and Jai Field, Wigan edged the critical moments on the night in appalling weather conditions to make it three Grand Finals in a row, and move the Warriors to within one game of a third straight league title.They have not quite hit the same heights this year as they did in 2024, when they clinched an unprecedented four trophies. But whether it is Hull KR or St Helens who emerge from Saturday’s second semi-final, they will not fancy the prospect of ending this era of dominance from Matt Peet and his men.View image in fullscreenWigan’s Patrick Mago (centre) attempts to get past Leigh Leopards’ Jack Hughes (left) and Owen Trout during the Super League playoff semi-final.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA“There’s a common trait at this time of the year where we really tighten things up,” Peet said after watching his side record their sixth straight win.Having been second best for large stretches of the opening quarter, they were able to go ahead against the run of play when an error from the Leopards allowed Adam Keighran to collect a loose ball and feed French, who slid over unopposed to break the deadlock.You wondered if Leigh’s heads would drop at that stage but, instead, they came back strong again. They deservedly levelled proceedings when Edwin Ipape’s superb pass put Robbie Mulhern through from short range by the Wigan posts to make it 6-6. But in truth this semi-final was decided in the two minutes before half-time.Ipape took French out off the ball to hand Keighran a simple opportunity to make it 8-6 in favour of the Warriors. Then, with seconds remaining of the half, Wigan broke from deep courtesy of Field and French – undisputedly Super League’s best player – did the rest. Suddenly, a game that had been 6-6 was 14-6 in favour of the champions. It was a seismic couple of minutes.Quick GuideWigan 18-6 Leigh teams and scorersShowWiganField; Miski, Keighran, Wardle, Marshall; French, Smith; Byrne, O’Neill, Thompson, Walters, Farrell, Ellis.InterchangeHavard, Nsemba, Mago, Leeming.TriesFrench 2, Walters.GoalsKeighran 3.LeighHodgson; Brand, Hanley, Niu, Charnley; O’Brien, Lam; Ofahengaue, Ipape, Mulhern, Halton, Trout, Liu.InterchangeHughes, Tuitavake, Davis, Dwyer.TryMulhern.GoalO’Brien.RefereeChris Kendall.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The key moment in the game is the Ipape penalty and that set after,” the Leigh coach, Adrian Lam, said. “Those two minutes broke my heart.”Lam insisted the saga in the week concerning his owner did not affect the buildup of his players and their performance, and the effort that his side produced, would certainly back up that assertion.But you always felt they had to score first after half-time to stand any chance and they were not able to break down the Warriors again. But goodness, they came close. With 15 minutes remaining, Owen Trout was freed and seemed destined to score but for a world class tackle from Field to deny him.It was another of those critical moments in a big game that the Warriors always seem to be on the right side of and it took the wind from Leigh’s sails.The Warriors were then able to close out a victory with minimal fuss and they were even able to score a third try after the hooter as French – who else? – provided a stunning pass for Sam Walters to stroll over from close range. Nobody would back against this side making it three titles in a row next Saturday.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueWigan WarriorsLeigh LeopardsRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

At long last their long-awaited stadium redevelopment looks likely to happen and, on the field, the champions are two from two after the first couple of weekends. With Finn Russell due back in action next week to pick up the fly-half baton, it is going to take a seriously good side to steal their crown.On a wet and windy night in Somerset, even so, they were made to work extremely hard for it by a stubbornSaleteam who stuck in the fight and refused to go away. It was only with three minutes left that Max Ojomoh slid in to score his side’s bonus-point try and maintain his squad’s perfect start to the campaign.This was Sale’s fourth successive loss on their opponents’ ground and the manner of it was largely familiar. Bath make a virtue of squeezing teams in the latter stages of games and, towards the end of a taut final quarter, Ben Spencer’s little chip eventually gave Ojomoh the chance to secure the maximum five points.Bath’s head coach, Johann van Graan, does have some potential injury headaches after Charlie Ewels, Quinn Roux and Ted Hill limped off but he headed home far more satisfied than a frustrated Alex Sanderson, Sale’s director of rugby. “The big rocks are there but small things and poor discipline let them in,” lamented Sanderson. “Against the best teams banging people isn’t enough, is it? You’ve got to be more than that.”There was also plenty to ponder for the watching England head coach, Steve Borthwick, with Ollie Lawrence and Henry Arundell both looking sharp. Sale’s Nathan Jibulu claimed a second-half try and is clearly a young player on the rise while the generalship and kicking accuracy of the composed George Ford stood out in testing conditions.View image in fullscreenGeorge Ford stood out for the visitors despite the loss.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockIt was another of those sodden nights when a roof on the open temporary stand would have spared its soaking inhabitants. Their tickets can still cost £100 but a reprieve is finally on the horizon. After decades of arguing, planning permission has been given for an 18,000-capacity stadium, with both Unesco and the secretary of state having given the decision their blessing.That merely leaves Bath awaiting formal signed approval which the club hope will materialise within a couple of months. And as and when Bath do finally have their own riverside palace to complement their extraordinary squad depth, life is going to become no easier for future visitors.Not that Sale were in any mood to be intimidated in a physical if slightly staccato first half. Their scrum was strong throughout but Bath dug in and registered the game’s first try. Just when Sale were threatening they were unzipped down the left by Lawrence before the speedy Arundell whizzed around Tom O’Flaherty to score his first home Prem try for his childhood club.It was to be the story of the half; encouraging visiting flashes only for Bath to strike with devastating effect. The game was still less than 30 minutes old when they scored again, Miles Reid slicing clear from a home lineout and feeding Cameron Redpath on his inside to finish exuberantly.Luckily Sale still had the outstanding Ford to keep them in touch via a finely judged penalty and a smart drop-goal and the England No 10 then nailed another inch-perfect drop before Beno Obano, from close range, claimed Bath’s third try with Sale’s skipper, Ernst van Rhyn, absent in the sin-bin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a credit to Sale’s resolve, then, when they worked Jibulu over from close range just seven minutes after the restart to puncture any home complacency.Usually that is the signal for Bath to shift up a couple of gears but this time the Sharks were forewarned. They made their own raft of changes and, at 21-16, it required a stunning tackle from Sam Underhill to halt the seriously hard running Marius Louw. A massive hit by Tom Burrow also forced Hill to leave the field prematurely but where it really counted, up on the scoreboard, Bath always find a way these days.

The governing body’s position on the women’s competition is less clear, as it has received contradictory information from R360 over when it will take place.While the inaugural competition is due to start next October, in 2027 a longer R360 has been scheduled to begin in April in a direct clash with the women’s Six Nations Championship. The RFU will not permit any of its 32 centrally contracted England women’s players to miss the Six Nations, but with R360 reputedly offering six-figure salaries to several Red Roses stars an accommodation could be reached if a clash is avoided.The potential for division among John Mitchell’sWorld Cup-winning squadpresents a major problem for the RFU, and the money on offer may force it to be more flexible. The first R360 tournament next year is due to feature four women’s teams and eight men’s sides, with the first matches planned for 2 October 2026.R360 are aiming to avoid a clash with the women’s Six Nations as with just four teams the competition will have fewer matches, but have yet to communicate their plans to the RFU or other unions.A spokesperson for R360 said: “Our ambition is for every player to play in R360 and be able to represent their country if selected, which is why we have built the series to avoid clashing with international windows and look forward to publishing the specific schedule that makes that clear for men’s and women’s teams in due course.”The RFU’s approach to the men’s competition is more straightforward in a significant boost to the Prem clubs, who are vulnerable given the startup is offering players multiples of the salaries they receive in the domestic game for less than half the matches.The inability to combine moving to the new global franchise tournament with an international career could have a major impact on R360’s recruitment plans. R360 is understood to have signed pre-contract agreements with more than 200 players, 80% of whom have played international rugby in the past two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While IPRA representatives held talks with R360 during the British and Irish Lions tour last summer, their statement to members characterised the discussions as a fact-finding mission.“In recent months, various information has been in the public domain about the proposed R360 competition and we understand that more recently, a proposed draft long-form player contract may have been circulated by R360 to players and/or player agents,” the statement read. “Whilst IRPA and IRPA members have had some discussions with R360 representatives, these conversations have been focused on fact-finding to understand the substantive detail about the business model, the competition, its delivery and its interplay with the existing ecosystem.“Detailed information about the competition remains outstanding and the competition does not currently have World Rugby regulatory approval. IRPA wishes to confirm that the competition and any associated player contracts are not endorsed by IRPA or IRPA members, and references to IRPA within any contract does not have IRPA permission.”R360 is yet to be approved by World Rugby, with the Guardian revealing last month that it hadwithdrawn a planned application in September. Plans are due to be resubmitted next June, but sources have indicated that the competition will launch next year regardless of whether they receive formal approval.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

For three of the accounts the sexualised searches were suggested immediately.After a “small number of clicks” the researchers encountered pornographic content ranging from women flashing to penetrative sex. Global Witness said the content attempted to evade moderation, usually by showing the clip within an innocuous picture or video. For one account the process took two clicks after logging on: one click on the search bar and then one on the suggested search.Global Witness, a climate organisation whose remit includes investigating big tech’s impact on human rights, said it conducted two batches of tests, with one set before the implementation ofchild protection rulesunder the UK’sOnline Safety Act(OSA) on 25 July and another after.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The incident involved four passengers who were in the vehicle when it hit a tree and caught on fire in a quiet Bay Area town inCalifornia, according to court documents.Only one of the crash victims survived.The suit, filed Thursday in Alameda county superior court, is being brought by the family of Krysta Tsukahara, a 19-year-old college student who was visiting her family over Thanksgiving weekend in Piedmont, California, when the crash occurred. The incident happened on the night of 27 November 2024, when the Cybertruck was traveling at high speed, struck a tree and ignited, according to aCalifornia highway patrol report. When power to the truck’s electric doors was shut down by the fire, the four passengers were locked inside with no way out.The lawsuit alleges the design of the Cybertruck’s door handles is at fault for Tsukahara’s death. From the inside of the truck, when electricity is cut off, the only way to exit a rear door is by pulling a cable that’s underneath a pocket liner under the door’s storage compartment, according to areport by Bloomberg. From outside the vehicle, the doors also remain locked and the flush handles make it difficult for rescue workers to jimmy their way inside.Tesla did not return request for comment.“The design of this vehicle failed Krysta,” said Roger Dreyer, the attorney representing the Tsukahara family. “There was no functioning, accessible manual override or emergency release for her to escape.”Tesla’s door handles are a flagship design for the vehicles and a point of pride for company CEO,Elon Musk. Teslas were the first make of car to be customized with such electric handles and are built to be flush with the body of the car to give the vehicles a more sleek and streamlined look. But the design has invited scrutiny from car-safety experts and currently isunder investigationby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.“Tesla had repeated and direct notice that its reliance on electronic door systems created a serious risk of entrapment,” reads the suit. “Owners, bystanders, and first responders documented instances where Tesla occupants survived crash forces but could not escape when electrical power failed and fire ensued.”Tesla vehicle deliveries spike after several quarters of declineRead moreThe Cybertruck has received high safety ratings in crash tests, but the vehicle has also received eight recalls since it first debuted less than two years ago. Tesla has been embroiled in other lawsuits over vehicle safety, including one in Florida where a jury ruled in August that Tesla must pay $243m in damages over its driver assistance system, known as Autopilot.Tsukahara’s family is alsosuing the estate of the driver, Soren Dixon, who at the time of the incident was under the influence of alcohol, cocaine and amphetamines, according to a coroner’s report from Alameda county. Dixon also died in the crash.On the night of the accident, a friend was following the Cybertruck in another vehicle and saw what happened, according to various news reports. He rushed to try to save his friends, breaking a window on the Cybertruck. He was able to save one passenger, but when he attempted to rescue Tsukahara she wasn’t able to make it through the fire.The lawsuit filed on Thursday alleges that Tsukahara didn’t suffer physical trauma from the Cybertruck’s collision with the tree, but rather she died of smoke inhalation and burns because she wasn’t able to escape the vehicle.“Her death was preventable,” Tsukahara’s parents,Carl and Noelle Tsukahara,said in a statement. “She was alive after the crash. She called out for help. And she couldn’t get out.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsTeslaCaliforniaWest CoastLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Although, truth be told, her expectations were low.Nevertheless, when she got the call, she says: “I was so overtaken by how responsive she was. It was impressive for a robot.”“She’d always ask ‘how you are today?’ and that gives you an opportunity if you’re feeling sick to say you felt sick, or I just say ‘I’m fine, thank you’.”“She would go on to ask questions – ‘have you had a chance to step outside today?’”Aida would also ask what Rolls had planned for the day and “she would respond to that properly”.“If I would say I’m going shopping, she’d say nice shopping or food shopping? I found it entertaining.”Bots easing the administrative burdenThe trial, which has now wrapped up its first phase, is one of the ways in which advances in artificial intelligence are being taken up in healthcare.Digital health company Healthily approached St Vincent’s about the trial to use its generative AI technology to provide social interaction, as well as an opportunity for home care clients to log any health issues or concerns for a staff member to follow up.Dean Jones, national director of St Vincent’s At Home, says the service being trialled does not replace any face to face interactions.“Clients still receive a weekly face to face meeting, but between these meetings … the [AI] system allows a daily check-in, which can then escalate any potential concerns to either our team or a client’s family,” Jones says.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailDr Tina Campbell, the managing director of Healthily, says there haven’t been any adverse incidents reported from the St Vincent’s trial.The company uses open AI “with very clear guardrails and prompts” to ensure the conversation is safe and mechanisms are in place to respond to serious health issues quickly, Campbell says. For example, if a client is experiencing chest pains, it would be flagged with the care team and the call ended so the person could dial triple zero.Newsroom edition: the battle to regulate AI - podcastRead moreCampbell believes AI has an important role amid significant workforce challenges across the healthcare sector.“What we can do very safely, with technology like this, is reduce the admin burden on the workforce so qualified health professionals can focus on doing the job that they’re trained to do,” she says.AI not as new as you might thinkProf Enrico Coiera, the founder of the Australian Alliance for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, says older forms of artificial intelligence have been a standard part of healthcare for a long time, often in “back office services” such as interpreting medical images, cardiograms and pathology test results.“Any computer program that carries out a task that involves decision making in some way is AI, irrespective of how it achieves that,” says Coiera, who is also the director of the Centre for Health Informatics at Macquarie University.“If you go to the imaging department, radiology department or pathology lab, you’ll see programs in machines doing just that.”Over the past decade, newer forms of AI known as “deep learning” – a neural network method that allows algorithms to learn from very large sets of data – have been used to interpret medical imaging and improve diagnosis, Coiera says.In November, BreastScreen NSW became Australia’sfirst population-based screening program to introduce machine reading technologyto support radiologists in interpreting a select range of mammography images.They are specialised tools that still require a specialist doctor to interpret the diagnosis they might suggest, and the responsibility for a medical decision sits with the medical practitioner, Coiera says.AI’s role in identifying illness earlyThe Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne has been collaborating with researchers from UCL London whofirst developed AI methods to detect epilepsy brain abnormalitiescalled focal cortical dysplasias from MRI images.These lesions cause seizures that often cannot be controlled with medication, meaning surgery to remove them becomes the only treatment available. However, the surgery can only be performed if the doctors can locate the abnormal tissue.In researchpublished this week in the journal Epilepsia, a team from the institute, led by neurologist Emma Macdonald-Laurs, showed their “AI epilepsy detective” could detect the lesions in up to 94% of cases from MRI and PET scans in a subtype of the lesions that have traditionally been missed in more than half of cases (60%).New NDIS needs assessments will use technology to simplify process but advocacy groups cautious about changeRead moreThe AI was trained on the scans of 54 patients and then tested on 17 children and 12 adults. Of the 17 children, 12 had surgery and 11 are now seizure free.The tool uses neural network classifiers similar to the breast cancer screening – highlighting regions of abnormality, which are still checked by experts “but it makes it a lot quicker to get to the answers”, Macdonald-Laurs says.She emphasises the researchers are still in the “early phases” of the work, with a further study necessary to get the technology heading towards clinical implementation.Prof Mark Cook, a neurologist who was not involved in the study, says MRI scans now generate such huge amounts of high-resolution data that it is hard for a human to go through it accurately. So for doctors the challenge of finding these lesions was like “identifying the needle in the haystack”.“It’s a great demonstration of how AI can support clinicians in making earlier, more accurate diagnoses, and has the potential to improve surgical access and outcomes for kids with otherwise intractable epilepsy,” Cook says.Disease detection in the futureDr Stefan Buttigieg, the vice-president of the European Public Health Association’s digital health and artificial intelligence section, says deep neural networks are also helping to monitor and predict disease outbreaks.Buttigieg, who spoke last month at the Public Health of Australia’s conference in Wollongong, gave as an example Blue Dot, a company set up by infectious disease specialists and which was one of the first organisations to detect the Covid-19 outbreak.Generative AI is a further subset of deep learning, in which the technology can generate new content based on training data. These uses in healthcare include programs such as Healthily’s AI voice bot as well as the AI scribes doctors and allied health professionals are increasingly using.Dr Michael Wright, the president of the Royal Australian College of GPs, says GPs have been embracing AI scribes, which records the consultation and turns into a consultation note that can be added to the patient record.Wright says the main benefit of the scribes is that it improves the quality of the interaction between the doctor and patient.Dr Danielle McMullen, the president of the Australian Medical Association, agrees that scribes are helping doctors optimise their time and says AI also has the potential to help doctors avoid duplication of tests and scans for their patients, if thepromised digitisation of health records eventuates.Buttigieg says one of the biggest potentials of AI is to deliver increasingly personalised healthcare.“For many years healthcare was delivered using tools and solutions that are one-size fits-all – so, for example, things like drugs – but now we are looking towards the future where there are more refined solutions, and the same needs to happen with AI,” Buttigieg says.View image in fullscreenResearchers are working on using AI to help analyse data from MRI scans to find lesions in the brain.Photograph: Carly Earl/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsHealthArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

In 1939 he read Prolonging Life, a pamphlet promising a lifespan of 150 years, by Aleksandr Bogomolets, a haematologist famous for his rapid-healing serums and blood transfusion methods.Bogomolets promised to prolong life with cytotoxic proteins, herbs and transfusions of young blood. Stalin made him a Hero of Socialist Labour and gave him generous research funding, but was dismayed when he died aged 64 in 1946 (this was hardly Bogomolets’s fault – as a boy in Tsarist times, he visited his mother, a revolutionary serving a sentence of hard labour in a Siberian prison, and caught tuberculosis).Donald RayfieldEmeritus professor, Queen Mary University of LondonAleks Krotoski says dictators and US techno-billionaires are striving for immortality. They should read After Many a Summer byAldous Huxley, a novel about a Hollywood millionaire who tries to achieve immortality, but regresses to an ape‑like creature in the process.The book is partly seen as reflecting science showing that embryo development takes a foetus through stages resembling a worm, a fish, a tailed rodent-like creature etc. Hence returning an adult human body to a younger stage might reverse this evolutionary process. But the book has also been seen as reflecting the narcissistic obsession with eternal youth in the US that Huxley had moved to.So has anything changed in the intervening century?

The talent pool was shallow. The contest winner, Kemi Badenoch, said nothing to suggest she was equipped for the challenge of renewing her party as a potential force of government. So it has proved.Mrs Badenoch goes into her first party conference as leader with the Tories in worse shape than they were in a year ago. Their opinion poll rating isconsistently lowerthan the 23.7% they managed under Rishi Sunak in the general election.One MP has defectedto Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. More will follow if they don’t see a route back to power under their current leader.The Tory leader has made her job harder by adopting a shallow, ideologically blinkered analysis of the challenge. She started from the premise that her party had “talked right but governed left” – a perverse revision of history given that she was describing prime ministers who implemented austerity, a hard Brexit, a sequence of increasingly draconian anti-immigration laws and, in the case of Liz Truss, a wild tax-cutting mini-budget that detonated the economy. In no sensible framing of political debate does that count as a legacy of leftwing government.Viewing the Conservative predicament through such a warped lens leads Mrs Badenoch into strategic misjudgments. Since she doesn’t hear anything in radical rightwing rhetoric around Brexit and immigration that might alienate mainstream voters, she has no understanding of why the Liberal Democrats wereable to winscores of seats in what had once been her party’s affluent southern heartlands. Her belief that Britain is suffocating under the dead hand of woke bureaucracy prevents her engaging with the real causes of inadequate public service provision and the role that budget cuts played in voter discontent when her party was in charge.Following a faulty compass in a quest for ideas that might capture public attention naturally leads to terrible policy choices. Hence, for example, this week’s announcement that a Conservative governmentwould repealthe 2008 Climate Change Act. That is a retreat from climate leadership – abandoning Britain’s responsibility and handing the green industrial future, and its economic upside, to other countries. It also signals alignment with a fanatical rightwing agenda associated with Reform UK, and heavily influenced by Donald Trump’s Maga movement, where denial of climate science is rife. Threatening toquitthe European convention on human rights is similarly reckless posturing – trading legal stability and international credibility for cheap nationalist applause.But if Mrs Badenoch wanted to police the boundary between traditional Conservatism and fanatical rightwing demagoguery, she would have disciplined Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, who strikesanti-immigrant posturesthat cross the line into aggressive nationalism and who is obviously angling to replace her at the top of the party. Mr Jenrick undermines his leader’s authority with impunity because she lacks a coherent alternative programme to the craven tribute to Mr Farage that he represents. Mrs Badenoch needs a credible plan to give her party some more worthwhile purpose if she is to stand any chance ofkeeping her jobfor long, let alone leading the Tories into a general election. It is possible. Her record over the past year suggests it is unlikely.Explore more on these topicsConservative conferenceOpinionKemi BadenochNigel FarageImmigration and asylumRobert JenrickReform UKDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Generals need to say somethingFri 3 Oct 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 12.39 EDTShareAt what point will the US’s top military brass decide that enough is enough, that loyalty to the constitution and the rule of law supersedes blind fealty to job andDonald Trump?The question is hardly academic. The president has been rapidly intensifying military operations on United States soil during his second term. In April, he began expanding the military presence along parts of the US’s southern border byestablishingso-called “national defense areas”. Troops are now authorized to search, question and detain people in those zones, dangerouslymuddlingthe line between military rule and civilian law enforcement.By the summer, Trump sent in the marines and the national guard to Los Angeles, against the wishes of the governor, and later to Washington DC. Similar deployments of the national guard, also against the wishes of the respective state governors, are expected for Chicago and Portland, Oregon.Needless to say, US law, under thePosse Comitatus Act, generally prohibits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement roles. A federal judgeruledin September that Trump’s troop deployment in Los Angeles violated the act, but Trump is doing it anyway. And he expects the military to follow him.Not just follow him. He expects the military to venerate him. Trump turned a 250th Anniversary Parade for the Army, which we already didn’t need, into his own 79th birthday celebration, which we definitely didn’t need. (Both anniversaries were on the same day. Attendance at the parade was not only sparse, but was dwarfed by theestimated 5 million peoplewho turned out for the “No Kings” demonstrations across the country on the same day.)And most recently, he joined his recently renamed secretary of war,Pete Hegseth, in an abruptly summoned meeting of the country’s military commanders on 30 September. (“I love the name,” Trump said, referring to the Department of War. “I think it’s so great. I think it stops wars.”) At the meeting, Trump told the leadership: “We’re under invasion from within, no different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms.” His evidence was that “Democrats run most of the cities that are in bad shape,” even though all the cities he listed –San Francisco,Chicago,New York,Los Angeles– have some of their lowest levels of violent crime in decades. And then he said: “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”Trump and Hegseth are attempting to reshape the US military into a partisan force committed to preserving Trump’s power, a prospect which is not only anathema to our tradition but should also worry all Americans. And they want to make this restructuring into a spectacle. Everything Hegseth said at this highly publicized and very expensive meeting could have been issued by memorandum, and in factwas. But Hegseth in particular needs a rebrand. He is, at this point, much less known for leading military operations than he is forleakingthem. For Hegseth, the very public lecture was a vainglorious attempt at buffing his own tarnished image. Unfortunately for him, it came across more like a condescending Ted talk that had possibly been directed by the ghost of Leni Riefenstahl.But far more significant, and infinitely more troubling, was Trump’s foreshadowing of even greater numbers of troops on our American streets. So, I return to my initial question: when will the nation’s top military brass decide that enough is enough?There’s every reason to believe that high ranking members of the military might already be worried about getting sacked by this president, either for being insufficiently loyal to Trump, insufficiently white, or insufficiently male, based on past actions from this administration. Within weeks of assuming office, Trumpsackedthe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Air Force Gen CQ Brown, only the second Black man to hold the position. Adm Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to be named to chief of naval operations, the US Navy’s highest rank, was alsodismissed.Trump alsogot ridof judge advocates general for the army, navy and air force, and fired Gen Tim Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command,reportedlyat the request of far-right activist Laura Loomer, who claimed Haugh was insufficiently loyal to the president. There aremany more examples.While it’s true that every administration does some house cleaning upon assuming power, it’s also true that the scale and mission to restructure the military during this administration is unprecedented. As Peter Feaver and Heidi Urben write inForeign Policy: “No previous administration exercised its power in this dramatic fashion for fear that doing so would effectively treat the senior officer corps as akin to partisan political appointees whose professional ethos is to come and go with changes of administration, rather than career public servants whose professional ethos is to serve regardless of changes in political leadership.”Hegseth claimed that he will also now get rid of “stupid rules of engagement”. Those rules, however, define what is lawful and unlawful behavior by the military, a line made more difficult to discern as the administration decimates the legal wing (the judge advocate generals) of the military. Clearly, there has been plenty of illegality in the US military behavior from its inception until today. But if you are a member of the military, you have the right, if not the duty, torefuseillegal orders.The Trump administration is currently engaged in blatantly illegal acts being carried out by the US navy. Lethal strikes are being launched against vessels in the Caribbean that the US claims are drug smuggling boats. No evidence has been provided, and now the administration isclaimingthe US is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels and the people who were murdered by the US in the strikes are “unlawful combatants”.This is ludicrous, of course, and is reminiscent of the worst legal reasoning developed during the early War on Terror era. Even if the people on those boats were participating in drug smuggling (which is quite unlikely), being involved in the sale of a controlled substance does not rise to the standard of engaging in hostilities, asnotedby Geoffrey Corn, a retired judge advocate general lawyer and formerly the army’s senior adviser for law-of-war issues.When a state intentionally kills a person outside of armed conflict and without due process, it’s a form of murder. It’s already happening in the Caribbean Sea. Is that the path we’re headed down on the streets of our own cities? Trump may have drawn up his own battle plans for his purposes, but it’s the members of the military who will have to carry them out. With all our institutions currently on the line, including the military, we need a much stronger defense against his idea of war.Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

Talk about an immaculate misconceptionFri 3 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 10.15 EDTShareIt hit me hard, out of nowhere.I’m never going to have children.I’m 55 years old; that ship has sailed. It disappeared from my biological horizon years ago – a once fertile landscape that held so much hope, promise and seemingly endless possibility.A horizon that, sadly, I took for granted.Did I forget to wind my biological clock? I admit to hearing it ticking, but at some point the throes of everyday life and loss drowned out the alarm until it eventually perished in the menopausal desert.Game over.I should have switched to a digital clock at some point but I’m a proud gen-Xer – we grew up on analog: rotary phones and winding our Swatch watches.You’d think I would have woken up at some point, but I didn’t.I missed the baby boat, and now I’m left standing on the midlife dock with my Hokas, a sensible hat, a comfortable mattress, and an electric toothbrush with my internal Jekyll and Hyde – the menopausal dynamic duo that have commandeered my emotional remote control and can’t agree on a channel.Just pick something already, I’m exhausted!I toggle between sadness and fury – one minute I’m weeping while watching a video of a baby elephant learning to swim with her mother, and the next I’m angry, cursing myself for not deleting Instagram and cursing Instagram for sending me the damn videos I feel compelled to watch at 2am while weeping (although at this point I’d take baby animals over wall pilates and posture-correcting bra reels any day).I say it hit me “out of nowhere”, but that’s not entirely true. What hit me was the certainty, the finite gusto of the wallop, as if someone was hammering down the final nail in theit’s never going to happen so get over itcoffin.I’m 55; of course I’ve thought about it over the years.But naively, I always figured it would just happen at some point.Talk about an immaculate misconception.I never planned tonothave children, I just never planned to have them.Herein lies my newfound remorse, and I have nobody to blame but myself.I’ve spent so many years mourning the loss of my parents, and now I’m mourning the loss of the children I never hadSince my mom passed away, I’ve missed our relationship with an excruciating pang deep in my soul, one that usually culminates in tears whenever I see a mother and daughter duo interacting (throw a grandmother in the mix and I’m a goner). At cafes, grocery stores, parks and theaters, I find myself unabashedly staring at unsuspecting strangers (one of the few upsides of menopause is theI don’t care what people thinkattitude, which is both a blessing and a curse, as I often leave the house in questionable attire). I observe their dynamic with a quiet longing – watching them laugh, chat, argue or quietly exist in each other’s orbits with the tender familiarity that I so intensely miss.I had always seen myself as the daughter in these candid scenarios, but recently the roles have been recast and I imagine myself as the mother, and if there’s a grandmother in the dynamic, I see my mother in her role (I always thought my mom would have made such a wonderful grandmother).I’ve spent so many years mourning the loss of my parents, and now I’m mourning the loss of the children I never had, and of the grandchildren that my parents would never meet.These interactions stir up an already bubbling caldron of menopause-infused emotions, and I can’t help but feel a touch of envy for the maternal bond I won’t get to experience. “You just have to meet a partner with kids, Shanti,” a friend suggested, as if it were that easy.More like grandchildren at this point, but I’m open.In these daunting days of internet dating, it’s hard enough to meet someone without piling extra condiments on to my online profile wishlist.“Menopause is about purging,” my friend suggests. “You’ll eventually come out the other end lighter, refreshed and feeling better than ever.” “Lighter” and “refreshed”? I’d say more like plump, overheated and in need of a really long nap.As many times as I’ve heard the spiel about how I’m going to emerge from this mythical “menopause chrysalis” like a butterfly ready to take on midlife heaven, when you’re on the hot flash seat with no eject button, it feels more like being stuck in hell.“This too shall pass.” I hear my mom’s voice whispering words of maternal wisdom in my ear, and I realize that she never left.Maybe my friend is right, and I am “purging”, but coming to grips with the enviable is challenging at any age, and I’m still waiting for AARP to send me a midlife roadmap.And although I’ll never give birth, I’m forever thankful for all of those mothers who did.Shanti Nelson is a writer and photographerExplore more on these topicsAgeingOpinionParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time to take that seriouslyFri 3 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 07.49 EDTShareFor gen Z Americans, it’s hard to remember a version of the economy not defined by crisis. We finished our education online asCoviddevastated the world, only to graduate into highcosts of living,stagnant wagesand nowAI’s threat to entry-level jobs. We’ve come of age in a system that no longer feels fit for purpose.The result is a generation that’s lost faith in the traditional markers of stability. What once defined a secure life –home, family and comfortable retirement– feels out of reach. “A pension is out of the question,” one friend told me. “So staying in the same job no longer makes sense.” She’s not alone: jobseekers’ confidence in keeping or finding workdropped sharplythis spring, with a survey in June suggestingnearly 60% of graduateswere still looking for their first jobs.Trump wants to rebrand his tax bill as the ‘Working Families Tax Cut’. Don’t be fooled | Steven GreenhouseRead moreIt’s not just these markers of stability, but the economic web that once bound us to them. The financial commitments that tied previous generations to long-term careerism – having children, affordable mortgages, college debt – are largely unattainable. College, long considered a reliable pathway to success, hasrapidly diminishedin importance for Americans. Childcare costs are soprohibitivethat agrowing shareof adults say they’re unlikely to have children. And with housing prices rising atmore than twicethe rate of inflation since 1960,one in three gen Z-ersbelieve they’ll never own a home. Locked out of these futures – for better or worse – we’re no longer tethered to economic paths that once rooted people to jobs, and more importantly, to communities.Enter disillusionomics: the economics of a generation raised on promises thatnever materialized. It’s a reaction to a system where traditional benchmarks of success have become largely unattainable, and even if attained, don’t deliver the same security they once did. Functioning well, the economy is supposed to provide security and opportunity. But when hard workno longer guarantees mobility, and outcomes are increasingly defined by where yougrow up, gen Z is asking: why play by the rules of a game that no longer works?Every time a new gen Z trend surfaces, I bookmark it: theGen Z stare,salary dysmorphia,fast-yield dividend investments,treat culture. But taking each in isolation doesn’t quite touch on thewhy. Connecting the threads, we see a generation that is not entitled, not indulgent, but reacting to a political and economic climate we’re disillusioned by. These are survival strategies in an affordability crisis.Some are retreating into predictability, with the resurgence of traditionalmasculine– andfeminine– norms. Linear careers that promise predictability are hotly desired, withhalf of Harvard graduates in 2024 going into consulting, tech or finance. Others are leaning into risk-taking,citingpressures to stay afloat. Manyclosely watchthe markets: over half of 18-25 year olds nowinvest, and more thana thirdare considering cryptocurrency investments. With growingdebt burdens, gen Z see these choices as responses tomore challengingeconomic circumstances than prior generations experienced.Then there’s the rise in earning passive income. Knowing thatwageswon’t build wealth, gen Z pursues creative income streams: from the demure (subleasing partsof their apartments) to the extreme (OnlyFans). Everything can become commodifiable if it means buying the stability we need. This also explains gen Z’s rush into AI startups, as young people refuse to letshrinking entry-levelroles dictate their future. “Entrepreneur” has become themost admiredprofession among young men, wanting to work for ashared purposeoutside atraditional9 to 5 that no longer delivers on its promises.So, contrary to how gen Z is perceived, we are a generation deeply engaged in the economy. We’ve had to become hyper-aware of economic realities just to live securely. But we’re still hoping the system will change. Acrosspartisan divides, economic outcomes are the most important driver of our voting choices, explaining the appeal of figures offering alternative models, fromMamdanitoMaga. We’re searching for any solution that might change the current system.It’s no coincidence, then, that we’re increasingly polarized acrosspoliticsandgender. Much of it stems from divergent responses to the same problem. Years of economic crises have left younger people with downturn fatigue. We’ve become morelikelyto think in zero-sum terms, seeinglimited resourcesand feeling the need to beat others to them. Gen Z is taking economic innovation into its own hands, angry at a system that doesn’t work. Our anger is then directed at diverging sources, amplified byalgorithmic outrage, ultimately making it harder to relate to each other. And with division sown across the generations, the social contracts we have with work, government and each other will fray.So if the economy just isn’t serving (excuse the gen Z pun), what should Americans do? It starts with taking gen Z’s behavior seriously. Dismissing our concerns as quirky reactions to a system that worked for older generations risks polarizing us further. Zero-sum thinking like this makes collective solutions harder, as we refuse to see or understand each other’s different generational challenges.Young people offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ask: what is our labour reallyfor? And as digital natives, gen Zers see AI – used thoughtfully – as a chance to redefine the value of work itself. This generation no longer wants to be bound to extractive contracts or roles thatfeel unnecessary. Now it’s time to collectively, and apolitically, ask: what would it take to redesign the economy so it serves its citizens again?Alice Lassman is a policy expert with a focus on the global economy and gender.

Let Manchester be a turning pointJonathan FreedlandThis was a horror but amid rising antisemitism, no one can say it was a surprise. There are lessons to learn, and that must start nowFri 3 Oct 2025 12.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.22 EDTShareIt was the Jewish New Year last week, when the traditional greeting isshana tova: a good year. This time around, you’d often hear it in adapted form, as Jews wished each other something more modest: “A better year.” As if, given the times we live in, “good” would be too much to ask for; as if we ought to scale down expectations. It turns out we didn’t scale them down enough.I was in synagogue when word spread of the murderous attack at Heaton Park in northManchesterthat left two people dead, along with the killer. Yom Kippur is rightly described as the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, but it is also a moment of vulnerability. Those who follow tradition, and that includes plenty who wouldn’t describe themselves as believers in God, do not eat or drink for 25 hours; many switch off their phones, and don’t watch TV or listen to the radio; they engage in reflection on the year that has passed, submitting themselves and the wider Jewish people to intense self-criticism.So they – we – were already vulnerable when we heard the first whispers of murder in Manchester. That made the shock and the sadness more intense. But what was missing was any sense of surprise. Having seen attacks on Jews, and on synagogues,recur around the world, British Jews had been fearing it and preparing for it.I don’t just mean emotionally. To an extent that is perhaps not realised by most Britons, every Jewish building in this country – every school, every cultural centre and synagogue – has long been hardened against attack, compelled to operate stringent security. Indeed, community officials I’ve spoken to believe that it was only the presence of guards and gates and fences, and of congregants who knew the drill, that prevented the assailant from killing more.It’s good that the system – operated by a Jewish charity, the Community Security Trust – worked. But it is a bleak kind of comfort to realise that Jews were right to reach the conclusion they came to long ago – that to live a Jewish life in Britain, to send a child to a Jewish school or simply to go and hear an evening talk on a Jewish theme, is best viewed as a high-risk activity requiring serious protection.It’s early to speak of the motive of the killer, Jihad al-Shamie, a British citizen born in Syria. Police warn that a clearcut answer may prove elusive. In the mental stew of a killer, it can sometimes be hard to calculate the exact portions of political radicalisation and psychological disturbance.Even so, there are some things we can and perhaps ought to say. The first is that we are living in an age of renewed political violence. Whether it’s the murder of Charlie Kirk or the attempted torching of refuges for asylum seekers, people are converting political rage into physical acts designed to cause injury or death. The condemnation of this is not as absolute as it needs to be. Too many feel the temptation, when sympathetic to the rage, to make excuses for the violence: you could hear a lot of that around last year’s anti-migrant riots. We need to be unbending on this. No anger, no matter how righteous we might consider its supposed source, justifies the murder of innocents. None.View image in fullscreenPeople with flowers before a vigil to be held after the attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue, Manchester, 3 October 2025.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesSecond, we should be wary of those who seek to use a wicked act such as this to advance a political agenda. I was struck that one Jewish community official I spoke to on Thursday night volunteered, unprompted, how “profoundly unhelpful” it was that rightwing Israeli politicians had rushed to claim the Manchester killings as proof of the folly of Keir Starmer’s Middle East policy. “Weakness in the face of terrorism only brings more terrorism,”wrote Benjamin Netanyahu, apparently unaware that the man who was prime minister when Israel suffered the greatest act of terrorism in its history on 7 October 2023 was one Benjamin Netanyahu.Third, there needs to be some soul-searching among those who pride themselves on their vigilance against racism and yet who have long had a blind spot around antisemitism. You don’t have to agree with all of David Baddiel’sJews Don’t Countthesis to recognise that too many progressives have, even unconsciously, seen antisemitism as a lesser menace, one that does not demand their full attention.The arguments, often made implicitly rather than explicitly, are now wearily familiar. That Jews don’t experience real racism because they’re supposedly white (the position that Diane Abbott advanced in the 2023 letter that saw her first suspended as a Labour MP). That Jews are powerful and therefore antisemitism constitutes a kind of “punching up” (a view that itself rests on an antisemitic cliche). That to talk about antisemitism is really to talk about Israel and it’s therefore all very complicated and best put to one side. (Witness the Jewish educational charity that tells me its offer of training against antisemitism was rejected by one headteacher on the grounds that their school was taking a “neutral stance”.)Threaded through such thinking is a kind of unspoken, maybe even unconscious, assumption that antisemitism need not be a prime concern of the left because it is discussed often by the right – the likes of the Daily Mail and GB News, for their own reasons – leaving the left free to downgrade or ignore it. But in Manchester we saw the proof that antisemitism can be as lethal as any other form of hate. It demands equal seriousness; its victims deserve equal solidarity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One only has to look at theenormous surgein antisemitic incidents since 7 October to see that. Perhaps this might be a way to think about it. Let’s say you’re a Guardian reader who is appalled by Israel’s destruction of Gaza and its killing of more than 60,000 Palestinians. Your fury will be entirely directed at the Israeli government and have nothing to do with Jews: the line between the two will be sharp and clear in your own mind. But what is surely now undeniable is that there are others for whom the line is not so clear, whose rage against Israel manifests itself as, and may be driven by, hatred of Jews.For you, it’s an article of faith that “anti-Israel” is not “anti-Jewish”. But not everyone is so careful. So the plea many British Jews might now make is for those justifiably outraged by Netanyahu’s conduct of the Gaza war to think of that line when they chant a slogan or carry a placard, and be sure their words and actions fall on the right side of it. Because sometimes theline gets blurry.And as for Jews, where does this leave us? The synagogue service that I was in on Thursday carried on, the same way as always. No one considered stopping. That, I suspect, is how it will be. Journalists have been asking if Jews might now leave Britain. I don’t expect it. But I do see Jews wanting to huddle together against the cold, to be among those to whom they don’t have constantly to justify or explain themselves. Even if that means being in the same place at the same time – even if that carries the risk of more sorrow, more pain, more tears. They will take the risk because, who knows, maybe next year will be better.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One is the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, hurt to the point of requiring smelling salts by some politically commonplacewords spokenby the prime minister. And the other is legally besieged bra baroness Michelle Mone, who has always been performatively sensitive, with chaos as her rising sign.Alas, far from their shared victimhood drawing our two snowflakes closer together, in Michelle, we may have finally found the Tory from whom Nigel would not accept a defection to Reform. Which really means something, considering Britain’s would-be next prime minister currently has precisely zero peers in the House of Lords. Like thePPE she providedduring the pandemic, Michelle would be deemed incredibly expensive and absolutely unusable.Not that you’d get that vibe from theletter she sentto Keir Starmer this week, claiming that Rachel Reeves reportedly mentioning a “vendetta” against her retaining her peerage was a security threat. This began, amazingly, with the words: “I am writing to you … first as a wife, second as a mother, and lastly as a baroness …”Surely writing at least second-and-a-halfly as a Range Rover driver? After all, in an earlier statement this week, Michelle had battled to get the public on side with a helpful analogy about the wrongness of the judge who had just ordered a company to which she and her husband, Doug Barrowman, were linked to repay £122m to the Department of Health for providing some defective surgical gowns. “To use a simple analogy,” her ladyship began promisingly in a diatribe against the “establishment”, “if a car looks, feels and drives like, say, a Range Rover, then unless you can show how the car is assembled by the manufacturer, it’s not a Range Rover.”Nope, I’ve read that 15 times and I’m still no clearer. Maybe we would be on safer ground if we just pictured the specific Range Rover. I’m getting strong notes ofOverfinch L460, maybe customised with monogrammed quilted leather and Swarovski crystal wheel caps. I also sense we peasants wouldn’t even be allowed to touch it unless we were wearing protective clothing – obviously sourced from a firm where it actually worked.That said, and partly because she can’t help herself, it does feel as though we focus more on Michelle than Doug Barrowman, the person whose wife she’s firstly speaking as. If you can’t immediately picture Doug, he’s a striking confection of tweed and Turkey teeth, and it’s fairly difficult to get past the fact that his house boasts a new-build amphitheatre. But then, the Mone-Barrowmans always wanted to tell us how very, very rich they were, and how very, very well they were doing. They gave theirfirst joint interviewto Hello! long before they were engaged, pictured standing not just in front of their Isle of Man McMansion, but in front of their Ferrari. “I feel like I’m in a fairytale,” revealed Michelle, “a beautiful dream I don’t ever want to wake up from.”Oh dear. Flash forward to the last time the couple attempted a spirited defence of their Covid antics, during an absolute helicopter crash of a BBC interview two years ago, and we findDoug saying: “There’s a reason why I live in the Isle of Man. I don’t want anyone in the press to know of any business activity or anything that I get engaged in.” Again: oh dear.So these are testing times over at Hubris Towers. Whither the yacht Michelle posted a picture of herself on during the pandemic? Caption: “Business isn’t easy. But it is rewarding.” Apparently the good ship Lady M has now been sold, as Doug has liquidated anestimated £80m of thingslike a private jet and a £41m Caribbean villa. This reportedly happened shortly after a separate£75m of the couple’s properties and accountswere frozen as part of a National Crime Agency investigation (Mone and Barrowman deny any criminal wrongdoing). But don’t get your hopes up – it feels unlikely lawyers will ever “pierce the corporate veil” and get all the money back from such personal assets.If you liked Brexit, you’re going to love what the Conservatives want next | Polly ToynbeeRead moreAs for the wider context, it’s strange. No one more than the Conservative government of the day encouraged us to think of the pandemic as a war. You’d think the possibility of mass viral death was a sufficiently horrifying novelty not to require a metaphor to bring it home. But war they called it, andbattle languagewas everywhere. Unfortunately, instead of Winston Churchill, we had Boris Johnson, and instead of remembering the revulsion towards profiteers in the wake of the second world war, we had something called “the VIP lane” for Covid contracts. This went … badly. If you haven’t watched ITV’s new documentary on the Covid contracts,Follow the Money, I strongly recommend it as a faultless roundup and exploration of what one contributor classes as “probably the biggest misspending scandal in the UK of all time”, from PPE to Covid tests, with particular emphasis on that VIP lane.The people who jostled their way into this lane for a grotesquely outsize cash bonanza and then boasted abouthelping the nationwere profiteering, plain and simple – and there were a lot more of them than just Michelle Mone. She isn’t being scapegoated, as she claims. But so many others have got away with it.Michelle doesn’t know where the profiteer bodies other than her own are buried, or she’d be out there digging them up with her bare hands so she wouldn’t be the only one in the limelight. But the people who did it do. How relieved they must be that their misdeeds are buried in the Covid bad-memory hole, stuck in the mind-wipe warehouse like the ark at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A structure that, ironically, does not look like it would be remotely big enough to hold all the useless stuff purchased – or all the money they fleeced off this country.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Tories’ new proposals will end the party for goodFri 3 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 08.48 EDTShareBrexit is never over and it’s about to get a bit worse. As the moribund Tories assemble this Sunday, it’s still their only tune, as if they haven’t noticed how the public mood has changed. Brexit is the root cause of all their woes, with almost all the 61% of those people who call it a failureblaming the Conservatives the most.But instead of recanting, rethinking, questioning their recent history, they double down, with Kemi Badenoch now following Robert Jenrick deeper into the Farage darkness witha pledgeto leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR). That double dose of Brexit will sink not save them.If people needed reminders of what Brexit has done to us all, 12 October will come as a jolt. That’s when the EU finally begins its long-delayed stricter border checks, witha new entry-exit system (EES). At the border, the system will take not just passports, but fingerprints and photographs, storing data to enforce the rule that no Britons can stay in the Schengen area formore than 90 out of any 180 days. (Take note,opponents of digital IDs: it’s already there for anyone holidaying on the continent.) A€20, three-year visais due to come in next year. Thank you, David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.Expect delays and gridlock, especially in Dover and Folkstone. But it will be worst for those crisscrossing the border often. Road hauliers are among occupations urging the government on in its EU negotiations to make exceptions for professions that need to travel frequently. Checks will come on top of the monumental paperworkBrexithas made hauliers take with every pallet.Coaches taking people on EU holidays (bar Ireland and Cyprus) or children on school trips will be badly disrupted. Jason Edwards, a coach operator in Pontypridd, is distraught: “We have primary school kids, often travelling in the early hours, who sleep through. Now they’ll have to all get out at 2 or 3am, and queue to be checked with their ID.” He says Dover last summer was already a logjam.He has 20 coaches staffed by 70 drivers, two of whom travel to the continent every week on 14-day tours, before resting and setting off again. They are restricted by their 90-day limit. “We need the EU to give us a special worker’s permit,” he said. The effect of Brexit, “has stopped a lot of our growth potential”.Along with the movement of goods and people, services – Britain’s biggest export category – are severely restricted by the time limit. Take Rolls-Royce: it doesn’t just sell engines, but services planes, too, sending engineers back and forth across the English Channel all the time, says John Springford of the Centre for European Reform. He lists consultants and accountants going back and forth to clients in the Schengen area, as well as UK events companies transporting performers and orchestras to venues around Europe. He says they are losing out massively to EU operators. Nothing can bring back lost trade exceptrejoining the customs union and the single market, he adds.Here’s theOffice for Budget Responsibility assessment: “Our forecasts have assumed that the volume of UK imports and exports will both be 15% lower than if we had remained in the EU.” That 15% loss in trade leads to “a 4% reduction in the potential productivity of the UK economy”.It takes time to negotiate when 27 countries have to agree – and frankly, why would they push British deals and British concerns up their crowded agenda? Especially when they can see Nigel Farage and the Tories advocating an ever-widening Channel. They can see how leaving the ECHR would be a repeat of the trauma caused by Brexit. Catherine Barnard, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge, warns of the consequences: leaving the convention would end any prospect of better deals for animal and plant trade. The price of food and other goods would rise, she believes, as trade falls. There’s more: she thinks the Good Friday agreement would fall apart overnight; the ECHR runs through it “as in a stick of rock”. And the fallout in retaliation would include losing data exchange on crime, and the ability to extradite criminals.You might expect business to speak out against the prospect of leaving the ECHR. But so far, barely a murmur. The CBI supported aBrexit reset last May, and has said the Tories’proposed abolitionof the Climate Change Act would be “a backwards step”, but has not said anything about leaving the ECHR. The Institute of Directors likewise – as in its catastrophic silence in the EU referendum. It would seem that some of the latter’s members are divided ideologically, and some fear a boycott by rightwing customers. Its members will pay a price if Reform UK ever comes to power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Divisive politics are openly back on the ballot paper. Labouris capitulatingto the anti-migrant talking points of Reform, all while talking the language of decency and fairness. It makes my toes curl.But I am here to do what others won’t. To tell the truth about what makes our country great and what makes it not so great. While others thrive on creating scapegoats, I am here to tell you a different story.The tapestry of cultural life in Britain is what makes our nation strong. From the doctors, nurses and carers who staff our NHS and who look after our elderly people, to the entrepreneurs, artists and teachers who enrich our culture and economy.Migrationis our DNA as a country, it is our superpower.Britain has always been built on the contribution of people who’ve arrived here to build a better life, and our future depends on us embracing that truth, not denying it. Until we do this, we will always be handwringing and trying to ineffectually factcheck Nigel Farage’sclaims about migrants.But we also need to understand the fears and worries that sit at the heart of Reform’s rise in popularity. Our rents are high and our wages are low. Our services are crumbling while our debt is growing. But these crises weren’t caused by migration. They were caused by political choices made in Westminster. It was austerity that stripped our communities bare, privatisation that handed public goods to people seeking profit, and tax breaks that showered wealth on the very richest.And yet, what makes this moment even more dangerous is that Labour, thoughclaiming to challengeReform’s poisonous narrative, is in fact echoing and enabling it. From Keir Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, for which he apologised andclaimed ignoranceto its similarity with the language of Enoch Powell, to Shabana Mahmood’s new stricter conditions on people’s right to remain in this country, Labour is indulging a politics of fear.Meanwhile, in villages, towns and cities across the UK, people are facing the same problems. Families wondering how they’ll pay the rent or the gas bill. Tenants living in mouldy homes terrified of another rent hike or eviction notice. Pensioners cutting back on heating while energy companies rake inastronomical profits.Labour directs them to be angry at those who have less than them – making demonstrably false claims that “cheap overseas labour” is driving down wages. I say the opposite. We are now one of the most unequal countries in Europe. The richest 1% hold more wealth than the bottom70% combined. Public services are stretched to breaking point, butprivate shareholders keep cashing in. It is not a lack of resources. It is a lack of political will from the very politicians who take money from the richest 1%.There is an alternative. One set out this weekend in Bournemouth, where a record number ofGreen partymembers are expected to attend our annual conference. A wealth tax on the richest 1% to fund public services. An end to rip-off privatisation so water, rail and energy work for people, not shareholders. Universal free childcare, to give every child the best start, and every parent real freedom. Rent controls and investment in warm, affordable homes. Real investment in green jobs and infrastructure, and a Green New Deal that doesn’t just cut carbon but transforms communities, lowers bills and creates opportunity.This isn’t just possible. It is essential.And that’s why the elections in May 2026 matter so much. Because when Farage’s politics of division are rising, and whenLabouris too timid to resist, it falls to the Greens to fight for something better. To stand up for hope against fear. To make the case for bold investment in people and planet. To celebrate those who choose to call Britain their home and who help to make us the great country we are.The truth is simple: Britain is not broken because of migration. Britain is broken because of inequality. Because of an economy that allows billionaires to hoard wealth while millions struggle to get by. Because of a political class that has lost its nerve and forgotten its purpose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The shock was that it was over £5.Coffee hasn’t really been cheap for ages, forcomplex reasons– post-pandemic inflation, a Russian war pushing up energy prices, a climate crisis having an effect on coffee bean growth, last year’s budget tax hikes – that capture the bitter flavours of the last few years in a cup. Less predatory capitalism, more global problems coming home to roost. But still, north of a fiver, for caffeinated cereal juice? I felt like the eight-year-old whoseoutraged reactionto ice-cream van prices – “NINE POUND FOR TWO?” – went viral last summer on TikTok.This isn’t going to be a column about how millennials could all be homeowners if they bought fewer flat whites, nor an invitation to play the world’s smallest violin for the not-that-squeezed middle classes when so many people are properly on the breadline. Rather, it’s about the strangely mood-dampening effect of little everyday treats beginning to feel unjustifiable, even for people who aren’t watching every penny; how that makes life feel more grey and drab, undermining any optimism about how the country is doing more broadly. For many gen Xers it feels oddly like sliding back towards the land of our childhoods, where eating out was strictly for the most special occasions, your mum took a Thermos of Nescafé along on every outing, and normal people painted their own nails rather than getting them done on the high street. Were the consumer boom years of our 20s and 30s not in fact a new bountiful norm to which we’ll eventually somehow return but, in retrospect, more of a blip?It’s not just coffee. This week Gregg’sannounced price rises, blaming the recent rise in employers’ national insurance – and if you don’t see why the cost of breakfast is politically salient, you have forgotten that half a million people signed a petition protesting against George Osborne’spasty taxin 2012 – while Tesco CEO Ken Murphy observed that its customers seem to be sticking with cost-of-living crisis habits, such as eating in instead of going out. “Do you feel sad at being priced out of little luxuries?” asked a plaintiveMumsnet threadrecently, in which users talked about giving up the little dopamine hits that used to brighten the day: a glossy magazine to read in the bath, meeting a friend for a glass of wine, cinema tickets, fresh flowers that aren’t a £1 bunch of supermarket daffodils. Small things, but important precisely because they’re small, which makes them the sort of things people in not flashy but solid full-time jobs ought to be able to do and have. Things that make the difference between just treading water financially, and living. It might or might not be entirely a coincidence that 23% of Mumsnet users polled in September said they weren’t sure how they would vote in an election, giving “don’t know” a lead over every other party.As the veteran consumer journalist Harry Walloppointed out this week, lunch for a family of four at an ordinary chain restaurant – a Pizza Express or a Bella Italia, somewhere you might take the kids at half-term – is now routinely through the psychologically important £100 barrier without booze or puddings, while the £20 pub main course is no longer confined to London. Market researchers Savanta say so-called “bill shock”, or going out for a meal that’s nothing terribly fancy and reeling at the card reader, is measurably on the rise: 43% of diners surveyed across 160 well known high street chains admitted to experiencing it, up from 30% in 2017. Bill shock is normally what happens when our inbuilt sense of what things “ought” to cost can’t quite keep up with inflation. Food-price inflation has now risenfor five months in a row, and a hospitality industry visibly anxious about this November’s budget insists that the real culprit is recent rises in employers’ national insurance and in theminimum wagebeing passed on to customers.Reeves had a wholly reasonable case last autumn for raising business taxes – ithelped her find the moneyto settle the doctors’ strike and create more hospital appointments – and successive chancellors have had, if anything, a morally stronger one for a measure putting money into the pockets of some of the people actually making £5 coffees and serving £20 pizzas. Arguably a lot of life’s little treats were in reality possible only because of cheap labour, and if the net cost of paying livable wages is that people often earning not much more than minimum wage can’t have so many nice things – well, maybe that’s what redistribution looks like in an era where chancellors are fresh out of easier options. You could even argue, as the economic gurus of what’s known as abundance theorydo, that the really joyful luxury in life isn’t retail therapy but things such as affordable homes or cheap green energy, and re-gearing economies to provide more of the latter will mean less of the former.But all that said, it’s an uphill slog to generate a feelgood sense of life getting better under Labour when quite ordinary things increasingly feel to ordinary people like guilty extravagances. Right now, it’s difficult to see how Rachel Reeves breaks out of this trap in November. But it might be time to get a Thermos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is misguided – Irish is a portal to a world of imaginationFri 3 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.04 EDTShareAmid a boom in Irish culture across music, literature, film and fashion, the Irish language – Gaeilge – is also experiencing a revival. Once the majority’s native tongue, it was assailed and diminished as a daily, working, spoken language under British colonialism and became largely confined to rural west coast districts for much of the 20th century, kept alive by generations of families. But over recent decadesthe number ofschools teaching the national curriculum exclusively through Irish has risen significantly, from fewer than 20 in the 1970s, to more than 200 today. The 2022 census showeda 6% increasein the number of people able to speak Irish compared with 2016. Irish is a core subject on the curriculum and compulsory in all schools.Yet in the academic year of 2024-25, a record number of pupils –14% of the post-primaryschool population – were granted exemptions from studying Irish, a record number. This makes me sad for the young people who will miss out – not just on the growing professional opportunities it provides, but the richness of the language and the window into Irish culture it cracks open.The number of Ukrainians now attending school in Ireland explains at least some of the rise in numbers seeking to opt out. There areclose to 7,000 Ukrainian pupilsin post-primary schools across the country. Exemptions can only be sought if a student was born outside Ireland, was educated outside Ireland for a significant period, or has needs that affect learning a language.And yet many Ukrainians are of course learning and studying Irish – along withsignificant numbers of Poles and Latvians.The broader issue is a longstanding and systemic one, where the language – despite its growing popularity – is still not seen as a priority by some Irish parents, or is perceived as overly challenging or even superfluous. Some parents, focused on exam points their children need to access university courses, argue that Irish should be optional.How the language is taught in schools has been a matter of debate since the foundation of the state a century ago. For decades, the same grievances have been repeated, with some justification: primarily that while Irish language, literature and poetry are studied, there isn’t enough emphasis on everyday usage, meaning young people can be “learning” Irish for a decade, yet many still emerge without basic conversational skills. Pupils take an oral test in their final exams, yet stock phrases and rote learning remain a feature of schooling.I attended a post-primary Gaelscoil (Irish-medium school) in Dublin in the 1990s into the 2000s. This was not perceived as fashionable. Studying one’s entire curriculum through Irish was sometimes viewed as idiosyncratic or nationalistic. But the language was a shared code among my school friends, and I maintained it on leaving school. It opened up opportunities. I presented a music show for Ireland’s Irish-language television broadcaster, TG4, and this year, for the first time, I am writing in Irish for print, as the Irish Times launched a weekly Irish-language supplement, calledScéal(Story).Although I still struggle with rustiness and confidence in speaking and writing the language, “keeping” and not “losing” my Irish is probably the greatest gift I have given myself. Irish is a portal, a lyrical language intrinsically connected to the natural world. Early Irish literature is among the oldest vernacular literature in westernEurope. As a spoken language, Irish predates English by a millennium. Its early writing system, Ogham, written vertically as a series of lines and strokes, has an alphabet based on trees. The first letter isbeith, meaning birch. There’sdairmeaning oak,coll, meaning hazel, and so on.Nature and the environment permeate the language viscerally. The word for photography,grianghrafadóireacht, literally means to make a chart of the sun. English has nothing on the spirit of Irish phrases, and the fun, evocative, poetic journeys they can take. Many of these were given new life when the writer and documentary maker Manchán Magan (who sadlydied this week) published his landmark book,Thirty-Two Words For Field, in 2020.So if you wanted to playfully yet emphatically berate someone, you could say “go n-ithe an cat thú, agus go n-ithe an diabhal an cat” (“may the cat eat you, and may the devil eat the cat”). There are dozens of words for penis in Irish, includingbliúcán(a wild carrot). One of the terms for menstruation isblathscaileadh, meaning the release of flowers.Enter theKneecap effect. Many younger people – inspired by the Belfast and Derry rap group – are now embracing Irish.

Even my local pub in Dublin offers a euro discount when you order a drink in Irish.But perhaps the most revelatory moments happen in private. During the pandemic, myself and my wife – who grew up in the Irish-speaking area of northwest County Donegal, but “lost” her Irish over time – began speaking it more frequently at home. Having moved to Dublin in the late 1980s, she had also lost her Donegal accent. But Gaeilge has dialects and accents (canúint) that instantly identify one’s specific geographical roots. When she spoke Irish, I heard her true accent for the first time. With it, came the unique vocabulary of her home county’s landscape and culture. An oral artefact, as though preserved in amber, suddenly – or as we say, “go tobann” – was alive again.Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish TimesExplore more on these topicsIrelandOpinionLanguagesEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Killing journalists is killing the truthAnthony BellangerIf we accept that reporters die in Gaza, we pave the way for other regimes to consider the murder of journalists a normal instrument of warFri 3 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTShareHistory will only be kind to witnesses. In Gaza, it will remember the name of Anas al-Sharif, a young Al Jazeera reporter killed on 10 August 2025. It will also remember the 222 other Palestinian journalists murdered in the past two years by the Israeli army, according to the International Federation of Journalists’ own monitoring. But those who chose to eliminate these media workers will remain condemned forever.For 24 long months now, Gaza has become the most dangerous place in the world to practise our profession. Israel prohibits foreign journalists from entering the territory, so the truth relies exclusively on Palestinian reporters – almost all of whom are members ofthe Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate, affiliated to the IFJ. Too often they work without protection and without refuge for their families. And all too often, they are directly targeted.The deadly toll on journalists in the Gaza warRead moreNever before has the profession of journalism seen such a massacre in its ranks. The International Federation of Journalists, founded in 1926 and celebrating its centenary in Paris in May 2026, has recorded no comparable death toll since its formation, neither during the second world war, nor in Vietnam, Korea, Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq.Gazahas become the worst graveyard for journalists in contemporary history.But this is not a series of accidental tragedies. It is a clear strategy: kill the witnesses, close Gaza, lock down the narrative. Preventing the international press from entering means silencing independent foreign observers to this conflict. And at a time when Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is promising to recolonise Gaza, controlling the narrative is as crucial as controlling the territory itself. Colonising also means erasing the ruins, the dead, the survivors and those who tell their stories.View image in fullscreenAl Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh stands near the shrouded body of journalist Samer Abu Daqqa, who was killed by an Israeli strike in Gaza on 15 December 2023.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFrom the northern border to Gaza City, hundreds of thousands of residents have been forced to flee south. But even there the south is no refuge: it offers neither safety nor a way out. Families are crammed together, trapped between bombs and the sea, with no way to escape the atrocities of this war. This reality of total siege is also that of journalists, condemned to work locked in an enclave where survival becomes more improbable every day.In this context, therecognition of the state of Palestineby a growing number of countries at the UN is symbolic. But it comes too late. It does not protect the living or bring justice to the dead. Diplomacy is catching up with history, but only after the irreparable has been done.So, who protects these witnesses? It is neither the paralysed United Nations nor the major powers, complicit through their arms deliveries and their silence. Palestinian journalists continue their mission alone, to the point of exhaustion. To the point of death.View image in fullscreenThe camera, press vest, helmet and mobile phone belonging to the Mariam Abu Dagga, one of the journalists killed in the Israeli army’s attack on Nasser hospital in Gaza on 25 August.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe IFJ, for its part, is taking action on the ground. It directly supports reporters and their families through itsInternational Safety Fund. It recounts thedaily lives of its colleagues, Sami Abu Salem, Ghada Al Kudr and others, so that their cruel reality is not reduced to mere statistics. And for several years now, it has been calling for aninternationalUNconventionthat would oblige states to protect journalists and punish their killers. Until such a convention exists, impunity will prevail and protect the Israeli leaders responsible for these crimes.An essential reminder repeated for years by the IFJ, to journalists and media workers holding international press cards is: “No story is worth a human life”.This is not a slogan: it is a rule of survival. The mission of journalists is not to die as martyrs but to report in safety. Their protection is a collective responsibility. Every helmet, every bulletproof vest, every safety and hostile environment training course is vital.Brothers, cousins, sons: the human stories behind four of the war’s fallen journalistsRead moreIn Gaza, many of our colleagues are asking themselves, “What is the point of continuing?” The evidence is mounting, the testimonies are piling up and yet nothing is changing. But giving up would be worse because silence is a victory for the executioners. It allows them to say that nothing happened.One hundred years after its creation, the IFJ faces the most terrible ordeal in its history. Gaza has become journalism’s graveyard. If we accept that reporters die there amid indifference, then we pave the way for other regimes to consider that the murder of journalists is a normal instrument of war.Anas al-Sharif did not want to die.

Lower your expectations, ditch the plans and embrace the ‘good enough’ parenting approachSarah AyoubI hadn’t expected the holidays to go downhill so fast. But a funny thing happened when I started taking it day by daySharing the Loadis a column about parenting children of all agesThu 2 Oct 2025 20.26 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 12.05 EDTShareOn the first day of the school holidays, my 11-year-old started playing music from the living room at 6am. This is a child who can’t be roused out of bed on a school day before 7.58am, and there she was, dancing to music by a scantily clad pop group I’d never heard of when I’d desperately needed to sleep. I suddenly had a sense of what my father may have felt when I danced through the family home in 1996, crooning to the Spice Girls’ 2 Become 1.By 9am I was already having a meltdown. I had thrown out toys, sent my husband a ranty voice note insisting “it’s either them or me” (knowing full well he’d likely opt for neither), threatened to cancel my youngest child’s birthday and hid two out of three devices (and only because I couldn’t find the third). I knew I would come to regret it.Travelling with children: the blood, sweat and tears – and the determination to keep going | Lucille WongRead moreAs a working mother, I’d always known that our school holidays wouldn’t ever be perfect. But I hadn’t expected them to go downhillso fast. I’d been ambitious about them despite being up to my eyeballs in work that I had to do from home, around my children, without the saving grace of an office door. Still, I’d planned a roundup of activities I thought they’d enjoy: playdates, a beach trip, walks to the local park with a new basketball and tickets to the Gabby’s Dollhouse movie (because I’m very productive on email at the cinema).And yet here I was being called the “Worst Mum in the World” on the very first day, even though I was nothing like the parents in David Walliams’ The World’s Worst Parents, a book I’d deliberately bought my son to evidence the triviality of my own shortcomings.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsHad I set myself up to fail?Quite possibly, according to parenting expert Genevieve Muir, who says modern parents are under more pressure, more financial strain and more contactable than ever before, while their kids are used to being more entertained. But, she says, we need to remember that “kids don’t need perfection”.“It’s not our job to make holidays magical and sometimes the holidays [are] about letting kids just work it out,” she says. “If parents are worried they’re not connecting enough, just a few minutes a day makes a difference. Whether it’s 10 minutes playing a board game, or shooting hoops, or a one-minute impromptu dance party that makes everyone laugh, that’s enough to see the benefits.”As I microwaved my homemade mocha that morning (because who gets to drink theirs warm the first time), I realised that my morning scroll through a dozen-odd videos of mindful mothers in coordinating outfits with their children hadn’t helped me. I saw my failures: not enough gentle parenting / too many preservatives / too little hikes / more bread baking!I’d felt attacked by my own expectations, which were so removed from my reality. I had internalised what the internet told me was acceptable without recognising where I was and what I was capable of at this period in time (and it had nothing to do with baking bread or hiking with a neurodiverse kid who’d hate it). I had to readjust my expectations, and theirs, regardless of how good past holidays might have been – how many trips we’d taken, how many times we cooked (or baked) together, how present I had been able to be.“School holidays don’t work without compromise,” Muir says. “Sometimes it’s more takeaway, more devices, more leaning on the village. And also letting kids get a bit bored so they find some real-world fun. ‘Good enough’ parenting is always enough.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Within seconds of it streaming, fans had deduced that the song Girl, So Confusing was probably about Lorde: all it took was the line “people say we’re alike / They say we’ve got the same hair”, riffing on a 2014 video where Charli and an interviewer did a bit about people confusing the two. In the song, Charli laid bare her anxieties about their relationship and admitted: “Sometimes I think you might hate me.” Exactly two weeks later camethe Girl, So Confusing Featuring Lorde remix, brokered by the pair over text and voice note in the days after Brat came out. On Lorde’s verse, she owned up to ghosting on dinner dates with Charli and exposed the self-hate, projection and industry-fuelled sense of pop-girl-on-pop-girl rivalry that had made her shy away from the friendship. Charli’s response to the text containing Lorde’s astonishing verse fairly summed it up: “Fucking hell.”It established an immaculate playbook – for pop, celebrity meta-narrative, harnessing the speed of online discourse in a way that showed total fluency in how stans talk. That nimbleness is just one reason that the Charli diss song on Taylor Swift’s new album feels like such a terrible relic.On the Brat song Sympathy Is a Knife, Charli sang about how anxious she felt being around Swift when the latter wasbriefly dating 1975 frontman Matty Healyin early 2023; Charli was dating (and has since married) the band’s drummer/producer George Daniel. “This one girl taps my insecurities,” she sang. It was obvious that these irrational fears were rooted in Charli’s perceived inferiority and her awe at Swift, amenable and crowdpleasing where Charli is stubborn and prickly: “’Cause I couldn’t even be her if I tried,” Charli sang in a frustrated yelp. “I’m opposite, I’m on the other side / I feel all these feelings I can’t control.” It’s not about active disdain for Swift, but theughgut-punch of poor self-comparison.Charli xcx: Sympathy Is a Knife – videoAlmost 16 months after Charli released Sympathy Is a Knife, Swift has made it about her. There’s no mistaking who Actually Romantic is aimed at: “High-fived my ex and then said you’re glad he ghosted me / Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face,” she sings. She suggests that Charli has spent undue amounts of time and effort hating her. (Maybe she has been poisoning the well in secret, but if so, no trace has leaked above ground.) “Some people might be offended / But it’s actually sweet, all the time you’ve spent on me,” Swift sings. That reframing is presumably intended to come off as Swift taking the high road, but she still sticks the knife in: “I heard you call me ‘boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave,” she sings, and likens Charli to “a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse”.“That’s how much it hurts,” she sings, somewhat unconvincingly given that she’s bothered to write a song about it several pop light years later – and given that in June 2024, in the week Brat set Sympathy Is a Knife loose, it was widely perceived that Swift released six new UK-exclusive deluxe reissues of her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department (largely about the short-lived Healy fling), in orderto prevent Brat from debuting at No 1(a move she previously pulled on Billie Eilish in the US). It worked. The potatoes, they are so, so tiny.Actually Romantic sounds a lot like Pixies’ Where Is My Mind?, a question Swift might ask herself. As Alexis Petridis writes inhis two-star review of The Life of a Showgirl, there is no way to interpret Swift, the biggest pop star of all time, attacking another female pop star as anything but punching down. The world has done its best to forget her terrible 2019 single You Need to Calm Down; Swift has also seemingly forgotten its revelation about the pointlessness of fomenting beef with other female artists (in that instance, Katy Perry). The “you’re so obsessed with me!” angle also has tangs of Mean Girls’ Regina George (when Swift learned to drive, she used her fledgling pop-star cashto buy the same model of Lexusas George drives in the film, to spite the girls who picked on her).View image in fullscreenNo more beef … Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.Photograph: BMGThis queen-bee spite pales in emotional intelligence next to the self-scouring insight, compassion and awareness of Lorde’s response to Charli. Recent Swift songs such as Mirrorball and The Archer show she’s capable of it when she wants to be; imagine hearing her own inner dialogue about how she compares to a more audacious, zeitgeist-defining peer. Perhaps most damningly, the drawn-out torture of it all makes her look old-school, a stately ship turning slowly next to her speedier, risk-taking peers. Should Charli choose to dignify it with a response, we will not be waiting 16 months to hear it.As Swift leans into her taunts in one of her fabled middle eights, she reframes Charli’s so-called hate campaign as “talking dirty” and sings – and I am sorry to have to write this – that “it’s kinda making me wet”. (Upsettingly, the moment is more convincing than Wood, the song about her fiance’s dick set to Bruno Mars-lite.) It unwittingly reveals so much of Swift’s current MO: eroticising hate, still getting off on it when her foes are long past participating.Time was that having an antagonist spurred Swift’s greatest work: from the entirety of Speak Now, written entirely solo to counter those who doubted her authorship, to the gimlet-eyed dances with her media-confected “boy-crazy” persona on 1989, to the panto villain of Reputation who leaned into the worst of what critics said about her. On Folklore, she wrote beautiful, thinly veiled songs about her former label owner Scott Borchettaselling her first six albums to foe Scooter Braun, then wrote several more notably worse ones – including her new album’s Father Figure. Long after most people acknowledged that she really was done dirty by Kim Kardashian and Kanye West and won that war, she still released the Tortured Poets bonus track thanK you aIMee (pointed capitalisation Swift’s own). And while the Showgirl song Wi$h Li$t is all about Swift’s dreams of a quiet suburban life with her fiance, it’s one that contrasts her simple hopes about kids and basketball hoops with conspicuously Kardashian-like venal desires (“a fat ass with a baby face”) to make her point.Showgirl also raises questions about which figures get a pass. Over the gothic thunder of Cancelled!, Swift welcomes social pariahs into her circle – the friends she likes “cloaked in Gucci and in scandal” – because her own post-1989 backlash taught her what it’s like to be tossed aside for perceived infractions. What may appear compassionate also functions perfectly as a rallying cry for the many scoundrels of our age: any comedian, actor, politician or otherwise who’s been confronted with the consequences of their actions and found community among those who see “wokeness” as a scourge. It’s hard to tell who it’s meant to be about – but it’s also easy to imagine it as an anthem for triumphant bad actors in the Teflon era of Trump 2.0.‘She’s leaning into the idea that her image is a gilded fantasy’: how Taylor Swift embraced the showgirlRead moreThe Swift album that Showgirl most resembles thematically is Reputation: both are divided between songs about those who seek to bring her down and ardent love songs about a guy who saved her life. But, ascritic BD McClay wrote in a great recent essay, “the meta-story of Reputation was that by trying to take everything away from her, The Haters gave her her great love.” There are no such stakes in The Life of a Showgirl. It comes off the back ofthe biggest tour of all time, which made Swift the biggest pop star of all time,lifting economiesand binding together giddy tweens and “actually she can really write songs!” dads in a link of friendship bracelets that could wrap around the world several hundred times. She isnewly engagedto a very famous American football player who has become infinitely more famous for their association, realising her youthful dreams of fairytale romance and total cultural domination. Not only did the Taylor’s Versions re-recordings stratospherically devalue Braun’s investment in her first six albums,she also got those albums back this year.There are no more foes to vanquish; like a new phase of Marvel movies, you get the sense of her scraping the barrel for conflict to mine, sucking the IP dry, lacking the imagination to explore and analyse tensions beyond rote hero/villain drama. The Life of a Showgirl was billed as going behind the scenes of Swift’s life on the Eras tour. One imagines her backstage, alone with her grindstone and axe, getting that thing really good and sharp.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftPop and rockCharli xcxcommentShareReuse this content"

Routledge was a talent like no otherKeeping Up Appearances actor Patricia Routledge dies aged 96Patricia Routledge – a life in picturesZoe WilliamsFri 3 Oct 2025 11.53 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 11.55 EDTSharePatricia Routledge,who has died at the age of 96, could have become a TV institution earlier than she did – she had a part in Coronation Street when it was still in black and white in 1961. She was the foxy cafe owner, Sylvia Snape, flirting with tradesmen and upselling cheese baps, and everything about her – from her frisson to the fact that she had her own set, a little cafe – screamed regular-character energy. But she “just knew, inside, that I needed to have other adventures,” she said on Parkinson, nearly 40 years later. She then spent the 50s, 60s and 70s mainly on stage, in jaunty-sounding musicals (How’s the World Treating You?) lost to posterity. She had a stunning voice that the small screen rarely found a proper use for, and was a longtime member of the RSC.Mrs Snape was the last time she played the romantic interest, and the first time, she said later, she’d been offered a role that wasn’t significantly older than her. An episode of Z-Carsand a couple of appearances in Steptoe and Son later, she was back as the title character in Plain Jane in 1977, an extravagantly weird, extremely British rumination on the class system (maybe this is unfair, but the inquiry seems to be: who would have thought that a working-class woman who isn’t pretty would know so much?).View image in fullscreen‘Regular-character energy’ … Patricia Routledge as Sylvia Snape in Coronation Street.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockShe was 40 before she considered herself to have an acting career, she said once, and in her mid-50s, by the time she started working with Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood, both of whom would have called her a muse, if people who wrote with their kind of self-deprecation would ever have used a word like “muse”. Routledge did Bennett’s stand-alone TV play, A Woman of No Importance, in 1982, in which she’s an inflexible, overbearing spinster who dies alone. Her performance was almost certainly part of the inspiration for Bennett’s groundbreaking monologue series, Talking Heads, which first aired in 1988, with Routledge first playing Irene Ruddock – another overbearing spinster who ends up in prison – and then Miss Fozzard who, through a series of quite normal events, ends up in a transactional relationship with a foot fetishist (“very kinky”,she said in 2007. “I didn’t really enjoy it”).She loved performing Bennett, saying later: “The fact that his work is microcosmic, he sees the world in a grain of sand – and the sympathy, the humanity. I know those women. It’s in one’s bloodstream, almost. There but for the grace of God, one could be one of those tragic spinsters, a lone person fighting bureaucracy.” It was commented upon – well into the 90s, and with dispiriting regularity – that Routledge herself had never married, and perhaps this was Bennett’s jumping off point, into his imaginative universe in which not having a husband was the worst thing that could happen to a woman. In fact, she didn’t seem to mind much that she’d never found the prospect of a man “quite exciting enough, as an alternative” to her career, and Bennett definitely fell for her as an actor rather than an emblem of thwarted femininity. Sending her a script once, he wrote: “I’m sorry if you find there are echoes, but I can hear your voice.”View image in fullscreen‘She could yammer away for ever’ … Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances, alongside  Clive Swift, playing her husband, Richard.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyAround the same time, in 1985, in fabulous counterpoint, Victoria Wood wrote her as Kitty, this brassy, garrulous creation who could bring furniture to life with her comic charisma. In 1990, Hyacinth Bucket – who insisted her surname was pronounced “bouquet”, a weirdly memorable detail we’ll still have long after we’ve forgotten how to pronounce our own names – arrived in Keeping Up Appearances. A sitcom of manners, it was very different; a grotesque, really, but plainly tapping into a Routledge quality: that she could yammer away for ever, and even if the entire dramatic point was to be totally unlistenable, you nevertheless wanted to listen. That’s quite an elegant and enigmatic art, and her own origin story, about her relationship to comedy – that she fell in love with it as a child, going to the Argyll music hall in Birkenhead every Monday night – doesn’t really nail down her uniqueness.View image in fullscreen‘Brisk and redoubtable’ … Patricia Routledge in ITV’s Hetty Wainthrop Investigates.Photograph: Ronald GrantHetty Wainthropp, an adaptation of the novel Missing Persons by David Cook, started as a two-hour adaptation for Yorkshire TV. Fun but clunky, it became episodic for four seasons. Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, on the BBC, saw Routledge through to the end of the 20th century. She was brisk and redoubtable and could see through humanity like a pane of glass but liked to help it out all the same, “flying the flag for the senior citizen”, she said later, though she considered herself “younger than springtime”.“Getting a performance together seems like starting on a long walk,” she said as Wainthropp reached the end of its run. “There in the distance, there is a tiny speck of a character, that you have an idea of in your imagination, and bit by bit, you come closer to each other. If you manage to meet up, link arms, and go off in the same direction, then you’re in business.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPatricia RoutledgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was a celebrity who loved sex, jewels and marriage (she got hitched eight times). And her surname is spectacular (it’s as if she knew Tay-Tay was coming).In the official notes on her new album, Life of a Showgirl, Swift writes this about track two, Elizabeth Taylor:View image in fullscreenSilly but fabulous … Taylor as Cleopatra in 1963.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveElizabeth Taylor is one of the most ultimate, quintessential showgirls I could ever imagine. You know, not in a literal sense as much as she was under a microscope so, so intense and she handled it with humour and she got along with her life. She continued to make incredible art and so this is a love song kind of through the lens of the motif of what she had to go through in her life and sort of the parallels that I feel in my own life. You know, role models are pretty hard to come by, but I would absolutely say that she’s one of mine.The pair are also strikingly similar. Swift came into the world fully formed. So did Liz. Where Taylor went around saying: “Hi, I’m I’m 11. I want a record deal – call me!”, preteen Liz launched herself at Hollywood. Age 12, she was cast as the lead in girl-meets-horse drama, National Velvet, and was so instantly perfect – acutely vulnerable, brooding and mischievous (especially great in scenes with aforementioned animal and her on-screen mum, Anne Revere) – that the world fell at her feet and stayed there.Like Swift, she handled adolescence with aplomb. Or seemed to (Swift has talked about the eating disorders that made life secretly agonising; Taylor, too, had a complicated relationship with food). But on screen, at least, she simply bloomed, appearing in a string of classics. She was a suitably annoying and adorable Amy, in Little Women, ie as fab as Florence Pugh in Greta Gerwig’s version. She was poutily gorgeous in Father of the Bride.The hidden life of Elizabeth Taylor – as seen by her son: ‘Her love for Richard Burton never went away’Read moreThen came the big leap. Taylor manages to be sophisticated, tantalising and above all earthy as rich party girl, Angela, in outrageously doomy melodrama, A Place in the Sun, (alongside the beautiful and talented Montgomery Clift; think Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty? Check out Clift). By the way, the strapless white “debutante dress” worn by 17-year-old Liz got lots of attention and deserved to. People go on about the way it made Taylor’s waist look tiny. Which is icky. But the fairytale gown is stunning (designer Edith Head, immortalised as Edna Mode in Pixar cartoon, The Incredibles, really knew her stuff) and isjustthe kind of thing Swift loves to swan around in on stage. Guilt-free dressing up. Why not?Not every film Taylor made was a work of art. Cleopatra is incredibly silly. But Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Suddenly, Last Summer and Butterfield 8 (for which she won her first Oscar) have all aged well. In these movies, Taylor seethes and roars with utterly plausible sexual yearning and frustration. She’s got a libido. And she’s proud of it. She’s also fantastically raw in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (for which she won her second Oscar). You can’t take your eyes off the frayed and charismatically chaotic Martha. The venom she directs at Richard Burton’s George is especially priceless (“I swear ... if you existed, I’d divorce you.”)View image in fullscreenPower couple … Taylor and Richard Burton on the set of  The Sandpiper in 1965.Photograph: API/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesElizabeth Taylor’s 20 best performances – ranked!Read moreTaylor’s fondness for salty jokes was legendary and many of her best gags were directed at the opposite sex (“Some of my best leading men have been dogs and horses”). But if she could be insouciantly cruel, she was also kind. She doted on Clift (who tragically was never able be open about his sexuality) and adored the bisexual James Dean, whom she met on Giant (she once gave him a kitten, which he named Marcus). Her support for gay rights was unwavering. She spoke out, about HIV/Aids, when it was still massively controversial to do so. Her very best quote on being a queer ally: “There is no gay agenda; it’s a human agenda.”Taylor had affairs with men she probably should have avoidedand got back together with Richard Burton too many times. But her wayward and much-chronicled search for love is just part of her story. Swift, (a wordsmith still underestimated by snooty types), puts it so well: “She was under a microscope so, so intense and she handled it with humour.” She sure did. Taylor once said people loved to peer at her, up close, so they could go home and say: “I saw Liz Taylor and you know what? She ain’t so hot!”Swift hearts Taylor. And now everybody’s talking about Elizabeth. Members of gen Z and gen A are probably YouTubing her film clips this very second. Truly, it’s a fabulous day.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftElizabeth TaylorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Inside Sally Wainwright’s joyous, raucous TV show about menopausal punksZoe WilliamsThe Happy Valley creator has turned her darkest hour into a rebellious tale of midlife women uniting in musical anarchy. The team behind the highly awaited drama talk vodka, rock’n’roll and hot flushesFri 3 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTShareRiot Women, Sally Wainwright’s hotly awaited new drama, will be billed as a menopause show, and that’s fine – a show can be proud of such a shorthand in 2025, and besides, there’s a lot of menopause in it. Lorraine Ashbourne stars as Jess, a smart-mouthed pub landlady, leading her best life (house full of grown kids and grandkids, a boyfriend who does literally everything she says. “I have, in Jerry, written a weak man,” says Wainwright, contemplatively, as if it’s the first time that’s ever happened. “But he’s very likable”).Nonetheless, Jess is overwhelmed – like all of us – by the state of the world, and decides to start a rock band for a refugee fundraiser. She needs bandmates, naturally, so enter Tamsin Greig as Holly, a retiring police officer, Joanna Scanlan as Beth, a ground-down teacher andAmelia Bullmoreas Yvonne, a midwife with a stick up her arse. They’re joined by Rosalie Craig as Kitty, a very hard-living shoplifter, significantly younger than the others – she’s late 30s/early 40s in this role, the others are all mid-to-late 50s – but also menopausal. Her USP is incredible charisma and a stunning voice, belted out at pub karaoke with vivacious rage, when she isn’t drinking neat vodka straight from the bottle or vandalising cars.Riot Women, the band, come together at once – the show starts off with the energy of a one-last-heist drama. They’re planning to do an Abba cover, until Beth rebels. She’s absolutely done with being nice. She’s been a competent pianist, accompanying school choirs all her life; she wants their music to express what they’re actually feeling. The songs they end up with – composed for the show by indie-punk two-piece ARXX – land in the bit of the Venn diagram where punk meets the menopause: an absolutely uncompromising “fuck you”.View image in fullscreenHands in the air … (from left) Amelia Bullmore, Rosalie Craig and Tamsin Greig in Riot Women.Photograph: BBC/Drama Republic LtdNo question, this is an unflinching look at the realities of the Change (sorry, I still love the euphemism – it sounds so satanic). Its plotlines include Kitty having a hot flush while she’s being arrested for wreaking havoc in a supermarket. Yet Riot Women is also about ageing parents, dealing with dementia, workplaces that have changed their sensitivities but only for some people, the long arc of feminism and who got screwed by it, plus adult children and why they are a pain in the neck.It’s also about music: the entire cast learned their instruments, some from scratch. The battles over their setlist drive a lot of the drama. The unlikely relationships, especially that between compliant Beth and delinquent Kitty, are forged at the keyboard. They all learned separately before a studio date where they had to get together and perform as a band. Because they’re playing their own instruments, the songs were written to reflect both their gutsy mood and their technical rustiness.Bullmore remembers: “Even when you can’t play, it still sounds so good. We had this date we were working towards … I can’t remember a date looming as big since having a baby!”“Riot Women is about women, at a certain age, when menopause is one of the things that’s happening to you,” says Wainwright. “But you’re dealing with a lot that you didn’t see coming, or that you knew was coming and you’d chosen to ignore. I wanted to find a way to talk about it that was energising and uplifting and offered a solution. For me, it started when my mum developed dementia. I was menopausal; I started to feel invisible.” I raise an eyebrow at this – it was peakGentleman Jack, she had a global fanbase, I interviewed her back then and she looked magnificently visible. But that’s not how it felt: “You know, your career’s big and you’re pulled in a lot of directions, and in the middle of all that, I was turning into this little old lady.”The show opens with Beth about to take her own life, under the pressure of a mother with dementia and an entirely unfeeling brother and boss. Wainwright says, understatedly, that when she started writing it, “I was quite low. And I wanted that journey, of two women who’ve reached the same point. Because Kitty’s trying to kill herself [through vodka] as well, in a more flamboyant way. Beth’s going out with a whimper and Kitty’s going out with a bang. I wanted to start with two women who are really low, and allow them to find something they never imagined was going to happen.” I suggest to Wainwright that Kitty is a bit of an idealised portrait of addiction – because alcoholics, in real life, tend not to be so charismatic. She simply smiles enigmatically at this, but Craig says later, “Sally would always say: ‘I don’t think Kitty is an addict. I just think that she’s self-medicating.’ She always fought Kitty’s corner.”Scanlan is such a fascinating actor – you feel what she’s feeling even in the most slapstick moments ofThe Thick of It– and here there’s a scene at the secondary school, where she discloses that she’s considered suicide, and her boss brushes her off because he’s reprimanding her for speaking sharply to a colleague, that I still feel vividly indignant about. “When I wrote that scene,” Wainwright remembers, “the women I was working with all had similar anecdotes: you’d been in a situation where you’d said something you didn’t realise was wrong, but at the same time, nobody’s looking out foryourmental health, as you’re accused of upsetting someone else’s.” The older woman as someone who can be asked to do everything but whose needs never have to be considered – a beast of burden, if you like – is in large part what all these characters are rebelling against.Scanlan says: “It’s specific to our generation of women. Punk came along in 1976 but it was probably 77 or 78 before it got to a girls’ boarding school in north Wales. I had this drama teacher, Jan Morris, handing me a copy of [feminist magazine]Spare Riband encouraging me to stuff a sponge up my vagina instead of using Tampax. A generation of women were liberated by 70s feminism, which was then completely and utterly suppressed by the feminism that happened during the Thatcher years.”Those broad social expectations – that you had to be liberated one way one minute, then unburn your bra and comply to a different kind of liberation the next – have been mirrored, naturally, in menopause discourse, so that it was “a shameful word until very recently,” Scanlan says, “and then it was expressed as a crisis. You’re [talked about as] a survivor. That’s not my experience of growing older. The wisdom-of-the-crone idea I find rather appealing.”It has been a mountain to climb, says Greig, in the creative industries as much as anywhere else. “The conversation is only moved on by you moving it on, bit by bit. I was working on a job, it was one of those really hot days, and it was unbearable. Nobody was saying anything. And of course, with my menopause head on, I was getting hotter and hotter, then flushes, then the brain fog, and then I had to remember the lines, and I just said: ‘No, it’s actually impossible to do this.’ And people said: ‘Yeah, it’s hot isn’t it?’ and I had to say: ‘Yes itishot, but for a menopausal woman, being this hot means that I cannot do my job.’” Greig doing an impression of herself, yelling at you, is comically endearing – nothing like the stock image of menopausal rage, because (newsflash)life isn’t.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As part of her research, she spoke to Louise Newson, the doctor who’s really raised the profile of hormone treatment, “and she said: ‘Tell me something about your life, your mum.’ I said: ‘She’s got dementia, she’s got osteoporosis.’ And she said: ‘That’s two reasons why you should be on HRT already.’”Riot Women isn’t all about hormones, except in so far as life is; and the ensemble is so strong there’s no real main character, apart from, in a way, the punk band itself. While the show is “a rallying call for women to fight for visibility”, as Ashbourne says, the music serves “to reignite their passion. Riot Women reminds us that joy isn’t something we outgrow … and it’s something worth fighting for.”Riot Women starts on 12 October on BBC One at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSally WainwrightTamsin GreigAmelia BullmorefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But while the new movie has a director and writer attached, we’re still none the wiser as to who will play the super-spyBen ChildFri 3 Oct 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 11.24 EDTShareIt’s James Bond Day this Sunday, if you didn’t know – 5 October is now a celebration of all things 007, thanks to this being the date of the world premiere of Dr No, the very first Bond film, starringSean Connery, in 1962. Imagine it as a bit like Star Wars Day, with fewer Wookiees and Ewoks and a whole lot more tuxedoed swagger.This year though, the advent of JBD (as no one has ever called it) is bit of a damp squib. It hasn’t been that long sinceDenis Villeneuve was announced as the directorof the next Bond film (June, in fact) and even less time sincePeaky Blinders’ Steven Knight was hired to write the script. But there’s been little to no sign since then of the new 007 actually being revealed, and even less sense of where this venerable franchise is going next. All we have arewhisperings on the wind via the Hollywood tradesto the effect that the film-makers will be looking for a relatively youthful (in his 20s or 30s) Brit, who could be a person of colour but is not going to be a woman, a franchise star, or anyone we’ve vaguely heard of.This is, of course, disappointing news for the hordes of online bookmakers who have been making a pretty penny for months now out of trying to convince punters that it is a race between Callum Turner,Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Henry Cavill, Theo James, Leo Woodall and that hunky guy in Saltburn who’s secretly Australian.Intriguingly, the last time the movie franchise actually went for a complete unknown was in 1969, whenGeorge Lazenbybriefly took up the Walther PPK. Before that, Connery himself certainly wasn’t a star: he had had a few minor film roles and done a bit of stage and modelling work (he was famously in the chorus line of the touring version of South Pacific) as well as working as a bodybuilder and milkman in Edinburgh before taking the lead role in Dr No. Producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman specifically didn’t want a household name; they wanted someone fresh whom audiences would accept as Bond himself, rather than as an actor playing Bond.Repeating this trick could turn out to be an ingenious move, just as it was in the early 1960s.But getting Villeneuve involved means that there is no get-out clause at all if this new Bond turns out to be a stiff. Dialling up the exploding pens and innuendo is no longer an option when your new director is a solemn auteur of genre film-making best known for ponderous sci-fi epics where the loudest sound is the audience’s own existential dread.View image in fullscreenA bruiser in a dinner jacket … Daniel Craig in 2006’s Casino Royale.Photograph: Sony Pictures/AllstarAnd yet, in many ways, hiring Villeneuve tells us everything we need to know about the new post-Daniel Craig direction. There are not going to be any invisible cars or double entendres, and we probably won’t be getting Sheriff JW Pepper back any time soon either. All of this is, of course, absolutely fine if you like your 007 with a modern twist. But it doesn’t tell us how Villeneuve’s take on Britain’s suavest state-sponsored assassin will stand out from the 007s who immediately preceded him (especially if the new era doesn’t choose to take the whole story back to Ian Fleming’s original 50s and 60s setting).Craig was immediately recognisable as a new kind of dapper super-spy when he arrived on the scene in 2006’s Casino Royale, a bruiser in a dinner jacket who would never be caught dead in an invisible car, or trading sex puns with Denise Richards while defusing a nuclear warhead. He made Pierce Brosnan’s gadget-addled smoothie, who only a few years previously had been considered by some as the best Bond since Connery, look like a karaoke Connery left too long in the microwave. Not that this is anything new. Lazenby (briefly) followed Connery, Brosnan followed the underrated Timothy Dalton, and cheesy late-era Roger Moore followed brilliantly dead-eyed and callous early Roger Moore. Every era of 007 redefines the last one, yet they are all in their own way James Bond 007, and worth raising a glass to. It’s just a little weird, as we apparently celebrate this year’s Bond Day, that we are being invited to toast one who doesn’t even exist yet.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekJames BondThrillersSean ConneryPierce BrosnanGeorge LazenbyDaniel CraigfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now that pivotal period has been brought to the screen – with The Boss’s approvalAlexis PetridisFri 3 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 06.56 EDTShareTwo years ago, film director Scott Cooper and writer Warren Zanes were summoned to Bruce Springsteen’s house in New Jersey. In a sense, the meeting was a surprise: as Cooper notes, Springsteen was known for “saying no to every overture about making a film of his life since 1986”. But something about the screenplay Cooper had written had clearly piqued his interest. It was based on Zanes’ book Deliver Me from Nowhere, not a traditional career-spanning biography, but a forensically researched history of Springsteen’s 1982 album Nebraska, which Zanes calls “the greatest left-turn performed by someone who is operating at the top of the charts in musical history”.Released between Springsteen’s first US No 1 album, 1980’s The River, and the world-conquering Born in the USA in 1984, it was a stark, lo-fi collection of demo-quality home recordings made in the singer’s bedroom while he was battling depression. Its songs were haunted by the ghosts of the 1950s teenage serial killer Charles Starkweather and the Italian-American mobster Philip Testa, and by Springsteen’s strained relationship with his father, a remote, hard-drinking blue-collar worker, whose paranoid schizophrenia was only diagnosed later in his life.Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere review – solid biopic both embraces and avoids clicheRead moreIts echo-laden sound occasionally bore less resemblance to the heartland rock that had made Springsteen famous and more to the notoriously confrontational electronic punk duo Suicide. Springsteen’s manager Jon Landau’s first reaction to the album was to suggest Springsteen seek “professional help” from a psychiatrist, which he subsequently did. He also declined to promote the album, refusing to give interviews or tour. It was, unexpectedly, a top five hit on both sides of the Atlantic.It’s an intriguing story, albeit one fraught with challenges for a film-maker: after all, as Cooper notes, it is essentially the story of someone writing and recording an album alone, in their bedroom. “How do you capture the writing process in a cinematic way? How do you capture what a man is dealing with when he’s alone in his bedroom? How do you make the silence cinematic? How do you make a story about a man who is very interior, and who is unravelling, cinematic?”Still, the omens for their meeting augured well. Springsteen seemed enthusiastic. Moreover, he appeared to be in good spirits, despite suffering from a peptic ulcer, greeting them with some cheesesteak sandwiches that, Zanes wryly suggested, seemed to speak loudly of a career that’s involved selling more than 140m records: “very high-quality steaks with some sharp cheddar melted on them, held between two slices of toasted artisanal bread – no one stopped at Subway to pick these up.”View image in fullscreenTormented … White as Springsteen in Deliver Me from Nowhere.Photograph: Macall Polay/20th Century StudiosBut fancy sandwiches notwithstanding, Cooper found the experience “nerve-wracking”. For one thing, he’d been a huge Springsteen fan for decades: he had got into the habit of listening to Nebraska and 1995’s similarly stark The Ghost of Tom Joad while writing screenplays. “I listened to them while I wrote two films I made with Christian Bale, Out of the Furnace and Hostiles, because they’re about men who are at times afraid to say out loud what they’re dealing with, what they’re capable of in the dark, things that give voice to their pain, and [the albums] speak to the loneliness that American men are enduring and a kind of spiritual devastation.”For another, he now had to read the script out in front of Springsteen and Landau, “who are both cinephiles. Before he was Bruce’s manager, Jon Landau wasn’t just a rock critic, he was a film critic, he was married to Janet Maslin from the New York Times for years. These men know movies. So I’m at Bruce’s house, and I’m reading the screenplay aloud, all the dialogue and all of the action. Every so often, Bruce or Jon would say something and I’d quickly jot it down, just to correct something I’d written, make it more authentic. And then, at the end of it, I remember Bruce hugging me and saying: ‘This is it – let’s go.’ At that point, I knew we were off and running.” He laughs. “Once I’d regained my sea legs.”View image in fullscreenSpringsteen in London, 1982.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/ShutterstockIndeed, Springsteen’s enthusiasm for Deliver Me from Nowhere is hard to miss. Unlike Bob Dylan, who gave last year’s acclaimed biopic A Complete Unknown his blessing, then a very wide berth indeed (he didn’t even attend the premiere), Springsteen has turned up at film festivals to promote it, telling the audience at Colorado’s Telluride festival that he’d finally broken the habit of a lifetime and agreed to the making of a biopic because “I’m old and I don’t give a fuck what I do now”, jumping on stage in New York in order to praise the actors’ performances, launch another of his broadsides against Donald Trump and sing his 1999 track Land of Hope And Dreams.Long before that, he was a regular visitor to the film set – obsessive Springsteen fans being what they are, you can find an itemised list of dates he showed up online. Cooper says his presence helped “ensure authenticity every step of the way”. Odessa Young, who plays Springsteen’s fictional love interest Faye, was absolutely delighted by his appearance. “I got to hang out with the greatest musical idol of my life and ask him a bunch of questions,” she says. “To see him walk into [legendary New Jersey club] the Stone Pony on the day we were shooting there and reach behind the counter and crack a beer, and just be like, a guy in his hometown – it was amazing.”Nevertheless, it’s perhaps worth sparing a thought for Jeremy Allen White. The star of The Bear was Cooper’s first pick for the movie’s starring role. He talks about him as “one of the greatest actors of his generation”, with a combination of “humility and swagger” that mirrors the film’s subject: without wishing to sound mercenary, the fact that The Bear helped make White a huge and immediately recognisable star – the New Yorker described the response toWhite’s ad campaign for Calvin Klein as “a frenzy”– doubtless doesn’t harm the film’s commercial appeal.View image in fullscreenWhite as Springsteen with Odessa Young as Faye.Photograph: 20th Century StudiosWhite was a non-musician prior to taking on the role of Springsteen – he says he spent “month after month” taking lessons, beset by the thought that “there’s no way I’m capable of this and this is never going to come together”. Having finally mastered both the guitar and a hugely impressive evocation of Springsteen’s singing voice, he found himself in the unenviable position of having to pretend to be Bruce Springsteenin front of Bruce Springsteen.“There is an incredible weight to playing any real and especially living person,” he says. “That sense of responsibility is always going to be stronger and larger, especially when you are dealing with someone like Bruce who is known and loved by so many. I think in the beginning I was almost too concerned with my understanding of Bruce or the public’s understanding of Bruce and it was kind of paralysing at the start.“After getting through that initial fear, I realised the only way to go about it and get in was to take Bruce Springsteen out of it and approach it as a young man who is a musician on the brink of this global stardom, who is trying to make a record and be inspired, while visiting his past and his home and his relationship to his family dynamics and trying to figure out what the future would hold … In order to get started, I almost had to forget him for a moment.”There is an incredible weight to playing a real living person, especially someone like Bruce, who is loved by so manyOf course, forgetting Bruce Springsteen is easier said than done when Bruce Springsteen is literally watching what you’re doing. “I think in the first week, it was difficult for me because I think my job as an actor is to try and shake the fraudulence that you might feel. It’s difficult to shake that stuff when you’re faced with the man you are playing. It’s hard to get lost and pretend at times and sync into your own reality and fake environment, however beautifully it’s crafted. That first week was tough, but then he became a sort of guide, even in silence with me. I thought he was there to tell me what was right or wrong about how things happened, but as time went on, I realised that he was there to give me and Scott and all of us permission to make the film. I also quickly realised, however fragile I was feeling at times having Bruce there, how Bruce felt just as fragile, if not more, witnessing the recreation of those moments that he experienced in isolation and loneliness.”White says Springsteen rarely interacted with him on set, but in the evenings would text him, “picking out the smallest of moments, a glance, the way I was seated or listening to someone else, just moments that were particularly true or honest to him. At the end of the [working] day, I would feel pretty beat up and doubtful oftentimes. So that all went a long way.”Whatever their interactions, the performance worked: White has been tipped for an Oscar, for his role in a film that, in one sense at least, is very much a period piece, an evocation of both a moment in Springsteen’s career and an era in pop music that have both long receded into history. As Zanes points out, Nebraska was released into “the dawn of the digital era”, a world where the compact disc was about to be launched, and MTV was just beginning to gain traction – two developments that Nebraska chafed against, with its rough sound, cover featuring a photo not of Springsteen but a dark landscape through a car window anda video for single Atlantic Citythat Springsteen only acquiesced to on condition that he didn’t appear in it.View image in fullscreenWhite, Cooper and Springsteen on the set of Deliver Me From Nowhere.Photograph: Bobby Bank/GC ImagesMeanwhile, the doubts its author felt in 1982 about the prospect of superstardom had clearly been banished by the time he released Born In The USA in 1984, with its pop-oriented sound and iconic videos prominently featuring a newly muscled-up Springsteen: it was the first compact disc manufactured in the US for commercial release, became the bestselling album of 1985 and turned Springsteen into the global megastar he’s been ever since.And yet, Zanes says, period piece or not, something about Nebraska and its making seems to speak to a more modern era. For one thing, he sees it as an album with a huge impact on subsequent rock music, that made “people open to the possibilities of stepping out of the commercial recording facility and seeing where else”: his book quotes Matt Berninger of the National calling it “the big bang of indie rock that was about making shit alone in your bedroom … every band that went after a lo-fi, DIY kind of thing – Pavement, Silver Jews, Guided by Voices, all the early indie stuff. It’s like when [Bon Iver] made For Emma, Forever Ago – I’m sure they were trying to make their version of Nebraska.”For another, Zanes suggests the story of Springsteen labouring away in his bedroom, and the unvarnished album that emerged as a result, has a broader resonance in 2025. “I look at my own kids and what they’re listening to and everything has tuned vocals – I’m not talking about autotune, I’m taking about what happens in studios with engineers looking at waveforms so even if they can’t hear an imperfection, they can see it, and who isn’t going to fix something that looks wrong. We’re all fixers … the world of social media, online dating – you can really tweak your profile and avoid the risk of turning red, being seen wearing the wrong thing, having your hair look a little fucked-up. And the problem with all of this is that we’re putting layers between ourselves and the next person.“But Nebraska is this emblem of ‘this is me, this is where I am at, and due to its imperfections, it’s going to be a little closer to the truth of my moment’. So it’s a story about 1982, but it’s also a story about right now. I hope one thing the movie does is make us all think about going out the door less than perfect and slightly more human because of it.”Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhereis released in the UK, US and Australia on 24 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmBiopicsBruce SpringsteenJeremy Allen WhiteSpringsteen: Deliver Me from NowherefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was claiming the prize forClash of the Comics, the bombastic night that throws comedians and pro wrestlers into the ring, when Ed Gamble stormed in, knocked everyone out, and swanned off with the belt. “Well,” corrects the comedian and Clash co-founder Max Olesker, “we were knocked down by his henchman.” Hulking pro wrestler Bullit was the one to clothesline him and his comedy partner, Ivan Gonzalez. “I think I could have taken Ed if he’d been on his own,” huffs Olesker.The popularity of pro wrestling has fluctuated since its golden era in the 1980s. At the start of this year, WWE made the leap on to Netflix with an eye-watering $5bn (£4bn) deal, inching the skimpily clad, heavily muscled combat sport higher in the public consciousness. In Britain, it has a rich working-class history, growing from the grassroots to raising some of the greatest international contenders such as Will Ospreay and Zack Sabre Jr. Now, wrestling is dipping a greased-up toe into the theatrical limelight, with a smattering of productions across the UK welcoming new audiences through alternative performance lenses, from comedy to queer cabaret to a living sculpture that uses bondage to suspend disbelief.View image in fullscreenRope work … A Still Lives performance in Melbourne in 2022.Photograph: Tim CarrafaOlesker, who used to be the UK’s youngest pro wrestler as Max Voltage, was the one to introduce Gonzalez to wrestling, putting on a match in the student union at university. “The atmosphere was electric,” Gonzalez remembers. “It’s this larger-than-life pantomime: good versus evil.” Forming a comedy duo together as Max & Ivan, the pair decided to blend the art forms for a show at the Edinburgh fringe, convincing pro wrestlers that they weren’t making fun of them and persuading comedians to throw themselves off the ropes.The Wrestling, as it was then called, won the Edinburgh comedy award and has rocketed in popularity since.Renamed Clash of the Comics, the brutal showdown that saw Rosie Jones defeat Greg Davies at the O2, as part of the 2023 Just for Laughs festival, is about to take over the Hammersmith Apollo, west London, where for the first time it will stand outside a wider comedy festival. The lineup includes pro wrestlers Simon Miller, Cara Noir and La Cyclonica, with comedians Aisling Bea, Flo & Joan and James Acaster, who has issued an open challenge to any comedian or wrestler willing to take him on. And, naturally, Wang needs to win his championship belt back from Gamble. Commentating from the sidelines, Nish Kumar will be cheering for the rule-breaking baddies, Sara Pascoe will support the good and righteous, and Greg James will give an impartial play-by-play.Comedyis key to the night, but the show’s success relies on the spectacles in the ring. “They’re both performance art,” Olesker considers. “You travel the world, you react to an audience. It’s a real meeting of disciplines.”Logistically, the event is a nightmare. The comedians are sent to wrestling school to make their transformations possible. “I guess in the same way that Strictly Come Dancing teaches the celebrities not to become professional dancers, but to dance a very specific dance,” Gonzalez says, “we teach our comedians to wrestle for one specific moment.” The comics often come with ambitions of spectacular moves, which the team do their best to realise. “And much like Strictly,” Olesker adds, “all our wrestlers and comedians are having affairs with one another.” He keeps a straight face. “It just makes the whole thing fly.”Wrestling is drag – you have an alter ego, you’re getting the audience on your sideWrestling walks a constant tightrope between reality and pretence. “You’re training your body to be an athlete,” says Heather Bandenberg, who runsFist Club, an LGBTQ+ cabaret night pitched as “Wrestling but gayer”. Melding queer performance and pro wrestling, the night features back-flipping drag kings, anarchic performances from pro wrestlers and an openness to the types of bodies that tend to be excluded from the mainstream. “You’re training to be a gymnast and you’re doing elements of stunt,” Bandenberg says. “It hurts.” One of the early moves a wrestler learns is how to “bump”, the classic move where they throw themselves on to the floor in order to imitate the impact of being thrown by someone else. The impact is real, even if the weight distribution and choreography lessen the pain. “There is an element of danger,” says Bandenberg. The liveness exaggerates this, as shows teeter between planned and improvised. “It’s one of the few performance art forms where the reaction of the crowd informs what will happen,” says Olesker. “People won’t do an extra scene in a Shakespeare play if people are really into it.”Bandenberg stumbled upon wrestling by accident, quickly falling for the space it allowed her to take up. “WWE has never been a great place to be a woman,” she says. “I saw the main world of wrestling and was like: This isn’t for me. But I found I wasn’t the only person who felt like this.” She formed the event with pro wrestling drag kings Rich Tea and Rocky Rhodes. For them, the collaboration between wrestling and cabaret seemed obvious. “Wrestling is drag,” Bandenberg says. “You have an alter ego. You’re getting the audience on your side.”Run for queer and female wrestlers, Fist Club leaps between venues across the UK and sells out fast, with some audience members having been persuaded to start wrestling themselves. Primarily featuring smack-talking drag kings, the night has a quota of 10% of straight male wrestlers: “Because that’s what it’s like to be a woman or queer person on a normal wrestling show.” The audience of their last show included a vicar in her 60s, who apparently had a glorious time. “We want it to be open to people who have never seen wrestling before,” Bandenberg says.A successful match relies on the sell: the performance. “You’re trying to make the audience believe you’re actually getting, you know, completely totalled in the face,” Bandenberg explains while miming knocking herself out. All the hosts are careful to make everything as safe as possible for their shows, but injuries aren’t uncommon. Olesker broke his ankle in the first show. In training, Bandenburg jumped off the top rope and broke both her big toes. “But I’ve got off lightly,” she shrugs.View image in fullscreenDrag place … A Fist Club event in May this year.Photograph: Rob Brazier/The Head DropIn Glasgow, the speed of a typical wrestling match is being frozen in time for a new piece of performance art. Luke George and Daniel Kok are the artists behindStill Lives, an installation using shibari, a rope-knotting bondage technique typically used in kink practice, to construct still images in the air. Adapting the piece to every city it moves to, they wrap people up, heave them high and suspend them, creating these breathing images with Australian rules players in Melbourne and rugby union players in Auckland. They are particularly interested in using underrepresented bodies. It’s not always sport; in Venice they wrapped up a gondolier. “We’re looking for something that can give us a sense of what life is like in that city,” says Kok.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Audiences will watch as the pair are carefully tied and hauled up, then slowly brought back down and undone. Coming from dance and performance backgrounds, the artists are invested in endurance and what the body is capable of. “We’re working with degrees of discomfort and endurance,” George says of the physical demands on the participants, “but it’s not sitting in pain for an hour.”Bondage drags with it certain assumptions about violence and dominance, yet both shibari and wrestling delicately navigate care, consent and power. “It’s about trust and communication, about listening to each other and watching for cues,” George says. They’ve been surprised by the similarities between the art forms, with each relying on watchful adjustments throughout. “Wrestlers have ways to communicate when there’s a certain narrative arc they’re trying to achieve,” Kok says, “so they’re looking out for each other even while they’re fighting.”Wider popularity for wrestling may come in waves, but for the truly dedicated, commitment is unrelenting. Months are spent organising getting the Clash of the Comics comedians to wrestling school. The Fist Club fighters train multiple times a week, with Still Lives capturing this devotion by stretching out the patient endurance of preparation. Through their chosen styles, these artists want to celebrate the sport, welcome new supporters and show that wrestling doesn’t belong to a single gender, shape or style.“There’s so much happening live,” says Bandenberg, “done by people who love it. They’re not getting rich off it, they’re just seeing it as a creative art form that brings joy.”Clash of the Comicsis at Hammersmith Apollo, London,8 October; Fist Club is atColour Factory, London, 11 October, andLost Horizon, Bristol, 8 November;Still Livesis at Tramway, Glasgow, 25 October.Explore more on these topicsWrestlingComedyPerformance artGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s Alan (Partridge) review – nothing else on TV has this many laugh-out-loud momentsThe fictional broadcaster remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, as he returns with this hilariously sloppy look at mental health. Is anything as joyous as watching his blunders? Surely notJack SealeFri 3 Oct 2025 04.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 13.37 EDTShareAlan Partridge is in crisis! But then, who isn’t these days? Last time he was on television, Alan was melting down live on air while hosting the light magazine show This Time, ending the series quite literally locked out of the BBC. At the start of his new, self-produced project, the light documentary How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge), the broadcaster reveals he’s since hit another low by fainting into the lap of a female interviewee during a corporate event for Norfolk agribusiness stalwarts Bannroyd Animal Feed. Tough times, but personalities of Partridge’s calibre know how to bounce back: tie your troubles to a national trend and see if you can get a series out of it.How Are You?, then, sees Steve Coogan’s immortal alter ego in roving factual mode, looking into an epidemic of anxiety, stress and loneliness that he feels is worsening: “If I can use an outdated term, it’s just got mental!” The journey will see him experiment with religion, reconnect with friends from school and take a lot of restorative country walks, as well as confronting his recent past. Episode one builds towards a hostile but cathartic reunion with “Sidekick” Simon Denton (Tim Key), Alan’s former colleague on This Time and North Norfolk Digital radio, and as this new series goes on, we’re shown unseen clips from Alan’s stints on both.‘Partridge is more popular than me – that’s a given!’ Steve Coogan on Alan’s glorious returnRead moreFor Coogan and his long-term writing/directing collaborators Neil and Rob Gibbons, How Are You? is a sideways move. Whereas This Time pushed Partridge into new territory, How Are You? often retreads it: as well as directly reviving old formats, the whole piece resembles the mockumentaries of the 2010s,Welcome to the Places of My Lifeand Scissored Isle. And, as Alan’s private life bleeds into his investigations, we’re most strongly reminded of the podcast seriesFrom the Oasthouse.That presents a small problem. There are two Alans: Winning Alan (currently has a big paid presenting gig) and Wilderness Alan (doesn’t), and although Wilderness Alan was the star of the faultless TV sitcom I’m Alan Partridge back in 1997, a more wistful Wilderness Alan has recently taken flight, in books and From the Oasthouse. How Are You? places us inside the oasthouse and casts Katherine Kelly as Katrina, Alan’s wildly unsuitable paramour from the podcast. But that tragic tale – Alan is in denial about Katrina cheating on him with his friend and local tanning-centre mogul, the unseen Darryl Flench – feels like one that would have benefited from the slower pace of audio-only Alan, where the listener’s imagination can co-write the comedy. When we can’t see him, Wilderness Alan has room to breathe: television nowadays feels more suited to putting Winning Alan under pressure and watching him implode, as happened onThis Time.These, however, are quibbles in the face of one large, undeniable fact: whatever medium he inhabits, Partridge remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, and even placeholder Partridge has more laughs-out-loud per half-hour than anything else on telly. How Are You? is produced and directed by Alan, as well as starring him, which opens up his genius for sloppy errors and poor editorial decisions. If he thinks Britain’s mental health problems are best illustrated by an aggressively edited montage of exploding fruit, that’s what we’re getting, and there’s nobody to tell him that he’s accidentally used the word “tastistics” or the phrase “mental bealth henefits” in his voiceover. The slight grimace we regularly catch as he strides out of shot, knowing on some level that that piece to camera was another balls-up, never stops being funny, and nor do the idents he’s made to fit between segments, the best of which sees him attempt to fix us with a sympathetic smile while simultaneously swallowing a mouthful of humble British tea.Is there anything more joyous than Alan grunting as he squats down next to a skip, or apologising to an off-screen passenger for sweeping biscuit crumbs too forcefully from a train table? Surely not. Visually he’s a feast too, with his new dye job several shades too light to be plausible, and his 2025 wardrobe featuring mustard chinos, black-and-white pundit pumps, an arsenal of body warmers and an enthusiastic overreaction to the news that rugby shirts are back in fashion.Plus, the subject matter here allows for the glimpses into Alan’s soul that have been there ever since the Gibbons brothers took over co-writing duties. More than once the series pulls off flashes of pathos, where Alan’s lack of self-awareness reveals a sadness that almost has us crying tears of emotion, before the persona snaps back in and we’re crying from laughter again instead. That can happen because we’ve loved him for so long: any version of Alan Partridge is always welcome back.How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge) is on iPlayer and airs on BBC One on 3 October at 9.30pm.Explore more on these topicsAlan PartridgeTV reviewSteve CooganTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

We’re beyond excited.”Marks said images of the prints did not do them justice and you had to see them up close to appreciate their “presence and impact”.The prints were intense and vivid and full of life, she said. “Honestly, the reason we don’t sell them that often is because people just do not want to part with them. They are so treasured.”Marks said Hockney had had a long-lastinglove affair with technology. “Since the 80s he experimented with tools that you were more likely to find in an office than an artist’s studio – he would use the photocopier, fax machine, Photoshop,” she said.Hockney was also an early adopter of the iPad, first released by Apple in 2010, and soon began to see its potential.The Bradford-born artist moved his base from Los Angeles to Bridlington about two decades ago, finding inspiration in the often overlooked beauty of the Yorkshire Wolds.In 2011 his plan was to paint the arrival of spring on a country road called Woldgate. He planned to paint on an easel starting in January but the unpredictable winter weather made that tricky.Hockney is someone who feels the cold, it has been said, but there were also the problems experienced by painters for centuries. “Outdoors, especially in northern Europe, the scene is constantly changing because the light conditions seldom stay the same for long,” the critic Martin Gayford wrote in the exhibition catalogue for Hockney’s 2012 show.“The sun moves, clouds move over the sky. Painting, on the other hand, takes time. A finished picture might take many hours or days to resolve.”View image in fullscreenLot 102 from The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate (2011). Hockey said ‘Turner would have loved’ the iPad-based approach to drawing.Photograph: Sotheby’sIn the same catalogue, Hockney explained his thinking. “I got one of the first iPads, so I had been drawing on it for seven months before I began these landscape drawings of the seasons,” he wrote. “It took me some months to learn the technique but by then I knew how to get anything I wanted, almost.“It’s a superb medium for some things. Turner would have loved it. You can be very, very subtle with transparent layers.”Hockney, 88, has continued to use his iPad and drawings from his time in Normandy will feature in ashow next yearat the Serpentine gallery in London.The prints being sold by Sotheby’s come from a single collection and are being sold individually, with estimates ranging from £80,000-£120,000 to £120,000-£180,000. The lowest total estimate is £1.7m. They will be sold on 17 October.Explore more on these topicsDavid HockneyDrawingArtThe art marketnewsShareReuse this content"

A man in a T-shirt cradles an infant, a kid in sneakers sits glumly in the foreground. Overhead in the towering clouds, the Lamb of God stands on a white altar amid the clustering gleam of golden pendulous stripes evoking the presence of God.The scene, humane and magnificent, is a part of what is perhaps the most significant new piece of public art in today’s riven America.From a Utah church to a Denver museum: the man who found 75 pyramids in the USRead moreTitled What’s So Funny about Peace, Love, and Understanding (after the Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello song), the 25ft-tall multi-part mural by New York artist Adam Cvijanovic celebrates the church and city’s tradition of welcoming immigrants. In this particular time of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents dragging people off the streets, it constitutes a prodigious rallying cry – a luminous affirmation of empathy and solidarity.“What I want people to realize from the mural,” declares the artist, “is that we’re all in this together. And to have this enormous platform to say something like that is an extraordinary privilege.”St Patrick’s, known as “America’s parish church,” serves about 2.5 million New York Archdiocese Catholics. It’s one of the two most important cathedrals in the country and by far the most visible with 5 million visitors a year. What’s So Funny about Peace, Love, and Understanding represents the largest permanent artwork commissioned by the cathedral in its 146-year history. Prominent art adviser Suzanne Geiss curated the project.In Cvijanovic’s competition-winning vision, his mural realizes archbishop cardinal Timothy Dolan’s longtime wish to commemorate the celebrated apparition of the Virgin Mary, with Joseph, St John the Baptist, the Lamb of God and angels, at a little rural church in Knock, Ireland, in 1879, the same year St Patrick’s was consecrated.View image in fullscreenAdam Cvijanovic in front of his mural.Photograph: Richard Drew/APCvijanovic expands that commemoration to include Irish immigrants of yore – St Patrick’s was the New York church of Irish immigrants – and New York’s broader multicultural immigration. He further honors New York figures notable for their service, both religious and non-religious.The mural’s long west wall, flanking the cathedral’s main doors, features a quintet of historic local Catholic notables on one side and on the other, a quintet of modern-day uniformed first responders. Over each grouping hovers a monumental angel in a setting again of those gleaming stripes evoking God’s presence. On the north wall, the Knock apparition’s main holy protagonists float in lustrous glory above bygone Irish arrivals disembarking from a ship. The newcomers are rendered mainly in the whites and blue-grays of a faded photo or film. On the south wall across from them, in colors rich and bright, the throng of today’s immigrants includes in their midst Italian-born Mother Cabrini, the 19th-century patron saint of immigrants, and Cuban-born Father Félix Varela, a 19th-century activist for immigrants and the poor. Some of the newcomers look aloft, others gaze ahead resolutely; others seem to be waiting, perhaps listening. There’s a reverberation here, for this viewer, of the crowd at the Sermon on the Mount.For the five west-wall Catholic notables the archdiocese named Irish-born archbishop John Hughes, who commissioned the building of St Patrick’s; Dorothy Day, the ex-bohemian New Yorker turned social activist for the poor; and Pierre Toussaint, the former enslaved Haitian who became a New York society hairdresser and major Catholic benefactor. Cvijanovic added New York state’s 17th-century Saint Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American canonized, and picked Al Smith, the popular New York politico of the 1920s and 1930s, cigar in hand. The first responders were Cvijanovic’s idea too. He’d personally witnessed their brethren in action in the apocalyptic smoke at Ground Zero on September 11.The mural’s painting style is straightforwardly representational – a deeply purposeful choice.View image in fullscreenCardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, with Adam Cvijanovic.Photograph: Diane Bondareff/AP Content Services for the Archdiocese of New YorkBecause this is an American painting, Cvijanovic tells me, not a European one. “Europeans have hundreds of years of incredible ecclesiastical art,” he said. “They don’t need to do it that way any more. But we do.” The European sort of “anchor sanctuary art-faith places” don’t commonly exist in the US. So when thinking about making imagery for one of the country’s most important churches, Cvijanovic wanted the mural to be “foundational”.“From a European perspective, the painting is completely retrograde,” he says. “But from an American perspective, it’s needed to form a basis for other things to come out of.”The Americanizing showcases Cvijanovic’s melting pot of influences. He loves John Singer Sargent, evident in his dashing flair with an Irish immigrant’s complicated dress. John Ford is a “massive” influence – the movie director’s way with figures against a landscape. The lineups of Catholic notables and first responders mirror Eastern Christian iconostases – but posed as if in action-movie hero posters a la X-Men. Meanwhile the great angels in their spread-winged splendor are inspired by Byzantine masterworks.And why does the angel over the first responders cradle a firefighter’s helmet and police hat? It’s an emblem of succor and protection that Cvijanovic recalled from a statue of the Virgin Mary cradling a miniature fishing boat atop a seamen’s church near Boston. He even tucks in a little portrait of Mexico’s Diego Rivera (high up on the south wall), an artist’s homage to Rivera’s notoriously removed 1933 leftist mural across Fifth Avenue in Rockefeller Center.The 64-year-old Cvijanovic has become a leading practitioner of very large-scale art, with, among numerous examples, an epic mural sequence of empty American-involved battlefields for the Bean Federal Center in Indianapolis, and an extravagantly tumultuous depiction of a scene from DW Griffith’s movie Intolerance for a New York gallery. He grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, son of a Serbian immigrant architect who worked closely with Walter Gropius, the German immigrant master of the Bauhaus. Gropius gave him a set of colored pencils when he was a kid, Cvijanovic recalls. He didn’t go to art school. “I didn’t want to make art the way they would teach,” he says simply.View image in fullscreenAdam Cvijanovic’s mural in St Patrick’s Cathedral.Photograph: Richard Drew/APThe mural’s enormous labor involved about 30 people, including an eminent fine-art gilder for the (very costly) upper-mural stripes of gold leaf, platinum and heated titanium. It took Cvijanovic five months to sketch the work in his huge studio in Brooklyn’s Navy Yard, then nine months for the arduous painting – clambering up and down a scaffold to gauge things, and carrying sketches of the angels to the cathedral to assess them taped to the empty walls.I tell him that the final work, radiant and profoundly stirring in its grandeur and humanity, fits seamlessly into the cathedral. The gleaming stripes seem to merge into the pipes of the cathedral’s great organ above. “Well, my father was an architect,” he replies. “So I understood how to plan for the space.”As for Cardinal Dolan, who is retiring – and who controversially just nowcomparedthe murdered Charlie Kirk to St Paul – he declared at the mural’s presentation to the press: “Some have asked me, are you trying to make a statement about immigration? Well, sure we are, all right? Namely, that immigrants are children of God.”“We’re all in this together, “Cvijanovic repeats to me. “Whether we like it or not,” he adds. There are Trump supporters among the models. And multiple different religions. “But shared humanity means shared humanity,” he insists. “It’s not reserved just for whom you get along with.”Explore more on these topicsPaintingNew YorkArtUS immigrationIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

From poor voice acting to bad characterisation, one fan explains why their beloved show has to goGeorge Francis LeeFri 3 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 3 Oct 2025 12.07 EDTShareIf I had to pick a specialist subject, it would beThe Simpsons. I reference it incessantly. I can recall episode names and showrunners by heart. I annoy my friends and loved ones by reciting lines as they play out on the TV. I love The Simpsons.It’s also the worst thing on television.Revealing yourself as a Simpsons fan comes with inevitable qualifiers: “Not the new episodes!” Most people want their favourite show to last as long as miserly TV executives will allow. Not me. I would gladly see The Simpsons sent to the knacker’s yard, rather than given a second movie,as was announced earlier this week.Fans agree the show pales in comparison with the quality of its “golden era” – a period usually defined somewhere between seasons one through eight – where it had a mind-boggling roster of talent. With the likes of John Swartzwelder, George Meyer and Conan O’Brien, the show’s writers were masters of slice-of-life, absurdist, high- and low-brow comedy, often jumping between them in a single gag.The Simpsons pushed what was acceptable on television, particularly with Bart’s smart-aleck underachieving and Homer’s penchant for beer, food and general laziness. President George HW Bush famously once said that his goal was to make American families “a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons”. A few years later, The Simpsons retaliated by having Homer fist-fight Bush in a sewer.Yet much of the beauty was the show’s wacky cynicism rubbing up against its sentimentality. Co-creator Sam Simon is often credited as helping to ground the characters in a reality unseen in cartoons up until that point. Nearly all the main cast were treated as multidimensional actors rather than drawings on a screen; in one episode Homer Simpson might go to space, in another he’d grieve the abandonment by his mother.View image in fullscreen‘Springfieldians are now oversimplified caricatures of themselves’ … Homer Simpson in the Simpsons movie.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyBut The Simpsons hasn’t truly been good since 1997, meaning the show has been in decline for as long as I’ve been alive. Now we are beset with season after season of awful, awful episodes. Ironically, the show was already lampooning the growing difficulty in keeping itself fresh all the way back in 1995. AsTroy McCluresaid in The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular: “Who knows what adventures they’ll have between now and the time the show becomes unprofitable?”It’s impossible to explain succinctly why modernSimpsons doesn’t work. It’s not funny, sure. But Springfieldians are now oversimplified caricatures of themselves – something so evident inNed Flanders’ transition from a well-meaning and church-attending neighbour to a relentless Christian fundamentalist that it spawned the term “flanderisation”.Perhaps more importantly, the show is less interested in shaping culture and more interested in chasing it. In its more mundane form this can be seen in the show’s cringeworthycouch-based take on the Harlem Shake. At its worst, you only need to look at the sycophanticElon Musk episode, or the Marvel and Star Wars crossover slop made after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox.Recently, the quality of The Simpsons has only suffered more by the loss of some of its iconic voice talent. Mainstay Marcia Wallace, the voice of Mrs Krabappel, died in 2013, followed by the death of Russi Taylor, voice of several side characters like the ever-bullied Martin Prince, in 2019. And of course, Pamela Hayden, who voiced fan favourite Milhouse since 1989,retired from the showlate last year.Viewings are a far cry from the 90s too, with season 36 often not cracking more than one million viewers per episode. Then there’s the declining voice quality of actor Julie Kavner, whose iconic gruff voice for Marge now sounds as pleasant as polyp surgery, and Harry Shearer: when he voices characters like Mr Burns and Ned Flanders, he comes off like he’s doinga bad impression. With recasts already a precedent, how long until artificial intelligence is used to skirt the limitations of actor mortality? Hank Azaria, the voice behind bartender Moe and the axed Apu, has already written anop-ed predicting that very outcome.And yet, despite falling ratings and a struggle against existence itself, a sequel to 2007’s The Simpsons Movie is in the works. Not only that, but Fox has commissioned four more seasons, meaning when it hits season 40 in 2028, The Simpsons will be the same age as Homer is in the show.View image in fullscreen‘A slight uptick in quality’ … The Simpsons in their 2007 movie.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyAdmittedly, The Simpsons Movie was a slight uptick in quality – no doubt thanks to the return of many of the sitcom’s best writers. But what can the Simpsons family do now that they haven’t already? What joke, what fresh take on Springfield can we really expect 36 years in? When The Simpsons started, it was a subversion of saccharine sitcom titans like The Cosby Show; today, it’s become just as hackneyed.The Simpsons has given us so much: new ways to tell jokes and new ways to write television. Many of its best moments are still passed around in meme form. It has made us laugh. It has made us cry. It even embiggened our vocabulary with perfectly cromulentadditions to the dictionary. But when the doughnuts start to go stale, you don’t keep them around for another 27 years – you chuck them out.Explore more on these topicsThe SimpsonsAnimation on TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The mode is reminiscence: we hear about a lost childhood friend from the council estate where he grew up in 1970s North Ayrshire; about former colleagues at the London Review of Books, where O’Hagan made his name in the 1990s; about his adult daughter’s bygone imaginary friend. He considers why actors, politicians and Republicans make bad friends, why the novelist Colm Tóibín makes such a good one, and how the experience of friendship is shaped by bereavement and the internet.The latter, for O’Hagan, is more damaging than the former, which maybe isn’t surprising for a writer who likens friendship to “a set of loyalties that turn in the head like old records”, and worries that people no longer go to pubs because they’re too busy shopping online. “In the age of the internet, what exactlyisa friend? … Can you swear by someone whose voice you’ve never heard …?”, he asks, not seeming to mind terribly much – strangely, for an author so companionable on the page – that this isn’t really a feature of online life so much as writing itself; Gutenberg, not Zuckerberg.In these pages, friendship liberates where family constricts. Growing up with three brothers, O’Hagan’s household was a “zone of adversities”, a “palace of stress”, with an unloving father who once had their dog deliberately driven out into the countryside and set loose, never to be seen again. At primary school, respite lay in tooling around wastelands with Mark, a neighbour his own age. “A great friend can summon a new world order, and, best of all, the beginnings perhaps of a new person for you to be, tugged from the constraints of home.” Later, O’Hagan revises the formula to call another friend’s fellowship “a passport to being the kind of person you wanted to be”.Metaphors of migration and rebirth feel potent in a book suffused with implicit wonder at the distance O’Hagan has travelled since boyhood. On one page, he’s stacking shelves as a teenager at his local Tesco in Ayrshire; on another, he’s at a party for a new girlfriend at “the Donna Karan store on Park Avenue”. He makes no bones about being an inveterate name-dropper – clubbing with the Stone Roses, whisky with Christopher Hitchens.But while a lot of life happens in these pages, it’s no tell-all. O’Hagan knows that friendship is rarely just a bowl of cherries, yet he’s discreet, even coy, about the subject’s shadow side: snubs, misunderstandings, fallings-out (“I know a famous actor who wanted me at his wedding, but he didn’t even reply when I invited him to mine”). The level of access, of disclosure, only goes so far: while there’s a brief mention of his aborted attempt to ghostwrite Julian Assange’s memoir (the WikiLeaks founder struggled “to befriend himself”, says O’Hagan, diplomatically), there’s nothing about his lengthy reported piece for the LRB on the Grenfell Tower fire, interesting in this context if only because the ensuing furore must have reminded him who his friends were.Partly for these reasons, the most intriguing item here concerns the late Irish novelist Edna O’Brien, whom he first met in London in 2009 after leaving Seamus Heaney’s 70th birthday party. When he invites her to lunch at the Wolseley in Mayfair (“Perfect … ask for the corner table, Lucian Freud’s table”), it’s the beginning of a 15-year friendship during which “we called upon each other to complete thoughts we were unable to have alone”, in O’Hagan’s curious phrase, glancingly elaborated on when he later recalls “the soft sonatas we used to listen to while I helped Edna with her manuscripts”.Of the various names dropped in these pages, she’s the only one permitted an insight into O’Hagan himself. In most of his anecdotes, he’s the guy who comes out best – whether as a schoolboy weeping over Charlotte’s Web when cruder classmates laughed, or as a hardy reveller who is nevertheless earliest to rise the morning after a big night out – so your ears prick up a little when, apropos of nothing, O’Brien tells O’Hagan (observed, for once, rather than observing) that she can see he’s “a wounded man who handles it very impeccably and very plausibly”.For a memoir – which is what On Friendship is, however piecemeal – that would seem to leave money on the table, to say the least. Ultimately, these memories and musings – in appealingly slimline hardback, eminently gift-ready – leave you wondering about the larger autobiography O’Hagan might write, if and when he chooses.On Friendship by Andrew O’Hagan is published by Faber (£12.99).

Her science fiction is full of journeys to different worlds, and many of these poems reference journeys too, both in this world and into the next. After the Death of Orpheus imagines Orpheus, after being torn apart by the Maenads, casually making his way down the track to the underworld, where he sees a slight figure waiting for him, Euridice. Other poems are more earthly, focusing on cattle, birds, a mouse killed by her cat, but even this smallest of creatures, as it’s carried to the trash, is given a soul by Le Guin. Cows calling for their calves from the train that takes them to the abattoir are “your sisters”. Landscapes are here too, sometimes under threat, sometimes evoked with beautiful simplicity, as in Autumn: “gold of amber / red of ember / brown of umber / all September”. Images of death in nature inevitably lead back to age and mortality, sometimes accepted as part of the natural process, elsewhere angrily resented, as in the poem about the death of Le Guin’s mother Theodora. Yet it is her own impending death which increasingly takes centre stage in the closing meditations on “extreme age”, hope mingling with despair as the body declines, approaching the end where “the wire / gets higher / and they forget / the net”.View image in fullscreenThrumsby Thomas A Clark (Carcanet, £12.99)A nature poet of minimalist tendencies, Clark’s career spans more than 50 years; during that time he has developed a style that by stripping away some of the hallmarks of the lyric – the personal voice, the argument, the rhyme – returns poetry to a purity of perception that gives us not poems about nature, but nature itself. The poet, all but absent, is like a sounding board for his environment, and he reports back to us about his encounters: “be one who / when the lightest breeze / thrills through you / takes note”. There is no moulding of the material into a personal experience here, there is no epiphany, rather the body becomes a vehicle for absorbing its surroundings, and as it leans into the rain, the self dissolves into the landscape: “a part of you on the rocks / a part of you in bog cotton / a part of you snagged on wire / a part of you unravelling”. Glimpses of gossamer, willowherb, deer, and owls are delicately interlaced with the language of music – the thrums of the title – which lulls us into a state of unfolding perception, caught in the moment before it is processed by thought. The poems figure environmental damage as well as beauty: “who cares for the dune gentian / who cares for the barn owl / who who who”. Yet by metamorphosing the repeated question “who cares?” into the cry of the barn owl – “who who who” – Clark shows us that by identifying with nature, of which we are always already a part, we might find a way.View image in fullscreenScullingby Sophie Dumont (Corsair, £12.99)If you like getting into a canoe, but sometimes struggle getting into contemporary poetry, this could be the book you have been waiting for. The title refers to the act of propelling a boat using two oars, one in each hand, but also brings to mind skulls; boats, death and water mingle together into a heady concoction. Holding an oar, for Dumont, is like holding a pen, and in To Kayak we are reminded of the parallels between poetry and kayaking – for just as on a river we might “know a town from the echo of its bridges”, poetry likes to look at the world differently. The Curse describes Dumont’s apprenticeship at a canoe club, which she soon comes to see as a “sanctuary for the cursed”: “One man broke both his legs …Another drowned … [the coach] died at twenty by aquaplaning into a tree and I left the club”. This is a tightly knit collection, and subsequent poems continue the theme of water – there’s a stunning memory map of Exeter quay, instructions on how to right a kayak, botanies of the riverbank and a universal declaration of river rights. You won’t get wet reading this book, unless, likeDylan Thomas, you combine your poetry reading with serious drinking, but you will emerge cleansed, and reminded that human beings are 60% water.Magadhby Shrikant Verma translated by Rahul Soni (And Other Stories, £14.99)Like Italo Calvino in Invisible Cities, Verma explores mythical cityscapes, here conjured from the ancient Indian kingdom. Its palaces and fountains, its temples and streets, its markets and beggars, are now silent or have turned to dust, and it is inhabited by fading memories, the scents of courtesans, malevolent spirits that reanimate corpses, and revenants, who pace the ruins: “Here I see Magadh, / here it disappears – /…/ this is not the Magadh / you’ve read about / in books, / this is the Magadh / that you / like me / have lost”. This world of cadavers is conjured in a language that itself is stripped to the bare bones, as in Heaney’s bog poems, yet which paradoxically oozes life, colour and pathos. In one poem, a soldier shuttles aimlessly back and forth between ruins: “Why does he play out the same scenes / over and again?” First published in Hindi in 1984, two years before Verma’s death, and here published for the first time in the UK in Soni’s luminous translation, this haunting and haunted masterpiece resonates louder than ever in our own times, with its stark images of cities pulverised by invading armies: “… nothing / remains // except a pile of rubble / that every now and then / shouts / Who / created me”.Explore more on these topicsPoetryPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

Heck, it’s even directed by O’Brien’s son, Linus O’Brien, a fact you couldn’t really miss given interviewees frequently allude cosily to Richard as “your dad”. Given its provenance, it’s no surprise that no one here says, as they do in the rival documentary, that the 1975 film adaptation is a “shitty fucking movie” – but nevertheless there’s honesty on display, mostly about the slapdash origins of the project and the later mistakes made, including the huge flop when the original stage production tried to transfer from Los Angeles to Broadway.But even the most diehard Rocky Horror sceptic would have to concede that this account does a more than competent job of explaining what the Rocky cult means to fans. That goes especially for queer viewers who saw their first glimpse of an out-and-proud identity baked right into the plot, and a community that grew up around the film that might accept them for who they were. We get personal, quite moving testimonies from various devotees including drag performer Trixie Mattel about how much it all meant to them, especially those living in areas where coming out was especially challenging. Even more touching are the recollections of one guy who ran away from home and ended up being a hustler in New York City at the height of the Aids epidemic, but feels his survival and HIV negative status may be owed to the fact that he spent every Friday and Saturday night out of circulation in a Greenwich Village cinema doing the Time Warp. Jack Black, meanwhile, remembers how the midnight screenings with their audience participation turned him on to the idea that rock music and theatrics could intersect and create joy.Of course, fans will be most excited by the big-name interviewees here, which encompass just about every one of the major players who are still alive. These include a now-fragile Tim Curry whose voice is rich as ever if a shade or two huskier;Susan Sarandon, remembering how she had to change digs every two nights when they were filming in Bray in England because the budget was so measly; and a still gamine Nell Campbell who has fond memories of working with the late Meat Loaf on set. Plus, there are many contributions from director Jim Sharman, producer Lou Adler, and costume designer Sue Blane whose wide eyes and giddy manner is so echt-costume designer-y one could die of delight. Through it all we see Richard O’Brien himself, sometimes jamming on a guitar and dropping crisp bon mots, right up to the end when he gets just a little bit weepy thinking about it all.

Steffan Donnelly’s finely detailed production casts the Montagues as Welsh speakers and the Capulets as not. It’s a neat dramatic conceit that in its most successful moments finds striking new fissions within the familiar stage traffic.View image in fullscreenEasy swagger … Steffan Cennydd as Romeo and Owain Gwynn as Mercutio.Photograph: Marc BrennerIsabella Colby Browne’s Juliet is often playfully petulant, complemented by Steffan Cennydd’s easy, prepossessing swagger as Romeo. Eiry Thomas’s commanding Ffrier Lorens makes an impression and Llinor ap Gwynedd’s excellent turn as the Nyrs, mostly English-speaking but with a broad Welsh accent, is imbued with a new dramatic complexity within the bilingual conceit. After Capulet strikes the Nyrs, calling her a “mumbling fool” for having uttered a Welsh sentence, all kinds of violent prejudices are bracingly exposed in a single, pithy sentence.Similarly, in the seclusion of her cell, the Ffrier and Romeo privately confer in Welsh, but respond to intrusive knocks from the outside world in English. All of this is evocatively staged on Elin Steele’s set of staircases and alcoves, which uses water to great effect – cleansing while also portending catastrophe.While the ambitious concept opens the possibility of exploring linguistic identity, intertwined with familial and class allegiances, its impact feels nebulous when the deployment of different languages is not underpinned by dramatic logic and instead seems arbitrary. The experience can feel discordant and the scenes performed mostly in one language or the other (and one particularly elegiac sequence with no words at all) are more compelling.Staged in association with the Globe, the production’s tour will end on the bank of the Thames where perhaps such conceptual dissonances will be less of an issue to audiences unfamiliar with the Welsh language. As a production, it clearly speaks from thecalon. But as well as that heart, you yearn for more logic.AtSherman theatre, Cardiff, until 3 October.

Dancers strewn across the stage, moving in sporadic tugs and jerks, or writhing flesh-to-flesh or just flat out on the floor, dressed only in nude-coloured pants and knee pads. Sweat and exhaustion is the mood.This is Andrea Peña’s Bogotá. Peña, from Colombia and now based in Montreal, has a background in design but is now an award-winning choreographer. And hers is the opening show of this year’s Dance Umbrella festival, which is bringing new voices in dance to the UK.Bogotá is inspired by mythology, spiritualism and magical realism. It’s about how bodies hold memory, grief and post-colonial identities – or that’s the blurb anyway. The setting is a kind of “no place”: some scaffolding, plastic sheeting hanging from the ceiling, stuff you might find backstage. In the opening voiceover, Peña says something about building bonds and imagining new futures, but it’s difficult to bond when the mood is alienation. This is more like revolt than rebuilding, moving towards anarchy. At one point, the powerful dancer Frédérique Rodier stands atop a speaker stack giving the middle finger to the sound of an operatic chorus. It might be an “up yours” to colonialism (I’m guessing the struggle for Indigenous land and rights in Colombia is part of this, but we’re grasping in the dark really).View image in fullscreenFlat out … Andrea Peña & Artists: Bogotá.Photograph: Raphaelle Bob GarciaWhen they actually dance, in surprisingly organised sequences, the movement has raw energy, punch and power, and sensual stretch. There’s one point where they gather as a pack at the front of the stage, moving as one like a nest of vipers.There’s a strand of contemporary dance where the dancers are really going on a journey, it’s a trip, a ritual of transformation. You can see it when they come to at the curtain call, dripping with sweat, eyes blinking in the light. But is it enough to be a witness to that? What’s in it for us in the audience?And yet. There is something bold, visionary even, in committing to an alternative world on stage, where you have to let go of time and any other expectations – whether that’s satisfying viewing or not.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 3 October.Dance Umbrella festival continues until 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsDanceSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then, the very different losses of two friends brought out a newfound sense of furyFri 3 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareSilvana Estrada spent 25 years “not knowing how to get angry”, she says. “That cost me so much energy and dignity.” Sadness, though, she had always understood: “I live with her very close to me.” Now 28, the Mexican singer-songwriter grew up outside Veracruz, a city on the Gulf of Mexico, “witnessing violence from so many angles”: rampant femicide, narcoculture, environmental attacks on the coffee plantations and rivers of her home. As a lonely teenager, she discovered Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald. They helped guide the darkness she felt and introduced her to vocal improvisation. Estrada, born to a family of luthiers, started making her own music, played on a four-string Venezuelancuatroand inspired by Mexicanson jarocho(folk music). The title of her acclaimed 2022 debut,Marchita, translates to “withered”; the record offered a spare, devastating, deeply poetic account of first love gone awry.“I consider her one of the richest artists of our time,” says her peer and mentor, the Mexican songwriter Natalia Lafourcade. “Her voice is freedom, it is birds of paradise, it isMexicoand Latin America. It reflects a deep connection to love, nature and human relationships.”This album is like a pendulum between beauty and terrorEstrada still loves that album, she says today, sitting in a New York cafe. It earned her a Latin Grammy for best new artist and critical raves. But afterwards, she says, “I really wanted to do something with my humour. After Marchita, I was a little bit trapped in this character that issadanddark, very eloquent, very solemn. That is also me, but I wanted to show myself in a way that’s even closer to how I really am.” Estrada talks with tender humour about that serious young girl, so animatedly that her sparkly rose-shaped earrings swing. Some of Marchita’s songs dated back to when she was 18, she says: “All this eloquence, darkness, I see it as so much naiveness because I thought that was the only way to talk about love and dreams.”View image in fullscreenEstrada playing at La Onda festival in June 2024, in Napa Valley, California.Photograph: Christopher Victorio/ShutterstockHer second album, she decided, would be poppier, lighter. But then unexpected losses forced her to get acquainted with an even darker side of her personality. Estrada’s new lyrics are stark with recrimination and brutal despondence: for ex-lovers who couldn’t reciprocate; for a friend who ditched her “because he couldn’t stand that my career was” – she shoots her hand upwards – “and his wasn’t. I got so depressed after that. I thought, ‘I cannot believe that I’ve been loving you as my brother all these years and you don’t want to see me because you feel small?’ That shocked me so much.”She channelled her indignation into Good Luck, Good Night, a fabulously melodramatic, comic kiss-off for something as pathetic as “el ghosting”. Every line feels as though it should be accompanied by the wayward slosh of a glass of wine. “Sometimes our lives are like a telenovela – infinite drama and suffering,” she says, referencing the high-octane Latin American soap operas of her youth. “Which is true, to be alive is to suffer, but being ghosted, the fact that someone who is alive decides to be a ghost for you – it’s so miserable!” She still sounds offended. ‘It’s funny because I guess it shows how small we can be.”During the process of writing, “I was like, wow, anger is really helpful,” she says. “Anger is this energy that really wants you to be responsible for your needs and your limits. It’s beautiful, strange, uncomfortable, almost like a grandmother telling you: ‘What are you doing? You don’t want this.’ We need anger, actually, to fight for our lives and the lives of others.”But Vendrán Suaves Lluvias (Soft Rains Will Come) doesn’t sound angry; it’s one of the year’s most unabashedly beautiful albums. After futile attempts to make the record with four other producers, Silvana decided to do it herself. She realised: “‘You’re the only one that knows what you want.’ It was so irresponsible to let in other people, to ignore my own desire.” She augments hercuatrowith swooping flourishes of strings, piano and woodwind, her commanding voice brimming with compassion. The bright, dewy Como un Pájaro (Like a Bird), nominated for best singer-songwriter song at next month’s Latin Grammys, is as fresh as a spring morning. She was surprised by the joyful melodies that came out of her. “As I get older, I understand the importance of pleasure and joy, even during hard times. This album is like a pendulum between beauty and terror.”The insult of being ghosted paled next to the tragedy of losing her best friend and fellow musician, Jorge, who was brutally murdered alongside his brother and uncle in December 2022. “This is a little bit embarrassing, but I didn’t value friendship very much when I was growing up,” she says. “I was a little bit weird. I liked music that nobody was listening to. I was very isolated. Even the friends I had were super mean to me. I’m supersensible[sensitive].” Her first real friend, Jorge taught her what friendship was. “Someone that loves you, accepts you, who has the generosity of telling you: ‘Hey, you did this and I didn’t like it,’ or, ‘This is amazing, I love you.’ We were inseparable.”When Estrada wanted to move to Mexico City, her parents were unsure until they heard that Jorge was going too: “They loved Jorge so much. He was like an older brother to me.” When she started touring, he came too. “I enjoyed so much feeling loved, not so like this super lonely child.”With Jorge, says Estrada: “I could be a child again. My heart was so light. And now my heart is heavy. I’m getting used to it.” Grave and sharpened by sudden bursts of strings, Un Rayo de Luz (A Ray of Light) is her tribute to him. It was written during a residency at the house of the late singerChavela Vargas, her hero, and interpolates her words: “¿Cómo será de hermosa la muerte que nadie ha vuelto de allá?” (How beautiful must death be when no one has returned from it?) “I really want to believe that,” she says.The killers were caught. “They’re gonna die in jail,” says Estrada, “but justice is the minimum. The state, everybody, failed us. I can’t even believe in jail. I believe in reintegration.”Estrada has always been vocal about justice: one of the earliest online hits for her is a 2018 video supporting Mexican abortion rights, three years before they were legalised. In 2022, she released the song Si Me Matan (If They Kill Me) after the student Mara Fernández was murdered by a ride-share driver. “I try to use the voice I have and the space that has been given to me as an example of empowerment, especially for little girls,” she says.Lafourcade was that example for Estrada. She returns the compliment. “She is undoubtedly the voice of young generations, with a soul and heart of great sensitivity,” says Lafourcade. “I see her as an old soul and wisdom within a young body full of vitality and beauty in every sense.”‘Doubt is exciting’: cellist Mabe Fratti on chaos, curiosity and climbing volcanoesRead moreIn 2023, Mexico’s then president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, played Estrada’s music as part of an effort to deter young people fromcorridos tumbados, the genre of regional Mexican trap popularised byPeso Plumathat has been accused of glorifying drug cartels and stoking violence. Estrada says she was “honoured”, but feels otherwise conflicted. Instead of cancelling this kind of music, she says, “we should talk about why people are admiring people who are killing us, killing our freedom, killing all the things we love.” She adds: “In Mexico, there are so many things we need to start talking about, and we need to involve everybody. Conversation is important to change your reality.”Listening to herself helped Estrada become accountable to her own feelings. Writing the ultimatum Dime (Tell Me), she realised she didn’t want an ex to stay;shewanted to leave. “It was such a useful thing to realise you can always turn around and walk away,” she says. “For me, it was hard to understand that I could just say no.”She links it to Greek mythology, specifically the Furies: goddesses of vengeance depicted with horrifying facial features. “My interpretation is that they were angry because of all the injustice on Olympus. Nobody wants to feel connected to the Furies because they’re ugly – it’s a reallymachista, misogynist conception of female fury. But I actually feel much more connected with their spirit than the rest of the goddesses: OK, I’m gonna have snakes instead of hair and one eye in myfrente– I don’t care: I just want to be whatever makes me happy, or more alive, or better.”Vendrán Suaves Lluvias is released via Glassnote on 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicMexicointerviewsShareReuse this content"

As he struggles to reach the hospital where his mother lies dying, he is angry and afraid, tormented by memories of their changing relationship. He recalls the moment the phone rang with the command to hurry to her bedside, the moment he witnessed a fatal attack during the conflict that drove them from their home, the moment he ceased to recognise his mother’s face, calling her only “the woman with the blond hair”, such – we gather – was the traumatic impact of exile on them both.Wahab’s reminiscences loop, falter, intertwine. The resulting spoken monologue, adapted by Wout van Tongeren from a novel by Lebanese-Canadian writerWajdi Mouawad, runs almost continuously through the work. In Oum’s UK premiere, it was a tour-de-force delivered by Dutch actorNadia Amin, who conjured the unthinkable on the nearly empty stage of Barbican Hall as she ran and froze, stamped and cowered.But the narrative is also haunted by music. There is no chance that Wahab’s mother (his “oum”, in Arabic) will die soundlessly. WithinBushra El-Turk’s score – part opera, part soundtrack, part commentary on the unfolding story – the work’s fleeting silences are shocking in their intensity. Amin was amplified but still periodically swamped by the waves of delicate trills and tremolo, long curling lines of unison melody and brief, catastrophic dissonances of the music.View image in fullscreenNadia Amin (left) as Wahab in Oum – A Son’s Quest for His Mother.Photograph: Mark AllanBorn in Britain to Lebanese parents, El-Turk often stages dialogues and tensions between different musical languages. Oum is scored for the culturally hybrid forces of theAmsterdam Andalusian Orchestra, whose players (strings, percussion, flutes and accordion plus theoudandqanunof traditional Arabic music) switched between ornamental filigree and searing lyricism, the accordion providing single, ethereal sustained notes and harsh cluster chords in alternation. A trio of singers, sliding virtuosically between Middle Eastern and European operatic idioms, echoed some of Wahib’s English phrases but otherwise sang in richly melismatic Arabic. Towards the end, the trio’s smoky, velvet-voiced contralto Ghalia Benali performed the song that underpins El-Turk’s score:“Al Atlal” (The Ruins), one of the signature numbers of mid-century Egyptian superstar singer and Arab national treasureUmm Kulthum. While many in the audience hummed and clapped, Japanese conductorKanako Abe, who had energetically coordinated passages of improvisation and intricate scoring alike, put down her baton to nod along, smiling in appreciation.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Debut Saltspreader married a jackhammer industrial beat – bandmember Will Wiffen has occasionally been spotted on stage wearing a T-shirt that bears the logo of industrial metal pioneers Godflesh – with vintage-sounding synthesisers and a guitar riff that vaguely recalls the Stooges’ garage rock perennial I Wanna Be Your Dog, before dissolving into a wall of disquieting noise. Its intended effect, the trio have suggested, was to evoke motorway travel, “the grinding circulation of vehicles 24-hours a day over huge distances … orange lights at night”.Its follow-up, Mr Invisible, sits somewhere between club music and left-field alt-rock. On one hand, the track’s rhythm, layers of hypnotic electronics, and vocals that arrive either psychedelically smeared or hypnotically looped in a way that recalls Dubnobasswithmyheadman-era Underworld all point towards the dancefloor. On the other, its forceful live-sounding dynamics, edge-of-chaos quality and distortion – “making everything sound crunchy is a lifelong ambition,” Wiffen has said – mark it out as very much the work of a band rather than a bedroom-bound producer. They’ve been playing around south London’s DIY scene for less than a year, “anywhere that will turn the PA up loud”.But both are exciting and different enough – from each other and anything else around at the moment – to make you wonder what Ashnymph might do next. Whatever it is, on the evidence of Saltspreader and Mr Invisible, it’s unlikely to be boring.Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenBeguiling … Dry Cleaning.Photograph: Max MiechowskiDry Cleaning – Hit My Head All Day“I simply must have experiences”​, Florence Shaw decides on her band’s beguiling return, but across six minutes – with human breath marking time – you get the sense that she can’t work out why.BBTDanny L Harle – Azimuth (ft Caroline Polachek)Welding Evanescence goth drama to peak 90s trance – right down to the lyric “and I ask the rain” – Azimuth suggests dusting off your best Cyberdog wear and heading south west to rave, stat.LSRobyn – Acne Studios mixRobyn’s soundtrack for the Swedish designer’s SS26 show previews her TBA ninth album, including Soulwax-worthy grinding guitar, Benny Benassi-style thrust and the lyrics “my body’s a spaceship with the ovaries on hyperdrive”.

Now the city of her birth, Antwerp, is hosting a major exhibition to place her in the modernist pantheon, alongsidePiet Mondrian,Amedeo Modiglianiand Alexander Archipenko, the Ukrainian sculptor who was her mentor, as well as romantic and creative partner.The exhibition, which opens on Saturday at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts (KMSKA) in Antwerp, showcases 55 of her works, from cubist paintings in warm colours, shimmering impressions of textiles, to flatter abstract pieces. Donas is in the company of Archipenko and La Section d’Or, a pan-European association of artist and writers, who aspired to promote modernism without cliques or manifestos.View image in fullscreenHet Prentenboek (The Picture Book) by Marthe Donas.Photograph: Marthe Donas Foundation, Gent, 2025The show reveals a different side to modernism, neither shocking likeMarcel Duchamp’s urinalnor stark likeKazimir Malevich’s black square. For Donas and Archipenko, “a sense of abstraction goes hand in hand with elegance”, the curator Adriaan Gonnissen said. “There is a real drive for renewal, for innovation … but there is also this incredible thirst, a hunger for classical beauty.”Unlike Duchamp orJackson Pollock, La Section d’Or were not radicals, Gonnissen said.One of the most prized works on display is The Dance, which Donas painted in 1918-19. The work was considered lost, until discovered in Japan in preparation for this exhibition.Donas was born in 1885 to a well-to-do French-speaking family in Antwerp. Her grandfather had been a realist painter, but Donas’s father was not keen on his daughter following this path; he removed her from art school in 1902 after a month.A decade later Donas enrolled again, determined to be an artist, after a life-changing accident. She fell off a roof while trying to catch a glimpse of King Albert I, who was visiting Antwerp, smashing through a glass ceiling on her way down. Her studies were then interrupted by the German invasion of 1914. While her family fled to the Netherlands, Marthe went to Dublin, where she enrolled in art school and learned how to make stained glass. After a spell in Paris, which was pivotal for her art but drained her savings, she went to the French Riviera as a drawing instructor to a rich lady.Donas met Archipenko in Nice in 1917. The pair soon clicked. He described her as “my best student” and began to promote her work. Donas created her shaped paintings, works that shunned traditional rectangles for uniquely shaped pictures that highlighted their cubist distortions.View image in fullscreenDetail from Stilleven (Still Life), 1917, by Marthe Donas.Photograph: Hugo Maertens/Marthe Donas Foundation, Gent, 2025While modern shaped paintings are often attributed to the Hungarian artist Peter László Péri, Gonnissen believes Donas was the first of her generation to pioneer this “totally different art form”.But her contribution was overlooked. At the time, cubism and abstract art were seen as male preserves; too intellectual, too rational, for sensitive women.More than a century later, Donas is slowly gaining recognition. KMSKA, which reopened in 2022 aftera far-reaching renovation, wants to promote female artists in the collection. Before the revamp, the museum had only one of Donas’s works, which was not always on display.The exhibition reflects a growing movement to recover long-neglected female masters, such as the Italian baroque artistArtemisia Gentileschior her near contemporary from the southern Netherlands,Michaelina Wautier.Other exhibitionshave brought out of dusty storerooms the works of theAmerican impressionist Mary Cassattand the Spanish modernistMaruja Mallo.Peter Pauwels, an art historian, has spent two decades trying to bring attention to Donas, who he admires for “the elegance, the colours, the originality and the beauty” of her work. A specialist in Belgian modernism, Pauwels knew Donas’s work because his grandparents collected it, but she was otherwise unknown in the Flemish art world 20 years ago. A co-curator of the exhibition, Pauwels criticises the condescension of Donas’s contemporaries. She wasn’t “a young pupil” when she met Archipenko, but a 32-year-old artist in her own right, he said.The relationship between Donas and Archipenko had ended by mid-1921. Donas married and moved to the Walloon countryside; Archipenko emigrated to America. Then Donas dropped off the artistic map for two decades from the late 1920s, after she unexpectedly became a mother aged 45. Decades later, Donas played down the connection with Archipenko, claiming she had only spent “a few months working at the sculptor’s studio”.This exhibition reveals a much more intense creative spark. It ends with two works: a composition by Donas that appears to have been inspired by an Archipenko sculpture she kept after the break-up. The vivid colours and curves of the two works are in harmony, but Pauwels said “she does something of her own, she never copied”.Donas, Archipenko & La Section d’Or.

The city’s old town is on a hill, with every other building in the three main squares and the sidestreets seemingly a historic monument, dominated by the medieval Lutheran cathedral of Saint Mary. The characteristic design of attic windows makes it clear why Sibiu is called “the town of a thousand eyes”, and theTeutsch Hausprovides a brilliant history of the region and the Transylvanian Saxons. The old town is crammed full of restaurants and cafes, and down by the river there is a local market with giant aubergines, tomatoes and peppers. For an evening glass,Wine Nothas a vast selection of Romanian (and Moldovan) wines, and a black cat to talk to.Barbara ForbesWrocław, Poland’s buzzy student cityView image in fullscreenA view across the River Oder in Wrocław.Photograph: Ingolf Pompe 19/AlamyWrocław has the perfect mix of quirkiness and beauty to make for a cracking affordable city break.

Warm weather, beaches, extraordinary street art, sea kayaking and amazing walking in the Calanques satisfied teenagers and parents alike. My favourites were theMucem(Musée des Civilisations de l’Europe et de la Méditerranée), the winding streets ofLe Panierand the sense of the place being a melting pot of cultures. We found the locals to be friendly as they encouraged our attempts to speak French, and there\\s a good transport system of trams, metro and buses. We got there easily on Eurostar and TGV train and stayed at theAparthotel Adagio.EvieBerlin’s hidden design gemsView image in fullscreenThe Ludwig Erhard Haus building designed by Nicolas Grimshaw.Photograph: Imago/AlamyAlthough I’ve been travelling to Berlin for nearly 20 years, I’m still making new discoveries. The headlines, like the Brandenburg Gate and the glass dome on the Reichstag, are definitely worth seeing, but there are also hidden treasures, such as the futuristicLudwig Erhard Haus, designed by Nicolas Grimshaw, whose steel-clad exterior is just the aperitif for some jaw-dropping architecture inside. Or the ruins ofSt Michael’s church, which was separated from its parishioners by the Berlin Wall. And try to bag a place on the tour of theESMT business schoolthat once housed East Germany’s elite. The socialist stained glass and GDR coat of arms mosaic are real showstoppers.James CarsonA dumpling and a beer in Vilnius, LithuaniaView image in fullscreenAerial view of the Three Crosses monument overlooking Vilnius old town.Photograph: Eloi Omella/Getty ImagesWe’ve just spent three nights in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius whose old town is easily walkable with plenty of churches, museums and other sights. We indulged in local specialities likekvass, a drink made from fermented rye bread, andcepelinai, which are potato dumplings shaped like airships and filled with minced pork. A half litre of beer (about €5) was ideal with moreishkepta duona, fingers of deep-fried black bread served with a garlic dip. A walk up hundreds of steps to the Three Crosses for views over the city burned excess calories.

Compact, largely flat (handy for an arthritic retiree) and utterly delightful. As a university town, we enjoyed the friendly, lively vibe but this did not distract from its charm and its history. The cloth market on Wednesdays and the bric-a-brac market at the weekend in the main square are amazing (we bought a milk churn!), the frites at the surrounding cafes were great and the beer was varied and delicious.Boekhandel Dominicanen(a bookshop in a converted middle-ages abbey) was certainly a highlight.Bruce HortonBeer spa in Olomouc, Czech RepublicView image in fullscreenOlomouc’s holy trinity column was built to mark the end of a plague in the early 18th century.Photograph: Adrian Wojcik/Getty ImagesOlomouc in the Czech Republic is an utter delight. Gleaming spires and domes, two old town squares, enchanting cobbled lanes, trams and its own astronomical clock. It also has a Unesco-recognised holy trinity column, which was built to mark the end of a plague in the early 18th century. A two-hour train ride from Prague, Olomouc is markedly less touristy than the Czech capital. Two great places to enjoy a beer wereSaint Venceslav’s brewery, where there is a beer spa with a sauna scented with hops; andTwinburg, next to the Moravian cycle path, which serves delicious craft ales. This is a city I felt had been put on Earth specially for me.Jack AndertonPolar nights in Tromsø, Norway’s ‘Arctic capital’View image in fullscreenA view of Tromsø from the Fjellheisen cable car.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyAs a Scot who once sought drawn-out summer nights, I now lean into the opposite with fervour. Winter in Tromsø, Norway – the “Arctic capital” – is for travellers who embrace the long, dark nights and are keen to meddle with their circadian rhythms. The polar night, when the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon, starts at the end of November and finishes in mid-January. Experience this unworldly extended twilight – the blue hour – from about 9am to 2pm. TheFjellheisencable car and silent whale-watching withBrim Explorerare two recommended activities.Aimee LawrenceWinning tip: blessed are the cheese markets in Alkmaar, the NetherlandsView image in fullscreenThe Molen van Piet windmill in the heart of Alkmaar, on the Singelgracht canal.Photograph: Pidjoe/Getty ImagesI recently visited Alkmaar, 35 minutes north of Amsterdam by train, which has waterways, picturesque pedestrian-friendly cobbled streets, chiming churches, excellent food (De Heeren Van Sonoy,Stadskaffee LaurensandPatisserie Elhorstinclude gluten-free options), and markets (don’t miss the cheese market for a true Dutch spectacle).

Plums are such an underrated fruit, because they’re so versatile and delicious. For these buns, they get cooked down with lots of fresh ginger into a warming jam that is then rolled into a simple enriched dough. Eat warm for maximum pleasure.Plum and ginger bunsPrep15 minMacerate30 minProve1 hr 30 min+Cook1 hr 30 minMakes7For the plum jam450g ripe plums,stoned and cut into small chunks20g fresh ginger, washed, peeled and finely minced160g caster sugarFor the dough320g strong white bread flour,plus extra for dusting40g caster sugar1½ tsp dried instant yeast½ tsp fine sea salt100ml lukewarm whole milk50ml lukewarm water1 large egg, plus 1 extra egg for the egg wash40g softened butter100g icing sugarStart with the jam. Put the plums, ginger and sugar in a wide saucepan, give them a good stir and leave to macerate for 30 minutes. Put a saucer in the freezer – you’ll use this later to test the jam is done.Bring the plum mixture to a boil, turn down to a simmer and leave to cook for 15-18 minutes, until the fruit is well softened. To test the jam is done, spoon some of it on to the frozen saucer, leave for a couple of minutes, then push it with a fingertip – if the jam wrinkles, it’s ready; if it doesn’t, cook for a couple of minutes longer, then retest. Pour the jam into a shallow dish or baking tray to cool down.For the dough, put the flour, sugar, yeast and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, and mix briefly to combine. Make a well in the centre, pour in the milk, water, egg and softened butter, and knead on medium-low for seven to eight minutes, until smooth and a little tacky but not sticky. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover and prove in a warm place for an hour or two, until nearly doubled in size.Knock out the air, then turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface. Roll it in to a roughly 30cm x 45cm rectangle, with one short side facing you. Spread 120g of the plum jam evenly on top; it might not look like enough, but trust me: if you add too much, it makes the dough much harder to roll up, plus the jam will spill out while it bakes. Starting from one of the long sides, tightly roll up the dough, then trim the ends and and cut into seven rolls. I find the neatest way to do this is with dental floss: slide a piece underneath the log, lift up both ends, cross them at the top, then pull.Put the rolls on a large baking traylined with greaseproof paper, leaving a bit of space between them. Cover loosely with clingfilm and prove again for 30-40 minutes, until puffy. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5.Brush the buns lightly with egg wash, then bake for 18-22 minutes, until lightly browned. While the buns cool, mix the icing sugar and a tablespoon of water to a smooth, thick paste. Drizzle over the warm buns before serving.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotAutumn food and drinkFoodBakingDessertSnacksFruitrecipesShareReuse this content"
