When parliament rose for the summer recess, the debate about immigration was still – just about – the right side of toxic. There was a pretence at least that the people coming to this country, either legally or by small boat crossings, were human beings just like us. They lived and breathed. Had feelings.Fast forward six weeks, in which government ministers have been putting their feet up doing not very much apart from intermittent attempts to stop the wars in Ukraine and Gaza – that went well – and the public discourse, stirred by Nigel Farage’s weekly press conferences, has altered radically.Forget George Orwell’s “Two Minutes Hate”. That was strictly for amateurs. If you haven’t got in a full half hour of loathing for foreigners then you clearly don’t love your country very much. And this hate is no longer confined to the far right. Even some bien-pensants of the centre left are joining in. Everyone now has licence to hate. The fightback against foreigners starts here.It’s a time of very public displays. Come draped in flags and colour in roundabouts with the cross of St George. Anything to make foreigners feel unwelcome. If they don’t like it, then they know what they can do.Even the language has changed. Immigrants are no longer immigrants. They are sex offenders in waiting. With Nige’s prodding we are encouraged to think of them as invaders. A scourge on a country that for far too long has been treated as a soft touch.A moment in time for true Brits to rise up and come to the defence of Lucy Connolly. A true red, white and blue patriot who had the courage to call for hotels to be set on fire while the asylum seekers were still inside. Who in their right mind wouldn’t want to do that? It’s only the last vestiges of woke holding you back. Never mind that Connolly admitted her guilt and was sentenced by a judge, she was the champion of free speech and the victim of a two-tier judicial system. Her release from prison after serving 40% of her 31-month sentence before being freed on licence was the righting of a miscarriage of justice.An age of a new morality. When Richard Tice, a newly self-appointed archbishop of Canterbury, declares himself to bebetter versed in the Christian scriptures than the archbishop of York.Because what God wants is for all Brits to be able to live in a country where 600,000 foreigners have been deported. Enough is enough. Our suffering is far greater than theirs. God has always been a Brit at heart. He’s one of us. As are the Taliban.At a press conference on Monday morning, Dicky declared himself relaxed about sending refugees back to a country where they might be tortured or executed.All of which is tricky for the Labour government. Because with anti-migrant rhetoric reaching fever pitch, Keir Starmer clearly reckons he has little choice but to lean into it if he wants to boost his flatlining popularity ratings. After all, he was elected on a promise to stop the small boats, and the people crossings – albeit with a small drop in August – are now at record levels. Keir is looking increasingly shell-shocked. Yet another reshuffle, another reset and a radio interview on Monday afternoon in which he declared a love of flags. “I love flags, me.” You can almost smell the desperation.So on the first day back in the Commons, it was left toYvette Cooperto give a statement. To try to convince the right and the centre that she had what it takes to be tough and the left that she still had some compassion. And herself that she had something more than a ”one in, one out” pilot scheme with the French as a plan. It’s slowly dawning on the government that the appeal court’s decision on the Bell hotel in Epping was a breather, not a victory.What followed was a collective display of amnesia from the home secretary and Chris Philp. Cooper began by saying the situation she had inherited had been terrible and that everything was the fault of the Tories. Which was fine as far as it went. Only she rather entered the world of fantasy by appealing to her own record of dealing with the problem. All things considered, everything was going swimmingly, she said. Just not if your prime goal is to stop people arriving by small boats. Just give her a little while longer and the sclerotic system would be fixed and every hotel closed. Not forgetting a small tweak to family reunion law. Schrödinger’s European convention on human rights. There and not there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mostly because he’s not very bright and not a serious shadow home secretary. More like someone from CCHQ on work experience. A quarter wit in a shiny suit. There again, Chris has got a lot to forget. Hard to believe, I know, but not so long ago he was the immigration minister on whose watch the number of small boat crossings soared and who actively went out of his way to requisition more hotels.You’d have thought he might have been embarrassed about that. There again, he has no shame. Rather he just dribbles out some nonsense about deporting everyone and that every asylum seeker is a rapist. He even had the front to bring up the pointless Rwanda scheme, while boasting it had removed four volunteers in two years. His Tory colleagues held their heads in despair.Neil Hudson, the Tory MP for Epping, declared his constituency to be a tinderbox. Dicky Tice, Lee Anderson and the Philpster all looked priapic at the thought. Just what they wanted to hear. A country on the edge. Cooper tried to calm them down by saying that she too loved the flag. It’s become a competition. You wouldn’t put it past Kemi Badenoch to come to prime minister’s questions draped in a St George’s flag.That just left time for Esther McVey. The government was putting immigrants before born and bred Brits. Bridget Phillipson had admitted as much the previous day. Cooper was outraged. How dare Esther accuse her of compassion. She was a tough home secretary for tough times. Phillipson had been guilty of thought crimes. School has not yet started and the education secretary is already on the naughty step.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchHouse of CommonsYvette CooperImmigration and asylumRichard TicecommentShareReuse this content"

The Daily Mail and the Sun are trying to make the moniker “three pads Rayner” stick, in reference to a property she recently bought in Hove and has made her primary residence. Ostensibly, the reports are asking whether she saved on stamp duty (which Downing Street says she has beenunable to comment on due to a court order) – but have been broadened out to question every part of her life and character. This weekend, the Daily Mail was furious one minute that the deputy prime minister spent so much time in Hove, where “residents have seen a lot of her”. The next minute, the Mail on Sunday was livid that she spent so little time there, where neighbours say she “appears to be using it as a holiday home for short breaks because she’s not there very often”. Defying the laws of physics by being in Hove too much and too little, Rayner adds insult to injury by frequenting a town that is home to the ex-wife of Sam Tarry, her partner. Sorry, his title in full: “on-off boyfriend”, despite the fact that they have been together four years. The information that Tarry, co-parent to his children, also lives in Hove may unlock this mystery a tiny bit, but wait, there’s more. Rayner has also been found guilty of going in the sea,wearing a “garishly coloured” Dryrobe(price tag: £165), vaping in a kayak, having friends and drinking wine.The flat in Hove is, in fact, the only home Rayner owns, her London address being a grace-and-favour apartment attached to her office. And maybe that isLabourhypocrisy all over; you don’t see Reform MPs lousy with official residencies, since they are not in government. She alternates her constituency address in Ashton-under-Lyne with her ex-husband, and her teenage sons live there. That’s divorce for you. As a thought-experiment, go pick over the equity arrangements of any divorced couple you know, and see how fast they tell you to shove it.It is also a huge problem for the moral majority and its perception of our political overlords that Rayner has been seen eating food; specifically, in a “well-known Italian restaurant”, in pubs at lunchtime, andin a chippie. Sorry to harp on, but again with the questions: where is the right place for her to eat? Those cover pretty much all the price-points of food vending, except for the fortune you would spend at a Michelin-starred restaurant, and can you imagine the hell that would break loose if she ate in one of those? I guess the right thing to do would be for her to get groceries online, though pray God not from Ocado, and then she can eat them in one of those homes she is not allowed to live in.It doesn’t feel like a million years ago, because it was only one year, that Rayner was considered shady for letting her brother stay with her, despite the fact that he had just returned from a tour in Iraq (had she declared her co-dwellers correctly for council tax purposes?), andabsolutely slated, two years before that, for going to Glyndebourne, it being impossible to imagine a genuine working-class person who enjoyed Mozart, and furthermore, deeply concerning as to whose pocket she would end up in as a result. In fact, she wasinvited by an old friend of hers, a violinist. Those are the ones you have to watch, in the corporate capture of the political establishment – the violinists.The same year, it was apparently Rayner’smaster plan to distract Boris Johnsonby sitting opposite him in parliament while having legs, and the year before, she was pilloried for calling the Conservatives “scum”, and when I say “pilloried”, I mean people were, with a straight face, accusing her of dehumanising her political opponents. There is a critical difference between being rude about people with power and deriding the powerless, which I feel sure we all used to understand.It has never been clearer: this is a class war, mediated through one person. According to the bizarre rules of the rightwing press, she cannot participate in cultural events without betraying her roots, she cannot have a personal life without insinuation, she cannot eat without censure, she cannot engage modestly in the Monopoly game of late capitalism, but you can be sure that if she didn’t, she would be accused of freeloading or chaos. There has been a wall of coverage telling Rayner not to exist. And, way beyond the kinship and admiration of seeing her vaping in the sea, it just makes me glad that she does.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He talks about agoraphobia, ADHD and creating ceramic cuddlesEmine SanerMon 1 Sep 2025 11.12 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 13.30 EDTShareIn a cavernous room in an old pottery factory, Johnny Vegas is approaching his work and his face is a delight. “Is it wrong to love your own pieces?” he says, seeing his sculptures for the first time in the place they will be shown, on a table lit by beams of dusty sunlight. Called Just Be There, and made in collaboration with the sculptorEmma Rodgers, each form is the result of two people embracing around a soft clay column. The huggers are mostly from Stoke-on-Trent, where Vegas’s work in the British Ceramics Biennial, one of more than 60 artists included, is being shown. Some are collapsed – thanks to a bear hug. Some are more restrained, the clay holding the imprint of people’s feelings about personal space. They’re robust and beautiful, and Vegas looks absolutely thrilled.The first time he produced a body of work to be on public show, it was for his ceramics degree finals and it ended up accidentally being thrown in a skip. To his tutors’ dismay he insisted on making sculpture rather than the technical ceramics he was supposed to be doing, and had produced a series of abstract female forms. He adds with a laugh: “At our final show, everybody kept writing, ‘I like your candlesticks’.”View image in fullscreen‘Your ideas are valid’ … with mentor Emma Rodgers.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThat, the skip and a third-class degree meant Vegas went off in what he calls “my little huff”, and became a successful comic instead, his former life relegated to a gag (he has sent up the potters’ wheel love scene from the film Ghost more than once). “In a way, I feel I’ve cheated myself,” he says, when we leave his work to be installed. Showbiz, he says, was “a big detour. I never made the time [for art], and I wish I had. I have so much time to make up for.” Now, in his 50s, he is doing just that. Last month’s Channel 4 documentary followed Vegas as he made a public art installation in St Helens, Merseyside, where he lives, and his joint exhibition with Rodgers at Liverpool’s WalkerArtGallery ended in June after more than a year.In the 90s, comedy replaced what he had been trying to do in art. Standup, realised Vegas, “was something I could do on my own creative terms. It’s yours, rise or fall.” Often drunk, unruly and anarchic, his stage personaJohnny Vegaswas a vulnerable but demonic figure – the counterweight to his more anxious and sensitive real self, Michael Pennington. His 1997 Edinburgh show brought awards, attention and, inevitably, TV offers. “Then when you go into TV, everybody has an opinion and that slowly seeps into you.”Whenever I’ve needed it most – in education, in later life – art turned up and rescued meTelevision tamed him. On panel shows, adverts and presenting jobs, the character of Johnny had lost that edge. “You wonder what younger comics make of you,” says Vegas. “As you get older, you also go: how much time have you got left to make a difference? Rather than just have a career, and cling on to it? Don’t make telly for the sake of making telly.” It was the same feeling, he says, that made him not want to sit at a wheel, turning out pots. “I’m really fortunate that whenever I’ve needed it most – in education, in later life – art turned up and rescued me, and gave me a different sense of purpose.”A chance meeting a few years ago with the renowned Wirral-based sculptor Rodgers led to an invitation to spend a day at her studio. She helped Vegas make a Jester, a forlorn figure representing Vegas’s unease. “That was a big point in my career where you’re going, what is success? Where has it took you?” Returning to art was “like this light had come on that had been dimming. There’s still a self-conscious, working-class part of me, but Emma really made me go, ‘you’re an artist, your ideas are valid’.” Vegas now has space in her studio, working in several media including clay, bronze and 3D printing, and Rodgers has become a mentor, chivvying him when he needs it, or making him stop before he goes too far on a piece.View image in fullscreenGlazed and confused … Vegas eyes his efforts.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFor many years Vegas had also been appalled at “the constant decline of art in education”. In 2022, he was diagnosed with ADHD, which explained a lot about his life. As a child, growing up in the 70s and 80s, “I was just seen as this slacker: ‘He refuses to try, or to concentrate.’ But I just wasn’t interested.” Art was what he was interested in – his father, a joiner, lobbied for Vegas to get a place doing A-level art, because of his obsessive drawing – and it worries him that we’re not providing the same opportunities to children today. “If they’re not necessarily academic, but they have gifts that lie elsewhere, they are being ignored. As we’re becoming more neurodiverse aware, we’re stepping further away from something where [many of those] children can excel.”Throughout the time Vegas was considering all this, and his rediscovery of art, the world was afflicted by the pandemic. He spent the first lockdown working out of his local pub, doing food drops for frontline workers and sourcing PPE. “It was the most rewarding thing I’ve done in years,” he says. He was busy, felt useful and his son was living with him (he has two children from two former marriages). The later lockdowns were harder – he spent them in isolation and struggled. He’d had a kiln installed at home but wasn’t creating much. The negative aspects of his then-undiagnosed ADHD “flourished and took over”. He developed agoraphobia which, for someone in the public eye, was particularly difficult. “Never leaving the house, this fear of expectations of what people want. Then everyone was back to the ‘new normal’, and I just couldn’t make the adjustment. It had a much more adverse effect on me than I thought, which is why, I suppose, now a lot of my work is still about re-engaging with people, society, and finding acceptance as ‘Michael’.”I had dream of flying when I was nine. I’ve chased it every sinceThe idea for this current work came out of that period, “of how the first time somebody hugged me, it felt strange. Being so averse to a hug had suddenly become so alien. I want to investigate this idea of reconnection, and I wanted to find a way of capturing moments in time, how people interpret a hug.” A hug can feel overwhelming, or “it just lasts too long with somebody. It can be interpreted like an invasion of space.” Mostly though, he was aiming to express “the robust nature of love” – some of the “huggers” were couples, but others were friends, or parents and children. “I think those pieces are going, ‘Have a bit more faith in what you’ve got around you, family and friends, and society. Don’t give up’.”View image in fullscreenTunnel vision: Vegas looks through his ceramic sculpture.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianVegas is about to tour the live stage show of the beloved cult BBC sitcom Ideal, but he can’t really see a return to standup comedy. “You’ve got to be hungry for it, and right now, I’m hungry for sculpture.” The idea of flight is prevalent in his previous work. The clay form, the result of a hug with his partner Vikki, is daubed with slip which looks like wings. When he was a child, he had a recurring dream he could fly. “And then from about the age of nine I never had that dream again. I think it was the first time I started experiencing anxiety and that replaced that hopefulness. So there’s that I’m always chasing.”Does he care what people think about his work, if they like it or not? “I’ve always cared what people think,” he says. “I think that’s what created Johnny – he became a defence mechanism.” But with art, he says, he craves a debate. “It takes me back to being a teenage student in the pub and people going, ‘Why do I pay my taxes so you can make bloody ashtrays?’ I embraced being an outsider in art. It was the first time that I went, I’m grateful to be different. I don’t want to be a total outcast but I’m grateful that this winds you up, that you would have such a reaction to art.” He laughs and says, “I’m absolutely prepared for somebody to go, ‘You haven’t finished it off. It’s got no handles. Did you drop that?’” In his standup shows, he loved a good heckle, as long as it was considered, rather than plain abusive. The difference with comedy, he says, is “it’s you in a room, with everybody listening, it’s the arena of the unwell. The beauty of making an object and leaving it open to interpretation is far more freeing.”The British Ceramics Biennial is at various venues in Stoke-on-Trent from 6 September to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsJohnny VegasCeramicsSculptureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since I dislike snakes but like rodents, it offers me Danish musician Astrid Sonne, who has sadly had to cancel ahead of the weekend. Nonetheless, the Top Tipper, by artists Mikesian Studio, is characteristic of the Wiltshire festival: playful, charming, with curation by an obviously human rather than algorithmic hand.View image in fullscreenHayden Pedigo.Photograph: Gem HarrisThe 13,500 people at this year’s EOTR are generous and enthusiastic listeners. Texan guitarist Hayden Pedigo seems bowled over by how many people turn up to watch him open the glade-like Garden stage on Friday lunchtime. He only started playing live a couple of years ago and professes to have terrible stage fright – though you wouldn’t know in the least from his delightful stage presence, telling us about how his Amarillo home is so flat that locals joke about being able to see your dog run away for three days. His widescreen, open-tuned instrumentals contain multitudes: proggy drama, nimble scurrying, Earth-like doom country and plenty of space.Cornish folk singer Daisy Rickman is a great complement, evoking craggier vistas from closer to home in her weighty, self-possessed songs, backed by a full band. A cover of the Velvet Underground’s All Tomorrow’s Parties makes a virtue of her stunningly deep voice and brings out the drone folk DNA in the original. For the last couple of songs, she hops on drums and sings, closing on a couple of numbers that almost have a Balearic heat in the sax. Her solo records are great, but she needs to make a full band record to capture their intuitive magic.On the low-roofed Boat stage later on, Mandy, Indiana make bucolic rambles a distant memory with their dystopian industrial racket, fuelled by grinding guitar and whippet-nimble drums, andCariboucloses the main stage with the sort of lethally efficient good vibes that you suspect Dan Snaith can parlay with his eyes closed.View image in fullscreenDystopian … Valentine Caulfield of Mandy, Indiana.Photograph: Chris JuarezBy Saturday, it becomes apparent that Friday was the last time the festivalgoers would ever know peace, ie remain dry. The New Eves cut through the torpor with their Raincoats and Velvets-influenced battle cries, while Lily Seabird leaves a quieter, deeper impression to a packed tent of people who discover magic while dodging the rain. The Vermont songwriter has some of Big Thief to her brawny, easy rockers, coupled with a gorgeously open-hearted voice that recalls Lucinda Williams and Frances Quinlan of Hop Along. She plays one new song solo: a stunning, rangy reverie that suggests an indie star in the making.But if EOTR has a true breakout talent, it’s Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti. On Saturday, Titanic, her duo with romantic partner and guitarist Hector Tosta, rework theirnew album– which isn’t even out for a week. That drive to reinvent speaks to a profound shared musical language, clear from the way the band visually communicate almost to the point of egging each other on to push things further. Just the opening bars of tectonic interplay between Fratti, Tosta, drummer Friso van Wijck and saxophonist Nat Philipps is stunning; Van Wijck can shift from blastbeats to chattering woodblocks in seconds; they evoke the squall of a charged city on the brink of collapse.View image in fullscreenTrue talent … Mabe Fratti playing with Titanic.Photograph: Gem HarrisFratti’s melodies are so pristine they could be produced as traditional chanson, but Titanic never do anything so predictable: at one point, the best comparison for what they’re doing is Maria Callas were she produced by Sunn O))), operatic desolation backed up by cliff faces of noise. Fratti’s voice is usually the piercingly calm centre of the music, but by the last song she’s starting to come apart vocally, and the raggedness of her singing is a thrill. Titanic is her maximalist side; her solo performance on Sunday with Tosta and Gibrán Andrade on drums is more minimalist and plaintive, making a virtue of space, always keeping you guessing and only breaking their immaculate tension with a sludge metal cataclysm right at the end.No one is doing it like these Mexico City musicians, though Moin are almost as exciting, an exercise in controlled collapse – with shades of Slint’s doominess – as drummerValentina Magaletticreates a striking sense of space in her playing. And certainly the only artist who could bring the sunshine – figuratively, at least – is Sofia Kourtesis, whose wistful, songwriterly house feels particularly heartfelt today, as does her shoutout to mentor Caribou, who comes on and gives her a huge hug. (Later, during his secret set as Daphni on the Boat stage, he plays their collaboration Unidos amid a set of heaters that thrive on being played under a low tarpaulin roof, unlike his big-tent hits.)That sort of warmth is missing from Self Esteem’s headline set, which feels too choreographed and stern to charm this festival crowd, not to mention bum-clenchingly basic in its Handmaid’s Tale-evoking vision of feminism. It feels like nature healing itself to leave to see Viagra Boys, a group of men literally singing a song called Sports, as is right and proper. The Swedish punks are not quite as riotous as expected – there’s almost a shocking maturity to their sax-dappled sound – but we later learn that they’ve donated their entire fee to Doctors Without Borders, one of several shows of support for Palestine at the festival. They loosen the night up again, as does Syrian dabke producer Rizan Said, whose set is relentless fun.No such thing can be said for the weather on Sunday. At lunchtime, a small girl is wailing to her parents that shejust can’t walk any more, a tearful refusal that I think many here five times her age would also like to scream at the filthy sky. But walk on we do: to Jake Xerxes Fussell’s plucky folk rambles, which bounce along with the verve of Richard Scarry characters; Ryan Davis and the Roadhouse Band’s amiable picaresque Americana; folk group Shovel Dance Collective, whose hungry remit quests from casting celestial spells to traditional fiddle-de-de. Blawan offers bracing blasts of bathhouse techno, laced with fun, demonic vocal samples, screaming fizz and industrial lockstep, and Squid bring back memories of one-album wonders Clor with their funhouse take on post-punk.View image in fullscreenLoose-limbed, ludic and romantic … Father John Misty at End of the Road festival.Photograph: Rachel Juarez-Carr/Rachel Juarez CarrAnd to these jaded ears at least, EOTR works some of its magic in getting me to enjoy some of Father John Misty’s headline set, having never been a fan. The clever lounge lizard stuff is still a bit offputtingly pleased with itself, but Screamland is disarming in its unvarnished desperation, a cosmic epic that hits like Coldplay having an existential crisis. Josh Tillman’s set is loose-limbed, ludic and romantic, and his old troll energy seems well and truly consigned to the dustbin of history; he’s ardently sincere, telling EOTR’s faithful “they don’t make ’em like you”. He’s right: in its capacity to surprise and delight, it’s a special place.Explore more on these topicsEnd of the Road festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsSelf EsteemCaribouFather John MistyIndielive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

I had to stand on a box’‘I skip one part when we perform it these days. As I’m in my mid-50s it would be creepy’Interviews byChris BroughtonMon 1 Sep 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 19.12 EDTShareNeil Hannon, singer/songwriterHaving made two albums with a chamber vibe, I was thinking, “Where do I go from here?” I started hearing your Suedes and Saint Etiennes, and Blur were referencing stuff from the 60s and 70s too. I could see the way the wind was blowing. That sounds quite knowing, but I already loved John Barry, the Kinks, Adam Faith and, of course, Scott Walker.I’d come up with a very eurocentricchord sequence, not the type you get in rock’n’roll, almost slightly Pet Shop Boys. Watching the 1995 adaptation of Cold Comfort Farm, I noticed that the grandmother’s repeated line, “There’s something in the woodshed,” scanned with the tune I was writing.The conversation between the woman in the song and the would-be Lothario evolved from that line. Of course, the guy gets his comeuppance, because that’s how my mind works. He goes down to the woodshed and the woman’s heavies assault and rob him. It was all a ruse.I returned to my favourite galloping snare drum groove, which had worked well on the last song of the previous album. That had been inspired by a documentary featuring Eurovision songs from the 60s, which included a clip of France Gall singingPoupée de Cire, Poupée de Sonfor Luxembourg. I thought, “That’s the best sound I’ve ever heard!” In those days it was harder to find a song again so I was working from memory. The engineer, Darren Allison, played the drum part and I had to fit everything else over the top as tightly as I could.One of the studios had a Hammond organ, which became the driving force on Weekend. When I said the track needed some giggling at the start, a young fellow working at Setanta said, “I’ll get my sister to bring a friend.” I put them in a little booth and they started giggling out of nervousness. Me doing that sort of Terry-Thomas voice was recorded separately. I skip that when we perform the song live these days – I’m in my mid-50s, it would be creepy.There hadn’t been any money for Divine Comedy singles before, but Keith Cullen, head of Setanta, knew that not promoting this song would be cutting off his nose to spite his face. We made a video in Venice. It was the first time I ate tiramisu. I thought, “My God, I’m living the life now!” They hired a statuesque Italian model to hang around with me, looking cool, but she was a foot taller than me. In the shots where you see us side by side on a boat, I was standing on a box.Chris Evans said something on his Radio 1 breakfast show about having been blown away by a song he’d heard at a friend’s house, by Divine something-or-other. My plugger, listening in the shower, battled travel chaos as he rushed to get a copy to the studio. He handed it in about 10 minutes before the show ended, and Chris played it twice.I was in a cab while doing promo in Paris when I heard we’d made number 14 on the UK charts. I don’t think I’ve ever been more excited. Super Furry Animals had an album out with a song of the same name. They changed it toSomething 4 the Weekendwhen they released it as a single a fortnight after ours, but their singer Gruff Rhys later gave me aRobin Sarstedt LPhe’d found in a charity shop that proved someone had beaten us both to the title by decades.Joby Talbot, orchestratorA friend had been playing cello with Neil, who asked him if he knew anyone who played oboe and piano. I remember meeting him and thinking, “Wow, he’s wearing eye makeup! What a rock and roll thing to do.” It turned out he had two black eyes after being punched in the face by a French journalist.For the Casanova album, Neil made demos on a four-track recorder. I’d take manuscript paper to whichever squalid garret he was sleeping on the sofa at and notate each part, so we could go into a studio and record it. We’d get a couple of days here, a couple there, and would be begging for more time as we bounced from one studio to another – it was a ludicrous way to make a record.I really just scored what Neil had demoed and tarted it up a bit. I conducted the strings, but I’m there in spirit more than performance, though I was one of the people who gathered round a mic to record the “Aaaaah-whooooo!” that leads into each verse.At the time, I was studying composition at the Guildhall and many people who played on the record were friends from there – the touring band was put together later. Robin Smith, who I got in to play the trumpet leading into the first verse, did take after take – his lips were turning blue. Eventually he said, “Look, I’ve been here for hours, I think I’m done.” Neil piped up over the headphones, “There’s another 20 quid in it if you can hit that high note,” which seemed to give him the impetus he needed. I guess that’s a lesson in how to deal with brass players.We were touring medium-sized venues in the French provinces when we got the call to appear on that week’s TFI Friday. We had to postpone three gigs, whiz back to London, grab a shower and rush to the soundcheck, having found a trumpeter, string players and someone to hit the tubular bells at short notice.I remember Neil being taken aside beforehand and given a pep talk by two girls from the record company: “Don’t mess this up.” His face was even greyer than usual. We managed one rehearsal, then there we were on live national TV. That changed everything. Until then, we couldn’t get arrested in the UK but we went straight back on tour and were being booked for every festival going.The Divine Comedy’s album, Rainy Sunday Afternoon, is out on 19 September. They tour from17 September to 25 October. The Royal Ballet’s Like Water for Chocolate, composed by Joby Talbot, is at theRoyal Opera House, London, 1-24 October.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is Keir saying he wants to have a direct line of sight to everything. Darren knows the departments inside out because of the spending review,” one said.“Keir has been thinking about how to fix things for the last couple of months and these are his appointments and this is his structure. There are decisions that were made in the Treasury – winter fuel being one of them – where No 10 did not take enough oversight.”Another senior No 10 source said: “These are not people who have been appointed to be at odds with the Treasury or alternative power bases but to work with it. The economic agenda has to be aligned. But of course the PM needs to be able to shape it. Downing Street has to be able to challenge.”A senior government insider denied the changes risked undermining Reeves’s position, saying she had been involved in discussions on them since earlier in the summer. “That is an analysis based on prime ministers and chancellors of the past – Blair and Brown, May and Hammond – when in fact these appointments make the Treasury’s job easier,” they said.Jones, whose new title will be chief secretary to the prime minster, will be replaced as Rachel Reeves’s deputy by James Murray, who has been promoted from exchequer secretary. In turn, his role will be taken by Dan Tomlinson, the government’s “growth mission champion”, as Starmer seeks to reward the new 2024 intake.However, there is not expected to be a wider reshuffle of the junior ministerial ranks this week, senior sources said, and cabinet ministers will stay in their current roles.The communications operation will also be shaken up with Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair in No 10 who went on to fund the PR firm Portland, coming in as executive director of government communications.His appointment has caused some alarm in government, as he did somework for Russian president Vladimir Putinin the early noughties to reshape his own image in the eyes of the west ahead of hosting the G8 summit that year. “I can’t wait for the Tories to start looking at Portland’s lobbying for the Russian government,” one Labour source said.The political role is separate from that ofDavid Dinsmore, a former editor of the Sun who has been tasked with improving the civil service communications operation. There have been questions internally over whether either man is up to speed with the modern media landscape.James Lyons, Downing Street’s director of communications for strategy, is stepping down. Steph Driver, his counterpart for day-to-day No 10 communications, who is close to Starmer, stays in post, answering to Allan. Joe Dancey, theLabourparty’s director of policy and communications, and partner of the health secretary Wes Streeting, has also left his role.The No 10 policy unit is also undergoing changes, after some internal conflict over who was running the department. Liz Lloyd, who was Tony Blair’s deputy chief of staff at No 10, is leaving but is expected to move to a new role in government.Stuart Ingham, another policy chief and Starmer’s most longstanding aide, will leave the unit to work in chief of staff Morgan McSweeney’s team, taking on a more political role, which sources said would ensure the prime minister’s priorities were taken into account in every decision.A new political policy chief is expected to be appointed shortly, but in the meantime Vidhya Alakeson, one of McSweeney’s deputies, will oversee day-to-day policy work.However, there was some concern among Labour MPs that the changes may not fix fundamental problems at the top of government. The latest appointments mean that since Starmer became Labour leader, he has had four chiefs of staff and five directors of communications.One Labour backbencher said: “Overall I think it is not something you can staff your way out of. This is about the politics and the story we tell. All the comms and strategy people in the world won’t fix that.”A senior Labour source added: “It’s not just a question of narrative. It’s ‘what is our purpose and how do we use power?’ The stakes are a shift to radical right authoritarian government. As progressives that’s an emergency.”In his BBC interview, Starmer said while he understood people’s concerns about migration, Reform and Nigel Farage were exploiting the issue. “They feed on grievance. They don’t want the problem solved because they’ve got no reason to exist if the problems are solved,” he said.When asked about a recent spate of English flags being draped on lamp-posts or spray-painted on roundabouts, the prime minister said he was proud of the flag, and had one in his Downing Street flat, but was wary of it being used for “divisive” reasons.Mujtaba Rahman, of political analysts Eurasia Group, said: “Keir Starmer’s reshuffle of his Downing Street team reflects his frustration at what he sees as a bloated but slow civil service machine and a desire to bolster No 10’s heft on the economy.“That is a belated recognition that Starmer delegated too much power to Rachel Reeves, whose political judgment was lacking on means-testing the pensioners’ winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts – both later abandoned.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourEconomic policyCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

Those who own land would be offered “a digital token” by the trust in exchange for rights to redevelop their property, to be used to finance a new life elsewhere.Those who stay would be housed in properties with a tiny footprint of 323 sq ft – minuscule even by the standards of many non-refugee camp homes in Gaza.It was not clear if the plan reflects US policy, and neither the White House nor the State Department responded to the Washington Post’s request for comment. But the prospectus seem to reflect Donald Trump’spreviously stated ambition to “clean out” Gaza and redevelop it.Among critics of the leaked prospectus was Philip Grant, the executive director of Trial International, a human rights group based in Switzerland, who called the plan “a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as development”.“This is a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as development. The outcome? A textbook case of international crimes on an unimaginable scale: forcible population transfer, demographic engineering, and collective punishment,” Grant said.Trial is one of fifteen groups that havepreviously warned that private contractors operating in Gazain collaboration with the Israeli government risk “aiding and abetting or otherwise being complicit in crimes under international law, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide”, and that they may be liable under several jurisdictions.“Those involved in the planning and execution of such a plan – including corporate actors – could face legal liability for decades to come,” Grant said.Even in the Israeli media the proposal invited incredulity, with a column in the left-leaning Haaretz describing it as “a Trumpian get-rich-quick scheme reliant on war crimes, AI and tourism”.Far-right Israeli politicians and settlers discuss luxury ‘Gaza riviera’ planRead moreThe highly fanciful prospectus – subtitled “From a Demolished Iranian Proxy to a Prosperous Abrahamic Ally”– appears to have been drawn up by people with no physical knowledge of Gaza, the politics of the Middle East or the likely challenges in attempting to rebuild the territory as a multibillion-dollar tourism and technology hub that would inevitably compete with Israel.The scheme, described as requiring no US funding and intended to be funded by investors to the tune of $100bn, envisages a bustling port city bisected by a watercourse and bordered by up to eight leafy AI-powered high-tech megacities, apparently modelled afterSaudi Arabia’s troubled Neom project.It also envisages an “Elon Musk” manufacturing park located – without irony – on the ruins of theErez industrial zone, which was built with Israeli investment to exploit cheap labour in the Palestinian territory and subsequently closed and destroyed by Israeli forces.Examination of the map appears to suggest the plan would also involve the expropriation for an Israeli security buffer zone of much of Gaza’s agricultural land, which tends to be located at Gaza’s periphery close to the border with Israel.The small print is most damning, however, making no distinction in terms of sovereignty between Gaza, Israel and Egypt, suggesting no consideration has been made for Palestinian self determination. Under the plan, Israel would maintain vaguely defined “overarching rights” over Gaza “to meet its security needs”. There would be no Palestinian state but a “Palestinian polity” which would joinTrump’s Abraham Accords.The entire language in the prospectus, and labelling of several features, appears aimed at appealing to the vanity of Trump, Musk, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, for whom the security ring around Gaza is named.According to the Boston Consulting Group, quoted by the Post, work on the document was not approved and two senior partners who led the financial planning had been fired.That criticism was echoed by HA Hellyer, a senior associate at the Royal United Services Institute who suggested that the details of the plan were so clearly ludicrous that the proposal should not be taken seriously at face value.“It’s insane. What is important is what the plan points to, and that is not a new idea: the Israel determination that there should be no Palestinian sovereignty or self determination in Gaza.“The US has made clear since February [when details of plans for a Trump Riviera in Gaza first emerged] that they are OK with the idea of ethnic cleansing in Gaza.“The notion that this would be about ‘voluntary departure’ when Palestinians in Gaza have no choice but to be shot or starved.”Katherine Gallagher, a senior lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, said that “any company that aligns itself with Israel – and seemingly, Trump – in a plan to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their homes in Gaza is opening itself up to significant legal liability at home and under universal jurisdiction”.The CCR recently sued the Trump administration for records of its funding of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the private outfit overseeing aid distribution in Gaza and at whose sites hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while queuing for food.The prospectus was leaked days after Trump held a White House meeting to discuss day-after planning for Gaza attended by the former British prime minister Tony Blair, who has contributed views on Gaza’s future to the Trump administration and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The leaked plan was also rejected by senior Hamas official Basem Naim who said: “Gaza is not for sale.“Gaza is part of the greater Palestinian homeland.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Trials in larger groups are under way.The Fastball test is a form of electroencephalogram (EEG) that uses small sensors on the scalp to record the brain’s electrical activity while people watch a stream of images on a screen. The test detects memory problems by analysing the brain’s automatic responses to images the person sees before the test.“This shows us that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” said Dr George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bath, where the test was developed.The trial, run with the University of Bristol, involved 54 healthy adults and 52 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI have problems with memory, thinking or language, but these are not usually severe enough to prevent them doing their daily activities.Before the test, volunteers were shown eight images and told to name them, but not specifically to remember them or look out for them in the test. The researchers then recorded the participants’ brain activity as they watched hundreds of images flash up on a screen. Each image appeared for a third of a second and every fifth picture was one of the eight they had seen before.View image in fullscreenDr George Stothart from the University of Bath with John Stennard, one of the 54 healthy adults involved in the trial.Photograph: BRACE Dementia ResearchThe scientists found that those with amnestic MCI, which largely affects a person’s memory for objects, had reduced responses to the test compared with healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. People with amnestic MCI are many times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those with non-amnestic MCI.The test cannot identify who will definitely develop Alzheimer’s disease. But if larger studies confirm the findings, it could help doctors assess early on which patients are at high risk and could benefit most from new Alzheimer’s drugs such as donanemab and lecanemab.All of the tests were performed in people’s homes, which Stothart said was important for making them accessible and reducing people’s anxiety. Details are published inBrain Communications.Prof Vladimir Litvak, of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said it was “an early step towards developing a clinically useful test”. A crucial next step, he said, would be to determine whether it can predict how a person’s condition changes over time and inform decisions about their treatment.Dr Julia Dudley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see studies exploring potential ways to detect memory problems earlier. New Alzheimer’s treatments are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease, therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.“Longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time. Memory impairment can also be linked to other health conditions, not just dementia. Future research should look at how other factors may influence brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchAlzheimer'sDementiaHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The legal age to bet is 18.In a second study, based on focus groups with children aged 13-17, 16% reported seeing content creators sharing links and sign-up codes for gambling operators, while 14% reported seeing them sharing betting tips and tricks.The reports warned about content produced by mainstream UK operators as well as unlicensed sites promoting newer or unregulated products associated with video gamessuch as “skins betting”and“loot boxes”.Both involve the use of in-game digital items that have value to players and can be traded, staked or won via mechanisms that replicate real-life gambling.Niks Kolosnicins, 24, developed a gambling addiction that severely disrupted his schoolwork and lasted into his university years.“I used to see a huge amount of gambling ads when watching online streamers and esports – and with my favourite influencers promoting gambling, and many of my friends regularly betting, gambling became normalised for me,” he said.Children who contributed to the study referred to seeing well-known sports stars in gambling content.The Labour MP Beccy Cooper, who has called for a new gambling act to replace 2005 legislation introduced under Tony Blair’s government, said existing laws were “failing to protect children from online gambling marketing where influencers portray gambling as socially acceptable or aspirational”.She added that “future generations should look back on this era of proliferation, targeting and sports gamblification with the same level of disbelief”.The Liberal Democrat peer Don Foster described the report as “extremely concerning” and called for greater scrutiny of gambling advertising.Heather Wardle, a professor of gambling research and policy at Glasgow University, said content seen at an early age can mean that gambling becomes “embedded deeply within social practices”.“Evidence shows there is a real risk of escalating harms among this already higher-risk age group,” she added.The previous government and Labour have taken steps to tighten up elements of gambling regulation – includingcutting the maximum stake on online slot machines to £5– but have stopped short of strict curbs on advertising.Zoe Osmond, the chief executive of GambleAware, said: “It is unacceptable that children’s environments continue to be flooded with age-restricted content.”A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “We recognise the impact harmful gambling can have on individuals and their families, and we are absolutely committed to strengthening protections for those at risk, including children and young people.“There are already a range of robust rules in place on gambling adverts, including rules to ensure adverts are not targeted at or strongly appeal to children.“We will continue to work closely with the gambling industry to ensure that advertising is appropriate, responsible, and does not exacerbate harm.”The Guardian approached the Betting and Gaming Council for comment.Explore more on these topicsGamblingSocial mediaSport bettingRegulatorsYoung peopleTikTokYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

Powerful tremors were shaking his small house in Piran village, in Afghanistan’s Kunar region, and he could see the walls beginning to crack.“I jumped out of bed and rushed to where my children and parents were sleeping,” Jan said. “I managed to rescue two of my children and brought them outside to safety. I went back inside to save my younger siblings, but as I did the roof and walls collapsed around me.”As themagnitude-6 earthquakehit eastern Afghanistan late on Sunday night, Jan found himself buried in the rubble of his own house. As much as he tried to claw at the debris, he struggled to push his head through the wreckage. It took villagers five hours to finally free him. When he finally broke through, he was greeted with scenes of tragedy and devastation.His wife, two sons and two brothers were among the dead after the powerful earthquake had razed entire villages across the region to the ground. In the poverty-stricken, mountainous terrain of Kunar, most homes in the affected villages had been made only of mud, giving people little defence from the debris and floods caused by the earthquake when it struck as they slept. Most homes lay in piles of rubble or had been washed away entirely.View image in fullscreenDamaged buildings in Kunar.Photograph: EPA“It felt as if the entire mountain was collapsing on us,” Jan said. “Our village has been completely devastated and residential areas wiped out.”The official death toll stood at 800 on Monday evening, with more than 2,500 injured, and was widely expected to rise significantly. Many in the villages of Kunar remained unaccounted for and rescuers continued to pull bodies from the rubble as all local hospitals declared a state of emergency.The Taliban, who took control of the country more than four years ago when its internationally recognised government collapsed, dispatched helicopters but many areas remained impossible to access.0:46Rescue efforts after Afghanistan earthquake kills more than 800 – videoSanaullah, another resident of Kunar province, had been away from his village when the earthquake struck. When he travelled back on Monday, he found that his house had been reduced to rubble and his brother had been killed alongside his five children. “It is the story of each and every house here,” he said. “Everyone I know here has lost at least three to five family members.”Abdul Rahim, a cleric in Kunar, said graveyards in Mazar valley in Kunar were now overflowing with the dead. “Everywhere people are crying and embracing one another following a mass funeral,” he said. “The death toll is so high that graveyards are overflowing, and local people are busy digging graves in advance as bodies arrive every half hour.”Many of those affected were critical of the rescue efforts by the Taliban, which was widely seen to lack the resources, manpower and funds to deal with a crisis on this scale. Since the Taliban retook power in 2021, it has become increasingly difficult for NGOs to operate in the country, particularly amid the draconian ban on women’s employment and education, and most foreign governments have withdrawn aid from Afghanistan, now one of the poorest countries in the world.View image in fullscreenAfghan men search for their belongings in the rubble of a collapsed house.Photograph: ReutersSohail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesperson, called on international organisations to step in and offer assistance in the wake of the disaster. “Many villages are not accessible yet,” he said. “I fear the casualties are very high.”One resident from the Maza Dara area, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely, criticised the Taliban rescue efforts. “There are women and children pleading for help but there are no authorities present to help them,” he said.“Everyone is trapped under the rubble and we are helpless and seeing them dying in front of our eyes,” he added. “There is no one here to help those buried and alive in the debris.

As well as Russia, North Korea and Iran, leaders from Myanmar, Mongolia, Indonesia, Zimbabwe and central Asian countries will witness China’s unveiling of a range of combat-ready weaponry. The only western leaders on the guest list published by China’s ministry of foreign affairs are from Serbia and Slovakia.“Xi Jinping is trying to lay out his ambition for the global order,” said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. In Xi’s view, “the world should be multipolar, led byChina, and joined by many non-western countries,” Yu said.Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, is already in China, having attended theShanghai Cooperation Organisationsummit in Tianjin over the weekend. India’s president, Narendra Modi, also attended the annual gathering of Eurasian leaders, a sign of thawing China-India relations at a time when India has been hit by 50% tariffs by the US as apunishment for purchases of Russian oil.Xi Jinping criticises ‘bullying behaviour’ and Putin blames west for Ukraine war at Shanghai summitRead moreAs well as showing Beijing’s power to gather non-western leaders, the parade – two months after US’s ownlacklustre military paradeheld on Donald Trump’s 79th birthday in mid-June – provides a direct comparison of US and Chinese military strength that Beijing will be comfortable with.Wednesday’s bonanza comes “quite shortly after the awful US parade”, said Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It would “rub it in from the Chinese side”, he said, telling the US that “if you do parades, we can do it better than anyone else”.In recent months China has been stressing the importance of its narrative about the defeat of Japan in the second world war, which minimises the role of the west. In May, when Xi visited Moscow for Russia’s Victory Day parade, he wrote an article calling for the “correct historical perspective” on the war.Xi said China and the Soviet Union were the principle theatres of war in Asia and Europe, and that the two countries “served as the mainstay of resistance against Japanese militarism and German nazism, making pivotal contributions to the victory of the world anti-fascist war”.Xi’s article made no mention of the US or European contributions against the axis forces in the war.Several recent blockbuster films have also focused on China’s experience of the war. Dead to Rights, a film about the Nanjing massacre, in which more than 200,000 Chinese people in Nanjing were killed by Japanese troops in 1937, took more than 500m yuan (£52m) in the first four days of its release in Chinese cinemas in July.Another film,Dongji Rescue, tells the story of British prisoners of war who were rescued by Chinese fishers from a bombed Japanese cargo liner, while the Chinese government hasenthusiastically promotedadocumentaryon the same topic.Yu said the legitimacy of the ruling Chinese Communist party was based in part on its defeat of Japan 80 years ago, making the historical narratives particularly important as Beijing grapples with challenging economic forces and a trade war with the US that threatens to undermine the prosperity of ordinary Chinese people.Analysts will be closely watching Wednesday’s parade for signs of China’s military upgrade, especially anything that could be of particular relevance to an assault on Taiwan.China’s war chest: Beijing’s ‘great wall of steel’ faces obstacles to military supremacyRead more“Taiwan is the great unspoken piece of the parade,” said Charles Parton, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. By projecting military might, he said, Beijing is “sending a message to the Taiwanese that resistance is futile”.In May, Chinese weaponry appeared to prove itself in a conflict between India and Pakistan, when Pakistan used ChineseJ10-C jetsto shoot down several Indian fighter jets. The role of Chinese kit in that conflict, while never officially acknowledged by Beijing, was nonetheless highlighted in Chinese media as a success story for China’s military capabilities.Even more advanced jets could be on display at this week’s parade. Wezeman expects to see so-called “fifth-generation” fighter jets such as the J-20, a more advanced and stealthy version of the J-10C jets used by Pakistan in May.Crucially, Chinese jets are increasingly made with Chinese rather than Russian engines, part of China’s military modernisation plan, which stresses the importance of self-reliance. “The whole point for China is to be totally independent of anybody else, including the Russians,” Wezeman said.That desire for military self-sufficiency comes at a time when China’s key ally on the world stage, Russia, has been propped up by Chinese economic support and North Korean troops during its war in Ukraine. Many analysts believe Beijing is learning lessons from that conflict to inform its thinking about a potential conflict with Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as part of its own territory.And while it is difficult to showcase China’s naval progress in a parade through the concrete streets of Beijing, there may be certain technology, such as supersonic drones and large underwater drones, that could show China’s ability to “deter anyone coming to the aid of Taiwan via the sea”, Wezeman said.Explore more on these topicsChinaRussiaNorth KoreaIranIndiaXi JinpingVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Only 11 councils provided full responses, yet they revealed 45,157 potentially contaminated sites, suggesting the true figure could be far higher.While most of Wales’s industrial waste legacy has never been investigated, in some places its impact is clear to see.In Ynysddu, a village in the Sirhowy valley in south Wales, waste from companies was dumped in the former Ty Llwyd quarry on the mountain above the village in the 1960s and 70s.Residents havewarned for yearsthat after heavy rainfall, foul-smelling brown and foamy liquid seeps from the quarry and downhill into the surrounding woods, council-owned land that was used by children and dogwalkers until it was recently fenced off.In 2023, testing by Dr David Megson, an environmental chemist from Manchester Metropolitan University, found unsafe levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Ynysddu. PCBs are forever chemicals that accumulate in the food chain and can cause liver damage and increased cancer risk in humans.All testing commissioned by Caerphilly county borough council to date has indicated zero level of PCBs, and the site is not legally defined as contaminated land.Megson has suggested that the council may be using tests that are not sensitive enough, or testing in the wrong places. Caerphilly council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Jane Beechy, 64, bought a plot of land at the bottom of the mountain in 2013, which she intended to use for stables. She had the land tested before she purchased it, and the results said it contained slightly elevated levels of chloroform – safe for horses, but not young children.View image in fullscreenJane Beechy with one of her miniature ponies.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianHowever, over the past decade, more frequent and prolonged periods of wet weather have led groundwater levels in the quarry to rise and sometimes flood the woodland and land downhill. Since 2018, water from the quarry has begun pooling on Beechy’s land, and she says that nothing will grow there any more.“It ruined my business plans. Who is going to keep their horses here if they don’t think it’s safe?” she said.At the Ynysddu allotments, soil samples tested positive for PCBs after Storm Dennis in 2020, when water rushed down the mountain from the quarry and the river flowing through the valley broke its banks, flooding parts of the village.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of Wales’s 22 local authorities, only six publish a legally mandated contaminated land register online, leaving communities in the dark about what may be lying under their feet.On Tuesday, Friends of the Earth Cymru called for a public inquiry into the scale and impact of contaminated land in Wales and for the UK and Welsh governments to provide councils with the resources to identify and clean up potentially dangerous sites.Its spokesperson Kirsty Luff said: “It’s shocking that so much land could be contaminated and yet isn’t being properly inspected. People in Wales deserve to know whether the places where they live, work, and play are free from pollution.“This issue must not be ignored. The longer the delay, the greater the risk to our health, our environment and future generations.”The Welsh government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The picturecould be similar across the rest of the UK. A BBC investigation suggests that of13,093 potentially toxic sitesidentified as high-risk in the early 2000s, only 1,465 have been inspected.Explore more on these topicsWalesPollutionWasteHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool also stepped up efforts to sign the Crystal Palace captain, Guéhi, who had a medical in London in anticipation of joining Arne Slot’s side after Steve Parish, the Palace chair, accepted £35m plus £5m in add-ons for the defender.Away the lad: how Isak’s long and messy departure from Newcastle unfolded | Louise TaylorRead moreButPalace dramatically pulled the plugon the deal when they failed to sign an experienced replacement. Liverpool had submitted a deal sheet to complete the transfer after the 7pm deadline when it collapsed. A Palace bid for Brighton’s Igor Julio fell through and a move for another higher-profile centre-back also failed to materialise.Oliver Glasner, the Palace manager, is understood to have been furious at the decision to accept Liverpool’s offer and reiterated his plea not to sell his captain during heated talks with Parish. There were even fears that the Austrian, who led Palace to their first trophy when they won the FA Cup in May, could step down after making it clear that they must keep hold of Guéhi to have a successful season.The England international is in the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park and has no intention of signing an extension. Liverpool may renew their attempts to sign Guéhi in January but he could have interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich if he becomes a free agent next summer. Parish had said after Palace’s win in the Community Shield last month that it would be in the club’s best interests to sell Guéhi rather than lose him for free.Despite missing out on their main central defensive target Liverpool managed to end the summer’s longest and most acrimonious transfer saga in their favour with the record signing of Isak. Liverpool had a £110m bid for the 25-year-old rejected on 1 August. Newcastle’s position at that time was that Isak was not for sale. However, his subsequent strike and public statements allied to their£70m signing of Nick Woltemadeand attempts to sign either Yoane Wissa or Jørgen Strand Larsen encouraged Liverpool to submit a higher offer on Sunday night.Newcastle accepted a fixed fee of £125m with no add-ons. The cancellation of loyalty bonuses to Isak means the deal is effectively worth £130m to Newcastle, who paid£55m to sign Wissa from Brentford. Wissa behaved similarly to Isak to force his move to St James’ Park.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak scored 27 goals in all competitions for Newcastle last season.Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters“I want to create history. I want to win trophies,” said Isak. “That’s ultimately the biggest motivation for me and I feel like this is the perfect place for me to grow even further and to take my game to the next level and help the team as well.“I feel like this is the next step for me in my career. I’m super happy that I’ve been given this chance and I’m very motivated to do something well with it.”The fee for Isak falls short of Newcastle’s £150m valuation but still represents a British transfer record and the second time this summer that Liverpool have broken their own transfer record. The champions paid £100m plus £16m in add-ons for Florian Wirtz in June and the Isak deal will take their total summer spending above £440m. Liverpool have recouped more than £210m in player sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He refused to play in a pre-season friendly against Celtic and did not go on Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia, citing a thigh injury. Since then he has been absent from the squad, at one stage training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, and has not spoken to the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, for more than a fortnight. Howe said pointedly on Friday that morale was strong within the Newcastle squad after a difficult opening two weeks of pre-season. Isak was part of pre-season training for only the first two weeks.The centre-forward accused Newcastle of breaking a commitment that he could leave if a suitable offer came from a big club and refused overtures from the club hierarchy to reopen negotiations over a new contract. A meeting at his home last Monday proved decisive. Isak informed a delegation that included representatives of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Newcastle’s financial backers, that he would never play for the club again. The Newcastle contingent left within 45 minutes and moves were soon made to sign Woltemade.Liverpool’s deadline-day business did not end with Isak and Guéhi. The champions accepted an offer from Aston Villa to sign Harvey Elliott on a season’s loan with an obligation to buy the England Under-21 international for £35m next summer. Liverpool also received approaches from Milan, Brighton and Palace for Joe Gomez in the final 24 hours of the transfer window but doubts over the Guéhi deal – well founded, as it turned out – meant they did not consider letting Gomez leave. Including the £35m for Elliott, Liverpool recouped £245m in transfer fees this window.Liverpool believe their central defensive options of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, Gomez and the new signing Giovanni Leoni, who is regarded as a potentially elite talent, should cover the failure to sign Guéhi.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolNewcastle UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Other groups put the tally far higher.Just one week before, another four Al Jazeera journalists and two freelancers were killed by a targeted Israeli strike on their tent outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. TheIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) said it deliberately targeted the Al Jazeera crew– the correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who had reported on the war since its outset, the reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, the cameraman Ibrahim Zaher, and Mohammed Noufal, a crew driver and cameraman. The IDF claimed it had evidence that Sharif was a Hamas terrorist.The CPJ and other organisations say that this claim is part of a pattern of misinformation – along with other cases where slainjournalists have been labelled as Hamas fightersor operatives – and is without credibility.The Israeli military has prevented international journalists from entering and reporting on the war, and has decimated Gaza’s own media community. Under international law, journalists should be protected civilians, yet the CPJ says that Israel is “engaging in the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented”.“Palestinian journalists are being threatened, directly targeted and murdered by Israeli forces, and are arbitrarily detained and tortured in retaliation for their work. By silencing the press – those who document and bear witness – Israel is silencing the war,” the organisation said.View image in fullscreenThe Gaza Media Center says that 238 journalists and media workers have been killed in the conflict.Photograph: Gaza Media Center/Anadolu/Getty ImagesDespite growing global condemnation and concerns over breaches of international law, Israel is continuing its military assault on Gaza and it is likely that more journalists will die as a result.The Guardian is printing the names of all the Palestinian journalists listed by the CPJ as having died as a result of Israeli military action since October 2023 as part of a day of action in condemnation of the killings and in solidarity with those journalists who remain, reporting on the war in Gaza.The names on this list not only constitute lost lives, futures and grieving families, but the loss of ageneration of journalistskilled doing their jobs in the most frightening and devastating of environments and whose bravery and dedication to covering this conflict cannot be replaced.This list will continue to be updated as more deaths occur. The CPJ list stands at 189. The Gaza Media Center and other Palestinian media groups put thenumbers higher,at 238; theUN human rights office puts the figure at 247.Ahmed Abu AzizJournalist 25/8/25Nasser hospital, Khan

But here are five questions she will face when she does speak publicly about it.1.Where does she actually live?Rayner spends time in three properties: a constituency home in Ashton-under-Lyne, a grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House on Whitehall, and a new flat in Hove.When she bought the flat in Hove in May, she classed it as her only property, allowing her to pay an estimated £30,000 in stamp duty rather than the higher rate of £70,000.The problem with this is that she has separately listed her constituency home as her primary property, in a move which allowed her to avoid paying about £2,000 a year in council tax on her grace-and-favour apartment in London.The Ashton home has now been put fully into a trust, allowing her to remove her name from the deeds and buy the Hove flat. But she still spends a lot of her time in that house, given her children live there and it is the only property out of the three which is in her constituency.2.Why did she put the Ashton house in a trust?The Mail on Sundayrevealed over the weekendthat Rayner had put her Greater Manchester house partly in a trust in 2023, before fully selling up this year. The trust was administered by Shoosmiths, a law firm which has a private wealth team to help rich clients manage their financial affairs.Some have suggested Rayner used a trust to avoid her children paying inheritance tax when she dies. However, experts say that if she is living there at the time of her death, they will still have to pay the tax, regardless of whether it is held in trust. That implies there may have been non-tax reasons to choose a trust, including making sure that none of her children can sell their share in the house without the agreement of the others.It may be significant however that at the time the property was put in trust, its value was listed at £650,000. If it had been a pound higher, Rayner would have had to pay an inheritance tax charge at that point.3.Has she broken any tax laws?Most tax experts agree with Rayner’s allies, who insist she has not broken any actual rules. There is nothing wrong, for example, with listing one property as a primary residence for council tax purposes but another for stamp duty purposes.Some however, believe this constitutes a loophole which Rayner has successfully exploited. “I have long said we should allow HMRC to communicate with councils so they can be consistent in their tax treatment of properties,” said Heather Powell, a partner at the accountant Blick Rothenberg.But some say tax inspectors could still revisit the question of whether Rayner should have paid more stamp duty on the Hove flat.“Simply removing your name from a deed is not enough to persuade the Revenue that that is not your primary property,” said Henry Pryor, a property agent. “If you are still living at that property, Revenue could deem your new one a secondary property for stamp duty purposes.”4.Why are her arrangements so complicated?Allies say Rayner’s family life makes her finances more complex than most. She had a child aged 16 with her then partner, Neil Batty, but the relationship did not last. She then married Mark Rayner, a trade union official, in 2010, and the couple had two sons.She and Rayner split in 2020 and are understood to have divorced in 2023, which was when they put the Ashton house into a trust, of which both served as trustees. She is now understood to alternate in the house with Mark, while their children remain there permanently.More recently Rayner has entered a relationship with Sam Tarry, the former Labour MP for Ilford South. The couple are reported to have spent time together at the Hove flat.Others however point out that many of her property decisions have also had the impact of minimising tax. “These arrangements are probably legal, but Mr and Mrs Average don’t do it – they can’t afford it,” said Powell.5.How is Labour planning to change property taxes in future?One reason the revelations have particular resonance is that they come just as Rachel Reeves looks for ways to repair her fiscal black hole, with property taxes reported to be in her crosshairs.The chancelloris reported to belooking at ways to tax second homes more, whether that is through a replacement to stamp duty, or more likely, higher rates of capital gains tax.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, spent Monday trying to highlight exactly that dichotomy, talking to homeowners in Reigate about what she believes the chancellor will announce at her budget later this year.That being said, Rayner did receive backing from an unexpected quarter last week, when the Reform UK leader insisted the row was confected. “This whole sort of hair-shirt approach – most of the press want politicians in sackcloth and ashes, would like all of us to be vegan and give up drinking,” said Nigel Farage. “Well, it’s not happening here.”Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerHousingLabourStamp dutyTaxPropertykey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Flooded with information and relentless updates, more and more people around the world are tuning out.The reasons vary: for some it’s the sheer volume of news, for others the emotional toll of negative headlines or a distrust of the media itself. In online forums devoted to mindfulness and mental health, people discuss how to step back, from setting limits to cutting the news out entirely.“Now that I don’t watch the news, I just don’t have that anxiety. I don’t have dread,” said Mardette Burr, an Arizona retiree who says she stopped watching the news about eight years ago. “There were times that I’d be up at two or three o’clock in the morning upset about something that was going on in the world that I just didn’t have a lot of control over.”She’s not alone. Globally, news avoidance is at a record high, according toan annual surveyby the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism published in June. This year, 40% of respondents, surveyed across nearly 50 countries, said they sometimes or often avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017 and the joint highest figure recorded.The number was even higher in the US, at 42%, and in the UK, at 46%. Across markets, the top reason people gave for actively trying to avoid the news was that it negatively impacted their mood. Respondents also said they were worn out by the amount of news, that there is too much coverage of war and conflict, and that there’s nothing they can do with the information.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Angelica Alzona/The GuardianJulian Burrett, a British marketing professional, said he’s intentionally unplugged from the news since the pandemic, after feeling almost addicted to constant negative updates. He’s deleted most media apps from his phone and avoids TV bulletins. Last year, he even started a small Reddit community,r/newsavoidance, to “consider the pros and cons, tips and tricks, and tools of avoiding news”.Others who spoke to the Guardian described varied approaches. One said he checks in on the news once a week to stay informed without being overwhelmed. Another said he has shunned the news for years, citing its effect on his mood and a broader distrust in the press. A Maryland man described feeling “enraged” by recent political developments, and tries to set boundaries by scanning headlines only.Studies suggest that increasedexposure to news– particularly via television and social media, and especially coverage of tragic ordistressing events– can take a toll on mental health.For decades, Roxane Cohen Silver has examined the consequences of consuming media about crises, from 9/11 and the Covid-19 pandemic to climate-related disasters and mass shootings.“With greater exposure, we see greater distress in people’s reports of their mental health. Greater anxiety, greater depression, greater post traumatic stress symptoms, acute stress symptoms,” said Silver, professor of psychology, medicine and public health at the University of California, Irvine.In recent years, her research has found political polarization to be a major stressor for people in the US. Similarly, political concerns topped the list last year in the American Psychological Association’s Stress in Americapoll, with the economy and spread of false news also ranking prominently.With the rise of smartphones and social media, opportunities for contact with distressing content have exploded, Silver noted.Teen killed himself after ‘months of encouragement from ChatGPT’, lawsuit claimsRead more“There’s just ample opportunity to be exposed to news all the time, through either push notifications on people’s phones, or people can be consuming news across many different modes simultaneously,” she said.Viewing graphic imagery, in particular, isassociatedwith psychological distress – a concern in an era when disturbing images of tragedies circulate freely beyond newsrooms’ control.A growing body of advice online promotes healthier ways to consume news. Much of it focuses on creating guardrails so people can be deliberate about finding information when they’re ready for it, instead of letting it reach them in a constant stream. This might include signing up for newsletters or summaries from trusted sources, turning off news alerts and limiting social media.“People can stay informed without doomscrolling,” Silver said. Applying learnings from her research to her own life, she reads news online, but skips videos, television and social media.“I don’t see any psychological or physical benefit from consumption of those kinds of images,” she said. “So if I’m reading a story and there is a video, I don’t click on it.”She suggests setting specific windows of time to read the news rather than staying immersed in that environment constantly, noting that it helps if people feel a sense of control over how much they’re being exposed.Benjamin Toff, director of the Minnesota Journalism Center at the University of Minnesota, studied the trend in his book Avoiding the News. He draws a key distinction between those who consistently avoid the news and those who simply limit their consumption – the latter, he says, is “perfectly healthy”.“We live in a world in which you can access news 24/7 and be inundated with information at all times. But that doesn’t mean you should,” he said.What worries him and his co-authors is when withdrawal turns into a cycle that deepens social divides, leaving some groups less likely to participate in political life.“The more you disengage, disconnect from the news, the harder it becomes to try to make sense of what’s happening on any given story,” he explained.The authors observed that consistent news avoidance tends to be more common among young people, women, and lower socioeconomic classes.“If you believe as we do, that normatively, we want people to be able to have the same opportunities to engage politically, to vote, to be vocal about the political issues that matter, then we think it’s a problem that people are disengaging from news,” Toff said."

It is about the central crisis in the life ofman-mountain Mark Kerr, America’s pioneering MMA and ultimate fighting champ, who in 1997 found himself in the ring, or maybe the cage, with his demons after the unthinkable humiliation of losing for the first time.This feature is in fact developed froma 2002 documentary about Kerrwith the same title. He confronted his substance abuse, relationship anxieties and the question of what the heck life is for if you can’t simply win all the time. Kerr is played by Dwayne Johnson, a colossus of muscle topped off with a head the size of Indiana Jones’s boulder, a body on which the only visible fat is rippling at the nape of his neck. Johnson’s appearance is modified by close-cut frizzy hair and facial prosthetics that make him look like Jon Favreau playing the Hulk. No other casting was remotely possible – not unless Timothée Chalamet fancied bulking up. (Sacha Baron Cohen could do it these days, and would probably want to play it every bit as seriously and non-satirically as Johnson.)The terrible, existential nightmare of losing – a possibility for which no one in Kerr’s professional or personal circle appeared to have prepared him – causes that giant statue of a man to wobble and topple. Kerr has to throw his opioids in the trash, enter rehab and deal again with the important people in his life; one of them is his best buddy, sometime coach and fighting rival Mark Coleman, slightly woodenly played here by Ryan Bader, an actualMMAfighter with no acting experience who doesn’t look as exotically jacked as Kerr.In those early days of MMA, the championship took place in Japan and it was called Pride; those hugely built male specimens would snarl, grapple and tussle under this title, and a cheekier, less brand-respectful film might have tried a gag here, or wondered if there were emotional aspects of the sport which had been left unexplored. The other person in Mark’s life, however, is his girlfriend Dawn, played with sympathy and wit byEmily Blunt, who has to cower and flinch as Mark, in a towering rage, will occasionally put his fist through the kitchen door. Immediately after the loss, Kerr has a breakdown which causes him to collapse; upon regaining consciousness, he remembers the medic testing him by asking him who the president is – he answers “Ronald Reagan”, a moment of droll political significance that Safdie doesn’t stress.Johnson’s testy and petulant post-rehab scenes with Blunt are shrewdly insightful; he scolds her for not pruning his giant cactus properly and not getting the leaves out of the pool. Dawn realises that when her husband was drinking and the permanent throb of pain dulled with opioids, he was a sweet, loving boyfriend. Has sobriety revealed a nasty mean-minded guy who is always snitching on her to his AA sponsor? And is Dawn actually less important to Mark than his pal Coleman, whom he might have to fight for the world championship?It’s difficult to tell. The film does not really permit the various emotional crises and issues to supersede the importance of fighting all that much, and the fighting itself is not transformed or transfigured in the drama. Even the climax of the great Kerr-Coleman face-off doesn’t make it entirely clear if Kerr has in some sense chosen his girlfriend over his friend and his sport. The movie doesn’t reach for tragedy or extreme dysfunction, like Sean Durkin’s The Iron Claw from 2023 or Bennett Miller’s Foxcatcher from a decade earlier, nor does Safdie go for big set pieces, like a boxing movie might, with eve-of-battle scenes in the dressing room.However, there is one bravura moment when Kerr, in shock after his loss, walks through the corridors, politely complains to the sponsor about his opponent breaking the rules; still sweaty and in his trunks, he then goes down one floor in the elevator causing a member of the venue’s restaurant staff carrying bread to think twice about getting in with him … and then Kerr bursts into tears in his dressing room. These moments of vulnerability are touching, though I wished the film could have promoted the excellent Blunt to equal status in the drama.The Smashing Machine screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsUFCDwayne Johnson (The Rock)Emily BluntVenice film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ilove summer, except for the last part of August, which I find really melancholy. The juice has been squeezed out of summer, the grass sun-faded, holidays in the rear view mirror. I’m happy for September to roll around.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.With the first cool days come the return of layering, which is when we start to see new styling tricks on the streets. And fashion shows start again soon, with lots of new designers bringing fresh ideas. It’s going to be a fun month.Also, you don’t have to be going back to school to buy yourself a back-to-school treat. Read on for the skirts of the season, the high-street steals of the moment and the zeitgeisty styling tricks to jump on. Sharpened pencils at the ready.Is it Schiaparelli? No, it’s MangoView image in fullscreenKnitted jacket with jewelled buttons£59.99 at MangoEye-catching, witty buttons have been a signature detail of the house of Schiaparelli for a century. Elsa herself commissioned none other than Alberto Giacometti to make buttons in the shape of birds and figures in the 1930s; current designer Daniel Roseberry fastens his pieces with golden ears, jewelled keyholes or coins. So the five different buttons on this Mango jacket give it a distinct “Paris fashion week” sensibility. Sound the high-street bargain klaxon.Wearable barrel-leg jeans really do existView image in fullscreenAuthentic barrel-leg jeans£95 at Whistles£95 at M&SI get asked about jeans a lot at the moment. Mostly by women who know that their go-to straight or skinny jeans look old-fashioned, but struggle to find loose-fit versions that look good if you aren’t 19 with giraffe legs.Strong recommend for these Whistles jeans, which I bought recently and am so pleased with. They’re non-stretch – essential for a fit that holds shape – with a definite but not-over-the-top curve silhouette at the hip. By the way, they look cropped on the model, but on 5’5” me they’re a perfect top-of-the-shoe length.My favourite summer braceletView image in fullscreenBohemian amour bracelet£45 at AtelierI am a big fan of bracelets and rings: it’s so cheering to catch a glimpse of them while you’re typing or cooking. Earrings and necklaces are lovely too, but you only see those in the mirror, right?I’ve been wearing my L’Atelier 73 bracelet for the past few months. It’s charmingly holiday-ish – the mixed textures, the barrel charm, the colour – but elegant, too. Not just a summer fling, I’m sticking with it to bring a much-needed dash of boho free spirit to hard-working September.Classic pointelle school socksView image in fullscreenPointelle-knit socks£4.99 at H&MWhen Bella Freud welcomed Valentino designer Alessandro Michele on to her podcast recently, he was wearing classic pointelle white ankle socks, and they bonded over how much they love them. I hadn’t thought about them since wearing them at school, but I went straight out and bought some. I’m wearing them today with my dark denim Whistles jeans (see above) and loafers.Socks are very important in fashion right now, so this is an excellent style update for a fiver: Alessandro’s were Valentino, but mine are by H&M. Cautionary note: stick to ankle-length, not knee-high, or the school uniform vibe gets a bit icky.Ethically sourced, affordable cashmereView image in fullscreenCandy floss long-sleeveT-shirt£145 at Jean and TempleMiranda Waller, founder of small British cashmere brand Jean and Temple, designs her pieces at home in Suffolk. The knitwear is made in a small, family-run factory in Nepal, with oversight of working conditions and animal welfare in the yarn production.A blend of 70% silk with 30% cashmere gives a luxe finish that’s useful all year round and featherlight, so the fabric drapes elegantly with no bulk. I love the Jean and Temple cashmere and silk long-sleeve T-shirt in candy floss pink (it also comes in blue, grey and black).Just a friendly reminder that you may want to rethink leggingsView image in fullscreenFlared sports leggings£27.99 at H&MBack in March, I wrotea column about how the cool kids are ditching tight leggingsand wearing looser workout gear.Now everyone has caught up, and you can’t move for “death of leggings” think-pieces, but you heard it here first.I’m weaning myself off leggings by moving on to these stretchy flared workout trousers from H&M. They don’t flap around when you’re on the reformer pilates bed, but they have a modern silhouette that helps them pass for “proper” clothing before and after class. H&M Move has had a real glow-up, by the way: good colours and fabrics without the price tags of fancy workout brands.This M&S skirt is a total winner. You need to buy it immediatelyView image in fullscreenHigh-waisted miniskirt£50 at M&SI mean, look at it. All-over tassels, a great length (short but not too short), and a chic off-white colour. And £50 from Marks and Sparks! Snap it up.One new belt, two new looksView image in fullscreenLuxury black suede belt£80 at Peachy BeltsBack in February,I declared 2025 to be the year of the belt, and lo, it hath come to pass. A great belt is up there with a good pair of socks as the simple, affordable, wearable style hack of 2025.Zoe Gibson founded Peachy Belts in 2005 and has been selling top-notch (sorry) belts handmade in England from Italian leather ever since. Buckles are detachable, so you can buy one belt with two buckles – for instance, this one comes with a simple silver buckle for day, and you can add a snazzy pearl one for evening. Not cheap, but gorgeous quality to last for ever.A great transitional jacketView image in fullscreenSuede-collarfieldjacket£189 at Cos£189 at H&MDo not underestimate the usefulness of a between-seasons jacket. There are many, many times when you will need more than a cardi but less than a proper coat. The barn jacket is going to be even bigger this winter than it was last year, and this Cos jacket with a softly waisted silhouette is an elegant take. You can wear this with a chunky knit and cords this autumn, and then over shorts or a dress to festivals next summer.Fashion prediction: a silk skirt with a lace trimView image in fullscreenCarolina silk skirt£218 at Reformation£230 at Harvey NicholsA while ago, Alexa Chung was wearing a pastel silk skirt with a lace trim on an Instagram post, and I had a “I want one of those now” moment, which to be honest I don’t get all that often any more.Mark my words, this will be one of those everyone-is-wearing-it pieces soon. I’m stalking a couple of past-season Dôen skirts on Vinted, but I’m also bewitched by this silk skirt from Reformation. It comes in lots of colours, but the cherry blossom pink with ivory trim is particularly delicious.Explore more on these topicsFashionJess Cartner-Morley‘s editSkirtsJeansWomen's topsAccessoriesWomen's trousersWomen's coats and jacketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This slur against robots is all over the internet – but is it offensive?The term is used to insult AI chatbots and platforms like ChatGPT for making up information and generating ‘slop’. Some believe we should stop using it, prontoMon 1 Sep 2025 12.23 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 13.27 EDTShareName:Clanker.Age:20 years old.Appearance:Everywhere, but mostly on social media.It sounds a bit insulting.It is, in fact, a slur.What kind of slur?A slur against robots.Because they’re metal?While it’s sometimes used to denigrate actual robots – including delivery bots and self-driving cars – it’s increasingly used to insult AI chatbots and platforms such as ChatGPT.I’m new to this – why would I want to insult AI?For making up information, peddling outright falsehoods, generating “slop” (lame or obviously fake content) or simply not being human enough.Does the AI care that you’re insulting it?That’s a complex and hotly debated philosophical question, to which the answer is “no”.Then why bother?People are taking out their frustrations on a technology that is becoming pervasive, intrusive and may well threaten their future employment.Clankers, coming over here, taking our jobs!That’s the idea.Where did this slur originate?First used to refer pejoratively to battle androids in a Star Wars game in 2005, clanker was later popularised in the Clone Wars TV series. From there, it progressed to Reddit, memes and TikTok.And is it really the best we can do, insult-wise?Popular culture has spawned other anti-robot slurs – there’s “toaster” from Battlestar Galactica, and “skin-job” from Blade Runner – but “clanker” seems to have won out for now.It seems like a stupid waste of time, but I guess it’s harmless enough.You say that, but many suggest using “clanker” could help to normalise actual bigotry.Oh, come on now.Popular memes and spoof videos tend to treat “clanker” as being directly analogous to a racial slur – suggesting a future where we all harass robots as if they were an oppressed minority.So what? They’re just clankers.“Naturally, when we trend in that direction, it does play into those tropes of how people have treated marginalised communities before,” says linguist Adam Aleksic.I’m notanti-robot; I just wouldn’t want my daughter to marry one.Can you hear how that sounds?Ihave a feeling we’re going tobe very embarrassed about all this in 10 years.Probably. Some people argue that, by insulting AI, we’re crediting it with a level of humanity it doesn’t warrant.That would certainly be my assessment.However, the “Roko’s basilisk” thought experiment posits that a future artificial superintelligence might punish all those who failed to help it flourish in the first place.I guess calling it a clanker would count.We may end up apologising to our robot overlords for past hate crimes.Or perhaps they’ll see the funny side of all this?Assuming the clankers develop a sense of humour some day.Do say:“The impulse to coin this slur says more about our anxieties than it does about the technology itself.”Don’t say:“Some of my best friends are clankers.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Pass notesRobotsChatbotsSmartphonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She even believes it’s lowering her biological agePaula CocozzaMon 1 Sep 2025 07.29 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 07.30 EDTShareTina Woods was sitting in a taxi when the dancing bug bit. It was after midnight and she and two friends were heading home from another friend’s 60th birthday party. South-west London rolled past the window. They had had a bit to drink. As they passed Le Fez nightclub, they realised they didn’t want to go home. “We were like: let’s go dancing before we go to bed,” she says.Woods, then 56, had gone clubbing in her 20s, but on Le Fez’s dancefloor, as her body caught the beat, she had “an epiphany moment”, a shock of pure euphoria: “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection – was like a lightning bolt.” She knew then that “dancing and music were going to be a bigger part of my life than I’d ever thought”.Woods, who lives in London but grew up in Montreal, Canada, has always been active. She loves travelling, mountain climbing and Zumba. But now she has started clubbing – with friends or with Nick, her husband of nearly 30years.“I started to get into the softer end of techno – melodic techno, tech house,” she says. “I loved the beat, the bass line – Afrobeats and a Latin vibe. I realised that my brain was responding to that music in a way that was incredibly energising. It made me feel alive.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m finding myself again.’ Tina as her alter ego.Photograph: Marek Misiurewicz/International Institute of LongevityWoods had studied genetics at Cornell university in Ithaca, New York. Her first job, after moving to London in her early 20s, was as a medical writer for a company that made training films for doctors. She worked in healthcare until she was 53 and is now a consultant specialising in health technology in relation to longevity; she has published a book on how to live longer with AI.In the joy she felt on the dancefloor, she began to see a connection to her work. “I’m trying to bring scientific rigour and understanding into this environment of dance and the neurochemistry of music to understand what promotes health and wellbeing – and, linked to that, what could delay the ageing process,” she says.Since she was 56, she has tested her biological age and says she is getting younger. At 60, one test put her at 35. Dancing has brought new, intergenerational friendships, such as with Yukari, an aspiring DJ Woods met on the dancefloor while in Japan at a conference.However, when she was 59, pain from bunions in her feet reached unbearable levels. The problem was so severe that some of Woods’s toes became dislocated. She decided to undergo surgery. “I was thinking: what’s important in my life? For me, that’s being mobile and energetic.” She knew the surgery would necessitate four to six months of recovery.Aphex Twin, a Brixton squat and a load of wet mattresses: revisiting Telepathic Fish, the heart of the 90s chillout boomRead more“How am I going to cope?” thought Woods, who has trouble relaxing. “But there’s always a positive side, if you look for it. I thought: I’ll learn to mix music.” Woods underwent surgery in December 2023, a week before Christmas – for which her three sons gave her a present of DJ equipment. The learning process was under way.One night, having recovered her mobility, she and her husband were on their way to a gig in east London when they stopped for a drink at the venue Love Shack. “We kept seeing people coming and going … They showed us this secret room under the railway arches and there’s this huge pulsating party.”Woods had found the venue for her DJing debut. She discussed it with Yukari. “We were like: ‘Let’s do a gig,’” Woods says. “ Before we knew it, more than 200 people had signed up.”They called their eventLongevity Rave. Woods now DJs once a month; she has DJed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London. The dancefloor is always a mix of ages. “I’m finding myself again, in a funny sort of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Everything about who I am as a woman,” she says.She doesn’t plan to stop her consultancy business: “DJing is not a career. It’s more of a calling.” But her world has become “more vivid … more electric … There are lots of successful DJswell into their 60s and 70s. So who knows? I’m just following a path, seeing where it goes.”Live Longer With AI: How Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Us Extend Our Healthspan and Live Better Too by Tina Woods is published by PacktTell us: has your life taken a new directionafter the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60Health & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t like a dictator,” the president said.Yet his comments came weeks after hedeployedarmed soldiers and Humvee-style military vehicles to patrol the streets of Washington, claiming, despite all available evidence, that the use of the national guard wasnecessaryto control crime.The remarks followed Trump withholding, or threatening to withhold, billions of dollars from universities, and after the increasingly politicizedFBI raidon the home of John Bolton, a prominent critic of Trump.Trump has alsotargeted law firmswho have filed lawsuits he opposes, while the Federal Communications Commission, led by a Trump appointee, isinvestigatingevery major broadcast network except Fox, which owns the pro-Trump Fox News channel. Trump has personallysuednews channels over critical coverage andfiredthe government’s top labour statistician because she published jobs data that he didn’t like.He hasthreatenedDemocratswith prosecution, anddemandedthat former president Barack Obama be investigated for treason. Trump has done all this as his family has ostensiblyearnedmillions of dollars from his presidency.None of these things are typical for a democratic leader. So … is Trump a dictator?Step back and take it in: the US is entering full authoritarian mode | Jonathan FreedlandRead more“Yes, of course,” said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology at Princeton University who spent years researching autocracies including Hungary and Russia. Scheppele said she had been wavering on using the term “dictatorship” until recently, but said: “If I was hesitating before, it’s this mobilization of the national guard and the indication that he plans to overtake resistance by force that now means we’re in it.”Trump, emboldened by a Republican party that appears willing to let their leader do whatever he wants, is now threatening to send troops to Democratic-run cities includingChicago,Baltimore,San FranciscoandNew York City, promptingoutcryand accusations of abuse of power.Scheppele said: “He’s really planning a military, repressive force, to go out into the streets of the places that are most likely to resist his dictatorship and to just put down the whole thing by force.”Most modern dictators try to hide their aspirations. Scheppele said leaders such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Turkey’sRecep Tayyip Erdoğanhave gone to “great lengths” to avoid looking like “20th-century dictators” in the hopes they can avoid the label.“If you think of dictators as, you know, tanks in the streets and large numbers of military people saluting the leader, and big posters of the leader going up on national buildings, all that stuff does remind everybody of Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia and all and Mussolini’s Italy,” she said.Hence Orbán, Erdoğan and the like attempting to avoid those scenes. But it doesn’t seem to bother Trump.View image in fullscreenA portrait of Donald Trump hangs on the Labor Department headquarters near the Capitol in Washington DC on 29 August.Photograph: José Luis Magaña/APJust this week, agiant bannerwas draped over the Department of Labor building, showing Trump glaring out over Washington DC above the slogan “American workers first”. On his birthday, which coincided with the 250th anniversary of the formation of the US army, he held amilitary paradein the capital, and wasreportedly furiousthat the troops did not look “menacing” enough.In Trump’s first term, as he railed against political norms, the bookHow Democracies Die– which examined the unraveling of democracies around the world – became a bestseller.Steven Levitsky, the book’s co-author and a political scientist at Harvard University, said Trump has the mentality of “a classic tin-pot dictator”, but said the president hasn’t managed to become one so far.“Technically in political science terms, no, he’s not a dictator. The United States, I think, is collapsing into some form of authoritarianism. But it has not consolidated into an outright dictatorship,” Levitsky said.Trump has said he is not a dictator, but claimed last week: “A lot of people are saying: ‘Maybe we’d like a dictator.’” It’s not clear who he was referring to, but hecontinuedthe theme on Tuesday.“The line is that I’m a dictator. But I stop crime. So a lot of people say: ‘You know, if that’s the case, I’d rather have a dictator,’” Trump said in a cabinet meeting.The Guardian asked the White House what data Trump was citing when he claimed Americans want a dictator, but did not receive a response.Dictators everywhere, first of all, claim that they’re not dictators. And second of all, somewhat contradictorally, claim that the people want a dictatorSteven Levitsky, author and political scientistLevitsky reiterated that he does not believe Trump is a dictator in the truest sense, but added: “Dictators everywhere, first of all, claim that they’re not dictators. And second of all, somewhat contradictorally, claim that the people want a dictator. Those are classic dictator lines.”The US has expressed interest in authoritarianism before. At the height of his fame a third of Americans tuned into the radio broadcasts of Charles Coughlin, a Catholic priest whose antisemitic broadcasts praised the likes of Benito Mussolini. Jim Crow laws were allowed to enforce racial segregation into the 1960s, while Senator Joseph McCarthy was allowed to persecute alleged communists during the so-called Red Scare.“You could always, in many, many periods of US history, find 25, 30% of the US electorate that was authoritarian-leaning, and I think that’s definitely true today,” Levitsky said.Today, that makes up a “big chunk” of the Republican party, he said, and Trump is leaning into that base.“There’s a real performative side to this government’s authoritarianism, which suggests that there is a constituency for it, which is very frightening. And I really haven’t seen anything like this sort of performative authoritarianism, honestly, since the 30s in Europe,” he said.Trump promised to be a dictator on day one. We’re now past day 200Read moreMost 21st-century authoritarian countries are “hybrid regimes”, Levitsky said. He pointed to Venezuela, Hungary, Tunisia and Turkey, where Erdoğan has spent more than two decades in power, cementing his position bycracking downon the country’s media andbringing thousands of criminal casesagainst people who insult the president.“They’re authoritarian, in that they’re not fully democratic: there’s widespread abuse of power that tilts the playing field against the opposition. So nobody would look at Turkey and say: ‘That’s a democracy.’ But they’re not what I would call a dictatorship. And that’s what I think the great danger is in the United States.”There is, Levitsky said, a “non-zero chance” that Trump could use emergency powers –as he hasin justifyingimmigrationmeasures andtariffs– to subvert the constitution, potentially undermining elections.But, he said: “The more likely outcome is a more mild authoritarianism where opposition exists, opposition is above board, opposition contests for power, competes in elections.“The government doesn’t win all its battles, but abuse of power – as we’ve seen in the last six, seven months – abuse of power is so widespread, so systematic, and violations of law, violations of rights are so widespread and systematic that the playing field begins to tilt against the opposition.“And you would not call that a full democracy.”"

Doing the same at a national level would be an antidote to Reform UKMon 1 Sep 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 11.04 EDTShareWake up to the peril. As MPs return to parliament, they should abandon that self-deluding pretence that it could never happen here in our “moderate” and “tolerant” land. On the contrary, Britain is at more risk of a populist right takeover than many of our European neighbours. With Labour in an electoral slough of despond, and the Tories looking dead already, the reptilian grin of Nigel Faragehaunts the political landscapeafter his satisfactory summer spent stoking division and cynicism.Our first past the post (FPTP) elections make us particularly vulnerable. As Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University,notes: “This is now a Farage-friendly electoral system.” Reform UK has reached the tipping point where winning as little as 30% support in our corkscrewed lottery of a voting system could propel him into No 10, however much that appals the other 70% of voters. “It’s certainly possible” he could be prime minister, was Farage’simplausible boast, a year ago. But as thelatest pollputs his party on 35% to Labour’s 20%, it keeps getting a little more credible.As it happens, in the Commons on Tuesday, MPs will be voting on afairer electoral system. Not, alas, for themselves in this most unrepresentative parliament in all history, where Labour commands almost two-thirds of the seats on just 34% of the vote. MPs tomorrow are voting on the more minor matter of restoring a fairer system for electing mayors in England,abolishing FPTPintroduced in the Elections Act 2022 as aTory gerrymander, returning instead to a supplementary vote system: a first and second choice. Expect sarcastic comments from the many electoral reformers in the house as the government solemnly explains why FPTP voting is unfair and leads to some grotesque results – but only when it’s a mayoral contest.Voter support for electoral reform in all-important general elections nowstands at 60%– its highest ever. People used to believe our system brought Britain strong and stable government, but the chaos of recent years has demonstrated that this isn’t the case. Since 2016, the UK has had six prime ministers, and among western democracies, UK cabinet ministers serve the shortest average terms. If once Britain once thought that its system kept the populist right out of parliament, it does no longer. Instead of being a barrier to dangerous outsiders it has become a springboard, catapulting Reform UK closer to power.Every Labour MP should study thenew reportfrom Compass, which analyses how a system designed to keep the lid on the pressure cooker of populism has become its dangerous enabler. With the old duopoly supplanted by five – soon to be six – UK-wide parties, having one winner take all and seizing the elective dictatorship of a Commons majority only increases voters’ political disengagement. Compass’s report, the Temper Trap, looks at the rise of populist-nationalist parties across the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Italy and Austria, and shows how their inclusion in coalitions under proportional representation (PR) forced them to moderate their extreme demands. Even in Italy, where populist-right voices are in the majority in cabinet, PR has softened their agenda.If the UK thinks itself a moderate country, analysis of its policies of the last 16 years shows how much more extreme it has been even than neighbours with coalitions that include the populist right. It has delivered some of the most immoderate policies in Europe: Brexit is wildly beyond anything done there. British policies on immigration, prison sentencing, deportations, austerity, deregulation, inequality and social justice were all delivered by radicalising a nominally “centre-right” Conservative party from the outside. With virtually no parliamentary presence,Reform UKand its spiritual predecessor Ukip transformed the political landscape.By way of contrast, look at Geert Wilders’ Freedom party (PVV) in the Netherlands. Despite winning the most votes its leader was denied power and the party had to compromise in coalition negotiations, putting to one side its positions onleaving the EU, banning Muslim schools and effecting mass deportations. It’s the same story with Finnish and Austrian populist parties, which negotiated their place in government by compromising on EU withdrawal, mass deportations and bans on foreign students. But, without PR as safety valve, Farage could take absolute power without moderating anything.Here’s the paradox: proportional representation allows populist-right parties into parliament but can stop them governing unchecked. FPTP keeps them out of parliament, but forces mainstream parties to co-opt their policies: see how the idea of withdrawing from the European convention on human rights is no longer a fringe issue.Labour, too, has undoubtedly been pushed further right by populist outsiders.No crystal ball can predict an election still nearly four years ahead. But Labour has the power and the duty to protect the country from the worst possible result, a hard-right populist government elected by a thin minority. The risk is substantial. It’s no longer in Labour’s self-interest to refuse a reform backed by nearly two-thirds of voters. Theparliamentary group on fair elections, by far the largest all-party group in parliament, on Monday published its reportcalling fora national commission on electoral reform. “The government needs to get to grips with this,” says the group’s chair, Labour MP Alex Sobel. Keir Starmer could set up a commission right away and implement change before the next election. He’s been accused of lacking purpose, but here is a strong (cost-free) cause that would protect democracy.Labour voted forelectoral reform at its 2022 conference: its national policy forum saysFPTP is driving“the distrust and alienation we see in politics”. While over half the all-party group are Labour MPs, the cabinet has a few adamant tribalists who resist PR as it would force coalition compromises: that old argument for not watering down socialism looks pretty weak now that Liberal Democrats and Greens in a coalition would push Labour leftwards. I’m told Starmer and Angela Rayner are said to be flexible pragmatists, along with Morgan McSweeney, who would back it if it helped Labour. Rumours suggest Reform UK, pushed hard by Richard Tice,might start dropping supportfor PR at its party conference this week. That should alert any Labour reluctants to the peril of staying with FPTP.An election bill is due shortly, having been delayed by the departure of Rushanara Ali, the homelessness minister who had the odd add-on of democracy minister. Who gets the latter job, and whether it’s taken more seriously, may indicate Starmer’s intentions. If the bill lands with no promise of a commission on electoral reform, a great many Labour MPs will sign an amendment to include it – that would be a serious rebellion on a fundamental principle. Better by far for Starmer to seize the initiative and make this his political challenge to the right and his lasting legacy.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s time they learned to live, laugh, loveMon 1 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 20.14 EDTShareMillennials are a generation infamous for their love of avocado toast, craft beer, Harry Potter, inventing the idea of a Disney adult and girlboss feminism. For that they’ve been subject to the brunt of our zeitgeist’s wrath in the years since.Resentful boomers began the anti-millennial crusade. That’s to be expected; older people griping about the kids is nothing new, but rather a rite of passage that signifies a healthy ecosystem within the age groups. Hell, even gen X occasionally joins in on the action.But now millennials face a brand-new beast of an enemy: their younger, meaner and far more tech-literate younger sibling, generation Z.It’s not hard to find anti-millennial sentiments on practically every mainstream social media site out there – zoomers are the new apex predator of the internet after all – even coining an antonym custom-fit for millennial uncoolness: cheugy.I was born at the tail-end of 1997, making me either the most fresh-faced millennial or the oldest gen Z hag, depending on who you ask. I’m otherwise known as a “zillennial”.The unexpected benefits of cringingRead moreSo as a generational fence-sitter with a foot in both camps, I reckon that I’m an excellent candidate to unravel this sibling rivalry.First, let’s point out the obvious: I’m sorry, dear millennials, but you are pretty easy to make fun of. From your bygone affinity for putting moustaches on literally everything, inventing stupid words like “doggo” and letting BuzzFeed control the culture for a couple of years, you really have a lot to answer for.I’ll be the first to admit I’ve partaken in bullying millennials but I’ve begun to hold back because – let’s face it – it’s pretty mean, and it’s not as though zoomers are that much cooler. Sure, they talk a big game but I don’t think the generation that made Labubus, JoJo Siwa and broccoli haircuts popular has a solid leg to stand on.Clearly, there is a cringe goldmine to be found in both generations. So why is it that it’s mostly millennials taking the heat?The truth is, millennials (for the most part) take cringe in their stride. Gen Z, on the other hand, is deeply terrified of being perceived as anything other than a specific type of curated cool.The poet and authorOcean Vuong spoke to the ABCin July about this phenomenon, saying “cringe culture” is holding young people back from enjoying life and pursuing what they want, whether related to their career, relationships or hobbies.Both generations share the dismal reality of never owning a home (without parental assistance) and being young under an ever-increasing threat of climate devastation. But while millennials unabashedly cultivated modern nerd culture and weren’t afraid to be seen as sincere online and IRL, gen Z find themselves weighed down by the heavy shackles of irony culture.Perhaps this type of swagless bravado is the only antidote we have to the hellscape we find ourselves inTo be perceived as earnest is a fate worse than death for the self-conscious, aura-farming zoomer, which leads them to lash out against those who do not follow the rules of their anti-cringe world.Millennials grew up quite literally alongside the internet, complete with awkward phases, while zoomers have never known a world devoid of near-constant and hyper-polished social monitoring.The digital landscape once ruled by millennials was “awesome”. Think back to those days when Photoshopped edits of cats in space, AutoTuned news reports and chaotically creative seven-second Vines were commonplace.Meanwhile, zoomers inherited AI slop, fascist influencers and megalomaniac tech overlords who also play a hand in global politics. How is that fair!?And while gen Z might bemaking more money than millennials, they alsohave more debt, might be havingless sex,fewer partiesandseem generally unhappier.We can chalk that up to unease about the state of the world and an unprecedented access to witnessing the successes of their seemingly happier peers. Things that millennials are all too familiar with.As the saying goes, millennials walked so that gen Z could run … and then make fun of them for it.I propose that gen Z open up their hearts and see that millennials, despite their cheuginess, share more commonalities with them than differences. Maybe then, after they finally embrace their own cringey attributes, they’d see that their “too cool” exterior is a prison of their own making.And yes, sure, millennial cringe is sometimes a bit too much to bear – I for one put forward that we completely remove the phrase “but first, coffee” from the lexicon – but perhaps this type of swagless bravado is the only antidote we have to the hellscape we find ourselves in.To be cringe is to be free. Live, laugh, love.Besides, gen alpha is steadily but surely on their way to dethrone the zoomers from their top spot, so are you ready to be bullied by the “skibidi toilet” generation with no one there to back you up?Eleanor Burnard is a production assistant at Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionGenerational inequalityYoung peopleInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

Moreover, he had attempted to take the unprecedented step offiring a board governor.b) The new US budget had been seen by the Congressional Budget Office asadding $3.4tn (£2.5tn) to the national debtover the next 10 years.By contrast, in the UK:a) The government had worked hard to stay within its fiscal rules and had made no attempt to interfere with the independence of theBank of England.b) In terms of the outlook for monetary policy, two-year yields in the UK and US had come down by about the same amount.Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for Van Winkle to expect that yields on longer-term US debt would have risen by more than in the UK. Hence, his astonishment when told that UK 30-year yields had risen by more than in the US.In talking to investors, I encounter strongly divergent views regarding Van Winkle’s puzzle. One group believes that this represents an anomaly and, given a catalyst, UK gilts (bonds) should outperform US treasuries. By contrast, some others believe that the UK gilts market is heading towards a full-blown crisis because of fiscal sustainability concerns. This camp points to the historical tendency of the Office for Budget Responsibility to be too optimistic with regard to its fiscal projections. They also worry that the OBR’s growth projections are too high. They point out that the OBR did not believe that the October 2024 budget would boost growth over a five-year period and are worried that recent tax changes have driven entrepreneurs away and changed the image of the UK as a place to invest.It is important to recall that market pricing is often dominated by the prevailing narrative. At the moment, thebond vigilantes are also circling in France. It is therefore time for the UK government to be bold and to change the image of the UK. This requires highly significant and eye-catching measures. Tinkering will not do.First, the autumn budget needs to be seen to be credible in terms of the fiscal projections. This will necessarily require some tough decisions.Second, the budget should raise revenue without hurting growth. The achilles heel of the 2024 budget was the rise in employer national insurance contributions, which was seen as hurting employment. It is therefore time to be bold and the government should engage in significant tax reform. By way of example, the introduction of a tax on land could raise revenue and actually increase growth if taxes on work could thereby be reduced over time.Recall that the quantity of land does not react negatively to a tax on its return, while labour supply and capital investment do. Continuing to raise taxes in ways that hurt growth might intensify fears that the current government is caught in a “doom loop” whereby each budget needs to raise taxes further because prior taxes hurt work or investment. I am therefore encouraged by recent speculation that the government is looking afresh at property taxes.Third, policies that are widely seen as increasing growth would help. These policies need to have a significant wow factor. An example would be joining the customs union.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One way of doing so would be to allow the Bank to set its own inflation target.Fifth, I argued a couple of years ago that inflation expectations in the UK were running higher than the inflation target. I said then that this would make the Bank of England slower to cut rates when, as now, the labour market was weakening. At the time, I resurrected an idea originally proposed by many distinguished economists – a tax on companies that give their staff inflation-busting pay deals. I continue to believe that such a tax would be rewarded by the gilts market and would allow the Bank to cut rates sooner.Sixth, the Bank needs to play its part here. It needs to make it known that it takes unwarranted moves in gilt yields into account in its monetary policy decisions and would therefore respond to, for example, contagion from the US. It also needs to reconsider its policy relating to quantitative tightening.To conclude, the government has an opportunity to increase growth and reduce its debt interest bill at the next budget. Boldness will be rewarded by markets now and, very likely, the electorate eventually.Sushil Wadhwani is an economist and a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committeeExplore more on these topicsEconomicsBondsBank of EnglandUS economyFederal ReserveDonald TrumpGiltscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s almost sweet – if you remove the contextMon 1 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 12.44 EDTShareIf soldiers are going to be deployed to your city, what would you prefer they do: point a rifle in your face or mow your grass? This is not a question I ever expected to have to consider in my days on this planet, but life is full of surprises. As part of Donald Trump’s military deployment to address Washington DC’s so-called “crime emergency”, national guard troops are being tasked with variousgroundskeeping dutiesaround the United States capital. These duties include spreading mulch around cherry trees, picking up trash and general maintenance of public spaces. The president must have been too embarrassed to getFour Seasons Total Landscapinginvolved again, so he got the military to do it instead.It’s a real “swords into ploughshares” moment, or in this case, “M4 rifles into thosegrabber sticks you use to pick up plastic bottles full of piss.” It’s almost sweet, if you separate the move from literally all outside context and just think about a part-time soldier pruning your bush. The national guard is actuallytrained for sanitation and groundskeeping, but they are usually deployed for such purposes in a crisis like a natural disaster or even during the height of the Covid pandemic. Except: there’s no natural disaster, no stay-at-home orders due to a deadly virus, no wildfires, no floods. The only crisis here is man-made.America survived a coup attempt. Can it endure dictatorial creep? | Lawrence DouglasRead moreIt’s usually the responsibility of the National Parks Service to beautify spaces in DC, but amid recent cuts by the Trump administration, the number of parks employees in the city fell from 200 to a mere 20, according to theWashington Post. Still, the guard wasn’t deployed to toss cigarette butts. This is happening because of alleged rampant crime in a city where the violent crime rate before Trump’s deployment wasdown by about 20% over the same period in earlier years.Some estimates place the cost of the DC military deployment at around a$1m a day. I will happily rake your leaves for half that.The guards assigned to cleaning up the capital are not armed and may be happy to be on trash duty rather than engaged in more aggressive operations. I’m thrilled for them, to be honest. This is the best version of an awful situation, but from my perspective, it could be even better. Why are they just cleaning up parks when they could be doing so much more with $1m a day in taxpayer revenue? Let’s really put these people to work.Sure, I love visiting my local park or perusing the public square, but you know where I really spend the majority of my time? At home. On my couch. Watching television. I’d toss in an extra $50 if the national guard would organize my refrigerator. I never can seem to keep track of all the produce in there and it inevitably goes bad. I’d get that $50 back just from the cost savings of not having to throw out old spinach every week.How about car repair? My passenger side door has a small ding in it. Grab a hammer and pop that thing back out. I need to call my mother back. She’s in her late 70s and is clearly very lonely. Maybe someone from the national guard can stop by to check on her for me. Pop a finger under her nose just to be sure she’s still breathing. I make a mean spaghetti bolognese from a Stanley Tucci recipe. The guard should come over and have some. I always make too much, and then I forget the leftovers are in the fridge because … I can’t organize my fridge.You might say that these are all things that someone else (me) should already be doing. Sure, I cannot deny that calling my mother is actually my responsibility, but is that so different from the guard entering a city to do what an already well-funded police department is actively engaged in every day? How is this different from firing most of the DC-based parks service members, then spending thousands of dollars to have someone else do it? And until my specific needs are met, how can we, as a nation, truly be free? Someone has to do the dirty work of calling my mother. I don’t see any volunteers lining up, and as a taxpayer, I’ve already invested in this service. The national guard has entered my home town of Los Angeles,Washington DC, and potentially others in the future, without anyone asking me (or really any other actual citizen of those places). If I’m going to be stuck with an unwanted houseguest who costs me seven figures every day of their visit, then I ask them to please do their fair share.My mom would greatly appreciate it.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsUS militaryOpinionWashington DCDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

While Starmer has taken the traditional time off, the Reform UK leader has been in overdrive, fromholding seven(increasingly chaotic) press conferences to featuring inglossy profiles in the broadsheetsand adorning a further 22front pages. Throughout it all, Farage has had the air of a conman seeing how long he can get away with playing at prime minister before anyone notices.That this hasn’t needed to involve any actual governing has suited the I’m a Celeb alumnus perfectly. Rightwing populism breeds on complaints rather than cabinet meetings, with Reform enjoying the media coverage of a major player and the lack of scrutiny of a nonentity. The impact of this has been staggering: concern over immigration – already seen by the public as the most important issue facing Britain – hasshot upeight percentage points since July, according to Ipsos. And that’s before any bounce from Reform’s party conference this week.It is not as if Farage’s PM cosplay has been made difficult for him. He was given free rein to set the agenda this summer by a bored and willing press, with the same editors keen to oversaturate him at any time of year grateful for content to cover the “silly season” (protests by the far right are not the typical definition of silly). Farage has utilised being permitted to spread the myth that migrants are a threat to British women largely unchecked, testing out an ever-more divisive and adversarial racial line (as herecently put itin the Times: “Whose side are you on?”)Few have made it easier for Reform to fill the void than Starmer, who could have hardly done more if he had subletted Downing Street out to Farage and washed the towels. It is not that the prime minister hasn’t been working – last month, he disrupted his family holiday in Scotland tofly to Washington DC– or that he should not have had a break, of course, but that after pushing through thedisastrous welfare bill, the entire government has seemingly disappeared from public view. The most pressing issues – immigration misinformation, far-right mobilisation,starvation in Gaza– have come and stayed in recent weeks with next to no input from our elected leaders.Ministers have been noticeably missing in action from media rounds, with Rachel Reeves – the most recognisable figure on the frontbench after Starmer – out of sight working on the autumn budget. The government in effect put its out-of-office on for August (“Taking time away until September. See you in Liverpool!”) and left the inbox to max out.This has only been compounded by the fact that, on the few occasions Labour has spoken out this summer, it has done so on Reform’s terms. When Farage announced his plan todetain and deportundocumented migrants last week, the Labour party chair, Ellie Reeves,lamented thathe “can’t say where his detention centres will be”, as if the problem with interning human beings en masse is the challenge of finding a big enough car park.The bar has felt so low through the hot restless weeks that you could almost find yourself willing Labour to act, if not as the government, then at least as the opposition. Or to put it another way: it isn’t just that Farage has been allowed to set the agenda for the summer, but that he hasn’t even had to worry about Starmer’s team trying to challenge it. AddKemi Badenoch’s complicity(her critique of Reform’s mass deportation policy was that the party had actually stolen it from the Conservatives), and the result is a political class that has given up its defences to the hard right, or even any pretence of one. We are seeing in real time where this takes a society. On Saturday, a group of masked menattempted to break into a hotelfor asylum seekers in west London.The danger is never simply that the “bad guys” bleed fringe ideas into the mainstream – it is that the “good guys” (whatever that means any more) either do nothing, or worse, embrace them. Capitulation sometimes looks like politiciansadopting ever-more hardlineimmigration policies; sometimes it looks like saying nothing when the other side pitches one. Often, it’s both.A desperate, opportunist press and vicious politicians: no wonder the debate on refugees is so awful | Jane MartinsonRead moreLabour’s summer has been defined by this indifference and inaction, as a government elected on a landslide only a year ago acts as if it were a tired spectator helpless to the political winds (or whichever way Farage and the media choose to blow them). There is a mix of defeatism and despair to it, both about the electorate and the country at large: the notion that Britain – increasingly characterised by the right as lawless, broken and invaded – is already lost.The Labour right has a default get-out clause to this: the only thing that matters is being electable. But that is hardly going well. A YouGovpoll last weekshowed Labour has sunk to its lowest approval rating in six years, with only 20% of the public saying they would vote for the party at the next election. As he returns to work, Starmer isreportedly reshuffling his aidesat No 10 to regain ground. But the real issue is not personnel – it is the project. What is the purpose of a Starmer government? And what courage can he find to deliver it?There is an alternative timeline in which Starmer acted decisively this summer. In this Sliding Doors scenario, the Labour leader stood firm against Israel, pulled the welfare cuts bill and challenged anti-migrant sentiment. It would be easy to be wistful for such an era of humane and fair governance until you remember this is meant to have really happened: the Conservatives were ousted, the “good guys” were elected, the human rights barrister was put in charge. As the weeks pass and the days darken, Starmer will try toregain the spacethat he left wide open. Whether Farage is willing to vacate it is another matter.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But I long for the days when the internet wasn’t just lists of bossy self-optimisation plansMon 1 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 12.43 EDTShareImay have found what will finally wean me off social media. It’s this “things I’ve learned” trend. Take, for example, advice that will supposedly “change your brain chemistry”, courtesy of someone who is definitely not a neuroscientist. Or “my nutrition rules”, from a dewy, gen Alpha sylph who doesn’t realise what they actually have is a teenager’s metabolism. Or “45 things you need to understand” about a place from someone who has spent 45 minutes there. Endless lists of the bleeding obvious: eat intuitively, embrace nature, exercise compassion, remain curious, be childlike, contact friends, put down your phone, put your head in a blender.OK, not that last one, but it’s how this stuff makes me feel. I don’t know what to call it – expertise overload? Advice pollution? A bottomless pit of wisdom brain rot? – but authoritatively delivered life advice dominates what I see online, fromSubstack(the online home of cosy, bookish elders) to TikTok (the opposite). It’s not just my algorithm or demographic: men, young people, pregnant people and new parents all get inundated with advice, albeit with different slants.I sort of admire the confidence it must take to tell people what to do. I can barely muster a tentative suggestion of what to have for dinner (crisps?). But it also makes me pine for the internet before everything was a bossy, bullet-pointed self-optimisation plan; for the gentler days of cat memes and rambling blog posts about strangers’ marital problems.Of course, no one is forcing me to consume this content, to roll my eyes at another earnest reel or wrathfully scroll through 1,000 words telling me to “prioritise rest”. But I’m a sucker for it, which is exactly why it’s everywhere: it gets us “engaging” and consuming. It’s undeniably appealing to be told how to live your life when you’re flailing, failing and bewildered (and aren’t we all?). Unfortunately, the only thing I’ve realised from endlessly clicking is that the cure for my confusion will not come from content creators.

The launch of anew, more generous regimefor funding early years education in England should help. The first of September was keenly awaited by hundreds of thousands of working parents of children aged between nine months and four. As of now, they are entitled to 30 free childcare or nursery hours a week.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is right to stress that this is the biggest-ever expansion of early years provision – described by the Institute for Fiscal Studies as“a new branch of the welfare state”. Equivalent to about £7,500 per year, per child, this is worth more, to most women in full-time work, than abolishing their income tax and national insurance contributions. Working-age parents, particularly those with larger families, have been dealt withless generouslyby the tax and benefits systems in recent years than under the Blair and Brown governments. The UK hashigher childcare coststhan most leading economies. So it is right that parents of the youngest children are targeted with support.Implementation will need to be closely monitored, however. Most of the new funding will flow to private providers. Ms Phillipson is a strong advocate for new nurseries attached to primary schools, but these are small in number. Families are being given additional funding, but not a new public service. The new subsidy willnot cover fees in full. Many nurseries face shortages of trained staff, while thenumber of childminders – usually women working at home – keeps on falling.While there are many good private and non-profit nurseries, as well as public ones overseen by councils, there iscause for concernabout the way that this market has developed. As in children’s social care and special needs education, private-equity owned businesses control a growing number of settings. Last year, academics publishedresearchshowing that privately run care homes were disproportionately likely to be closed by regulators. Inchildren’s social care, the Competition and Markets Authority judged that private owners were making excessive profits and carrying too much debt, leading to unacceptable risks.Ministers must ensure that such shocking failures are not repeated in the nursery sector. As a first step, Ofsted inspections should increase from their current six-yearly cycle to a four-yearly one – the same as schools. The current disparity sends a terrible signal about early years’ lowly status.Another issue is the impact of the changes on poorer children who do not meet the eligibility criteria because their parents do not work or do not meet the £9,518 earnings threshold. While some vulnerable families already qualify for additional childcare, experts are right to worry that the existingattainment gapcould grow as a result of a policy that grants extra funding to under‑fives from wealthier homes.This is the logical but troubling consequence of a policy whose chief aim is to enable parents to work, rather than invest in early years education as an intrinsic good. The hope must be that rules change if these fears are realised, and that “family hubs” – which the Tories brought in after vandalising Sure Start – make a contribution to these families’ welfare in the meanwhile. Ms Phillipson has a lot on her plate. Extra spending on early years is welcome – but it needs proper oversight.Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationOpinionPrimary schoolsSchoolsBridget PhillipsonEnglandCompetition and Markets AuthorityeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Instead, Narendra Modi flew to China, shook Xi Jinping’s hand and left Washington sidelinedMon 1 Sep 2025 13.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 21.49 EDTShareDonald Trump’s imperial tendencies see the US president wield tariffs and sanctions in the expectation that America will receive tributes. Yet his latest move –punishing India with 50% tariffsfor Russian oil purchases onceencouragedby the US – has produced not submission but spectacle. It has sent India’s Narendra Modi to China for thefirst time in seven yearsas Xi Jinping hosted more than 20 leaders for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin. And it is in Tianjin, not Washington, where it looks as if the hinge of history is moving.The SCO is easy to dismiss: the bloc is a bundle of contradictions.India and Pakistanremain adversaries. China and India still stare across a garrisoned Himalayan frontier, though relations have thawed since last October’sborder breakthrough. Russia and China vie for influence in Central Asia. Unlike Nato, the SCO has no binding defence commitments. For much of its life, it has looked like a paper tiger, sending out communiques that were all roar and no bite.But in geopolitics, appearances are important. To seeMr Modi, Mr Xi and Vladimir Putinsmiling and joking is to watch Washington’s influence fade. Mr Trump’s tariff broadside against India makes Tianjin significant. Here was the prime minister of India – supposedly the US’s Asian counterweight to China – affirming that New Delhi and Beijing are “partners, not rivals”.India’s calculation is straightforward. It has red lines:agriculturewill not be opened up to US demands; oil purchases cannot be determined by Washington; theceasefirewith Pakistan was conceded by Islamabad, not brokered by Mr Trump. Backing down would look like weakness. Far better, from Mr Modi’s perspective, to demonstrate that the US cannot take India’s partnership for granted, and to seek friends elsewhere.For China, the rewards are immediate. Mr Trump has given Mr Xi a stage on which to pose as the host of an important multipolar gathering.Cai Qi, Mr Xi’s chief of staff and a member of China’s top ruling body – the first to hold both roles sinceMao’s era– was dispatched to meet Mr Modi, an unmistakable gesture of intimacy from China’s rulers. Beijing sees the SCO as emphasising the US’s absence and letting others seize the stage.The implications stretch well beyond South Asia. For Moscow, every handshake in Tianjin underlines that sanctions have not made it a pariah. ForTurkey, attendance preserves its ambiguity as a Nato member. For Iran, the SCOcondemnedthe US-Israeli attacks it suffered this summer. The more this theatre normalisesChina and Russiaas leaders of a non-western bloc, the harder it becomes for Washington to muster global consensus – notably over Ukraine – in future crises.Nor was Tianjin just about Eurasia. A spat with thePhilippinesover Taiwan on the eve of the summit reminded delegates of China’s reddest lines. The SCO claims it is inclusive. But Beijing runs the show. Mr Trump sought a kowtow from Delhi. Instead, he has handed Beijing the platform for its long game – building asystem beyond the reach of the US. Whether that would allow more room for other states to manoeuvre is moot. The SCO may never fight China’s wars, but it ensures Beijing will never stand alone. That is the high price the west may end up paying for Mr Trump’s narcissistic delusions.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What a load of rubbish. Far better to order a free glass of tap water. At an Open University summer school some years ago, students were invited to take part in a trial. All were given 10 lots of two samples, Nottingham tap water and Highland Spring. There were enough participants over the weeks for a statistical sample. Answer? They could not tell the difference. Incidentally, licensed premises are obliged to provide free tap water on request. Refusing to do would be a breach of their licence condition.Rosalind ClaytonLondonPerhaps Joe Rawlins and Gaëlle Radigon, the owners of La Popote restaurant, could consider putting tap water on the menu as “Corporation Pop”, as we called it when I was a child in Manchester. If you wanted it fizzy, just shake it. The omission of Buxton water from their list is a crime.Chris WaltersBuxton, DerbyshireAs a non-drinker, I can readily tell between my Vichy Catalan (my favourite) and my Badoit green bottle or Badoit red bottle (second favourite), all naturally carbonated. Would I pay £19 for a bottle of water I haven’t yet tried? 100%. What’s the difference between this and a fermented grape or a distilled grain?

I too believe creative imagination is a muscle, which needs its exercise. She is also right that it can revolutionise scientific endeavour. My field of weather forecasting will soon be revolutionised by machine learning – a type of AI – where we recognise enough past weather patterns so that we can predict what weather will be coming. But writing best-man speeches, leaving speeches for work colleagues, letters to a dear friend? Do we really want to dissolve into brain-lazy folk who use AI to be the understudy to our own emotions?If I say “I love you” to someone, would they like to hear it from me or a bot? There is also another concern: AI output has no audit trail, no clues to its source. Its source is the wild west. Anyone – good, bad, indifferent – can feed into it, program it, bias it. If, as you say Imogen, you do end up in the woods in an “analogue manner” with your ability to think intact, I’ll happily join you. Hopefully others will too.Murray DaleHayle, CornwallImogen West-Knights shares her hatred of offloading toChatGPTthe tasks that make us human. And while I share her concerns (I couldn’t have put them better myself), there is an additional one that troubles me: if students go through their entire school lives with this all-knowing and all-solving technology at their fingertips, how will their critical thinking skills develop?Students in literature class are not given books such asThe Great Gatsbyso they can regurgitate the plot 20 years later at a dinner, but rather so that they can understand the interconnection of class disparities, wealth and the social atmosphere after the first world war, and so they can trace parallels with the present day.They learn multivariable calculus not because they will need it to buy groceries but to make their brains strong and malleable, so that grasping and implementing new concepts and ideas will become easier, whatever the subject.And they don’t learn history so they can repeat over and over “Victoria 1837, Edward VII 1901, George V 1910, Edward VIII 1936, George VI 1936, Elizabeth II 1952”, but to understand how sequences of events have led to wars, legislative changes and economic crises, and can do so again.Technologies that make work easier have always been seductive, and always will be. AI usage is already rampant in secondary schools and universities.But as ChatGPT turns three years old in a few months, preschoolers are also starting to go to kindergartens.

It made the wrong one, 28 August). He goes on to place the ball in Netrebko’s court by suggesting she should withdraw from the performances or “say something unambiguous for the British audience in opposition to Putin’s continuing war”. He later acknowledges that Netrebko stated her opposition to the war at its outset and that she was attacked for her stance by the Russian regime.Must this happen again? As Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova pointed out, when speaking in a2022 Guardian interviewof how she was “pretty much ready to die” when she went on hunger strike: “If you fight with a dictator, you have to show them that you are ready to fight to the end.” Members of Pussy Riot were separated from their children and endured appalling conditions in prison.We cannot expect such bravery from every artist – Netrebko should not have to be an activist as well as a world-class singer. It is really up to the Royal Ballet and Opera to decide how far to go with political alignment. They certainly need to address the discrepancy between their obvious support forUkrainein the last three years and the recent suppression of a show of support for Palestine during a performance.Kate LoughSouthsea, HampshireThere is an incredible double standard with regard to the banning of Russian artists and sportspeople. Israel is waging a genocidal war in Gaza (not justified by the horrific atrocity against Israelis that preceded it), and its violent settlers have been systematically driving out the original dwellers of the West Bank for years now. However, not only are Israeli artists not banned, but Israel participates in European events despite not being inEurope, such as European football and the Eurovision song contest.Many other countries have carried out unprovoked attacks on other nations – for example, the US on Iraq in 2003 and Iran this year. Nobody has ever suggested that their artists be banned.Whether or not Anna Netrebko is close toVladimir Putin, I do not see that ostracising her and other Russian artists is justified, unless artists from other countries engaging in wars of aggression are also banned, and unless all commercial contacts with Russia are also forbidden. Let us have the same standard for all.Name and address suppliedI am surprised that Martin Kettle puts the onus completely on the management of theRoyal Opera House. It has to make its way financially. If enough people buy tickets to watch and listen to Anna Netrebko, they will put her on stage. If the public choose not to watch her, her feet will not be seen for dust. The onus is clearly on opera-goers to boycott her performance, but perhaps they have feet of clay.Richard McLachlanIpswich, SuffolkWould your writer like to give his opinion on the wartime National Gallery concerts of Dame Myra Hess and performances by others such as Eileen Joyce where they played music by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and other German composers?

In accusing Newcastle of breaking promises and leaving a relationship severed, it reduced even Liverpool’s Egypt forward to a mere warm-up act before the night’s main event.Isak has always possessed the knack of timing his runs to perfection and now the Sweden striker had picked precisely the right, high-profile moment to pave the final stretch of an albeit still arduous path towards joining Salah at Anfield. His Instagram message certainly blindsided St James’ Park executives while virtually extinguishing increasingly faint hopes that a player then refusing to either train with or play for Newcastle could somehow be “reintegrated” into Eddie Howe’s squad.Rather like a centre-half panicking in the face of one of Isak’s penalty-area advances, Newcastle’s majority owners, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, lunged in with a bullish statement of their own insisting that their £63m signing from Real Sociedad three years ago was going nowhere. There were briefings that Isak’s social media-powered hand grenade had blown up in his face but they would ultimately prove wide of the mark. Behind the public intransigence reflecting their own desperation to save face, Newcastle knew that the endgame of a long-running saga was under way.It all started when, in the spring of 2024, the former minority owner Amanda Staveley informed Isak he would be awarded an enhanced contract that summer. Then in the June, Staveley lost an internal power struggle with Newcastle’s now outgoing chief executive, Darren Eales, and was ousted by the Saudis.The upset extended to Howe and his players. Staveley’s communication skills were so strong and her emotional intelligence so high that friends speak of the financier’s uncanny ability to persuade initially sceptical footballers that Newcastle is England’s finest city.Howe does not dispense trust easily but he knew he could rely on a woman whose in-depth knowledge of the Arab world and its distinctive business culture enabled her to understand PIF’s thinking in a way others could not.Her exit coincided with the arrival of the more abrasive Paul Mitchell as Newcastle’s sporting director. He would stay less than a year but one of his first acts was persuading Yasir al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s Riyadh‑based chair, to revoke the decision to improve Isak’s £140,000 a week contract.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak after scoring against Liverpool in last season’s Carabao Cup final.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersNo matter that he had four years left on his current deal and Newcastle were struggling to avoid breaching Premier League spending rules, the striker was incandescent.Howe would later speak repeatedly of a “very difficult” summer and an “unsettled” dressing room as Newcastle opened last season slowly, with Isak scoring once in the opening seven games. That he ended it having scored 27 times in all competitions asNewcastle won the Carabao Cupand qualified for the Champions League speaks volumes for the manager’s soft leadership skills.It was, however, noticeable that Isak’s form dipped after the cup triumph. Howe has rebutted claims he told him he could leave this summer but it is understood a June training ground meeting involving the striker, his representatives and the manager ended badly.By now the Saudis were happy to improve his contract but the Swede wanted more than the £200,000 weekly wage on offer and his desire to join Liverpool was highlighted during a difficult training camp near Salzburg in early July. Divisions were understood to be drawn between players critical of the 25-year-old and sympathetic friends including Sven Botman and Joe Willock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps coincidentally that was the fortnight Isak spent with Newcastle before dodging Newcastle’s summer tour to Singapore and South Korea and working out alone in Spain for a week without managerial permission.After returning, Isak declined all Howe’s offers of reintegration, was told to stay away from a club bonding barbecue and trained in isolation from his teammates, kicking balls repeatedly into empty goals and against a rebound wall.Privately, Newcastle’s determination to retain Isak was softening. The only problem was that with a series of strikers including Hugo Ekitiké and Benjamin Sesko rejecting moves to St James’ they could not find a suitable replacement, let alone the desired two. Moreover the Saudis regarded Liverpool’s initial £110m offer for Isak as an insult.View image in fullscreenA T-shirt for sale at the It’s In Black & White Shop at St James’ Park.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAFast forward to late last Monday afternoon back in Darras Hall, an affluent Northumberland enclave, eight miles north-west of the city where a Saudi delegation joined Newcastle’s minority owner Jamie Reuben on a visit to a property hidden behind the high hedges and opaque security gates that characterise north-east England’s wealthiest neighbourhood.Inside the house Isak and his representatives, most notably his uncompromising Serbian adviser, Vlado Lemic, informed their guests he had no intention of wearing black and white stripes again. Within 45 minutes Reuben and co were driving back to St James’ Park where Howe’s teamlost 3-2 against Liverpoollater that bank holiday Monday evening.At that point the manager had not spoken to his supposed star striker for almost a fortnight and was reiterating that he “only wanted” players “fully committed to Newcastle”. It finally proved the cue for Rumayyan, making a rare trip to Tyneside, to sanction a successful £70m move forStuttgart’s Germany striker Nick Woltemade.By Saturday evening Howe diplomatically refused to deny reports from Sweden that Isak had already bid his former teammates farewell. The longest, and messiest, of goodbyes was almost over, leaving the Saudis stung by suggestions that even Newcastle’s former and unlamented owner Mike Ashley would have handled things infinitely better.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweLiverpoolTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But despite Palace confirming the signing of the France Under-20 defender Jaydee Canvot from Toulouse for £21m, they decided not to sanction Guéhi’s departure at the last minute because they failed to bring in another more experienced option.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were even fears that the Austrian, who led Palace to their first trophy when they won the FA Cup in May, could step down after making it clear that they must keep hold of Guéhi if they are to have a successful season.That, and their failure to bring in a direct replacement in time, eventually persuaded Parish to inform Liverpool the deal was off despite admitting after their victory over Arne Slot’s side in the Community Shield that he would probably have to be sold this month to avoid losing the 25-year-old for free next summer.Palace announced the signing of 19-year-old Canvot and had also been working on deals to bring in a more experienced replacement for Guéhi, although a move to sign Brighton’s Igor Julio on loan failed to materialise and they could not find other replacements in time to beat the deadline. Palace are also in talks with Tottenham over a loan move for Manor Solomon and are set to sign Nigeria forward Christantus Uche for €20m (£17.3m) from Getafe.Parish said after their victory over Arne Slot’s side in the Community Shield that Guéhi may have to be sold this month to avoid losing the centre-back for free next summerExplore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceLiverpoolTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

This time there were no tears, no consolations, only the sight of a four‑times major champion dictating terms again on the sport’s biggest stage.Is record-breaking Djokovic robust enough to keep rolling back years?Read moreGauff, 21 and seeded third, is the same age Osaka was when she broke the teenager’s heart six years ago on the same court. Then, Osaka had comforted the 15-year-old wildcard in a moment that went viral. On Monday the generosity stopped at the baseline. Osaka dominated from the first ball, ripping returns and taking control of rallies before the crowd could rouse their favourite. She breezed through her opening service games with the authority that once lifted her to the summit of the sport, winning 16 of her first 18 service points, and her confident body language stood in stark contrast to the brooding, stressed figure she has sometimes appeared since her return.Gauff’s serving woes, the recurring theme of her summer, surfaced immediately. In her opening service game she fell behind 15-40, hitting a routine forehand into the net to concede the break, and never quite recovered. She served a double fault three times in the opening set, the last on set point to hand it away after only 31 minutes.By then she had sprayed 16 unforced errors, 11 of them off a forehand that was in open revolt. The Labor Day crowd, eager to lift her, swelled behind her at every pressure point, but their encouragement could not dispel the nervous energy. Osaka looked liberated, striding confidently to her chair with a one-set lead, while Gauff disappeared into the tunnel for a bathroom break.“I felt it was the best I served all tournament,” Gauff said. “A lot of aces. Yeah, there were some doubles, but I thought that was a good performance from me serving. Off the ground I just made way too many mistakes.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s disappointing for sure, but it is a step in the right direction,’ said Coco Gauff after defeat by Naomi Osaka.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThe troubles on serve have been simmering for months. After winninga second grand slam at Roland Garrosin June, Gauff endured a turbulent summer of double faults and early exits, including a first-round defeat at Wimbledon that underscored the fragility of her delivery. She arrived in New York with a reshuffled team and a newly hired biomechanics specialist, Gavin MacMillan, who helped Aryna Sabalenka to turn her own serve from liability into a potent weapon en route to three grand slam titles and the world No 1 ranking.Early rounds suggested the transition was uneven – a grinding three-setter against Ajla Tomljanovic, then tears in her second-round escape against Donna Vekic – before she steadied with a better display on Saturday in a straight-sets win against Magdalena Frech. She had spoken of embracing a long-term process rather than chasing a quick fix, but under the Ashe sun there was little sign of the assured server who had appeared only in flashes.The second set followed a similar pattern. Osaka, serving at 2-2, fell behind on serve for the first time all afternoon but rattled off four straight points to hold. In the next game Gauff opened with a fifth double fault, then unravelled in a flurry of errors off both wings to gift Osaka another break. From there the match was all but a handshake away. Osaka pounded through the closing games without fuss, sealing her progress after just 64 minutes when Gauff dumped a forehand into the net for her 33rd unforced error.The statistics reflected Osaka’s clarity of purpose. She landed only 42% of first serves but won 32 of 38 points on her racket, including 94% of first-serve points. She finished with 10 winners to 12 unforced errors, content to sit back as Gauff’s erratic play kept rallies short and prevented her famed speed from becoming a factor.For Gauff, the defeat was a sobering comedown after an uneven but promising opening week. She had hoped a remodelled service motion would hold under pressure, but five double faults and more than four times as many unforced errors (33) as winners (eight) told the story.“It’s disappointing for sure, but it is a step in the right direction,” she said. “If I kept the way I was going in Cincinnati to here, I would have been out the first round.” She admitted the past three months had taken a toll. “It’s been a tough post-French Open for me. I don’t know, I feel like I put so much pressure on myself at 21.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seeded 23rd after reaching the Montreal final last month, she has now won 10 of her past 11 matches and appears to be gathering momentum with each week. This was her 14th career win against a top-10 opponent and the third since launching her comeback last year in Brisbane.View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka (left) and Coco Gauff embrace after their fourth-round match.Photograph: Brian Hirschfeld/EPAEvery time she has reached a grand slam quarter-final she has gone on to lift the trophy – 12 wins from 12 matches at majors in the last eight or beyond – a curious statistic that now hovers over the draw. She will face Karolina Muchova in the last eight, and on this evidence she will be no one’s idea of an underdog.Her elation was evident in the on‑court interview. “I honestly just had so much fun out here,” she said. “I was in the stands two months after I gave birth to my daughter watching Coco, and I just really wanted the opportunity to come out here and play again. This is my favourite court in the world and it means so much for me to be back here.”Asked when she started believing again, she pointed to Montreal. “I had played a match there where I had to save two match points. Ever since then I thought to myself anything’s possible. You just have to keep trying and keep a smile on your face.” She added: “I’m a little sensitive and I don’t want to cry, but I want to say thank you to my team. I looked up to Coco a lot – the way she carries herself is really special – and it means a lot to share the court with her again.”Whatever comes next, Monday felt like a landmark. One of only two mothers in the last 16 alongside Taylor Townsend, Osaka has spoken about rediscovering joy in her tennis. Here she found it in real time, grinning after big points and basking in the Ashe ovation.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisNaomi OsakaCoco GauffTennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg, Matt Fitzpatrick, Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka received the captain’s call. Rory McIlroy, Robert ­MacIntyre, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood, ­Rasmus Højgaard and Tyrrell Hatton qualified automatically.Charlie Woods, son of Tiger, hits second hole-in-one in 12 months at Junior PlayersRead moreThe only change in the Europe team is Højgaard replacing his twin brother, Nicolai, representing the ­biggest carryover of players in Ryder Cup history.Donald is keen to emphasise the “different challenge” requiring “different strategy” when playing away. Europe has not won onAmerican soil since 2012and endured a10-point defeatthere in 2021.“Just because we have a very similar team it doesn’t mean we are going to roll out the same pairings or the same lineup in foursomes and ­fourballs,” Donald said. “I think over a two-year period, these players do change. Their profiles change and we’ll adapt to that.“This isn’t certainly a question of rinse and repeat from Rome. I’m ­trying to come at this one quite ­dif­ferently to what we did in Rome. It’s nice to have a continuity within the team, the memories, the experiences that we got to celebrate together. When it comes to thisRyder Cup, it doesn’t necessarily mean we are going to have the same partnerships.”Donald shrugged off the widespread sense the US team gained an early advantage when their ­captain, Keegan Bradley, opted not to play. Last week,Bradley chose not to pick himselfas a wildcard,­prompting comment that the 39-year-old’s selflessness will galvanise the hosts.“There’s been a lot of intrigue about whether Keegan would play or not,” Donald said. “That was ­obviously a big storyline at his press conference on Wednesday with his picks. We understand Keegan in whatever role as a playing captain or captain, is going to bring a lot of energy and spirit to the Ryder Cup. He loves it and is very passionate about it, and whatever role he plays he’ll be very good at it.”View image in fullscreenKeegan Bradley’s decision not to play as captain of the USA team has been well received.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APAnother theme has been the likely influence of an inevitably raucous New York crowd. There have been fears voiced that Europe’s ­players may be subjected to treatment that crosses the line. “We all live in ­America, or most of us do,” Lowry said. “We have all got a lot of fans in America. I don’t think they can turn on you that badly for one week but that remains to be seen.”Donald will urge his players to enjoy the backdrop rather than wilt. “We understand what’s going to happen to us,” the captain said. “It’s our reaction to that that’s really important.“So we all have fears. We all have anxieties and we all find Ryder Cups pressurised. But these are top ­athletes that understand how to walk towards that fear. You want to embrace what a Ryder Cup represents and then part of that is embracing the crowd and embracing that atmosphere. I think certainly these guys will be ready for that.”Donald told Matt Wallace that he would not make the European team moments after the ­Englishman broke down in tears during a TV interview after the Omega ­Masters. ­Wallace knew he had fallen short of a Ryder Cup debut.“I felt very emotional for him,” Donald said. “It just shows to me what the Ryder Cup means to these guys and how they are trying to ­desperately make the team and be a part of it.”Donald will take his team to ­Bethpage for a scouting mission after the PGA Championship at Wentworth.Explore more on these topicsRyder CupGolfUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Andrée Jeglertz, the former Denmark coach, has made the move to England to become Manchester City’s head coach and is tasked with changing their fortunes of a team that has, by their high standards, underdelivered in recent years.They have said goodbye to three senior players in Chloe Kelly, Laia Aleixandri and Jill Roord, while welcoming in five new signings so far, including reinforcing their defensive depth with the additions of the Austria full-back Laura Wienroither and the Canada defender Jade Rose, while the arrivals of Sydney Lohmann and Iman Beney higher up the pitch will give fans cause for excitement.Yet, despite last year’s frustrating fourth-placed finish, they already had a squad with fearsome qualities, whether you are focusing on the stars in their forward line such as Khadija Shaw, Vivianne Miedema and Lauren Hemp, to name but a few, or the technical ability on the ball of the midfielder Yui Hasegawa and the centre-half Alex Greenwood. Their rivals will be wary of the fact that the last time Manchester City were not juggling their domestic matches with the rigours of European football – in 2023-24 – they missed out on the titleonly on goal difference. With that in mind, they should be expected to challenge.When they have their strongest starting side fit, they have shown they are capable of beating anyone, as was demonstrated whenthey deservedly defeated Barcelonalast autumn. The task ahead of them is toperform consistently for a full 22-game league season. Returning to the European places, as a minimum, will be expected.CityThe managerJeglertz became a European title-winning coach with the Swedish club Umeå in 2004 and has built a strong reputation for coaching in the women’s game for more than 20 years, including being in charge of Finland for six years. However, trying to deliver a first league since 2016 for Manchester City will not be easy. The club searched far and wide for the new head coach and admired Jeglertz’s style of play. He was most recentlyin charge of Denmark, exiting Euro 2025 at the group stage. It had already been agreed prior to the tournament that he would remain in charge of Denmark until after the Euros and then join City.View image in fullscreenAndrée Jeglertz, manager of Manchester City, speaks with his coaching staff during a training session.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesOff-field pictureThe biggest ongoing change to the club’s infrastructure is the building of their women’s training centre, on the site of the club’s City Football Academy. Work began on the £10m project in March, with a 17,000-square-foot building set to include facilities tailored specifically towards female performance and to have world-class features including a hydrotherapy pool. Observant passers-by will have noticed the structure rising behind the north car park adjacent to the women’s team’s 7,000-seater Joie Stadium. It is set to open during the season, according to the club’s original announcement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 25-year-old had been with Bayern since joining their under-17 team and helped them win four Bundesliga titles. England fans may recall Lohmann was on the receiving end of an expletive-filled remark from Jill Scott during the Euro 2022 final, which went viral, but more importantly she will bring a physical presence to Manchester City’s midfield as well as her quick feet, good passing range and heaps of top-tier experience.Stepping upThe highly rated winger Lily Murphy made her senior debut for City at the start of last season and went on to have an encouraging first campaign in the first-team squad, scoring twice, gaining experience in the Champions League and starring in a League Cup victory over Manchester United. She has signed a new contract until 2027, looking set for more match minutes this term, and as if to illustrate that likelihood, Murphy started their pre-season victory over Durham, scoring City’s second goal in a 4-0 win.It was a good summer for …Greenwood and Hemp – both of whom started every game – plus Jess Park and Khiara Keating were all part of England’s victorious Euro 2025 squad, while the Brazilian forward Kerolin also won silverware at the Copa América, scoring three goals. It was also something of a breakthrough summer for one of Manchester City’s new young signings, Beney, as she impressed for Switzerland as one of their stronger performers at their home Euros, helping them reach the quarter-finals and giving Manchester City fans plenty of reasons to be excited.Main initiative to attract more fansAt each game at the Joie Stadium, the club randomly select a group of fans to have the chance to spend time in “autograph alley”, a post-match zone they have designated to enable players to meet supporters in a safe environment, and they hope it will serve as an extra incentive to buy match tickets. The club froze season-ticket prices and they also announced they will play two matches at their men’s team’s neighbouring home, the Etihad Stadium; against Manchester United in November and Chelsea in February.Explore more on these topicsWSL season previews 2025-26Manchester City WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You remember the good times’Read moreFor Thomas, the wheel will have turned full circle, as his final professional race takes him back to south Wales where his path to Olympic and Tour de France success began, at the Maindy velodrome.“If I didn’t live so close to Maindy or if I didn’t live in Cardiff, I may never have ridden a bike, never have had the career I had, the life I’ve had,” Thomas told the BBC.It may have helped that his former coach Rod Ellingworth, one of his past mentors at BritishCyclingand Team Sky, is now race director of the British Cycling-run Tour of ­Britain.Of the Welsh climax to the race, Thomas said: “I just feel so lucky to be able to call time on my career on my own terms, when I’m finishing and even more lucky to decide where, as well.”Thomas expects there to be tears when he bows out in Cardiff after a 19‑season racing career. Among the highs are his2018 Tour de France victoryincluding a memorable stage win on Alpe d’Huez, his gold medals in the ­Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and ­multiple successes in other stage races such as the ­Crite­rium du ­Dauphine and Paris-Nice.To mark the occasion, he will be wearing a fiery red jersey that cele­brates his achievements and his Welshness, and that incorporates a Welsh dragon, the hairpins to the and a sketch of Thomas on a podium, by his young son, Macs.“Certainly the most meaningful ­jersey, that’s for sure,” Thomas said on social media. “I think it definitely will be emotional come the final stage, finishing in Cardiff, wearing this.”First, though, he has to navigate a punchy race route, that gets more challenging as it nears the Welsh border. The rolling roads of the opening few stages, with finishes in ­Southwold, Stowmarket, Ampthill and Burton Dassett, are succeeded by two days of racing in the climbs of south Wales. The penultimate stage takes in two ascents of the short but steep climb of the Tumble, over­looking Abergavenny, while the final day’s racing tackles the first category climb of Caerphilly Mountain, just 10 ­kilometres from the finish.Headlining alongside Thomas are Remco Evenepoel, winner of the road race and time trial in the Paris Olympics, Kelso’s Oscar Onley, the breakthrough star of July’s Tour de France, the former world champion Julian Alaphilippe, and the fast-rising British sprinter Matthew Brennan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They had said they wouldn’t sing, but the best nights aren’t planned they just happen, and in the end it was their kind of night. Chaotic, wild, a lot wrong but alright, like a picture of who they are, sticking it to the man up here and down there. Packed into crumbling, filthy stands, Rayo Vallecano’s fans didn’t see their team get a deserved victory against Barcelona on Sunday but on a torn-up, dried-out pitchwith not much grass, in a ground where VAR became the latest thing to fail, they did watch them fight and do it their way too, flying into the team with a budget 18 times bigger as if they weren’t big at all. “Fantastic,” Hansi Flick called them.It started as a protest and never stopped being one but it became something else too, something fun; they had been infuriated, worn down over years, and then they had been insulted but they couldn’t help but enjoy themselves, protest and party in one. Three days after Rayo had definitively qualified forthe Conference Leaguethe team that is not justinthe neighbourhood butofthe neighbourhood almost comically incongruous in Europe, Rayo’s supporters announced they were going on strike. Rayo’s players meanwhile laid into the treble winners, worthy of more than the 1-1 draw it finished. But for a Lamine Yamal penalty which the broken video assistant system couldn’t correct, they might have got it. But for goalkeeper Joan García they definitely might.European football: Keinan Davis on target as Udinese shock InterRead moreBecause if Rayo’s team are good that line needs asomehowin there somewhere; the club could hardly be worse. As winger Álvaro García has put it: “Sometimes you think: ‘How are we where we are with what we have?’”What they have is a mess, mostly. An institution falling apart, a club where the captain hands over the armbandin protest over the treatment of staff; where they can’t use the training ground; where the stadium fails building inspections, where plug sockets sit open, wires exposed; there is bird shit everywhere; seats are broken, toilets overflow; taps don’t work. And if there is something almost gloriously bad about it, enjoyably unique, it is also just bad. There is a risk of glorifying poverty and grime, and indulging failings as authenticity. As the statement from supporters this week put it: yes, they’re humble; yes, they celebrate theirbarriowith its consciously working class, left-wing identity and luxury isn’t their thing. Yes, they love this place, but that doesn’t mean they have to live like this.Worst of all is the feeling that it is not by accident but design, the way the owner and president Raúl Martín Presa wants it. He certainly wants to go to a new ground, paid for by the local government, a decision the coach Iñigo Pérez, speaking for everyone else, says would be “devastating”. The suspicion lingers this is a classic case of running the place down as a prelude, a justification to a move to somewhere he can make his own in a way the current ground never will be. The idea of Vallecas being inadequate for Europe is one he has embraced and echoed, opportunity presented as obligation. The pitch is so bad as to be suspicious. It is municipal, but the tenant has done nothing to care for it.View image in fullscreenRobert Smith lookalike Raúl Martín Presa (left) is the unpopular president of Rayo Vallecano, and the feeling is mutual.Photograph: Ruben De La Rosa/NurPhoto/ShutterstockPresa, at the other end of the political spectrum to supporters proud of their working class, left-wing identity, has always seemed to despise the fans and the feeling is mutual. Communication is almost entirely reduced to abuse. At every game, the entire ground sings for him to leave. That he hangs on can feeling genuinely baffling at times. Graffiti round the ground demands he go. Former coach Míchel Sanchez, thebarrio’s most beloved son, has publicly called him out, saying he has never belonged.This weekend that divide could not have been laid more bare. When supporters’ groups came together to announce “enough is enough”, complaining about the way the club had fallen into abandonment, Presa responded by claiming this was just theBukaneros, Rayo’s ultras behind the goal; they had forced other fans into backing them, acting like mafiosos. He called them –his club’s own fans– idle, brainless and drunkards, saying they didn’t respect their partners. They are, he claimed, the opposite of the values of the neighbourhood. His “evidence”? Their song, A Pirate’s Life, all yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum, a woman in every port, but should I ever marry it will be the girl who’s Rayo. No work, no study, every day instead spent aboard the Santa Ines. “They talk about working class but working class is breaking your back every day,” Presa said.In the middle, the team and its manager,” Pérez, says. And while careful about how he expressed it on Sunday night he said: “The fans have their reasons. My family are in the stands and they see the deterioration, that things could be better.” So on Sunday the first protest began, quietly broken by chants for Presa to go, which grew in intensity. As the first half went on, the banners came out one by one, each with a reason to oppose him, a megaphone explaining them: “for abandoning our stadium”; “for never listening to the fans”; “for mistreating the women’s team”: “for abandoning the youth academy”; “for refusing to sign the [reciprocal] ticket agreement”; “for dressing the stadium in mourning”. The 10th of them had just gone up whenBarcelonawere given the penalty with which they took the lead, Lamine Yamal falling in the area before then taking the kick himself.View image in fullscreenFran Pérez, Rayo’s summer signing, enjoys the moment of scoring against the champions.Photograph: Fernando Villar/EPA“I think the ref will have a look, nothing will happen … and that’s when we found out there was no VAR,” full-back Pep Chavarría said. Before the game, referee Mateo Busquets Ferrer had taken Flick and Pérez to one side and told them that the VAR technology wasn’t working, but they were trying to fix it. Over on the touchline, Pérez the coach was going crazy, kicking the iPad by the bench. “I’m ashamed,” he said, although perhaps the league should be more ashamed. “I lost the plot; I broke a screen, I spoke badly to the fourth official and I should have been sent off.” The issue, he said, was not so much that VAR didn’t work but that “it didn’t, then it did, then it didn’t again, then it did: yes, no, yes, no” – players not knowing how to respond. “That influences the game,” he said. “And, hey, look, the [technical] error might well be Rayo’s; it wouldn’t surprise me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s a person.” Rayo weren’t, though, going to let this go, Vallecas alive, volume rising, supporters driven by another injustice, protests coming together as one. Driven above all by their team. Rayo had played well in the first half, García making the first superb save. Now they were on fast forward, every challenge an appeal, every attack a threat, everything frantic. And, above all, great fun. “It was chaotic,” Frenkie de Jong said, and that is the way they like it.Organised chaos,Andoni Iraola likened it to, and he preferred more chaos to more control. Pérez, his assistant,denied a work permitby the UK home office, has taken that on, volume over precision, no bus parking. He had also, Isi said, seen what he called the “Flick Line”, Rayo’s players pouring into the space behind the Barcelona back line. The team that beat Xavi Hernández twice, that got Ronald Koeman the sack, now took Flick to the edge. And when Fran Pérez, the only new player to cost anything this summer at €1m, slipped into what he called “the binman’s zone” at the back post and smashed a side-footed volley in off the bar, they had deserved it. They had deserved more, Joan García making a couple of sensational saves, Isi delivering an outrageous assist for Jorge de Frutos for one of them.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowElche 2-0 Levante, Valencia 3-0 Getafe, Alavés 1-1 Atlético Madrid, Oviedo 1-0 Real Sociedad, Girona 0-2 Sevilla, Real Madrid 2-1 Mallorca, Celta Vigo 1-0 Villarreal, Real Betis 1-2 Athletic Club, Espanyol 1-0 Osasuna, Rayo Vallecano 1-1 BarcelonaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We played aggressive football, we didn’t stop, we kept going forward,” Chavarría said. “The manager was very clear about how we could hurt them and we carried that out to perfection; we made loads of chances and deserved all three points.”Flick said: “It’s amazing the work Peréz has done with them; they’re very intense.”At the end, they stood before the fans in the end, communion complete. They had come to have their say; the president had called them idle, drunkards and brainless but players and fans had a ball. “At the moment, I’ve got a slightly bitter taste. I think we deserved to win but in in a few hours’ time we’ll be pleased with what we have done,” Pérez said.

It’s been really good to see. He bowls at high pace and he can swing it both ways with exceptional death skills as well so to have him in the team and for him to be opening up tomorrow is awesome. I think there’s quite a lot of people excited to see where he goes.”Baker made his County Championship debut in April after joining Hampshire from Somerset at the end of last season. He took nine wickets at 16.22 for the Originals in the Hundred this year, including a hat-trick against Brook’s Northern Superchargers, having dismissed Brook during a three-game stint for Southern Brave in 2022.“The spells he bowled to Kane Williamson and David Warner [of London Spirit] and then Steve Smith and Jonny Bairstow [of Welsh Fire], all four are world-class batters in the shorter format and he was all over them,” Brook said. “He bowled with high pace and high skill. He was awesome to watch this year and everyone was talking about him.”View image in fullscreenJamie Overton successfully appeals for the wicket of Dhruv Jurel during day three of the fifth Test between England and India.Photograph: Gareth Copley/ECB/Getty ImagesAn understrength England squad trained at Headingley on Monday, with the five players who were involved inthe Hundred final at Lord’son Sunday still making their way north. “In an ideal world we’d have liked to meet up yesterday and train yesterday, train today and go into the game as a group,” Brook said. “But nobody’s short of cricket, that’s for sure.”The squad was joined by Mark Wood, who continued his recovery from knee ligament injury by bowling in the nets. The sight of the fast bowler in apparently full flow may buoy England more than reports from Australia that scans have identified a back problem for Pat Cummins that could affect their captain’s ability to play all five Ashes Tests.Brook said he had been “a little bit shocked” by Overton’s decision to step away from red-ball cricket after 99 first-class games, including two Tests. Overton was in England’s squad throughout the five-match series against India this summer and played in the last game, but has concluded that it is “no longer possible to commit fully to all formats at every level, both physically and mentally”.The 31-year-old will still spend part of his winter in Australia, though he will be there for a third season with Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League rather than to represent England in the Ashes.“Red-ball, first‑class cricket has provided the foundation for my professional career and has been the gateway to every opportunity I’ve had in the game so far,” Overton said in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said Badenoch risked undermining trust.Badenoch has defended her claim to have received an offer as a teenager in Nigeria from the elite university to study medicine, sometimes described by her as pre-med, even though the university does not offer that course for undergraduates.Admissions staff have also said the Conservative leader’s assertion she was offered a place on exam results alone, and was offered a partial scholarship, would not have been possible, with no offers made on that basis.Jon Reider, the admissions officer during the period Badenoch applied, told the Guardian he had been responsible for international admissions and scholarships andhad not offered one to Badenoch.Badenoch doubled down on Monday, telling reporters she had indeed received offers based on her exam results. “All I will say is that I remember the very day those letters came to me. It was not just from Stanford. I was 16, I had done very well in my SATs,” she said. “But this is 30 years ago, I don’t have the papers, and what the Guardian is doing is reporting on hearsay rather than talking about what the government is doing.”Multiple former admissions staff and US academics have told the Guardian that Stanford has never made offers based only on SATs – US standardised tests – with no exceptions even for royalty or child prodigies.Prinsley, a former hospital consultant, wrote to Badenoch to say her claims have been “called into serious question by people in a position to understand the situation, and I would be grateful if you could demonstrate that you have been telling the truth”.He said the Tory leader should clear up whether she had applied to Stanford and whether a place and financial aid had been offered.ALaboursource said: “Honesty and integrity aren’t optional qualities for those who serve as the leader of His Majesty’s official opposition.

I thank Laurent for his years of service.”Freixe took over the chief executive role in September last year after Nestlé, which owns consumer goods brands including KitKat chocolate, Häagen-Dazs ice-cream and Nespresso coffee capsules, ousted his predecessor, Mark Schneider.Bulcke, who Nestlé announced in June is set to step down as chair next year, said Navratil was “recognised for his impressive track record of achieving results in challenging environments”.He said Freixe’s successor was “renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style. The board is confident that he will drive our growth plans forward and accelerate efficiency efforts. We are not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance.”Navratil began his career with Nestlé in 2001 as an internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America, he was appointed country manager for Nestlé Honduras in 2009.He assumed leadership of the coffee and beverage business in Mexico in 2013, and transitioned to Nestlé’s coffee strategic business division in 2020. He moved to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined Nestlé’s executive board on 1 January this year.In September 2023, the chief executive of the oil multinational BP resigned afterfailing to reveal relationships with colleagues.Bernard Looney was subsequently formally dismissed from his one-year notice period for serious misconduct after an investigation by the BP board and its advisers found he had knowingly misled his fellow directors when they sought assurances regarding his disclosure of past relationships and his future behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His next of kin have been informed. His death is being treated as unexpected but not suspicious.”Warburton announced that he was resigning his safe seat two years ago,having been suspended by his party in April 2022 pending the outcome of anindependent complaints and grievance scheme investigation into allegations of harassment and drug use. His resignationled to a byelection, which the Lib Dems won.Warburton admitted taking cocaine after drinking “incredibly potent” Japanese whisky, but denied harassment and claimed he was denied a fair hearing over claims that he made unwanted advances to two women.In July 2023, the House of Commons said the investigation against him “will no longer be proceeding”.Warburton said he was overjoyed but that it had been “extraordinarily difficult for my family and myself, with the personal toll being incalculable”.Warburton became MP for the Somerset constituency in 2015, securing the country’s biggest swing to the Tories. He won again in 2019 with a majority of more than 19,000.Warburtonturned heads in Westminster when he lost six stone in less than a year, having previously been classed as obese.He said he had “got a bit obsessed” with using a home gym during the first Covid lockdown, and won plaudits from then health secretary, Matt Hancock, for his newfound fitness fanaticism.Multiple Tory MPs told the Guardian in 2022 that upon his return to Westminster, his reinvention seemed like a “mid-life crisis”, though when the allegations about his behaviour emerged, colleagues said they were shocked.The former Labour MP Simon Danczuk,who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a 17-year-old girl,said on X: “Sad to see that David Warburton, former Conservative MP, has died. Cleared by parliament of any wrongdoing, but like most of us wasn’t flawless, he’d just had enough and resigned. With him a few times recently, he was doing really well.

Until the new framework is introduced, refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else.”Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Until now, family reunion has been one of the only safe and legal routes available that allows refugees fleeing war and persecution to be reunited with their partner and children.“Far from stopping people taking dangerous journeys to cross the Channel, these changes will only push more desperate people into the arms of smugglers.”Critics have accused Cooper of hypocrisy, pointing out that in 2021 shetold the Commons: “If there are not safe legal routes for family reunion, we end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous criminal gangs.”Gunes Kalkan, the head of campaigns at the children’s charity Safe Passage, said the change would have “disastrous consequences” for unaccompanied children trying to join their families in the UK. He added: “We’re talking about children from conflict and high human rights abuse areas, such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran, who have been torn apart from family in the chaos.”Mubeen Bhutta, the director of policy at British Red Cross, said: “Today’s announcement will separate families and cut off one of the only safe and managed routes for children to seek protection. The vast majority of people who use family reunion visas are children and women, often trapped in very dangerous situations.”Cooper told MPs that six years ago refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average close to 18 months after they were granted protection, allowing applicants to find work. Applications now came in on average within a month, with some councils finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications were linked to refugee family reunion, she said.Home Office figures show there were 20,817 refugee family reunion visas issued in the year to June 2025, 93% of which were granted to children or women. More than half of the visas, 11,641, were issued to children. Two-thirds of visas were issued to nationals of five countries – Syria with 3,808, Iran 3,619, Afghanistan 2,569, Eritrea 1,963 and Sudan 1,804.Cooper suggested the new scheme could be modelled on those in Europe such as Denmark and Switzerland, where migrants have to wait two years before being allowed to reunite their families after being granted refugee status.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Flora Alexander, the IRC’s UK executive director, said: “Narrowing access for people seeking to reunite with loved ones is not a solution to system pressures; it risks pushing more people toward dangerous journeys and represents a step away from compassion and common sense.”Cooper also told MPs:Reforms to family reunion routes would be introduced to the Commons next month and become law in the spring.The first returns of rejected asylum seekers to France under a “one in, one out” deal would take place this month.She would set up a new independent body to process a backlog of immigration and asylum appeals.Earlier on Monday, Starmer said he wanted to speed up efforts to empty hotels housing people awaiting asylum decisions before the next election. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “We’ve said we’ll get rid of them [asylum hotels] by the end of the parliament. I would like to bring that forward, I think it is a good challenge. I want to bring that forward.”The SNP MP Pete Wishart told MPs he thought the government was encouragingReform UKby refusing to speak up for asylum seekers. “Doesn’t [Yvette Cooper] realise that every time she moves on to the ground of Reform, all she is doing is further encouraging and emboldening them?” he said.Cooper said she had spoken positively about asylum seekers. But she said the public wanted the asylum system to be “properly controlled and managed”.The government has committed to stop using hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of the parliament, which could be as late as 2029, but the prime minister suggested on Monday he wanted to “bring that forward”.Speaking to 5 Live, Starmer said he understood concerns about migration, describing it as a “really serious issue”. Asked to commit to a date to empty asylum hotels, he said: “Well, we’ve said we’ll get rid of them by the end of the parliament. I would like to bring that forward, I think it is a good challenge.

Smaller cities such as Cleveland, Ohio and Greensboro, North Carolina, held rallies of their own as a part of the nationwide action.The May Day Strong group, a coalition to labor unions, organized Monday’s efforts, along with AFL-CIO, the US’s largest federation of unions; the One Fair Wage, a non-profit advocating for fair wages for restaurant workers; and other labor groups.“This is about organic, grassroots organizing, and we intentionally wanted it to be outside ofWashington DC, because that’s where the impacts are being felt,” said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, about Monday’s efforts.In New York, hundreds gathered across the street from Trump Tower in the city’s Midtown district, USA Todayreported. Separate protests were held throughout New York state,including inAlbany, the state’s capital.US senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who represents New York, made an appearance at an Albany demonstration. “It’s Labor Day [and] we want to celebrate working men and people in this community,” said Gilibrand. New York state, the middle class was built on the labor movement and it’s time to recognize how important working people are to this community, to our country, to our great state,” she added.Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 residents in DC joined a protest against Trump’s federal takeover of the city,reported WUSA9. Participants of the event, dubbed the “Freedom Run”, ran and walked through DC while chanting.Christie Harlan, who took part in Monday’s run, shared her motivations for joining with WUSA9. “I feel bad for the families of the national guard members who’ve been deployed here to essentially be window dressing for this administration,” said Harlan.The Trump administration’s termination of federal employees, many who worked out of the DC area, also prompted others to take part in the run. “Firing folks left and right, some of the damage that’s being done is going to be irreparable whenever things come back,” said participant Janice Ferebee to WUSA9.Thousands also marched in the Los Angeles area early Monday, local affiliate KTLAreported. The rally was followed by a free picnic for community members, along with live entertainment.Several protests were organized in California’s Bay Area. Residents in Redwood City, about an hour from San Francisco, even formed a 17-mile human chain to Santa Clara as apart of the day’s protest, NBC Bay Areareported.Alongside the coordinated protests, workers at the Hilton Americas-Houston, one of Houston’s largest hotels, walked off the job as apart of a nine-day strike, the Houston Chroniclereported.The walkout came as Hilton failed to reach a deal with members of the Unite Here Local 23 Texas chapter, which includes the more than 400 workers at the hotel.Among several demands, workers are campaigning for a higher minimum wage of $23-per-hour, up from the current rate of $16.50. The strike, which is set to end 10 September, is the first in the union’s 25-year history, chapter president Franchesca Caraballo told the Chronicle.As thousands took part in the rallies, Trumppostedhis own Labor Day message to the Truth Social platform: a photo of himself shaking hands with workers.The image featured the caption: “Celebrating 250 years of THE AMERICAN WORKER.

This year’s average temperature was just over a third of a degree hotter than 2018’s previous record, while temperatures for the other four of the five hottest summers on record differed by just hundredths of a degree. Overall the mean temperature was 1.51C above the long-term meteorological average.June and July had hot weather, with four heatwaves including days above 30C. There has been very little rain across much of the country, with England experiencing what the government has called “nationally significant” water shortfalls. Much of England is under a hosepipe ban as reservoirs,rivers and groundwater run dry.Although the summer has been consistently warm, there has not been extreme heat. The highest temperature recorded to date for 2025 was 35.8C in Faversham, Kent, on 1 July, well short of the UK’s all-time high of 40.3C, set in July 2022.But in June alone there were two heatwaves, making it the hottest June on record for England and the second hottest for the UK overall. A third heatwave in July and a fourth in August pushed the overall average temperature for the summer into record-breaking territory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They knew there weren’t many. Hunting, loss of habitat, conflict with cattle ranchers and other issues had pushed the population to the brink of extinction.Ceballos and his team from the National Alliance for JaguarConservation(ANCJ) thought there were maybe 1,000 jaguars across the country. They decided to carry out the country’s first census of the animal to find out exactly how many there were. They found 4,100.“It was a great surprise, terrific news,” Ceballos said. “Obviously 4,000 means the species is still in danger of extinction, but 4,000 is a lot better than 1,000.”Fast-forward 15 years and the news has got even better. The group’s latest census found that in 2024 there were 5,326 jaguars in Mexico, a 30% increase compared with 2010.“The fact that the country has managed to maintain and increase its population over the last 14 years is extraordinary,” Ceballos said. “For me it’s great news for the country. Mexico and the world need good news.”The census took place over 90 days across 15 states, using 920 motion-capture cameras and involving nearly 50 researchers as well as local community leaders. Researchers looked at an area of 414,000 hectares, making it the largest census for any mammal in Mexico.Jaguars were found across the country, with the largest number in the Yucatán peninsula region (1,699), followed by the south Pacific area (1,541), north-east and central Mexico (813), the north Pacific (733) and the central Pacific coast (540).View image in fullscreenA jaguar in the jungle of southern Mexico.Photograph: Mardoz/AlamyCeballos credits three main factors for the population increase: maintaining natural protected areas where jaguars can roam freely, reducing the conflict between cattle ranchers and jaguars, and a publicity campaign that has put the jaguar on the map.“Before when we started, the jaguar was virtually unknown,” Ceballos said. “Right now it’s one of the most well-known species” in Mexico.Still, at the current rate of population increase it would take 25 to 30 years for the jaguar to no longer be considered at risk of extinction in Mexico. Ceballos and his team aim to reduce that time to just 15 years.There are many challenges in their way. Deforestation and loss of habitat continue to be a major issue: Mexico has lost 600,000 hectares of forest and jungle in the last six years. In the Yucatán peninsula alone, the country loses 60,000 hectares of forest and jungle each year, vastly reducing the areas in which the jaguar can live and hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He hopes to work with social media companies to have pages marketing such products taken down.The construction of new highways is a continuing challenge. Not only do they fragment a jaguar’s territory but they increase the risk of the animals being run over. This can be mitigated by building specific points where animals such as jaguars can cross safely.There is continuing conflict with cattle ranchers, and the spread of diseases from domesticated animals also poses a threat to the jaguar population.Ceballos said a greater financial commitment to conservation from the federal government was needed, as well as support from the private sector, from scientists and from landowners to protect areas where jaguars may be living, if they were to meet their goal.“We are winning a battle in a war that is being lost. But it is a very important battle,” he said. “It gives us hope that if we articulate the right policies, we can achieve great results.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoEndangered speciesConservationWildlifeMammalsAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past five years, he said, the climate emergency had caused more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse €32bn (£28bn) in material losses.“We need to mobilise as a society against climate change, which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies,” he said. “Climate change kills. It kills. And that’s why we have to be aware of everything it represents in terms of insecurity and in terms of the risks it poses to our lives.“The climate change denial that’s coming from an important part [of society] – and which is growing as a result of the lies spread on social networks by some members of our political class – is as incomprehensible as it is worrying.”Spain wildfires are ‘clear warning’ of climate emergency, minister saysRead moreHe proposed a series of initiatives including a state civil protection agency to coordinate crisis responses, a network of climate refuges across the country and arethink of forest management and land use. Only by acting now, he said, could the country hope to avert similar disasters or reduce their impacts.“The biggest opportunity we have right now is to avoid this tragedy – and to do that, we need to do as a US president once advised when he said that the moment to fix your roof is when the sun’s shining and not when it’s raining,” he said.“I think he was right because thesesixth-generation firesthat have burned through more than 300,000 hectares in our country aren’t put out in summer; they’re put out in winter and in autumn. They’re put out by working all year.”Other measures in the socialist-led government’s “state pact to address the climate emergency” include funds to prepare for, and rebuild after, climate-related disasters, improvements to firefighting capacity, a plan to increase water resilience in the face of floods and droughts, and initiatives to fight rural depopulation and thus help keep the land clear of combustible material.Sánchez said farming would also play an important role in fighting the climate crisis, pointing to the benefits of extensive agriculture, careful grazing and efficient irrigation. The final two measures are promoting a “civic culture of prevention and reaction” and accelerating the green transition.The plan will be approved in cabinet on Tuesday and put out for public consultation.Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezClimate crisisWildfiresEuropeClimate science scepticism and denialExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

By the time they were brought to the surface, they had experienced such a dramatic change in pressure that they had undergone barotrauma, so they were internally damaged and unlikely to survive.I am a marine biologist and my work on the trawler was to document what types of deep-sea shark the fishers were catching, accidentally, while fishing in waters between 200 and 450 metres deep.My research brought home the realisation that deep-sea mining could have a massive impact on biodiversityMy Namibian colleague Filippus Tshimwandi and I recorded a number of deep-sea shark species that had not previously been thought to be anywhere near Namibia before. We recorded west African catsharks, which were mostly thought to be farther along the west African coast and a sawshark species.We also saw quite a lot of gulper sharks, which have huge emerald eyes and areamong the most threatened shark speciesin the world. They are often targeted by other fisheries for their squalene, a compound made from the oil in their liver and widely used in manufacturing cosmetics.View image in fullscreenRuth Leeney, a marine biologist, holding a frilled shark. Some of the sharks and rays she collected could fit in her hand, others were three metres long.Photograph: Ruth LeeneyThey were caught because bottom-trawl fisheries – even those that want to be sustainable like the fishery whose boat I was on – drag their nets along the bottom of the sea and collect everything that lives on or just above the seabed.This includes the fish they are targeting, but it also includes skates and rays that sit on the seabed and lots of other non-target fish – including the many shark species that live very close to the sea floor. It is a highly unselective and destructive type of fishing.Some sharks we measured and documented were the size of my hand, while others were more than three metres (10ft) in length. A lot of them had bioluminescence spots and patches on their bodies, which would be visible to other animals, even in this pitch-black environment they live in.View image in fullscreenA longsnouted dogfish. A member of the Deania species, it is from an order of sharks that can be found in waters between 400 and at least 1,300 metres deep in temperate zones of the Pacific and Atlantic.Photograph: Kelvin Aitken/VWPics/AlamyIt is thought this might give deep-sea sharks some sort of camouflage by breaking up their silhouette. But we do not know for sure, because most of these animals have never been seen alive in their natural habitat.I felt intrigued by how strange they looked and privileged to collect such hopefully useful data, because I suspect these ecosystems are incredibly important to the health and balance of the ocean.But I also felt really depressed because so many of these amazing animals were dead.View image in fullscreenRuth Leeney with a sicklefin chimaera sharkPhotograph: Ruth LeeneyI am hoping that my data, when it is published next year, will help to raise awareness and point to ways in which deep-sea fishing trawlers could be more sustainable and less damaging of these habitats.My research has also brought home to me the realisation that deep-sea mining could have a massive impact on the biodiversity of the planet.I’m obsessed with brittle stars: fish often nip off bits of their arms but they regenerateRead moreMy fear is that we’re going to be too late for a lot of deep-sea sharks. They breed slowly, so if their populations are depleted, they don’t recover quickly. We know so little about how their ecosystems work.If they are overfished or destroyed by deep-sea mining, we may just wipe out entire populations or create a huge imbalance in deep-sea ecosystems – without even knowing we are doing it.Ruth Leeney is a teaching fellow at Univeristy College Dublin’s school of biology and environmental science.

A roundabout at the park was later taped off by police.In a statement released by Cheshire police, his family paid tribute to “a little boy who was so full of life”.“Logan was a much-loved son, brother, grandson, great-grandson, cousin and friend to many,” the statement read.“He had an infectious personality and a beautiful smile. Everyone wanted to be where Logan was. He was a little boy who was so full of life and wanted to make everyone laugh. He made every day worth living.“Logan was everyone’s therapy person; their calm, and he will be missed more than we can ever put into words. We are taking comfort from the words of support we have received while we take time to come to terms with the untimely loss of our blue-eyed boy.”His relatives were being supported by specialist officers, police said.Winsford academy, the school Logan attended,posted on its website:“We are deeply saddened by the recent tragic news involving one of our students. Our thoughts are with the family and all those affected at this incredibly difficult time. As a school community, we will be offering support to students, staff and families.”A GoFundMe page set up by family friends in memory of Logan had raised more than £14,000 by Monday evening to help relatives.Investigating officers have urged witnesses or anyone with useful information to contact them via the website or on 101, quoting IML-2165641.Explore more on these topicsCheshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The documents – obtained byFast Charge, a newsletter covering electric cars, and shared with the Guardian – detailed how JLR and other carmakers lobbied the UK government toweaken targetsrequiring them to sell more EVs each year.JLR said armoured cars should be excluded from the targets, known as the zero emission vehicle mandate, because it “does not see any workable engineering solution to the challenges surrounding an armoured BEV [battery EV], primarily because the required safety levels and blast protection cannot be achieved”.Armoured vehicles are a small but very profitable business for carmakers. They usually have bulletproof glass, armour plating, and “bomb blankets” under the floor, adding hundreds of kilograms of weight to already heavy cars.While JLR did not say what specific vulnerabilities it sees in armoured electric vehicles, key engineering roadblocks are likely to include the extra weight from the battery cells, range issues and the time needed to recharge.However, its German rival BMW does not appear to share those worries: its electrici7 Protectionsaloon offers “special armouring” in the floor and ceiling to protect against explosives on the ground and those carried by drones.JLR said the UK government was the main customer in Britain for its armoured vehicles. The vehicles are built at the company’s site at Solihull in the West Midlands and then converted by its special vehicle operations department.Precise specifications of Starmer’s fleet of Range Rover Sentinels are not public to avoid aiding potential attackers, but they are understood to have 5-litre V8 engines, designed to allow the heavy cars tospeed off if threatened.The prime ministerial fleet also includes non-electric, German-made armoured Audi A8 saloon cars, which replaced the Jaguar XJ after that model was discontinued.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 400 homes in the Chesterfield area were evacuated during the storm.Neil Longden, the Environment Agency operations manager for Yorkshire, told the inquest on Monday that Tapton Terrace where Gilbert resided was at a high risk of flooding due to several factors, including lying on low land and being at the point where multiple water sources come together.Despite this, the street was found to have no flood defences. When asked why, Longden said the “answer really is you can build something, but someone has to pay for it”.View image in fullscreenTributes at the door of Maureen Gilbert. The level of the water can be seen near the top of the door.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianHe added: “There is a feasible solution to the problem but funding, and potentially the planning process, may put that at risk.”Longden also told the court there are “thousands of people at flood risk” throughout Britain, and that you would “have that challenge in many locations around the country”.The court heard that a storage reservoir, a unit that can hold large amounts of water in case of flooding, was installed downstream of River Rother in 2018 to reduce the peak flow caused by heavy rainfall.Longden described Storm Babet as “one of the most significant storms” he had encountered and a “different type of storm than I have experienced before” because of the amount of rain. He told the court the storage reservoir was the “only significant step” taken to protect the area from flooding between 2007, when Chesterfield experiencedintense flooding, and Storm Babet.Gilbert’s son, Paul Gilbert, attended the first day of the inquest.He told Sky News in 2023 that he had tried to secure his mother’s home with makeshift flood defences, which he had done for every flood warning since 2007, as residents feared an inundation, saying that “everybody on the street did as much as they could”.He told an interviewer at the time: “She lived on the street all her life. Rebuilding after the 2007 flood was hard for us and her but this is just devastating. We now only have memories as everything else is gone.”In the aftermath of Storm Babet Derbyshire police, whose officers responded to the flooding, referred themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which decided that the matter should be dealt with locally by the force.The inquest will continue on Tuesday and is expected to last five days.Explore more on these topicsDerbyshireExtreme weatherFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

Finally, an extraordinary collection of weapons and ceremonial objects taken from the Larrakia people more than a century ago is beginning a winding journey home to the saltwater landscapes of theNorthern Territoryin Australia.During an emotionally charged ceremony,Bristolcity council formally handed over 33 objects including spears that would have been used to hunt creatures from fish to buffalo, some still gleaming with the red ochre used to decorate them.They will be flown to Melbourne and then taken by truck to Garramilla/Darwin – road is the only option because at three metres some of the spears are too long to be transported on a domestic flight – and the plan is to show them at theLarrakia cultural centre, which is scheduled to open on a site overlooking Darwin harbour next year.“It’s a good day, very important,” said Nigel Browne, a Larrakia and Wulna man who was in Bristol to receive the objects. “This is the end of a four-year journey. To see the return of these cultural objects that were taken from Larrakia is very significant. They are the tools of our trade as ancient huntsmen, fishermen. They have been gone a long time.“They’ll be used not only to admire back home, but also teach a new generation of Larrakia how to craft spears that our ancestors were very adept at making. It’s not just about the past here. It’s about the future, teaching the next generation about their heritage.”Browne said museums across Australia and around the world held hundreds of such objects: “That’s the same for many different groups, not just Larrakia. Objects were taken over many years.”View image in fullscreenSome of the 33 objects that Bristol’s museum is returning to the Larrakia people.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianHe said other institutions should look at what Bristol had done: “It puts them in a leading role internationally and can be used as an example as to what good can happen.”Some of the objects could be photographed while others were kept hidden beneath tissue paper. Browne said: “Some of the objects we call secret and sacred and were used for ceremony.” The ones from Bristol can only be handled by men.The objects were collected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and donated to the museum. The earliest is a collection of spears, a spear thrower and a club donated by a Mr R Cuff in 1881. Nothing more is known of him. Marlborough College in Wiltshire donated five spears in 1934.Five years later, spears and spear throwers were donated by a relative of an English botanist who had “acquired” them while working inDarwin. Some were put on display in Bristol for a while, but all have been in storage for at least half a century.Mikayla Lee, a Larrakia woman and a member of the advisory group for the Larrakia cultural centre, described the recovery of the objects as overwhelming. “It’s very moving, emotional, a special moment,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Close by were artefacts taken from Nigeria and China, and the council said it would continue to work on repatriations of objects taken by British colonialists.The leader of the council, Tony Dyer, said he was proud of the work that had been done with the Larrakia people and that other objects may be repatriated to other countries. “I think there is much for us to learn from this and much to share with others,” he said.Some Larrakia people who could not make it to Bristol had sent moving reactions to images they had been shown of the pieces.“That’s a fishing spear. That’s really old that style,” said Roque Lee, a Larrakia man. “You don’t see that sort of spear now days.

One of the officers then appears to strike them in the face twice. It is unclear from the footage whether the police officer intentionally targeted O’Brien’s face.A Berlin police spokesperson confirmed that authorities were aware of the incident and said the officer had been identified.“We as the Berlin police are reviewing whether the officer acted proportionately, and we’re doing it as part of a criminal investigation on suspicion of bodily harm on duty,” the spokesperson said.O’Brien was treated by the Berlin fire brigade for unspecified injuries, police said. The activist is being investigated for insulting and resisting law enforcement officers.It was not immediately clear whether O’Brien had filed a complaint against the officer.Ireland’s department of foreign affairs said senior officials and its ambassador toGermany, Maeve Collins, had conveyed “concern” to German authorities about the incident.Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said the video footage obliged the Irish government to take action. “They had to take it seriously. It was two very violent assaults … It’s shocking. The German police are just horrendous when it comes to Palestine activism.”Lawlor said a fundraiser had been launched for O’Brien. “I understand they are still in hospital and will be out of work for a period of time.”Activists protested outside the German embassy in Dublin on Saturday. Catherine Stocker, a councillor with the Social Democrats and an aunt of O’Brien, said injuries included a broken arm and nerve damage.“What you have here is a bunch of mostly young Irish people standing up for international law and standing up for the people of Gaza and Palestine, which has effectively been made illegal to do in Berlin at this stage,” shetoldRTÉ.Stocker urged the Irish government to tell the German authorities that the police behaviour was “completely outside the bounds of democratic practice”.The German foreign ministry declined to comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Media reports said “Yallah, yallah intifada” and “From the river to the sea” were heard. Last year a Berlin courtconvicted an activistfor leading a chant using the latter phrase four days after theHamas attackson Israel.“During the operation, there were insults, physical attacks and acts of resistance against police officers,” the police added.Officers temporarily detained 94 people and police initiated 96 criminal investigations on suspicion of acts including “using symbols of unconstitutional and terrorist organisations, attacks on law enforcement officers, insulting behaviour and bodily harm”.Clashes between police and demonstrators at pro-Palestinian rallies are a common occurrence in Berlin, where local authorities have accused activists of creating an “aggressive atmosphere” and accosting police.However participants and observers have repeatedly reported what they have called excessive and unprovoked attacks by police against pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the German capital.Explore more on these topicsProtestGermanyEuropeIrelandPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warGazanewsShareReuse this content"

They also said the children could face peril and abuse if they were returned to Guatemala.District judge Sparkle Sooknanan’s order halting deportation of the children applies for 14 days while the case is pending. It covers potentially hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors who have been in US custody after crossing the southern border.Trump returned to the White House in January in part on a promise to deport more migrants than his predecessors. Courts have found that at least some of his accelerated deportation efforts violate constitutional rights to due process.The children had crossed into the US unaccompanied by their parents or guardians, in many instances to stay with relatives already in the country, and are by law entitled to heightened protections while their asylum and other immigration claims are processed.Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaUS immigrationTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Children are also risking long-term cardiovascular effects as a result of vaping at school and college, experts say.Speaking at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference, Prof Maja-Lisa Løchen, a senior cardiologist at the University hospital of North Norway, said she was concerned that millions of children could face ill health in future.She said: “I worry that vaping may be causing irreversible harm to children’s brains and hearts. Of course we have to wait for long-term data, but I am concerned. It increases your blood pressure, your heart rate, and we know that the arteries become more stiff.”Vaping stresses children’s cardiovascular systems, Løchen said. Their heart rate rises and their blood vessels constrict, which can stiffen arteries in the heart over time. Repeatedly vaping can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, stroke and even a heart attack.Løchen cited a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested vaping increases the risk of stroke by almost a third (32%).When e-cigarettes heat liquids to higher temperatures, they can also release larger amounts of harmful chemicals that can flow into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and seep into the heart.The liquids in e-cigarettes can release known carcinogens such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde when heated, research suggests. These and other chemicals can damage blood vessels, drive inflammation and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.“There is an additional risk of vaping in children [compared with adults] when it comes to effects on the body,” Løchen said. “Because we know that the nicotine and other elements in e-cigarettes have a very harmful effect on developing brains. Not only in the foetus, but during childhood and into your 20s. So that is something we are extremely concerned about.”When children quit vaping, some experience nicotine withdrawal that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, Løchen told reporters after she gave a presentation on e-cigarettes in Madrid.“We also know that when children and young people start vaping, they may become dependent on the nicotine and it can become a gateway to smoking. I’m very worried – and convinced – that children and adolescents that are starting to vape now are at increased risk of irreversible harm to their health.”Also speaking in Madrid, Prof Susanna Price, a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital in London and the chair of the ESC advocacy committee, said: “We are seeing an increase in children vaping but what we don’t yet know is what that translates to in long-term cardiovascular risk because they haven’t been around long enough.“I think there is a push to suggest that vaping is safe but we don’t know that. It’s my concern that we’re going to replace one highly addictive substance with another one that may have a similar profile with respect to cardiovascular risk.”Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Vaping is not risk-free and no child or teenager should be picking up an e-cigarette.” She said governments must take action to tackle concerning levels of youth vaping. “Making vaping less appealing to young people and creating a smoke-free generation cannot come a moment too soon.”Data on the long-term health effects is limited because vapes are relatively new and evolving. It could be years before further effects become apparent. In the meantime, Løchen is in favour of a global ban on sales of e-cigarettes.“I think based on what we know now about the detrimental and harmful effects of e-cigarettes, I think there should be a ban on sales of e-cigarettes worldwide,” she said. “There have been around for 15, 20 years now, we have the data. We know they are not harmless.”Explore more on these topicsVapingSmokingChildren's healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

If you go back to the European foreign policy leaders in the history of the nuclear deal, Javier Solana, Cathy Ashton, Federica Mogherini, Josep Borrell, they all tried to liaise betweenIranand the US.“They tried to prove they were credible negotiating partners. But now the Europeans have decided to be the proxy of the US and Israel. It is absolutely irresponsible of them to hand over that role to the US.”He highlighted theclaim by Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, that Israel was doing “the dirty work … for all of us” by attacking Iran’s nuclear sites in June. “In a way, all of the European countries condoned what Israel did, and very likely provided information to the Israeli regime,” Baghaei said.His remarks may be designed to put pressure on European capitals to distance themselves from the US and tone down the conditions they have set before they will agree to defer UN sanctions.Baghaei also said the Iranian government was not constitutionally able to block Iran’s withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) if the Iranian parliament went ahead and passed a law withdrawing from it in response to the European reimposition of UN sanctions. Withdrawal from the treaty was the prerogative of parliament, he said.The number of MPs backing an NPT withdrawal bill is due to be revealed on Tuesday but MPs said the measure was likely to be rushed through parliament with overwhelming support. Withdrawal from the NPT would mean the UN loses all rights to oversee Iran’s nuclear programme and would inevitably raise US concerns about whether Iran will build a nuclear bomb covertly or overtly.The powerful factions in the parliament seem convinced that Iran has the firepower to inflict heavy damage on Israel in the event of a second western attack.“We are prepared because this is a matter of our dignity and sovereignty,” Baghaei said. “I think you in the UK had your blitz spirit when attacked by Nazi Germany. We have the same spirit because we knew this war imposed on us in the middle of negotiations was so unjust.”View image in fullscreenA billboard in Tehran of nuclear centrifuges and the sentence: ‘Science is the power, and the Iranian nation will not abandon its religion and knowledge.’Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAThe three European signatories to the original nuclear deal – France Germany and the UK – notified the UN last Thursday that they intended to use their right to reimpose UN-wide sanctions at the end of September unless Iran met three conditions: a return of UN weapons inspectors to the bombed Iranian nuclear sites, the handover of details of the whereabouts of its 400kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and agreement to open talks with America on the future of its nuclear programme.Europe says there is still room for diplomacy in the coming four weeks to reach an agreement on these conditions. Baghaei described the European conditions as “a sign they are not serious and they do not have good faith”.He said: “There is an extreme trust deficit between the UN weapons inspectors fromIAEA and Iran. There is a real concern that the information gathered at the sites by the IAEA would end up being passed on to Israel.“It has been a real concern especially after the highly politicised approach of the IAEA. We cannot ignore the fact that previous IAEA reports were abused by America and Israel to craft the resolution to the IAEA board which claimed that Iran was not in compliance with its obligations.” He said that resolution was used as a pretext for theIsraeli attack on Iran in June.He conceded that Iran’s room for diplomatic manoeuvre at the UN in the next month was limited because of the public mood in Iran.“The fact is our public is outraged because of the unlawful attacks on our facilities and as a government we have to be accountable to our people and to our parliament,” he said.“The western media goes on about our cooperation with the IAEA and stockpiles, but the western public has to remember the outrageous [acts] committed by Israel and the US. They torpedoed the diplomatic process, they attacked the rule of international law because our facilities have been under inspection 24 hours a day for throughout the past three decades.”Iranian officials insist that the aim remains to reach a compromise in the next month that will allow the weapons inspectors to return. Iranian diplomats have given assurances to the IAEA that the stockpiles have not been moved. They also insist they are willing to speak to the Americans, but repeated messages sent to Washington have not been met with any response so far.Baghaei said Iran was willing to reduce the purity level to which it enriched uranium back to 3.67%, the level set in the old nuclear deal, so long as an overall agreement was reached that preserves Iran’s right to enrich uranium domestically.He questioned why the US was so intent on removing Iran’s right to enrich if, as Trump claimed, Iran’s ability to undertake such enrichment had been already destroyed by the joint US-Israeli attacks.Explore more on these topicsIranIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now the criminal code reference has become a catch-all term forNigerian consand illicit financial activity.The most famous form 419 takes in the west is the internet con, also known asthe Spanish Prisoner, where the target (or “mark”) is offered a sizable cut from a sum of money that needs to be transferred out of the country, often by someone claiming to be working for a bank or a powerful figure (posing as thebrother of the Nigerian dictator Sani Abachawas a popular tactic in the 00s). But in Nigeria the term has a universal meaning. “It covers everything,” Ellams tells me. “From a five-year-old trying to get extra sweets from his parents to a businessman embezzling money from his company.”View image in fullscreenIt’s all connected … a market seller in Lagos.Photograph: Oluwamuyiwa ‘Logor’ LogoThe playwright first noticed the signs back in 2013. He had been in town to research his hit playBarber Shop Chronicles, the award-winning tale about African men and their relationships, when the seed for his latest project was planted.That project is The 419, a series of photographic portraits by Oluwamuyiwa “Logor” Logo and sonnets written by Ellams that combine to tell the story of how money and 419 culture weaves into every facet of Lagosian life. Actors will record Ellams’s sonnets so that you can hear the images “speak” as you gaze at them.Four one nine is the lubricant that greases the wheels of Nigerian localised capitalismThe story starts with Zaria, an area boy – a thug for hire – who sells weed, before we meet a trader called Ronke who needs a guide to get her through a local market. Things slowly move up the food chain of Lagosian society to show how the lives of work-site foremen, architects and even a governor are all connected by the money that flows through the country. “Four one nine is the lubricant that greases the wheels of Nigerian localised capitalism,” says Ellams.Logor’s portraits will hang on the walls of the West Wing gallery at Somerset House in London and depict real-life Lagosians who Ellams met and interviewed and whose stories he stitched together into sonnets. Those verses bind together as a crown of sonnets – meaning each opening line can be combined to create a new sonnet. The language evolves as the story progresses and the subjects become more middle class and managerial, as pidgin makes way for more formal English. It’s a fittingly intricate setup for a work that unpicks a byzantine world of money, bartering and power.Ellams and Logor aren’t the first people to find inspiration inthe phenomenon of Nigeria’s informal economy. In 2000, the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argued in his bookThe Mystery of Capitalthat the key to unlocking Nigeria’s potential lay in formalising the informal economy that 419 scams help to power.But Ellams’s new work has a different approach: perhaps, it posits, we’ve been thinking about 419 offences all wrong. What if this extra-legal system of money and power is entirely logical in a country without the kind of welfare state that Europeans take for granted?View image in fullscreen‘Somewhere it got corrupted’ … Ellams.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images“The more I went back to Nigeria as an adult, the more I realised that what we termed as 419 often is the necessity of surviving in a country where there isn’t any sort of social safety net,” he says. “And there’s always this need to try and make more money to survive, literally to survive.”Ellams has a work-in-progress theory about the evolution of 419 in Nigeria. He thinks that the tradition of always ensuring you didn’t turn up to someone’s house empty-handed (a yam, or other produce, was expected as a gift) has morphed into the contemporary “cash is king” culture.“I suspect that when capitalism came, the demand or the expectation for goods became the expectation for cash, then became ademandfor cash,” he says. “Somewhere it got corrupted.”The repurcussions of 419 culture are huge, linking the country with a reputation for corruption. The former prime minister Boris Johnson wrote in a Spectator column that young people had “an almost Nigerian interest in money”, while the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announcedthat she no longer sees herself as Nigerian.“There are several things I think about Badenoch, none of them are good,” says Ellams. “I think she’s suffered various identity crises, which have only deepened since she became leader of the Conservative party. And I think in her appeal to be more British, she’s trying to cut off things that are undivorceable from her being, from her physical being, from her identity.”What does Ellams hope people take away from The 419? “Art at its most primal is simply a mirror,” he says. “It just shows you who you are and asks you to confront the world. And that’s what I’m trying to say: these are individuals, they live in a different place. That different place requires them to act in a specific way. How would you act if you were in those exact situations?”The 419 is at Somerset House, London, 9-14 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designPoetryPhotographyNigeriaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks about the joy of those early 60s pictures – and why they never made him richCharlotte JansenMon 1 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 03.53 EDTShareBlack-and-white street shots of elegant, unimpressed elderly women. Classic cars in shadows cast by New York’s soaring tenement buildings. Street-corner preachers. Imposing wiseguys too busy posturing to notice the camera. Stephen Shore’s new book,Early Work, is full of such everyday New York moments turned into magic. Though he later won acclaim for thephotographs he took at Andy Warhol’s studio/hangout the Factory, the previously unseen Early Work may be some of Shore’s most uninhibited and daring pictures – and they were taken in the early 60s, when he was a teenager.Perhaps it’s understandable, then, that the photographer, now 77, can’t really remember taking them – though he does recall that he printed them himself, in a DIY darkroom set up in the bathroom of his parents’ home on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. “The memory of the prints I made then is hard to separate from the memory of the actual event of taking the photograph,” he admits over the phone. “I don’t remember what was on my mind then, but what I see looking at them now is a kind of formal awareness, which I guess I understood intuitively. I understood from the beginning that a camera doesn’t point, it frames. I also understood the gap between the world of the photograph and the world we experience – the world of the photograph has to make sense on its own, out of context.”View image in fullscreen‘I see a photographer observing the people and the city’ … Stephen Shore, from Early Work.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackHe does remember how he took a series of shots from an unusual high angle, a kind of giant’s eye view of passersby – as if the voracious young photographer were trying to grasp his home city from every possible perspective, to make himself big enough to understand it. “I put a very wide-angle lens on my Leica and held the camera over my head and took pictures randomly.”People were out on the street experiencing each other – not scrolling through TikTokThe idea for Early Work came after Shore returned from Rhinebeck Village in upstate New York, whereupon his studio manager Laura Steele presented him with a stack of prints made from his archive. The picture on top depicted Shore’s parents standing on a street corner – in Rhinebeck. Though Shore has lived nearby since the early 1980s, “I had no idea I had been there before.” The picture appears on the back cover of the book and is the one in the collection Shore is most attached to. Aside from sentimental reasons, it prefigures the formal concerns he would explore aged 23, when he travelled across the US with an 8x10 camera, taking the photographs that appear in his lauded bookUncommon Places, an expansive portrait of America’s diners, gas stations and national parks.View image in fullscreen‘I had no idea I’d been there before’: Stephen Shore’s parents in Rhinebeck.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackLooking through Early Work, it is remarkable how uninterested Shore seems to be in people his own age. Most of his subjects are over 40. Their generation, he points out, had lived through the Great Depression and the second world war – many were veterans trying to return to regular life in the city. The pictures suggest a reverence and respect for their authority, though Shore can’t remember whether he was feeling this when he took them. “I see a photographer observing the people and the city, observing their inner state, how they interact, looking at social and cultural meanings,” he says. “People who are drawn to the medium of translating the world into an image tend to be fascinated by the world.”Stephen Shore: ‘People would chase me off their lawns with my Leica’Read moreShore’s documentation of 1960sNew Yorkinevitably reveals how social habits have changed over the decades. “The city is crowded now, but people don’t hang out in the same way,” he says. “People were out on the street experiencing each other, engaging with each other and feeling free to roam the city, not scrolling through TikTok.” The pictures also convey a sense of liberation perhaps less accessible to New York kids today. “Parents were not as protective and determining of their children’s activities,” Shore says. “When I was eight and living in Manhattan, I went to school downtown alone on two different buses. That was typical in the 1960s.”It was Shore’s uncle Leo who introduced him to photography. Recognising his nephew’s nascent interest in chemistry, he gave Shore a Kodak ABC Darkroom Outfit as a sixth birthday present – a simple kit for making contact prints at home, complete with developing trays and chemicals. By 1962, the 14-year-old Shore had signed up to take photography classes at New York’s New School, where he studied briefly under the great Austrian American photographerLisette Model– whose influence can be seen in the confrontational approach and bold attitude of some of Shore’s shots of people on the street.View image in fullscreen‘Pictures sold for nothing – if they sold’ … Stephen Shore, from Early Work.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackHe became involved in a photography community who would get together once a month to critique each other’s work. “You’d get a little slip of paper in an envelope with a time and date for the meeting,” he remembers. “It was like a secret society – except we didn’t have any pretensions to exclusivity.”Photographywas hardly ever exhibited at museums or galleries at the time: “There was absolutely no notoriety involved in being a photographer, there was no remuneration, pictures sold for nothing – if they sold. Some people are drawn to the medium without any possibility of fame or fortune.”MoMA was one of the few New York art institutions to take photography seriously enough to have a curator dedicated to it,Edward Steichen, and at 14 Shore called him up, which led to MoMA acquiring three of Shore’s photographs. In 1971, Shore became the first living photographer to have a solo exhibition at the Met. Despite being awarded two prestigious fellowships in 1975 and a subsequent solo show at MoMA the following year, his pictures sold for as little as $125 each. Shore got by financially thanks to teaching – he has been the director of the photography department at Bard College, New York, since 1982. “I’ve taught every generation from X to Z.”View image in fullscreenA diner with Shore reflected in the window.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackEarly Work ends with pictures Shore took on his very first day at the Factory. He and Warhol had met at a screening where the latter premiered his underground movie The Life of Juanita Castro and Shore presented a 16mm film, Elevator. He would spend three years photographing the Factory almost daily, capturing “superstars” such as Edie Sedgwick, its house band the Velvet Underground, and the groundbreaking work its impresario was making. Warhol, Store says, “was always friendly and direct. He was 20 years my senior and would, if I said something inappropriate in a situation, correct me, somewhat like an older relative giving guidance, but otherwise he treated me as a friend.” As Shore was the only other person in the group who lived on the Upper East Side, “when we broke up for the evening, perhaps two in the morning after a late supper in Little Italy or Chinatown, Andy and I would share a taxi uptown. We had totally unguarded conversations.” Many of the Factory regulars were gay, as was Warhol, but “he understood that I was straight – and this was never an issue”.Factory records: Andy Warhol’s 1960s captured by Stephen Shore – in picturesRead moreWhile Shore got unprecedented access to the Factory, the pictures he took there lack the expansive experimentation and lucidity of Shore’s street shots. You can sense the photographer, still only a teenager, feeling his way into a new world. In his 20s, Shore would become one of the defining photographers of postwar America, but Early Work shows that his ability to articulate the mood of his country in images was present right from the start. “Painters start with a blank canvas and make marks to add complexity; photography is the opposite – you start with the whole world,” he says. “I don’t know what to do with a blank paper – but put me on a street corner and my imagination goes off!”Stephen Shore: Early Workis published by Mack on 1 September, £55Explore more on these topicsPhotographyStephen ShoreNew YorkAndy WarholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Get the popcorn ready for a preposterous world of locked rooms, creepy gardeners … and bodiesLucy ManganMon 1 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareThe writer Matthew Barry and director Ashley Way gave us one of the highlights of 2023’s television output inMen Up, a witty, moving, compassionate treat of a drama about the development of the drug that would become known as Viagra and the group of Welshmen who were among its first guinea pigs.Their new offering is a more straightforward one, and if it doesn’t achieve the same success Men Up did, they can hardly be condemned for having set their bar so high.The Guest is a fast, furious, preposterous thriller of the kind that you can only pull off if everyone involved in its creation and consumption approaches it without an ounce of cynicism. Barry, Way and the high-calibre cast hold up their end of the bargain, delivering bags of propulsive plot. Viewers must hold up theirs via uncritical acceptance of the multiple twists, and bring along enough metaphorical or actual popcorn for the ride.Thus will happiness ensue as we embark on the tale of young have-not Ria (Gabrielle Creevy, in a really fine performance that does much to prevent the whole thing flying off the rails). She is working as a cleaner for various horrible people who fire her as soon as someone cheaper comes along (“If you’re going to be funny about it, let’s just call it a day, shall we?”), supporting Lee (Sion Daniel Young), the deadbeat boyfriend she has had since school, and stealing food so she can pay their rent on a grim illegal sublet while he complains about the lack of jobs. Into this unrewarding life arrives Fran (Eve Myles), a rich, self-made businesswoman and apparent fairy godmother. She offers Ria a four-day-a-week cleaning job at her luxurious mansion for decent wages and gives her inspirational speeches, which stir the longings and ambitions in Ria that have lain dormant since her mother died while Ria was still at school.View image in fullscreenThings quickly get more twisted and more intense … Eve Myles and Gabrielle Creevy in The GuestPhotograph: BBC/Quay Street Productions/Simon RidgwayOf course, Fran could be all benevolence, but a glimpse of a shadowy figure in the supposedly empty guesthouse, and the ominous strings scoring every scene Fran is in, tell the astute watcher otherwise, even before the aged gardener, Derek (Clive Russell), tells her to get out of there while she still can. It’s probably his memory going, though. It’s almost certainly nothing to do with the permanently locked room in the mansion, the imports Mr Fran is constantly sourcing abroad and sending home, or Fran having an affair with Derek’s son. Nor dropping hints about domestic violence or insisting that her childlessness is a happy choice she made so that she and her unsettling husband could concentrate on the business.Soon, Fran is offering her more money, more responsibility, more inspirational speeches, more clothes from her wardrobe, giving her pills from her stash and installing Ria in the guesthouse. She also encourages her protege to join dating apps to see what improvements Ria can make on the boyfriend situation now that Fran has shown her what she’s truly worth. A guy called Mike Rice (Joseph Ollman) seems nice!Not that Ria is a sap. She has an instinct for self-preservation (quietly whipping out her phone to record Fran and her lover shagging in the kitchen, though this may just be a reminder to double-Dettol the place rather than as future blackmail material) and enough smarts to keep her from being the kind of heroine you find yourself shouting at in frustration.With a sense of glorious inevitability, we move into a world of broken banisters and bodies, Instagram clues, police suspicions, hidden diaries, rolls of ready cash and more, while Fran and Ria’s relationship grows more twisted, more intense. The question of quite how dangerous it is to know each of them becomes more pressing.Oh, I almost forgot (I’m sorry – there is alotgoing on)! What of the previous cleaner, Anna, who was also promoted to Fran’s assistant, given a makeover, supplied with lots of pills and installed in the guesthouse? Why would anyone give that cushy number up? I’m sure there is not a reasonable explanation, and you will be too if you’ve gone into this with the right attitude, as recommended above.All four ridiculous, well-played, well-paced episodes slip down a treat. There’s nothing hugely earth-shattering or innovative here – apart from the sheer volume of plot contained therein – but you will have fun. That much I promise you.The Guest aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a vehement, fervent, striking but sometimes baffling drama about thehistorical figure of Ann Lee, who endured religious persecution in 18th-century England as leader of the fundamentalist Shaker movement.As the embodiment of Christ’s second coming, Lee took her radical message to the New World and in pre-revolutionary America founded an enduring community of souls, persecuted all over again by the new patriarchy for being a woman and a pacifist. Her Shakers were known among other things for their skill in stylishly elegant and minimalist furniture – although the connection with Christ’s profession is unstressed. Lee is played byAmanda Seyfried, with Lewis Pullman as her brother William and Christopher Abbott as her oppressive husband Abraham, who appears to be partial to a bit of BDSM where he gets to be a Christian dom in the marriage bed.The movie looks sometimes like a Lars von Trier nightmare of ironised martyrdom, or a Robert Eggers horror film like The Witch, and then sometimes like a weird but spectacular Broadway musical melodrama, in which the shaking and shivering of the dancing faithful – ecstatically submitting to divine joy – is shaped into a choreography not unlike the musical Stomp. Atheists and rationalists in the audience might be tempted to ask … well … whatisthe testament of Ann Lee exactly? What is her message, her legacy for the 21st century?The answer would appear to be simply this: she established a Christian sect. (Some statistics about follower numbers are given over the closing credits.) Lee fiercely believed that all sex was wrong, and a wicked distraction from the spiritual. No follower in this film is so disloyal as to ask how then is humanity to be saved from dying out? Is it simply a matter of letting people outside the faith keep humanity going with their deplorable activities and the resulting children can be brought into the fold? And the shaking, the shivering, the speaking in tongues, to a modern audience, this will obviously look like collective hysteria and sexual repression, but the film cannot exactly bring itself to endorse this obvious diagnosis, because it wants us to take Lee seriously at some level.Yet Fastvold is arguably justified in wanting to show that this sexual repression generated enough redirected energy to take a religious group all the way from Manchester to colonial New York, and to make a real contribution to the new enlightenment and the debate over liberty. Lee shouts “Shame!” at a slave auction in this New World of liberty for white people, though it doesn’t occur to her to make abolitionism part of her Christian mission.This is a genuinely strange film, elusive in both tone and meaning, one which deploys the obvious effects and rhetorical forms of irony, while at the same time distancing itself from these effects and asking its audience to sympathise and even admire Lee, because she is not supposed to be the villain. Fastvold is perhaps asking her audience to take whatever elements from the film they find congenial. An enigmatic ritual that is not for everyone.The Testament of Ann Lee screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDrama filmsBiopicsChristianityPeriod and historical filmsThe BrutalistAmanda SeyfriedreviewsShareReuse this content"

She is one of the very few golden age stars still with us, and maybe the title of this film is a playful pun: at the very apex of Hollywood history, perhaps Novak feels dizzy looking down from her mythic height.Philippe himself is more than qualified for this kind of intensely personal exegesis, having in the past made intriguing films aboutDavid Lynch’s debt to The Wizard of Ozand about thePsycho shower scene. With a touch of mischief and misdirection, he begins his film by simply playing a voice note that Novak has sent him, in which she talks sombrely about her health issues and about how much time she has left. She does sound poignantly frail. Then you see her in person and she is sensational; articulate, vibrant, youthful in ways that have nothing to do with cosmetic work, very engaged with the questions that Philippe puts to her – but concerned also to discuss her own life and personality, particularly her interest in painting and what she owes to her parents. And, of course, she has something to say about the most germane issue of all: how Hollywood, and society in general, imposes its male views on how a woman should look and behave, a trope famously embodied by Novak in Vertigo.Novak conducts her interview with Philippe at home, a conversation interspersed with clips and home-movie archive footage – but what makes it so absorbing is that Novak has been persuaded to open up boxes of personal material, live on camera, that she has not looked at for 60 years. And the climax comes when she gingerly prises off the lid of a box to find inside thegrey two-piece suit that she worefor James Stewart’s Scottie in Vertigo. She even sniffs it to “find out if it smells of me”. For old Hollywood fetishists, that’s a real showstopper.Novak, who is of Czech heritage, began her career in her early 20s at Columbia Pictures, under the whip of studio chief Harry Cohn, who used an ugly racist epithet about her. (Cohn himself was reputedly subject to an antisemitic outburst from Walt Disney.) Cohn was irritable about any residual foreignness in the new acting name that would be assigned to her. Originally Marilyn Novak, she was renamed Kim with Cohn’s agreement and, perhaps oddly, the film does not talk about the other Marilyn. Novak herself talks about her passionate admiration for Greta Garbo, though two more different personalities can hardly be imagined.In the 1950s, Novak made the noir Pushover with Fred MacMurray, the romantic romp Phffft with Jack Lemmon, Pal Joey with Frank Sinatra and the stridently dramatic Jeanne Eagels with Jeff Chandler. Later, before her retirement in the 60s, she made bold and interesting choices with Of Human Bondage with Laurence Harvey and Robert Aldrich’s The Legend of Lylah Clare. For each of these (relatively) lesser-known films, it is possible to make the case that she gave a more animated and more interesting performance than the one she was most famous for: the tormented leading lady of Alfred Hitchcock’s great mystery thriller, who is often eerily still and trancelike. Novak herself has felt the corseted pressure of being a consciously created enigma.This is a very watchable and pleasurable film, though I was disappointed that Novak, despite speaking a lot about Stewart, had so little to say about Hitchcock himself. (Perhaps Philippe will now want to interview those other legendary Hitchcock survivors: Eva Marie Saint, 101, and Tippi Hedren, 95.) Either way, Novak shows herself to be a fierce, even heroic, figure.Kim Novak’s Vertigo screened at the Venice film festivalExplore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDocumentary filmsAlfred HitchcockThrillersVertigoFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s how old I was when I first laid eyes on The Talented Mr Ripley, Anthony Minghella’s ravishing, exquisitely grim 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s flinty 1955 novel. I’d been a movie fan for years at that point, but something about its elegant menace, its beauty flecked with blood, grabbed ahold of me like little had previously. It is by no means a feelgood film, this story of queer longing and loneliness giving way to murderous deed. But watching it now (as I do perhaps embarrassingly often) still evokes the primal thrill of art cracking open a young mind.‘High-adrenaline opulence’: why Bad Boys is my feelgood movieRead moreMinghella, who died in 2008, was a master of style, crafting wholly credible visions of the past. His prowess is perhaps best on display in Ripley, which takes the viewer on a grand tour of mid-20th-century Italy, both its sun-splashed coastal languor and its more anxious, cobble-gray city streets. Tom Ripley, a low-birth conman sent to Europe’s blessed boot to retrieve a prodigal shipping scion at his father’s behest, is in awe of the country, as are we in the audience; so much so that we begin to sickly root for Tom’s increasingly sinister campaign to stay there.Gabriel Yared’s alternately forbidding and playful score – its seductive clarinet, its ominously plinking glockenspiel – envelops as Tom plunges ever further into his pool of lies, dragging hapless heirs and dilettantes down into the murk with him. It’s seriously high-grade suspense, though the film thrums with a sadder, more profound undertone. Just beneath the film’s lacquered finish is a bitter, and disarmingly empathetic, consideration of what it is to live with unspoken desire, to yearn and reach for a golden world from which your true self would likely be shunned.It’s no mystery why I, having just come out of the closet in the summer of 1999, saw in this film something particularly salient. But it wasn’t just that. It was the electric rush of Minghella’s seamless execution, working with a cast of soon-to-be-enormous actors – who, I’d argue, have never been better.Few other young, straight male actors trying to make their name in 1990s Hollywood would have been confident enough to play this shifty queer protagonist with anything matching Matt Damon’s precise, fearless conviction.Jude Law, a sun-god beamed into the picture from Mount Olympus, is a perfectly loathsome and alluring Dickie Greenleaf.Philip Seymour Hoffmanis a noxious hoot as boorish flaneur Freddie Miles. Gwyneth Paltrow is effectively patrician and pathetic as Dickie’s fiancee Marge, whose worldly chicness and easy warmth are no match for Tom’s cruel manipulations. And, of course, there is the magnificent Cate Blanchett, gliding off with each of her scenes as Meredith Logue, a socially stunted textiles princess who witlessly aids Tom in his deceptions, happy to be involved in a bit of intrigue while being rather careless with her own heart.It was all so exciting to witness at 16, when I was beginning to form an idea of what I liked about actors, about movies. And, maybe, when Hollywood was developing a new idea of itself. The Talented Mr Ripley might ultimately have fallen on the wrong side of that cultural faultline; it is the kind of Hollywood film that is now in woefully short supply, entertaining and artful and, despite all the period trappings and on-location shooting, modestly budgeted. Such things have largely gone away in the years since Ripley’s release. But at the time, the film felt – for me, anyway – like a bridge to the future.If the movie is a relic of a lost age, what a relic it is. And how significantly it has resounded in my head, returning to me again and again as I’ve ventured into adulthood. On any of my many rewatches, I’m certainly not seeking solace from Tom Ripley; I’m not even craving a trip to Italy. (Any more than usual, anyway.) What I am instead chasing, and remembering, is the giddiness of realizing that movies like Ripley could even exist, and that I was finally ready to see and enjoy them.Which is why The Talented Mr Ripley has become, in its shivery and melancholic way, a feelgood movie for me, and no doubt plenty of others. It’s a representation of Hollywood’s purest capability, to enthral and stir and transport. However naively, I still hold the hope that an upstart director of this era might turn to Minghella’s film, now a quarter-century old, and find some inspiration in it. There in its thoughtful construction, its deft employment of movie-star glow, its calm insistence that literary things can also be visceral, sensual wonders. If we can’t all go to Europe to find ourselves, we can at least watch Ripley and let ourselves darkly dream.The Talented Mr Ripley is available in the US on Paramount+ and the Criterion Channel, on Amazon Prime and Paramount+ in the UK and on Stan in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieMatt DamonGwyneth PaltrowPatricia HighsmithThrillersCrime fictionCate BlanchettfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2000, this cartoon-fronted project seemed like something fun for Damon Albarn to do between Blur albums, hiding behind Jamie Hewlett’s comic-book animations, but they’ve overtaken Blur almost everywhere but Britain. The number of children in the audience testifies to Gorillaz’s powers of self-rejuvenation – an ever-changing vehicle for Albarn’s ceaseless curiosity.Gorillaz are marking the occasion with an immersive exhibition, House of Kong, and four era-specific shows. This second night revives 2005’s Demon Days. Co-produced by Danger Mouse, it remains the most satisfying expression of the Gorillaz concept: focused in both its themes (innocence and violence) and personnel (rappers and the rap-adjacent). Dressed like a hip vicar, Albarn serves double duty as a frontman and a conscientious host, although the original cast of vocalists is inevitably depleted. The late MF DOOM and awol Shaun Ryder appear only on screen, while Skye Edwards replaces Martina Topley-Bird on All Alone. Thank goodness for the old-school stalwarts. Bootie Brown enters Dirty Harry like a red-and-white firework before De La Soul boom and cackle through Feel Good Inc.View image in fullscreenGorillaz with London Community Gospel Choir at Copper Box Arena, London.Photograph: Phoebe FoxStraight replication, though, is not the point. Beneath Hewlett’s helter-skelter videos, the band, choir and string quartet give the songs new mass and drama. O Green World builds to a startling frenzy and the climactic title track blossoms gloriously. As stained-glass windows fill the screen and the London Community Gospel Choir chant the cathartic refrain, “To the sun”, Albarn’s vicar gear suddenly makes sense. The encore of three contemporary B-sides, while admirably disciplined, is somewhat anticlimactic. The luminous Hong Kong, starring theguzhengvirtuoso Qing Du, ends the night on a melancholy question mark rather than an exclamation point.Then again, the singles notwithstanding, Demon Days isn’t exactly a party record. This product of the Bush-and-Blair years was pitched as “the world in a state of night,” drawing inspiration from horror soundtracks and the Specials’ queasy crisis-pop. The show opens with a wartorn newsreel montage and sporadically drenches the crowd in hell-red light. For obvious reasons, the album’s haunting protest against humanity’s appetite for destruction – of people and planet alike – sounds no less apt tonight. Demon days are here again.Explore more on these topicsGorillazPop and rockHip-hopRaplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

What was the effect on you of living with a mother who was mad?” Ginsberg’s answer, mildly inflected by a laugh, is: “It gave me a great sort of … tolerance for eccentric behaviour.”Arundhati Roy, whose memoir is partly an account of her life with her mother Mary Roy, might recognise this insight. Arguably, all mothers appear to their children as mad: madness here meaning an unbounded force, at odds with what society imagines normal parenting to consist of. The manifestations of this madness are as disparate as those of love, and these two aspects – the abnormal, the overbearing, and the protective, the nurturing – can be, in our mothers, intimately intertwined (“She was my shelter and my storm,” writes Roy). It is through loving and depending on the mysterious and incomprehensible that we come to “tolerate”, even embrace, the strangest thing of all: life itself.Mary Roy was a kind of visionary, but she seemed to drive people around her mad, as well as being frequently driven mad by them. A Christian from Kerala, she escaped her parents by marrying a member of the Bengali bourgeoisie, known to his friends as Micky Roy, before leaving him when he became an alcoholic, “a Nothing Man”. She took her children, Arundhati and her brother Lalith, to a “cottage that belonged to our maternal grandfather” in Tamil Nadu, but came up against her family’s invocation of a law governing inheritance in her community: “daughters had no right to their father’s property and we were to leave the house immediately”. Finally they came to Aymanam, a village in Kerala (spelled “Ayemenem” by Roy, recognisable as the village inThe God of Small Things), staying first with their family, “extraordinary, eccentric, cosmopolitan people, defeated by life”, before once more falling out with them. Mary then set up her own home and, eventually, a school that developed a national reputation.Mary seemed to be perpetually at war, often for no clear reason, with her children, especially her daughterMary Roy’s years of doing battle allowed her to leave two remarkable legacies: her school, but also the case she eventually fought against her family, which went all the way to the supreme court, and resulted in the annulment of the discriminatory inheritance law. In the meantime, she seemed to be perpetually at war, often for no clear reason, with her children, especially her daughter: “In my effort to fathom my mother, to see things from her perspective … to understand what hurt her, what made her do the things she did … I turned into a maze … hoping to gain a vantage point for a perspective other than my own.”This attempt to understand the compulsion to love what seems hostile transforms Roy’s writing, lending her prose, especially in the first 130 or so pages, an unprecedented freedom. An astringent conscience-keeper in the political sphere, she finds herself, with her mother as the subject, on terrain that tests her in quite a different way. We discover, in these sections, an ability to transition between contraries, a fluency that is less “empathy” than something unpredictable and alchemical. Note, for example, the paradoxically liberating role the word “fortunately” plays in this sentence about her mother, brother, and herself: “He remembered being loved. Fortunately, I didn’t.” Or the defiantly jubilant assertion, “I loved killing them”, about the lice the family help would comb out of her hair.The world described in the first part of the book provides much of the material for The God of Small Things. But these pages aren’t significant for giving us access to Roy’s inspiration, or as a preamble to her life as a bestselling writer who would go on to become an oppositional political voice. Even if she were none of these things or had never written her novel, they would be utterly absorbing. They have a wonderful, self-assured self-sufficiency.In the late 1970s, Roy escaped her mother, arriving in Delhi and enrolling in the School of Planning and Architecture there. At this point the memoir also bears witness to a world-historical shift: the receding of a kind of modernity and politics which had given rise to experimental lives and ways of thinking. Both Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, despite the great gulf between their backgrounds and world views, embodied the open-endedness made possible by such experimentation. So did Mary Roy and her brother George Isaac in their various projects and vicissitudes. I’d also situate Micky Roy in this context: one of the funniest, most moving sections in this book has to do with Arundhati’s reunion with her father in a hotel in Delhi: “He was lying on his stomach with his knees bent, his feet waving at the ceiling.”This shift ultimately created the world we inhabit today. Even before the precipitous slide towards the far right now evident almost everywhere, there was the feverish globalisation that engendered a liberal elite just as bizarre as any of its political opponents. These changes are – explicitly and implicitly – the subject of the second half of the book. They are woven into Roy’s continual, courageous confrontations with the nation-state, including her criticism of its nuclear policies and opposition to Sardar Sarovar dam. Roy lovesIndiadeeply, but the nation-state isn’t India, and it doesn’t love her back. The conflict is comparable to, albeit profoundly different from, her relationship with Mary Roy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

That success was akin to an inheritance left to a writer in the 18th century by an obscure uncle: something Roy benefits from but whose meaning she must also grapple with. In the midst of this, Mary Roy re-enters her daughter’s life, the mother delighted by Arundhati’s celebrity, but also puncturing it occasionally with Dadaist zeal. Throughout the book, but with especial force in the second half, Mrs Roy’s resistance and recalcitrance are an invigorating antidote to whatever our new world preaches is most rewarding about life.Mother Mary Comes To Me is published by Penguin (£20).

As it begins, the protagonist, Lise Mundus, has just been abandoned by Vilhelm, her husband of 20 years. He’s a celebrity newspaper editor; she’s an acclaimed writer with a history of addiction. From a bed in a psychiatric ward, Lise publishes a lonely hearts ad: “Recently escaped a long, unhappy marriage – aged 51, but youthful in spirit – wonderful son, aged 15 – household literary name – summerhouse – large flat in the city centre – temporarily incapacitated by a nervous breakdown – prefers a motorist.”The ad is seized upon by Lise’s malicious upstairs neighbour, Mrs Thomsen, who shows it to her young lodger/lover, Kurt, hoping he can financially exploit Lise. Kurt is duly installed in Lise’s home, but finds himself treated there with total indifference. Lise is wholly consumed with memories of Vilhelm and with plans to end her own life. We know she will carry these out; in the opening pages, she is already dead.In the English-speaking world, Ditlevsen is best known for her great trilogy of memoirs,Childhood, Youth and Dependency. Her fiction is also often autobiographical to an unusual degree. Lise’s marriage isn’t just similar to Ditlevsen’s marriage to the editor Victor Andreasen – it’s identical. The lonely hearts ad is an edited form of one Ditlevsen really wrote. The book also deliberately elides the distinction between author and character. Sometimes Lise is a first-person narrator, but, from one word to the next, the “I” can become that of someone discussing a Lise who is already dead. In a typically jarring shift, we get: “Only one [photograph] have I kept: the photograph of Vilhelm and Lise at the top of Himmelbjerget. We are young and happy …”The most crucial likeness between author and character is that Tove Ditlevsen would kill herself within a year of the novel’s publication.She used the same means as her alter ego, and, in her final letters to family, she expressed the same sentiments Lise feels in her last moments. What we are reading is an autofictional suicide note.What seemed to be fearless self-revelation is actually an exercise in not mentioning the single most important factIt is no surprise, then, that the book isn’t concerned with providing the usual pleasures of fiction. The plot is a series of arbitrary events that fail to matter to anyone. People have become ugly caricatures even to themselves. As an avatar of pain, Vilhelm is the one person who retains his full reality for Lise. His diary is full of sadistic ravings about her: “I want to see her suffer even more. Yet it’s impossible to bring her to her knees, because for her, suffering is so easily transformed into pleasure.” To her face, he rants: “When I met you, you were nothing but a blethering drug addict. You knew nothing of Rilke, Eliot, or Proust, and now all you do is plagiarise them.” Lise seems to revel in this cruelty, the only form of love she can still acknowledge. Her only other pleasure is anticipating death. As she heads off to take her life, she reflects that Vilhelm will be proud of her, and “is so overwhelmed with joy at what is finally within reach that she feels like singing and dancing all the way home …”While the book is closely autobiographical, it never claims to be a truthful picture. The demand for accuracy is just another social dictate the already-dead need not respect. As we’re blithely told, “[Out] of sheer impatience to be rid of this Lise … in her final book, I basically make her out to be worse than she is.” And, since a memoir published in 2023 by Ditlevsen’s granddaughter, Lise Munk Thygesen, we’re aware of one crucial omission: the real Victor Andreasen sexually abused Ditlevsen’s teenage daughter, Helle, starting when the girl was 15. Ditlevsen knew, but never addressed it in her writing. Knowing this radically alters how we read Lise’s agonised loathing of Vilhelm and herself. What seemed to be fearless self-revelation is actually an exercise in not mentioning the single most important fact.It will be obvious from the above that this book isn’t for everyone. Some will reject a book that endorses suicide; some will condemn Ditlevsen for concealing her husband’s crimes. Reading it can be like listening to a stranger ranting disconnectedly about her ex and viciously slagging off everyone she knows, while clearly desperately needing help that isn’t going to come. But Ditlevsen makes this darkest of all material fascinating, perversely likable and occasionally revelatory. She’s a brilliant writer and formidable thinker, even with her thinking at its most disordered. Vilhelm’s Room can be uneven and heavy-handed, and it’s nothing if not problematic. But it remains a unique and powerful document of catastrophic mental illness.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Forthcoming deck-building game,All Will Rise, seeks to interest players in political activism,Compensation Not Guaranteedaims to educate players about south-east Asian politics, whileMythMatchis ostensibly a puzzle game set in ancient Greece, but is also about building communities and challenging capitalism – while still looking cute and approachable.You play as Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, who is having to navigate the institutionalised sexism of Mount Olympus, here represented as a corporation infested with tech bros. In defiance, she decides to help the mortals of Ithaca build a new, more progressive world – and you do this by running around the little environments, merging items and animals to create helpful new beasts and objects. For example, when you’re cast down to Earth you accidentally smash a chariot belonging to Selene, the goddess of the Moon, so you have to match moon shards together to recreate the celestial vehicle. However, one of the shards has fallen into a greenhouse, so you need to solve a puzzle to gain access.View image in fullscreenAll-new Ithaca … Mythmatch.Photograph: Team ArtichokeThe game then is part narrative adventure, part social sim, part match-three teaser. “We ended up taking a lot more from automation games like Factorio, but where the automation happens through connection with the NPCs rather than building machinery,” says Moo Yu, founder and creative director at developer Team Artichoke. “And in Mount Olympus, we’re inspired by various arcade-style games like Money Puzzle Exchanger, Overcooked, and even Super Auto Pets.”With a diverse bunch of characters and a genuinely funny script, the emphasis is very much on forming friendships and a pleasant community. “I became obsessed with the theme of belonging,” says Yu. “As someone who has always struggled to make friends or find community, I just felt like there weren’t enough games about rejection and found family. So I started with some gameplay about moving goalposts and constantly being rejected by the gods of Olympus. Then when searching for where Artemis might actually fit in, I thought about some of the communities that I love and how they are about aligning our commonalities while embracing our differences.”Team Artichoke is a small studio with 10 staff, most of whom are working part-time on the project. At the helm, Yu is a veteran who’s worked at Media Molecule and Mind Candy as well as co-developing the hit adventureKnights and Bikes. When asked about the key influences behind Mythmatch, he immediately cites three films: Kung Fu Panda, Amelie and most prominently Legally Blonde, the Reese Witherspoon comedy which is visually coded to look like a romcom but also deftly analyses misogyny in the legal profession. “We wanted to create a caricatured world to give us the breathing space to venture on to more serious topics,” he says. “[There’s] a surface cuteness but with a layer of grittiness throughout. So while the game might not literally look like the world of Legally Blonde, we wanted to capture the space created by the exaggerated colour palette while also making sure there was a layer of messiness as well.”So while Mythmatch uses the core game loops of casual genres such as match-three and merge games, it has a fundamental message to impart about power and belonging. Yu sees this combination as important in the indie games scene of 2025. “I’m seeing more small games that are delivering new stories or pairing mechanics with interesting narratives that I think speaks to what creativity can accomplish with limited funds,” he says. “I wish the funds weren’t getting more and more limited, but I am always inspired by what people can accomplish with what they can scrape together.”Mythmatch is currently in development for PC, with a release date to be announced.Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesPuzzle gamesCasual gamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or are there some things that you just can’t get over? These are the themes of this muted British drama about raw grief from actor turned director Joseph Millson. It stars Sarah-Jane Potts as Anne, a woman in her 40s travelling alone in Lanzarote. Dressed head to toe in black, and unsmiling, Anne stands out from the other holidaymakers. And she doesn’t talk; there is a page in the notebook she uses to communicate with the words: “I’m not deaf. I just don’t speak.”From the start, it seems obvious that Anne is selectively mute – she has stopped talking, and there is a terrible reason for this. “The bereaved cannot communicate with the unbereaved,” wrote Iris Murdoch. This is true for Anne, whose holiday read is Murdoch’s The Sea, The Sea. In her interactions with other people, she is remote, unengaged, or impatient and irritated. It’s a big ask for an actor to perform in silence, but Potts’s big, brown, intelligent eyes speak volumes.But for a film, it’s not quite enough. There are no flashbacks; instead, the audience gathers crumbs about this terrible thing that happened to Anne – a photograph in her wallet, a business card. By chance she is thrown together with Bill, a big Irish man sympathetically played by David Ganly. Socially clumsy and good-hearted, Bill is also on holiday, a trip he planned as a treat for the kids after a messy divorce. Where Anne doesn’t talk, Bill can’t stop, and there are awkward, funny moments as he blathers on. It’s an interesting idea but the script struggles to navigate the complexity of Anne’s grief and in the end it doesn’t fully hang together.Signs of Life is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsComedy filmsBereavementComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But in the 1920s, the consensus shifted.The Kenwood painting, which is in much better condition and – crucially – is signed by the artist, was the original Vermeer, experts agreed. The Philadelphia version, in which the young woman wears her hair not in ringlets but tight braids, was widely accepted to be an 17th- or 18th-century copy.View image in fullscreenThe Guitar Player, c.1675-1725, from the Philadelphia Museum of Art collection.Photograph: Philadelphia Museum of ArtBut is that the whole story? In 2023, aDutch art researchersuggestedthat the Philadelphia painting might be the painter’s own copy of the image – potentially a sensational development for an artist with only 37 acknowledged surviving paintings.As a result, the Philadelphia Museum of Arthas been conducting further testson their painting, while English Heritage, which manages Kenwood and its collection for the nation, has also tested its own Vermeer. While curators anxiously await those results, the two paintings will hang side by side in London for four months, allowing visitors to make up their own minds.While the original impetus for the dual display was the painter’s 350th anniversary in December, says Wendy Monkhouse, English Heritage’s senior curator at Kenwood, “the emergence of the discussion [over the Philadelphia painting] raised the opportunity to be able to say: ‘OK, let’s really discuss this.’ Both on an expert level, and offering the public an opportunity to become detectives and to weigh the evidence.”Comparing the works side by side offers the viewer “a rather beautiful confusion”, she says. “You can’t believe your eyes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Crucially, it’s better for the environment tooTara RussellMon 1 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareIwas 18 when I tried a menstrual cup for the first time. I was studying at the University of Edinburgh andScotland had just become the first country in the world to make period products freeto those who need them. The university health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t resist a freebie.I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak, run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often than I cared to admit.When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no going back.Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water, place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.The Mooncup revolution: ‘People were revolted by what we were doing’Read moreThe benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk of tampons or sanitary pads, andsteer clear of the toxic chemicals that are common in many tampons. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone, last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced since using a cup.I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic, packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every month.They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a lifesaver.The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch. More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and I haven’t looked back since.Explore more on these topicsMenstruationThe one change that workedWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)Health & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My husband has had to give up work to look after him butAvivais refusing to pay out under our critical illness policy.We’ve been paying £60 a month for the cover since 2007.Our son was born in 2008and diagnosed withspinalmuscularatrophy with respiratory distress(SMA-RD) when he was eight.He managed well in mainstream school until June last year, since when his health has deteriorated significantly and he has paralysis in all four limbs.We contacted Aviva in January to discuss our eligibility for a claim. We were transferred between three departmentsand waitedmore than three-and-a-half hours. An adviser repeatedly stated that he did not meet the criteria, but would not tell us what the criteria were.We twice requested copies of our policy documents, but they were never received. We raised a formal complaint about their communications in Februaryand our consultant submitted medical reports.In late June, our claim was denied. Its argument is that SMA-RD is a genetic conditionthat would have been present at birth, while his cover on our policy only started on his first birthday.I suppose that is why Avivahas reported £1bnoperating profit in the first half of this year.NL,BelfastInsurers look upon human suffering through the lens of terms and conditions, and cold hard cash. It has to be this way – they are businesses. But commerce does not preclude compassion and this was shamefully lacking in Aviva’s dealings with you.Despite the urgency of your circumstances, it took five months to reach a decision. The email trail you sent me shows your repeated pleadings for updates.Your critical illness policy automatically covers children once they reach their first birthday. The terms and conditions do, indeed, state that illnesses that are present from birth are not covered and that symptoms must not have started when the cover begins.You sought advice when your son was one as he wasn’t meeting certain developmental targets, but all the tests came back negative. It took another seven years before he was diagnosed with SMA-RD.The Financial Ombudsman Servicestates that it usually upholds complaintsabout claims rejected because of pre-existing conditions of which the customer was unaware.It also says that it overrides exclusions in insurers’ terms and conditions if the customer had only general symptoms when cover began, and could not reasonably have foreseen that they would later give rise to a claim.There are many reasons why a one-year-old may miss generalised development milestones and most aren’t incurable diseases. I therefore put it to Aviva that you could have had no way of knowing that your infant son had a serious condition that would lead to a claim 15 years later. I suggested that, given the complexities and the timescales, it was rejecting the claim unreasonably on a technicality.I was startled by the speed of Aviva’s response. Within two days it had told you that, although it considered your claim had failed to meet its terms and conditions, it would pay you the full £10,000 allowed by your policy. It freely acknowledged that its about-turn had been prompted by my intervention. The money was in your account a few hours later.It says: “We fully acknowledge that our service and communication did not meet the standards our customers rightly expect from us. The family’s situation should have prompted a more urgent and compassionate response.“While we are unable to approve NL’s son’s claim because of the terms of the policy, we recognise the unique circumstances of this case and the shortfalls in our service, and believe that it is appropriate to make a goodwill payment that is equivalent to the benefit the family would have received had the claim been eligible.”Saga left me in the lurch over home insurance coverRead moreComing up to scratchMost companies get it right most of the time. Most put it right when they don’t. And some exceed expectations so magnificently they deserve a shout-out.“I have a £73 pair ofCocoonssunglasses that fit over ordinary glasses,” writesLRof Colchester. “I have macular degeneration and UV protection helps slow this. My puppy got hold of them and scratched the lenses. I rang the company to ask if this would damage the UV protection, and was told that, under the terms of the warranty, I could get a new pair by paying £2.99 for postage.“I said that I did not think that a four-month-old German shepherd counted as ‘normal wear and tear’, but a new pair duly arrived.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

It’s the first cousin to okonomiyaki in that it’s a crisp cabbage pancake, but with cooked rice as the main ingredient; after that, however, it’s up to you what you put in. I like to make this mini mushroom version because, miraculously, my children eat it. And the secret to a super-crisp pancake? A good gluten-free flour (I likeFreee) – the combination of flours in a gluten-free mix gives you an amazingly crisp pancake.Mini mushroom okonomiyakiI really like finely chopped kimchi and greek yoghurt on the side. After all,okonomimeans “as you like it”, which I take as a green light for “anything goes”.Prep15 minCook15 minServes2-32tbsp sesame oil, or neutral oil150g shiitake mushrooms, roughly chopped1garlic clove, peeled and finely grated2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated1½tsp flaky sea salt2eggs, beaten100g white cabbage, thinly sliced200g cooked white rice50g cheddar, roughly chopped40g gluten-free flour3 spring onions, finely slicedTo serveMayonnaiseand brown sauce, orKewpie and okonomi sauce, if you have itHeat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick frying pan, then add the mushrooms, garlic, ginger and a half-teaspoon of flaky salt. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until the mushrooms are just cooked through, then tip into a bowl.Add the beaten eggs, cabbage, cooked rice, cheddar, flour, spring onions and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the mushroom bowl, and mix well to combine.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, then, working in batches, add tablespoons of the mixture and flatten each one into a rough disc. Fry the mini okonomiyaki on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown (the cheese will melt in patches and crisp up), then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll and keep warm in a low (70C (50C fan)/gas very low) oven while you cook the rest of the mixture.Serve hot with your choice of sauces: Japanese mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce are traditional, but regular mayonnaise and brown (or, indeed, tamarind) sauce are good, too, if that’s what you have.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyVegetablesSnacksStarterCheeseRiceJapanese food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy raw celery – it has an earthy pepperiness that I find quite moreish – but I adore it in cooked form, especially with soy and garlic, and today’s recipe is a take on a wok-fried celery dish that we often eat at large banquets in Malaysia. But first, a silky, fragrant curry with tender baby aubergines and a golden coconut base that’s perfect with hot steamed rice and a scattering of fresh herbs. These baby purple aubergines are perfect for one person, and hold their structure well in a curry. I adore them.Yellow curry with baby aubergine (pictured top)This is more for a day when I’m pottering around – the paste seems a bit laborious, but I don’t believe that cooking for yourself always needs to be quick; love and care and time can also be put into the process, especially when you get this golden, rich and nourishing curry at the end.Prep20 minCook40 minServes1200ml coconut milk1 tbsp coconut oil3 babyaubergines, cut into 4cm chunks4–5 curry leaves¼ tsp ground turmeric½ tbsp fish sauceJuice of ¼ lime, or to taste½ tsp palm sugar, or brown sugar1 pinch of salt¼ tsp MSG(optional, but lovely)For the paste1 small shallot,peeled and chopped1 small thumb of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 tsp)1 small thumb of galangal, chopped (about 1 tsp)½ stalk lemongrass, tender part only, finely sliced1garlic clove,peeled and chopped1 dried red chilli, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes, drained and chopped1 small fresh red chilli,chopped¼ tsp belacan(shrimp paste), dry toasted until crumblyTo serveSteamed jasmine riceDill sprigsCrispy garlic(optional)Put all the paste ingredients in a blender and blitz to a rough paste; if need be, add a splash of water to help it along.In a small pan, reduce the coconut milk on a low-medium heat until it thickens and starts to split slightly – this will help bring out its natural oils and sweetness. In a second pan, heat a little coconut oil, then fry the aubergines in batches until golden and soft. Transfer to a rack or plate lined with paper towel to drain any excess oil.In the same pan, fry the curry leaves in a touch of oil until they start to pop, then add the paste and cook gently on a medium heat, stirring continuously, for five to seven minutes, until fragrant and the oil begins to split – this is when the magic happens. Add the turmeric and fry for another 30 seconds.Stir in the reduced coconut milk, season with the fish sauce, lime juice, a little sugar, salt and MSG, if using, then taste and adjust until it hits that beautiful balance of salty, sweet, sour and creamy. Return the aubergines to the pan and simmer for a few minutes so they soak up all that rich flavour. Serve with steamed jasmine rice and topped with fresh dill and crispy garlic.Chinese-style spicy garlic celeryView image in fullscreenJulie Lin’s Chinese-style spicy garlic celery.Once you get the knack of the timings, you can switch up the flavourings to whatever you fancy; if you want a more floral version, say, add some fried ginger. Again, this is a dish bursting with flavour and something I make for myself when I need something green with a satisfying crunch.Prep10 minCook15 minServes12 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine3 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp white sugar2 tbsp vegetable oil1 bunch celery, sliced on an angle5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely diced1 tsp cornflour, mixed with 3 tbsp water to make a pasteSalt and white pepper1 tsp Malaysian crispy prawn chilli, or crispy chilli oilIn a small bowl, mix the rice wine, soy sauce and sugar.Put the vegetable oil in a wok on a high heat, then add the celery and stir-fry for a minute, until a little translucent. Add the garlic and stir-fry for two to three minutes, until fragrant, then add the rice wine, soy and sugar mixture, followed by the cornflour paste, and stir-fry until everything thickens slightly and all the flavours come together. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and ground white pepper.Finally, stir in the crispy prawn chilli or crispy chilli oil, make a few final tosses, then serve piping hot.The Chinese-style spicy garlic celery is an edited extract from Sama Sama: Comfort Food from my Malaysian-Scottish Kitchen, by Julie Lin, published by Ebury at £28.

I’ll always look back fondly on the fun and community of growing up in a football familyRohan SathyamoorthyMon 1 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 00.02 EDTShareMy dad made sure my two younger brothers and I were raised in aChelseahousehold; the shed at the back of the garden was, we were told, where Arsenal supporters belonged. Growing up, we went to all the games at Stamford Bridge, competed in our local little league as though it were the Premier League, and followed Dad to the pub to watch Sunday matches (the cheeky chips and J2Os were at least half of the allure).I’m pretty sure I’m 12 years old in this photo and closing in on the peak of my sporting career, as I got ready to play football at a nearby park with my siblings Jevan (then nine) and Kiran (just four). Although we didn’t always have the money for the expensive new kits every season (I’m sure you can spot my mismatched camo shorts), we always hadsomethingChelsea to wear. My dad would often dodge the high ticket prices by taking us to watch the women’s team play, as well as the under-21s, where you would witness great talent at a fraction of the cost.My favourite childhood outfit: ‘I was an innocent Muslim girl – and a walking endorsement for ecstasy’Read moreOne of my most memorable football moments was the extraordinary6-0 Chelsea victory against Arsenal in 2014, which I got to enjoy alongside our extended family from the local area. In south-west London, particularly my area of Worcester Park, there has always been a strong Chelsea tradition as a result of the movement of working-class households out to the suburbs in response to overcrowding in inner-city areas like Kensington. This gave the area a strong football culture, which my family was more than happy to be a part of. Now, as a new generation is priced out of the suburbs, that community risks being broken up and dispersed across the country, where I’m sure it will find new places to call home.Even though we’ve all grown up a bit since (it’s certainly been a few years since I’ve been to Stamford Bridge or donned a Chelsea shirt), I’ll always look back fondly on the childhood memories, even as our old kit finds its way from the back of my cupboard to a high street charity shop. Today, Dad still goes every Saturday to coach the little league team I joined almost a decade ago, where my youngest brother, Kiran, has taken my place. Even after a torn ligament left him with limited capacity for the sport, my father is still as committed to his club as ever. My hope is that one day I can give my future children their own memories to cherish, as he has done for me.Explore more on these topicsFashionMy favourite childhood outfitFamilyChelseaLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It improves the muscle adaptation response to the exercise, which leads to growth in size, strength and lactate tolerance.Is it true that … you need to lift heavy weights to build muscle mass?Read moreThat said, Crouse adds, if you’re just a casual gym-goer (doing resistance training three or four times a week), it’s better to focus on consuming three balanced meals in the day, and choosing healthy snacks, before you start stressing too much about when you consume things. “Go back to the basics of carbs, protein and veggies on your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates first,” she says.And if you do like to have a snack after working out, it doesn’t need to be a protein shake. “A large glass of milk has really high protein content, as do those chicken satay skewers that you often get in a meal deal,” says Crouse. “Having something like a chocolate milkshake, which contains both carbs and protein, is good. Co-ingestion of carbohydrates and protein leads to greater net muscle protein synthesis.”Explore more on these topicsFitnessIs it true that …Health & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That may sound familiar, but a shared love of tea is where similarities between Turkey’s Rize province and the UK start and end. In fact, this corner of the country feels more like a mythical land, a fairytale mix of mist-shrouded mountains and dramatically plunging valleys cloaked in impenetrably deep, dark forests.Despite the dramatic landscapes, international tourism has never really taken off here. Running between the eastern edge of the Black Sea and the rugged Pontic Alps, just shy of the Georgian border, it’s been a tricky spot to reach, historically (a bus journey of about 19 hours from Istanbul – though an airport opened in 2022, which cuts this to two hours).View image in fullscreenI became intrigued by Rize when researching a book on the world’s best road trips. I spent weeks cruising the globe’s highways, country lanes and mountain passes via Google Street View. When I reached Turkey, I noticed a long green belt running along its northern coastline and discovered a land of dense tea plantations, cliff-hugging roads, roaring rivers and wooden villages.Curious to find out more, I convinced a friend to come on a road trip to the Fırtına valley, home to some of the region’s most spectacular scenery (as well as being its most accessible area – large swathes are serious wilderness and should only be visited with a guide).View image in fullscreenFog rolls over the Kaçkar mountains, which rise above the Black Sea coast.Photograph: Ali Eobanoglu/AlamyRize is the name of both the province and its capital city, an unassuming coastal hub. We decide to prioritise our time in deep nature, so head straight for the mountains in our hire car rather than lingering in town. As we head east towards the Fırtına valley, our route is lined by the shimmering turquoise waters of the Black Sea on one side and rolling tea plantations on the other, where the steep hillsides are dotted with workers gathering leaves into wicker baskets strapped to their backs. Rize has been Turkey’s leading tea-producing region since the 1940s. It is the country’s wettest region, but rain tends to dissipate quickly during the summer months, leaving thin wisps of mist trailing across the hilltops.After about 20 minutes, we reach the mouth of the Fırtına River. The name translates as “stormy” and its waters crash along the rocky riverbed. The further along it we drive, the more ferocious it becomes; the valley sides loom over us, their steep slopes blanketed in dense forests (apparently home to a growing population of brown bears).The further we drive, the more ferocious the river becomes and the higher the valley sides loom over usAfter half an hour, we reach Çamlıhemşin. The town skirts the riverbanks precipitously, cradled by towering, mossy cliffs. We wander along its main street as the sun sets, passing a few tea houses, bakeries and shops selling honey and local cheese.Dinner is at theÇamlıhemşin cafe-restauranton the river, where we feast on chargrilled chicken skewers, white bean stew in a rich tomato sauce, and hunks of bread. With the help of Google Translate, our waiter proudly tells us that the loaf is homemade.View image in fullscreenA bakery in Çamlıhemşin.Photograph: Hester UnderhillAfter dinner, a staggering series of hairpin bends leads to our accommodation:Dudi Konağı, a towering stone mansion that clings to the valleyside. Once one of the grandest private homes in the region, it was built in the early 1900s by the Tarakçıoğlu family, who made their fortunes in Russia. Today it’s a 24-room guesthouse with restored timber panelling, carved stone fireplaces and rustic wooden furnishings. We’re ushered up to our room on the third floor, where we fall asleep to the sound of a nearby stream and the soft croaking of frogs.The next day, we head off deeper into the valley, towards the lofty, snow-capped peaks of the Kaçkar mountains. We trace the course of the river, passing thundering waterfalls hidden within corridors of beech and chestnut trees, and stone bridges that date back to the early years of the Ottoman empire.We trace the course of the river, passing thundering waterfalls hidden within corridors of beech and chestnut treesOur first stop is Zil castle, a 14th-century fortress that rises above the thick forest canopy. Historians believe it was constructed by the empire of Trebizond, an offshoot of the Byzantine empire that thrived along the Silk Road. For centuries, Zil castle guarded a critical mountain pass that connected inland routes with ports on the Black Sea, watching over caravans carrying spices and silks between Europe and Asia. Today, it’s a miraculously preserved masterpiece of medieval engineering, with sweeping panoramic views across the valley.As we press on, we spot a colourful new addition to the landscape: rhododendron bushes. These plants, bursting with bright purple flowers in early summer, are responsible for one of the region’s more unusual delicacies,deli bal(or “mad honey”). The nectar of this native variety of rhododendron contains a neurotoxin that slows the heart rate, is said to pack a hallucinogenic punch and has aphrodisiac properties. The honey is among the world’s most expensive. With the land too steep and rugged for regular agriculture, beekeeping is big business here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This relative isolation has helped keep its distinctive language, culture and traditions alive. One age-old custom is black hive beekeeping, which involves hoisting hives high into the branches of hornbeam trees, so they are out of the reach of greedy bears.View image in fullscreenA young tea picker in Rize, which is Turkey’s leading tea-producing region.Photograph: Can Yalcin/AlamyAs we edge out of the Fırtına valley, the road turns to a rocky track and snakes upwards into the Kaçkar mountains. We head deeper into the clouds until we’re enveloped by thick mist. Our final stop, Elevit, is a small mountain hamlet, which perches prettily on a high-altitude plateau. People only live here in the summer months to tend their livestock, then descend to the towns when the snow arrives. It’s still quite early in the year and the village is eerily quiet. The mist adds to the mysterious atmosphere: shuttered wooden chalets appear ghost-like through the haze; a technicolour blanket of wildflowers has a thin, dewy sheen.Behind the fog lie the high peaks of the Kaçkars. An extension of the Caucasus, the range extends 620 miles along Turkey’s Black Sea coast, making them more than twice as long as the Pyrenees. While it’s possible to hike here without a guide, it’s not advisable. The area isn’t properly set up for day hikers; paths through the rugged terrain aren’t marked clearly. Had we more time, we would sign ourselves up for a guided trek – offered by the likes ofMontisandTwo Ararat– to explore the untamed wilderness of lofty peaks, glacial lakes and mountain pastures. But with our road trip set to continue over the border into Georgia, our exploration into the Kaçkars ends in Elevit.View image in fullscreenMuch of the region has a surprisingly alpine feel.Photograph: Murat Nergiz/AlamyA hidden delight on Turkey’s Turquoise Coast: my cabin stay amid olive trees and mountainsRead moreWe drive back to Çamlıhemşin with dusk casting an amber glow over the valley, the river below glinting like a ribbon of steel between the darkening trees. We end our day playing backgammon (ortavla) in a dimly lit, wood-panelled tea house that feels like a working men’s club. The clientele sip tea from tulip-shaped glasses as their wooden counters clack speedily across the board.The proprietor asks us what we make of his region. “Güzel,”(beautiful) we tell him. He gives us a wide grin and nods. It’s easy to understand why this place inspires such fierce pride in those who call it home. Rize is not packaged for mass tourism, and that’s precisely what makes it worth exploring – a place that still feels wild, where ancient cultures live on, and the tea is always hot.Accommodation was provided byDudiKonağı(dudikonagi.com); rooms from€140 a nightB&BExplore more on these topicsTurkey holidaysRoad tripsFood and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Glass Air is a lighter, slimmer and cheaper version of theGlass gen 2and is arguably the low-cost TV Sky should have launched first, coming in three sizes starting at £309 or just £6 a month on 48-month interest-free credit with £20 upfront.As with its pricier siblings, Glass Air requires a Sky subscription for full use, which costs from £15 a month for the Essential TV pack. It will function as abasic smart TVwith streaming apps,an aerialand its three HDMI ports, but you would not buy any Sky TV without the intention of paying for its TV-over-broadband service.Glass Air is best thought of as a cut-down version of Glass gen 2. It has the same service and internal smart hardware but lacks the integrated soundbar, aluminium body and has a different screen, making it a fraction of the weight and thickness.View image in fullscreenThe slim plastic frame is available in a choice of three colours with matching remote.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIt also means all it needs is a power cable and an internet connection, be that via wifi or ethernet – no aerial or satellite cable required – and just one remote for all of your TV, streaming apps and services combined. It also has Sky’s voice-control system with integrated mics, so you can turn it on, search, control the volume and playback by simply saying “Hello Sky” followed by your command. You have to speak up a bit but it works well. Alternatively, you can press and hold the mic button on the remote and speak into that.The 60Hz screen is a bright and crisp 4K LCD panel with HDR support, but it lacks the superior local-dimming backlight technology present in Glass gen 2 and other higher-end TVs. That means the picture has one brightness across the whole scene, reducing the difference between light and dark areas. As a result, some high-contrast scenes look less dramatic and lack a little depth, while bright landscapes can look a little bleached out.Despite this, the television does a good job of displaying an engaging picture, looking great with everyday TV shows and doing a solid job with bright animation or moody movies.View image in fullscreenGlass Air has three HDMI ports, an optical port, two USB ports, ethernet and an aerial socket, but only needs power and wifi to actually work.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 15W stereo speakers are surprisingly good for a thin TV without a soundbar. They can get loud enough to fill medium-sized rooms and produced clear vocals at anything up to 90% volume, which can’t be said of most TV speakers.They lack bass and any attempt at surround sound, but are certainly good enough for watching Bargain Hunt or the Premier League. You can use one of the three HDMI ports to connect a soundbar for more immersive sound, although you will need to raise the TV otherwise the soundbar will block a portion of the screen.Sky OSView image in fullscreenThe modern Sky interface puts all of your content, whether live or on-demand, in one easy to use system.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne of the biggest advantages of Glass Air compared with similarly priced budget TVs is that the software running on it is actually good. Sky OS hasimproved dramatically over the last few yearsand runs well on the Glass Air.It combines live broadcast with on-demand content seamlessly through its excellent playlist feature, which makes keeping track of your shows and films easy. Watching live TV, pausing it and rewinding it works great. Almost every major streaming service is supported, including BBC iPlayer, ITV X, Channel 4, Apple TV+, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+ and Discovery+.Glass Air also supportsAirPlay 2for sending content from Apple’s various devices and Bluetooth for connecting a set of headphones for private listening.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe TV switches to a screensaver before turning off when not used for a set time, detecting your presence through motion sensors in the remote.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe television isrepairable apart from the screen. It contains recycled plastic and solder. The company will recycle its old products and ships the TV in plastic-free packaging.PriceThe Sky Glass Air is available in three sizes with upfront costs of £309 for 43in, £509 for 55in and £649 for 65in. It is also available on 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans costing from £6 with a £20 upfront fee.The minimum required Sky package is Essential TV costing from £15 a month, which includes Netflix and Discovery+, with many other combinations of entertainment, movies, kids and sports channels available on 24 or one month rolling plans.VerdictSky Glass Air is a solid budget television with all the advantages of Sky’s pay-TV over broadband service built in.It is slim and light with stereo speakers that are far better than most slender TVs. It has a decent 4K picture that is bright and colourful, although it lacks a little contrast here and there. The physical bits of the TV are essentially good enough. Where it trounces other budget rivals is in the service and software, which is miles better than most low-end smart TVs.Of course you have to pay a monthly subscription for the privilege, but for those looking for Sky pay-TV you are not getting a worse software experience on a cheaper television. And it still has the genuinely great all-in-one convenience of every TV and streaming service in one box with one remote and just power and internet required.You can get better-looking mid-range TVs discounted to around this price if you shop savvy. But the Glass Air is great for the money and stands out against the sea of unremarkable budget TVs at this end of the market.Pros:all-in-one streaming and pay-TV device, decent vocals, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, great software, excellent search and playlist functions, all major streaming apps, voice control, custom picture modes.Cons:no local dimming means lower contrast, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, no Chromecast support, requires subscription.View image in fullscreenThe TV slots on to two metal prongs on a sturdy plastic stand with no tools required or it can be wall-mounted instead.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGadgetsTelevisionSky (Media)Sky (Business)reviewsShareReuse this content"

A high-profile case of federal racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking against the rapper Sean Combs returned a verdict only on lesser charges.At the same time, some men accused of sexual misconduct or harassment have made their way back toward the spotlight – Donald Trump is in the White House, comedian Louis CK is headlining a national tour, and formerNew Yorkgovernor Andrew Cuomo is running for New York City mayor.For Kaja Sokola, Weinstein’s youngest sexual assault accuser, it is a tough moment to speak out as a victim.“I believe they are a setback for #MeToo, and I believe that it is very important right now for people to speak out,” she told the Guardian. “For people that are being abused, the most important message I can send is that you don’t have to go to court to get justice – but you need to talk to other people.”Sokola knows about disappointment in the face of US justice. She says Weinstein raped her twice, in 2002 when she was 16, and in 2006 when she was 19. At trial in June, Sokola, now 39, testified about the alleged 2006 rape. Sokola testified that she had gone with her older sister to a meeting with Weinstein when he took her to a hotel and raped her.The jury found that the charge relating to Sokola’s claim had not met the burden of proof required for conviction. But the jury found Weinstein guilty of raping accuser Miriam Haley and were hung on a charge relating to accuser Jessica Mann – the charge that may now be retried.After Weinstein was found not guilty on the Sokola charge in June, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg apologized to Sokola for the verdict and thanked her for her bravery.“Without the courage of survivors like you, prosecutors like us cannot pursue accountability and justice,” he said. He added that the case was “about an immense power imbalance”.Sokola has had time to consider the events of that time. Her sister had turned over to the defense personal writings from a spell in rehab when Sokola was treated for alcoholism and bulimia that did not mention the alleged Weinstein rape among a list of men that had abused her. The sisters are not on speaking terms. “No, and I will not [speak to her],” she said.“I was terrified that Harvey’s lawyers could crush me, so that’s why I didn’t write about it.” A former friend had also testified that Sokola and Weinstein had been together earlier, throwing off the timeline of her account.“The trial, from what I understand, was more about proving the point that people who thought they were untouchable are not untouchable,” Sokola said. “I’m pleased that I came forward for people to hear my story, and prosecutors decided that it was a case. The jurors are a whole different story.”She said she identifies with Cassie Ventura, who testified at length in the Sean Combs case. Sokola too had been in a long, abusive relationship. In Sokola’s case, that became a custody battle with her husband of seven years that a UScourt foundhad subjected her to “severe, unrelenting psychological and physical abuse”.“I really connected with Cassie’s story, because I think people don’t really understand right now how difficult it is to step out of a relationship that’s abusive,” she said. “That’s why I have so much empathy for Cassie. I met Harvey when I was 16; she met Sean when she was 19. We were just kids.”The picture Sokola paints of young women like her coming to the US at the time is in keeping with stories of that era in the 2000s. The fashion industry wanted to cast eastern European and Brazilian models, and model agencies readily delivered.“I was definitely the type for that. But I think sending a 16-year-old to cities like this is inappropriate.”What she found was not necessarily what she anticipated. Models would be encouraged to go nightclubs by promoters who were often also models. Two New York nightclubs of the time, Seraphina and Butter, were mentioned at trial.“Everyone knew about what was going on. It was not a secret. The first time I went out for dinner, at Seraphina, I was like, ‘Oh my God, someone is paying for my dinner. They’re so generous. How lucky!’ It was only later that I understood the trade and I changed my perspective.”“The [modelling] agencies are like pimps for rich people,” Sokola now considers.Weinstein, who denies the allegations against him, is currently in jail on Rikers Island in New York, and faces sentencing on 30 September on the Miriam Haley conviction, which could add 10 years to the 16-year sentence he received from a separate sexual assault conviction in California. But the New York sentencing will only happen if there is no retrial on the Jessica Mann rape charge.Weinstein’s defense team told the Guardian their client is not willing to plead guilty to raping Mann to avoid a fourth trial.“At some point this becomes a little too much,” said Weinstein crisis PR Juda Engelmayer. “The prosecution had a hard time making their case last time, and they’ll have a hard time the next time around. Harvey is more than ready for his next day in court.”But Sokola’s part is done – she can’t be called again to tell her story in court. And she has come to terms with that.“He’s probably going to die in jail. I’m not 16 any more. I’m 39, and I can stand my own ground. I think I’m good with whatever it is right now. It was like the closing of a chapter.”Explore more on these topicsHarvey WeinsteinNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

They also said the children could face peril and abuse if they were returned to Guatemala.District judge Sparkle Sooknanan’s order halting deportation of the children applies for 14 days while the case is pending. It covers potentially hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors who have been in US custody after crossing the southern border.Trump returned to the White House in January in part on a promise to deport more migrants than his predecessors. Courts have found that at least some of his accelerated deportation efforts violate constitutional rights to due process.The children had crossed into the US unaccompanied by their parents or guardians, in many instances to stay with relatives already in the country, and are by law entitled to heightened protections while their asylum and other immigration claims are processed.Explore more on these topicsGuatemalaUS immigrationTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They knew there weren’t many. Hunting, loss of habitat, conflict with cattle ranchers and other issues had pushed the population to the brink of extinction.Ceballos and his team from the National Alliance for JaguarConservation(ANCJ) thought there were maybe 1,000 jaguars across the country. They decided to carry out the country’s first census of the animal to find out exactly how many there were. They found 4,100.“It was a great surprise, terrific news,” Ceballos said. “Obviously 4,000 means the species is still in danger of extinction, but 4,000 is a lot better than 1,000.”Fast-forward 15 years and the news has got even better. The group’s latest census found that in 2024 there were 5,326 jaguars in Mexico, a 30% increase compared with 2010.“The fact that the country has managed to maintain and increase its population over the last 14 years is extraordinary,” Ceballos said. “For me it’s great news for the country. Mexico and the world need good news.”The census took place over 90 days across 15 states, using 920 motion-capture cameras and involving nearly 50 researchers as well as local community leaders. Researchers looked at an area of 414,000 hectares, making it the largest census for any mammal in Mexico.Jaguars were found across the country, with the largest number in the Yucatán peninsula region (1,699), followed by the south Pacific area (1,541), north-east and central Mexico (813), the north Pacific (733) and the central Pacific coast (540).View image in fullscreenA jaguar in the jungle of southern Mexico.Photograph: Mardoz/AlamyCeballos credits three main factors for the population increase: maintaining natural protected areas where jaguars can roam freely, reducing the conflict between cattle ranchers and jaguars, and a publicity campaign that has put the jaguar on the map.“Before when we started, the jaguar was virtually unknown,” Ceballos said. “Right now it’s one of the most well-known species” in Mexico.Still, at the current rate of population increase it would take 25 to 30 years for the jaguar to no longer be considered at risk of extinction in Mexico. Ceballos and his team aim to reduce that time to just 15 years.There are many challenges in their way. Deforestation and loss of habitat continue to be a major issue: Mexico has lost 600,000 hectares of forest and jungle in the last six years. In the Yucatán peninsula alone, the country loses 60,000 hectares of forest and jungle each year, vastly reducing the areas in which the jaguar can live and hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He hopes to work with social media companies to have pages marketing such products taken down.The construction of new highways is a continuing challenge. Not only do they fragment a jaguar’s territory but they increase the risk of the animals being run over. This can be mitigated by building specific points where animals such as jaguars can cross safely.There is continuing conflict with cattle ranchers, and the spread of diseases from domesticated animals also poses a threat to the jaguar population.Ceballos said a greater financial commitment to conservation from the federal government was needed, as well as support from the private sector, from scientists and from landowners to protect areas where jaguars may be living, if they were to meet their goal.“We are winning a battle in a war that is being lost. But it is a very important battle,” he said. “It gives us hope that if we articulate the right policies, we can achieve great results.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoEndangered speciesConservationWildlifeMammalsAnimalsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That effort has been boosted by the global upheaval caused by US president Donald Trump’s tariffs and other foreign policy changes.Among the attendees is India’s leader Modi, onhis first visit to China in seven years. The two nations had long traded hostilities over a Himalayan border dispute, trade, and China’s support for India’s rival Pakistan.But the meeting on Sunday, five days after Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, showed the relationship was thawing.Xi said China-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, state media reported.Xi, Putin and Modi were seen chatting on live footage, the three leaders flanked by their official translators. In his remarks on Monday, Putin also praised the efforts of China and India “aimed at facilitating the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis”.Many of the assembled dignitaries will be in Beijing on Wednesday to witness amilitary parademarking 80 years since the end of the second world war. The event will also be attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.On Monday, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi said that the summit had issued a statement calling for the international community to uphold the “correct” perspective on world war two and said that SCO members had fought side by side in that conflict.In recent months China has highlighted its role, alongside the Soviet Union’s, in defeating Japan and Germany in the second world war.Analysts will be closely watching for any formal meeting between Putin, Xi and Kim. North Korea’s assistance to Russia’s war is believed to have rankled Xi, who is trying to balance its Russian alliance with avoiding any further punitive responses from the US over the war in Ukraine.“It is publicly known that North Korean soldiers are already present on the Ukrainian battlefield, and Russia and North Korea have close military cooperation. If all three were to meet, it would be very striking to the United States, highlighting a potential new cold war dynamic,” said Lim Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo.“If such a meeting does not take place, it is likely because China does not want to overly provoke the US while maintaining a certain degree of triangular ambiguity.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingVladimir PutinAsia PacificRussiaIndianewsShareReuse this content"

Officers were also patrolling the city to “protect” citizens and give a sense of security, a police spokesman told broadcaster Kompas TV.Indonesian students and civil society groups called off protests on Monday, citing fears of a crackdown by authorities.Protests first erupted a week ago, sparked by anger over the pay and privileges given to lawmakers, including a housing allowance of 50m rupiah ($3,075), which is nearly 10 times higher than the minimum wage in Jakarta. Anger escalated further after a motorcycle taxi driver, 21-year-old Affan Kurniawan, was run over by a police vehicle at a protest site on Thursday.A video apparently showing his death prompted an outcry against the security forces.Witnesses told local television that an armoured car from the National Police’s mobile brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators, hitting Kurniawan and running him over. Kurniawan had reportedly been trying to complete a food delivery order at the time.Prabowo has promised an investigation into his killing, and pledged to help his family. Seven officers have been detained for further investigation.View image in fullscreenPresident Prabowo Subianto meets the family of Affan Kurniawan, a ride-hailing driver Affan Kurniawan who was run over and killed by police during protests in Jakarta on Thursday.Photograph: BPMI Presidential Secretariat/Cahyo/Sutantaaditya.com/ShutterstockThe death toll from riots rose to six after the Amikom Yogyakarta University confirmed the death of 21-year-old student Rheza Sendy Pratama in protests on Friday. The circumstances around his death remain unclear.At least three people were killed in the eastern city of Makassar on Friday after a fire was started by protesters at a council building.Another victim died in Makassar on Friday after he was beaten by a mob on suspicion that he was an intelligence officer, local disaster agency official Muhammad Fadli Tahar told Agence France-Presse on Sunday.Protests have taken place in multiple, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java, and Medan in North Sumatra province.Prabowo reiterated that his government respects freedom of expression as guaranteed in Indonesia’s constitution and international conventions.“But when demonstrations turn anarchic, destroying public facilities, endangering lives, and attacking private homes or public institutions, this becomes a serious violation of law,” he said.Prabowo cautioned that violent acts risked veering into treason and terrorism, and warned “the state would not tolerate attempts to destabilise the country”.The homes of political party members and state buildings have been targeted by looters, including a house owned by finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, according to state news agency Antara reported on Sunday. She was not in the house at the time and it was not clear if she uses the property often, Reuters reported.The crisis forced Prabowo to cancel a planned trip to China for a military parade commemorating the end of the second world war.TikTok, which has more than 100 million users in Indonesia, temporarily suspended its live feature in response to the protests.The Alliance of Indonesian Women, a coalition of women-led civil society groups, said it had delayed planned protests at the parliament on Monday, fearing a crackdown by authorities. “The delay is done to avoid increased violent escalation by authorities ... the delay takes place until the situations calm down,” the group said in an Instagram post on Sunday.Student groups also delayed a protest on Monday, with one umbrella group saying the decision was “due to very impossible conditions”.With Associated PressExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaPrabowo SubiantoAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Of this tax, 70% would to go to reducing state debt and the remaining 30% to funding drug and alcohol support services.“By legalising the sale of products (as we already do via prescription) and charging an excise, just as we do with alcohol, we allow Victorian adults to exercise freedom of choice; remove an unnecessary regulation/barrier in requiring a prescription, break the business model of criminals and collect desperately needed tax revenue for our state to pay down Labor’s debt,” the motion reads.Economic modelling commissioned by the drug research and advocacy group the Penington Institute, published in July, showed a regulated adult-use cannabis market couldinject $10bn into Victoria’s economy over a decade.That same month, the Penington Institute also releasedYouGov pollingthat found 57% of Victorians support allowing “adults to buy cannabis legally – similar to alcohol – but with stricter safety and regulatory controls”.The chief executive of the Penington Institute, John Ryan, welcomed the conference motion, saying measures to reduce drug harm and improve community safety “should be above politics”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kennett also set up a drug advisory council led by David Penington, for whom the Penington Institute is named.The Victorian Liberals’ policy forums committee – made of rank-and-file members – also have put forward several motions, including reforms to the Heritage Act to “prevent the misuse of heritage protection that can impede housing development”.They also call for changes to planning laws to create a uniform set of standardised planning controls tied to zoning categories. These changes would replace various local policies and overlays with a single standardised set of rules – a move welcomed by housing advocacy group Yimby Melbourne.“It’s a great signal that the Liberal party is beginning to recognise that there is a problem with the local opposition to housing we desperately need,” lead organiser Jonathan O’Brien said. “Bringing down red tape is traditionally a Liberal idea, right?”The policy forum committee will also move a motion urging the federal Liberal party to introduce 52 weeks of paid parental leave, with 26 weeks paid at a full wage and the remaining 26 at the national minimum wage. This would include a “daddy quota” that would give the second parent a non-transferable four-week leave entitlement to use within the year.Other proposals are not dissimilar to those put forward at recent Queensland and Western Australia conferences. They include a push to abandon net zero by 2025, reverse a federal ban on live exports, “protect sport for women and girls” and a reject gender or diversity quotas.A motion put forward by the Mornington-Mt Martha branch also calls on a future state Liberal government to scrap Labor’s rental reforms, which allow tenants to have pets, make minor modifications without consent and require electrical and gas inspections by landlords every two years. They said the changes had “pushed many landlords to sell their properties”.The Victorian Liberals’ administrative committee, including party president, will also be up for re-election at the state council.In a statement, a Victorian Liberal spokesperson said: “Motions proposed and considered at State Council are not binding on the State Parliamentary Party, and will be considered and responded to in the usual way.”Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsVictoriaCannabisLiberal partyParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

I thank Laurent for his years of service.”Freixe took over the chief executive role in September last year after Nestlé, which owns consumer goods brands including KitKat chocolate, Häagen-Dazs ice-cream and Nespresso coffee capsules, ousted his predecessor, Mark Schneider.Bulcke, who Nestlé announced in June is set to step down as chair next year, said Navratil was “recognised for his impressive track record of achieving results in challenging environments”.He said Freixe’s successor was “renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style. The board is confident that he will drive our growth plans forward and accelerate efficiency efforts. We are not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance.”Navratil began his career with Nestlé in 2001 as an internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America, he was appointed country manager for Nestlé Honduras in 2009.He assumed leadership of the coffee and beverage business in Mexico in 2013, and transitioned to Nestlé’s coffee strategic business division in 2020. He moved to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined Nestlé’s executive board on 1 January this year.In September 2023, the chief executive of the oil multinational BP resigned afterfailing to reveal relationships with colleagues.Bernard Looney was subsequently formally dismissed from his one-year notice period for serious misconduct after an investigation by the BP board and its advisers found he had knowingly misled his fellow directors when they sought assurances regarding his disclosure of past relationships and his future behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the past five years, he said, the climate emergency had caused more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse €32bn (£28bn) in material losses.“We need to mobilise as a society against climate change, which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies,” he said. “Climate change kills. It kills. And that’s why we have to be aware of everything it represents in terms of insecurity and in terms of the risks it poses to our lives.“The climate change denial that’s coming from an important part [of society] – and which is growing as a result of the lies spread on social networks by some members of our political class – is as incomprehensible as it is worrying.”Spain wildfires are ‘clear warning’ of climate emergency, minister saysRead moreHe proposed a series of initiatives including a state civil protection agency to coordinate crisis responses, a network of climate refuges across the country and arethink of forest management and land use. Only by acting now, he said, could the country hope to avert similar disasters or reduce their impacts.“The biggest opportunity we have right now is to avoid this tragedy – and to do that, we need to do as a US president once advised when he said that the moment to fix your roof is when the sun’s shining and not when it’s raining,” he said.“I think he was right because thesesixth-generation firesthat have burned through more than 300,000 hectares in our country aren’t put out in summer; they’re put out in winter and in autumn. They’re put out by working all year.”Other measures in the socialist-led government’s “state pact to address the climate emergency” include funds to prepare for, and rebuild after, climate-related disasters, improvements to firefighting capacity, a plan to increase water resilience in the face of floods and droughts, and initiatives to fight rural depopulation and thus help keep the land clear of combustible material.Sánchez said farming would also play an important role in fighting the climate crisis, pointing to the benefits of extensive agriculture, careful grazing and efficient irrigation. The final two measures are promoting a “civic culture of prevention and reaction” and accelerating the green transition.The plan will be approved in cabinet on Tuesday and put out for public consultation.Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezClimate crisisWildfiresEuropeClimate science scepticism and denialExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the officers then appears to strike them in the face twice. It is unclear from the footage whether the police officer intentionally targeted O’Brien’s face.A Berlin police spokesperson confirmed that authorities were aware of the incident and said the officer had been identified.“We as the Berlin police are reviewing whether the officer acted proportionately, and we’re doing it as part of a criminal investigation on suspicion of bodily harm on duty,” the spokesperson said.O’Brien was treated by the Berlin fire brigade for unspecified injuries, police said. The activist is being investigated for insulting and resisting law enforcement officers.It was not immediately clear whether O’Brien had filed a complaint against the officer.Ireland’s department of foreign affairs said senior officials and its ambassador toGermany, Maeve Collins, had conveyed “concern” to German authorities about the incident.Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said the video footage obliged the Irish government to take action. “They had to take it seriously. It was two very violent assaults … It’s shocking. The German police are just horrendous when it comes to Palestine activism.”Lawlor said a fundraiser had been launched for O’Brien. “I understand they are still in hospital and will be out of work for a period of time.”Activists protested outside the German embassy in Dublin on Saturday. Catherine Stocker, a councillor with the Social Democrats and an aunt of O’Brien, said injuries included a broken arm and nerve damage.“What you have here is a bunch of mostly young Irish people standing up for international law and standing up for the people of Gaza and Palestine, which has effectively been made illegal to do in Berlin at this stage,” shetoldRTÉ.Stocker urged the Irish government to tell the German authorities that the police behaviour was “completely outside the bounds of democratic practice”.The German foreign ministry declined to comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Media reports said “Yallah, yallah intifada” and “From the river to the sea” were heard. Last year a Berlin courtconvicted an activistfor leading a chant using the latter phrase four days after theHamas attackson Israel.“During the operation, there were insults, physical attacks and acts of resistance against police officers,” the police added.Officers temporarily detained 94 people and police initiated 96 criminal investigations on suspicion of acts including “using symbols of unconstitutional and terrorist organisations, attacks on law enforcement officers, insulting behaviour and bodily harm”.Clashes between police and demonstrators at pro-Palestinian rallies are a common occurrence in Berlin, where local authorities have accused activists of creating an “aggressive atmosphere” and accosting police.However participants and observers have repeatedly reported what they have called excessive and unprovoked attacks by police against pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the German capital.Explore more on these topicsProtestGermanyEuropeIrelandPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warGazanewsShareReuse this content"

If you go back to the European foreign policy leaders in the history of the nuclear deal, Javier Solana, Cathy Ashton, Federica Mogherini, Josep Borrell, they all tried to liaise betweenIranand the US.“They tried to prove they were credible negotiating partners. But now the Europeans have decided to be the proxy of the US and Israel. It is absolutely irresponsible of them to hand over that role to the US.”He highlighted theclaim by Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, that Israel was doing “the dirty work … for all of us” by attacking Iran’s nuclear sites in June. “In a way, all of the European countries condoned what Israel did, and very likely provided information to the Israeli regime,” Baghaei said.His remarks may be designed to put pressure on European capitals to distance themselves from the US and tone down the conditions they have set before they will agree to defer UN sanctions.Baghaei also said the Iranian government was not constitutionally able to block Iran’s withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) if the Iranian parliament went ahead and passed a law withdrawing from it in response to the European reimposition of UN sanctions. Withdrawal from the treaty was the prerogative of parliament, he said.The number of MPs backing an NPT withdrawal bill is due to be revealed on Tuesday but MPs said the measure was likely to be rushed through parliament with overwhelming support. Withdrawal from the NPT would mean the UN loses all rights to oversee Iran’s nuclear programme and would inevitably raise US concerns about whether Iran will build a nuclear bomb covertly or overtly.The powerful factions in the parliament seem convinced that Iran has the firepower to inflict heavy damage on Israel in the event of a second western attack.“We are prepared because this is a matter of our dignity and sovereignty,” Baghaei said. “I think you in the UK had your blitz spirit when attacked by Nazi Germany. We have the same spirit because we knew this war imposed on us in the middle of negotiations was so unjust.”View image in fullscreenA billboard in Tehran of nuclear centrifuges and the sentence: ‘Science is the power, and the Iranian nation will not abandon its religion and knowledge.’Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAThe three European signatories to the original nuclear deal – France Germany and the UK – notified the UN last Thursday that they intended to use their right to reimpose UN-wide sanctions at the end of September unless Iran met three conditions: a return of UN weapons inspectors to the bombed Iranian nuclear sites, the handover of details of the whereabouts of its 400kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and agreement to open talks with America on the future of its nuclear programme.Europe says there is still room for diplomacy in the coming four weeks to reach an agreement on these conditions. Baghaei described the European conditions as “a sign they are not serious and they do not have good faith”.He said: “There is an extreme trust deficit between the UN weapons inspectors fromIAEA and Iran. There is a real concern that the information gathered at the sites by the IAEA would end up being passed on to Israel.“It has been a real concern especially after the highly politicised approach of the IAEA. We cannot ignore the fact that previous IAEA reports were abused by America and Israel to craft the resolution to the IAEA board which claimed that Iran was not in compliance with its obligations.” He said that resolution was used as a pretext for theIsraeli attack on Iran in June.He conceded that Iran’s room for diplomatic manoeuvre at the UN in the next month was limited because of the public mood in Iran.“The fact is our public is outraged because of the unlawful attacks on our facilities and as a government we have to be accountable to our people and to our parliament,” he said.“The western media goes on about our cooperation with the IAEA and stockpiles, but the western public has to remember the outrageous [acts] committed by Israel and the US. They torpedoed the diplomatic process, they attacked the rule of international law because our facilities have been under inspection 24 hours a day for throughout the past three decades.”Iranian officials insist that the aim remains to reach a compromise in the next month that will allow the weapons inspectors to return. Iranian diplomats have given assurances to the IAEA that the stockpiles have not been moved. They also insist they are willing to speak to the Americans, but repeated messages sent to Washington have not been met with any response so far.Baghaei said Iran was willing to reduce the purity level to which it enriched uranium back to 3.67%, the level set in the old nuclear deal, so long as an overall agreement was reached that preserves Iran’s right to enrich uranium domestically.He questioned why the US was so intent on removing Iran’s right to enrich if, as Trump claimed, Iran’s ability to undertake such enrichment had been already destroyed by the joint US-Israeli attacks.Explore more on these topicsIranIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Those who own land would be offered “a digital token” by the trust in exchange for rights to redevelop their property, to be used to finance a new life elsewhere.Those who stay would be housed in properties with a tiny footprint of 323 sq ft – minuscule even by the standards of many non-refugee camp homes in Gaza.It was not clear if the plan reflects US policy, and neither the White House nor the State Department responded to the Washington Post’s request for comment. But the prospectus seem to reflect Donald Trump’spreviously stated ambition to “clean out” Gaza and redevelop it.Among critics of the leaked prospectus was Philip Grant, the executive director of Trial International, a human rights group based in Switzerland, who called the plan “a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as development”.“This is a blueprint for mass deportation, marketed as development. The outcome? A textbook case of international crimes on an unimaginable scale: forcible population transfer, demographic engineering, and collective punishment,” Grant said.Trial is one of fifteen groups that havepreviously warned that private contractors operating in Gazain collaboration with the Israeli government risk “aiding and abetting or otherwise being complicit in crimes under international law, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide”, and that they may be liable under several jurisdictions.“Those involved in the planning and execution of such a plan – including corporate actors – could face legal liability for decades to come,” Grant said.Even in the Israeli media the proposal invited incredulity, with a column in the left-leaning Haaretz describing it as “a Trumpian get-rich-quick scheme reliant on war crimes, AI and tourism”.Far-right Israeli politicians and settlers discuss luxury ‘Gaza riviera’ planRead moreThe highly fanciful prospectus – subtitled “From a Demolished Iranian Proxy to a Prosperous Abrahamic Ally”– appears to have been drawn up by people with no physical knowledge of Gaza, the politics of the Middle East or the likely challenges in attempting to rebuild the territory as a multibillion-dollar tourism and technology hub that would inevitably compete with Israel.The scheme, described as requiring no US funding and intended to be funded by investors to the tune of $100bn, envisages a bustling port city bisected by a watercourse and bordered by up to eight leafy AI-powered high-tech megacities, apparently modelled afterSaudi Arabia’s troubled Neom project.It also envisages an “Elon Musk” manufacturing park located – without irony – on the ruins of theErez industrial zone, which was built with Israeli investment to exploit cheap labour in the Palestinian territory and subsequently closed and destroyed by Israeli forces.Examination of the map appears to suggest the plan would also involve the expropriation for an Israeli security buffer zone of much of Gaza’s agricultural land, which tends to be located at Gaza’s periphery close to the border with Israel.The small print is most damning, however, making no distinction in terms of sovereignty between Gaza, Israel and Egypt, suggesting no consideration has been made for Palestinian self determination. Under the plan, Israel would maintain vaguely defined “overarching rights” over Gaza “to meet its security needs”. There would be no Palestinian state but a “Palestinian polity” which would joinTrump’s Abraham Accords.The entire language in the prospectus, and labelling of several features, appears aimed at appealing to the vanity of Trump, Musk, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, for whom the security ring around Gaza is named.According to the Boston Consulting Group, quoted by the Post, work on the document was not approved and two senior partners who led the financial planning had been fired.That criticism was echoed by HA Hellyer, a senior associate at the Royal United Services Institute who suggested that the details of the plan were so clearly ludicrous that the proposal should not be taken seriously at face value.“It’s insane. What is important is what the plan points to, and that is not a new idea: the Israel determination that there should be no Palestinian sovereignty or self determination in Gaza.“The US has made clear since February [when details of plans for a Trump Riviera in Gaza first emerged] that they are OK with the idea of ethnic cleansing in Gaza.“The notion that this would be about ‘voluntary departure’ when Palestinians in Gaza have no choice but to be shot or starved.”Katherine Gallagher, a senior lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, said that “any company that aligns itself with Israel – and seemingly, Trump – in a plan to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their homes in Gaza is opening itself up to significant legal liability at home and under universal jurisdiction”.The CCR recently sued the Trump administration for records of its funding of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the private outfit overseeing aid distribution in Gaza and at whose sites hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while queuing for food.The prospectus was leaked days after Trump held a White House meeting to discuss day-after planning for Gaza attended by the former British prime minister Tony Blair, who has contributed views on Gaza’s future to the Trump administration and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The leaked plan was also rejected by senior Hamas official Basem Naim who said: “Gaza is not for sale.“Gaza is part of the greater Palestinian homeland.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Of those who voted, 86% supported the resolution. The resolution states that “Israel’s policies and actions inGazameet the legal definition of genocide in article II of the United Nations convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide (1948).”The three-page resolution passed by the body calls on Israel to “immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of the population.”Theresolutionsaid the IAGS recognised that “since the horrific Hamas-led attack of 7 October 2023, which itself constitutes international crimes”, the government of Israel had engaged in systematic and widespread crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, including indiscriminate and deliberate attacks against the civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, homes and commercial buildings, of Gaza.Melanie O’Brien, the IAGS president and a professor of international law at the University of Western Australia, said the resolution was “a definitive statement from experts in the field of genocide studies that what is going on on the ground in Gaza is genocide”.Founded in 1994, the IAGS has a broad membership that includes academics, historians, political scientists and human rights activists. It has adopted previous resolutions identifying genocide, including historical cases such as the Armenian genocide.As a former IDF soldier and historian of genocide, I was deeply disturbed by my recent visit to IsraelRead moreThe 1948 UN convention, drafted in the aftermath of the Holocaust, defines genocide as acts committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. It obliges signatory states to act to prevent and stop such crimes, which may include killing members of a group, inflicting serious harm, imposing destructive living conditions, preventing births or transferring children by force.There was no immediate response from the Israeli foreign ministry.Israel is fighting allegations at the world’s top court, the international court of justice, of committinggenocide in Gaza. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) hasissued arrest warrantsfor Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, but withdrew it after he was killed.At least 31 people were killed on Monday, more than half of them women and children, as Israel launched strikes across the Gaza Strip, according to health officials.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Powerful tremors were shaking his small house in Piran village, in Afghanistan’s Kunar region, and he could see the walls beginning to crack.“I jumped out of bed and rushed to where my children and parents were sleeping,” Jan said. “I managed to rescue two of my children and brought them outside to safety. I went back inside to save my younger siblings, but as I did the roof and walls collapsed around me.”As themagnitude-6 earthquakehit eastern Afghanistan late on Sunday night, Jan found himself buried in the rubble of his own house. As much as he tried to claw at the debris, he struggled to push his head through the wreckage. It took villagers five hours to finally free him. When he finally broke through, he was greeted with scenes of tragedy and devastation.His wife, two sons and two brothers were among the dead after the powerful earthquake had razed entire villages across the region to the ground. In the poverty-stricken, mountainous terrain of Kunar, most homes in the affected villages had been made only of mud, giving people little defence from the debris and floods caused by the earthquake when it struck as they slept. Most homes lay in piles of rubble or had been washed away entirely.View image in fullscreenDamaged buildings in Kunar.Photograph: EPA“It felt as if the entire mountain was collapsing on us,” Jan said. “Our village has been completely devastated and residential areas wiped out.”The official death toll stood at 800 on Monday evening, with more than 2,500 injured, and was widely expected to rise significantly. Many in the villages of Kunar remained unaccounted for and rescuers continued to pull bodies from the rubble as all local hospitals declared a state of emergency.The Taliban, who took control of the country more than four years ago when its internationally recognised government collapsed, dispatched helicopters but many areas remained impossible to access.0:46Rescue efforts after Afghanistan earthquake kills more than 800 – videoSanaullah, another resident of Kunar province, had been away from his village when the earthquake struck. When he travelled back on Monday, he found that his house had been reduced to rubble and his brother had been killed alongside his five children. “It is the story of each and every house here,” he said. “Everyone I know here has lost at least three to five family members.”Abdul Rahim, a cleric in Kunar, said graveyards in Mazar valley in Kunar were now overflowing with the dead. “Everywhere people are crying and embracing one another following a mass funeral,” he said. “The death toll is so high that graveyards are overflowing, and local people are busy digging graves in advance as bodies arrive every half hour.”Many of those affected were critical of the rescue efforts by the Taliban, which was widely seen to lack the resources, manpower and funds to deal with a crisis on this scale. Since the Taliban retook power in 2021, it has become increasingly difficult for NGOs to operate in the country, particularly amid the draconian ban on women’s employment and education, and most foreign governments have withdrawn aid from Afghanistan, now one of the poorest countries in the world.View image in fullscreenAfghan men search for their belongings in the rubble of a collapsed house.Photograph: ReutersSohail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesperson, called on international organisations to step in and offer assistance in the wake of the disaster. “Many villages are not accessible yet,” he said. “I fear the casualties are very high.”One resident from the Maza Dara area, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely, criticised the Taliban rescue efforts. “There are women and children pleading for help but there are no authorities present to help them,” he said.“Everyone is trapped under the rubble and we are helpless and seeing them dying in front of our eyes,” he added. “There is no one here to help those buried and alive in the debris.

There were landslides and flooding.The earthquake was shallow, taking place close to Earth’s surface, which is known to cause greater destruction. Several aftershocks were reported throughout the night and into Monday morning, which could even be felt in the capital, Kabul, more than 100 miles away.The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the death toll had exceeded 800 by Monday afternoon and that rescue efforts were continuing to recover those trapped beneath mud and debris. However, those efforts were hampered as roads to affected areas were destroyed or blocked by rubble from the earthquake, and the terrain of the region is steep and treacherous.The death toll is expected to rise significantly as local hospitals reported being inundated with casualties, and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. Medics at the provincial hospital in Asadabad in Kunar described the situation as an overwhelming crisis, with new patients arriving every few minutes.MapRasheed Khan, a 40-year-old cloth merchant in Kabul originally from Kunar’s Watpur village, said his wife, children and brothers were among the dead. “It’s doomsday for me. I have lost my wife, three children and two brothers, and I don’t know what has happened to my other relatives and fellow villagers,” he said while returning to his native village from the capital.“I fear thousands still remain trapped under the rubble, and I don’t know if they will be saved or not,” Khan said.Afghanistan’s defence ministry said it had dispatched 30 doctors and truckloads of medicine to Kunar to assist local hospitals, according to the state-run Bakhtar news agency.The Taliban urged humanitarian organisations to assist with rescue efforts in areas that could only be reached by air because of the landslides and flooding. Officials emphasised the urgent need for field hospitals, medical aid, rescue equipment, shelter, food and clean drinking water.Since the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 and installed a hardline regime – including heavy restrictions on women’s employment and education – there has been a significant withdrawal of foreign aid and assistance to the country. This has pushed the country’s healthcare system to the brink of collapse and severely undermined its capacity to respond to disasters.Jeremy Smith, the country manager for Afghanistan for the Red Cross, which is taking part in the rescue operation, said the remote location of the earthquake made efforts particularly challenging. “There have been repeated aftershocks and more are feared in the coming days,” he said.Kunar is a poor, mountainous region where homes are primarily constructed of mud and rocks. The epicentre of the earthquake was close to the bustling trade city of Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan. Swaths of the city’s buildings are low-rise and informal constructions, mostly made of concrete and brick, which are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.Muhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar’s Nur Gul district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, were killed in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the rubble.“The poor people in this area have lost everything,” he said. “There is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof there are dead bodies. The mud houses have been wiped away and destruction is everywhere. People are desperately seeking help.”There were reports that some remote villages were yet to receive any rescue assistance due to damaged access routes. Rescue workers in Nur Gul said a journey usually of two hours to reach one village, Masood, was now taking eight while many other villages could be accessed only on foot.Nearly everyone in Masood has lost family members, and many people are believed trapped under the rubble. Rescue workers said the death toll could be as high as 250.In Laghman province, officials reported at least 30 injuries, mostly among women. Tremors were also felt in Nuristan, but damage assessments there are still pending.The disaster comes with Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, already in the midst of a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the suspension of US foreign aid earlier this year, which has forced hospitals and health clinics to shut down.The country is also grappling with the impact of the forced return of more than 2 million Afghan nationals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. According to the United Nations, more than half of Afghanistan’s 42 million population is already in need of humanitarian assistance.China said it was ready to provide disaster relief assistance “according to Afghanistan’s needs and within its capacity” and India said it had delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food material to Kunar, with more to be sent from Tuesday.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said its mission in Afghanistan was preparing to help those in areas devastated by the quake. Pope Leo sent condolences for the dead.Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. A series of earthquakes in its west killed more than 1,000 people last year.Amagnitude-6.3 earthquakestruck Afghanistan on 7 October 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated that at least 4,000 people died. The UN gave a far lower death toll of about 1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanEarthquakesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The legal age to bet is 18.In a second study, based on focus groups with children aged 13-17, 16% reported seeing content creators sharing links and sign-up codes for gambling operators, while 14% reported seeing them sharing betting tips and tricks.The reports warned about content produced by mainstream UK operators as well as unlicensed sites promoting newer or unregulated products associated with video gamessuch as “skins betting”and“loot boxes”.Both involve the use of in-game digital items that have value to players and can be traded, staked or won via mechanisms that replicate real-life gambling.Niks Kolosnicins, 24, developed a gambling addiction that severely disrupted his schoolwork and lasted into his university years.“I used to see a huge amount of gambling ads when watching online streamers and esports – and with my favourite influencers promoting gambling, and many of my friends regularly betting, gambling became normalised for me,” he said.Children who contributed to the study referred to seeing well-known sports stars in gambling content.The Labour MP Beccy Cooper, who has called for a new gambling act to replace 2005 legislation introduced under Tony Blair’s government, said existing laws were “failing to protect children from online gambling marketing where influencers portray gambling as socially acceptable or aspirational”.She added that “future generations should look back on this era of proliferation, targeting and sports gamblification with the same level of disbelief”.The Liberal Democrat peer Don Foster described the report as “extremely concerning” and called for greater scrutiny of gambling advertising.Heather Wardle, a professor of gambling research and policy at Glasgow University, said content seen at an early age can mean that gambling becomes “embedded deeply within social practices”.“Evidence shows there is a real risk of escalating harms among this already higher-risk age group,” she added.The previous government and Labour have taken steps to tighten up elements of gambling regulation – includingcutting the maximum stake on online slot machines to £5– but have stopped short of strict curbs on advertising.Zoe Osmond, the chief executive of GambleAware, said: “It is unacceptable that children’s environments continue to be flooded with age-restricted content.”A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “We recognise the impact harmful gambling can have on individuals and their families, and we are absolutely committed to strengthening protections for those at risk, including children and young people.“There are already a range of robust rules in place on gambling adverts, including rules to ensure adverts are not targeted at or strongly appeal to children.“We will continue to work closely with the gambling industry to ensure that advertising is appropriate, responsible, and does not exacerbate harm.”The Guardian approached the Betting and Gaming Council for comment.Explore more on these topicsGamblingSocial mediaSport bettingRegulatorsYoung peopleTikTokYouTubenewsShareReuse this content"

Only 11 councils provided full responses, yet they revealed 45,157 potentially contaminated sites, suggesting the true figure could be far higher.While most of Wales’s industrial waste legacy has never been investigated, in some places its impact is clear to see.In Ynysddu, a village in the Sirhowy valley in south Wales, waste from companies was dumped in the former Ty Llwyd quarry on the mountain above the village in the 1960s and 70s.Residents havewarned for yearsthat after heavy rainfall, foul-smelling brown and foamy liquid seeps from the quarry and downhill into the surrounding woods, council-owned land that was used by children and dogwalkers until it was recently fenced off.In 2023, testing by Dr David Megson, an environmental chemist from Manchester Metropolitan University, found unsafe levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Ynysddu. PCBs are forever chemicals that accumulate in the food chain and can cause liver damage and increased cancer risk in humans.All testing commissioned by Caerphilly county borough council to date has indicated zero level of PCBs, and the site is not legally defined as contaminated land.Megson has suggested that the council may be using tests that are not sensitive enough, or testing in the wrong places. Caerphilly council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Jane Beechy, 64, bought a plot of land at the bottom of the mountain in 2013, which she intended to use for stables. She had the land tested before she purchased it, and the results said it contained slightly elevated levels of chloroform – safe for horses, but not young children.View image in fullscreenJane Beechy with one of her miniature ponies.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianHowever, over the past decade, more frequent and prolonged periods of wet weather have led groundwater levels in the quarry to rise and sometimes flood the woodland and land downhill. Since 2018, water from the quarry has begun pooling on Beechy’s land, and she says that nothing will grow there any more.“It ruined my business plans. Who is going to keep their horses here if they don’t think it’s safe?” she said.At the Ynysddu allotments, soil samples tested positive for PCBs after Storm Dennis in 2020, when water rushed down the mountain from the quarry and the river flowing through the valley broke its banks, flooding parts of the village.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of Wales’s 22 local authorities, only six publish a legally mandated contaminated land register online, leaving communities in the dark about what may be lying under their feet.On Tuesday, Friends of the Earth Cymru called for a public inquiry into the scale and impact of contaminated land in Wales and for the UK and Welsh governments to provide councils with the resources to identify and clean up potentially dangerous sites.Its spokesperson Kirsty Luff said: “It’s shocking that so much land could be contaminated and yet isn’t being properly inspected. People in Wales deserve to know whether the places where they live, work, and play are free from pollution.“This issue must not be ignored. The longer the delay, the greater the risk to our health, our environment and future generations.”The Welsh government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The picturecould be similar across the rest of the UK. A BBC investigation suggests that of13,093 potentially toxic sitesidentified as high-risk in the early 2000s, only 1,465 have been inspected.Explore more on these topicsWalesPollutionWasteHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The former Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik, a well-respected economist,will be Starmer’s economic adviser.Economists and former government advisers welcomedthe reshuffle, suggesting it was high time for Starmer to take more interest in the direction of economic policy.Jonathan Portes, a former senior government economist, said it was always a mistake to subcontract tax and spend entirely to the Treasury. “It is a well-functioning department staffed by people who know what they’re talking about and if it’s not politically challenged by No 10 things go wrong,” he said.“Because of the way the Treasury works, it’s intellectually predisposed to do things that are not just politically counterproductive but economically counterproductive. You need somebody in No 10 to push back, and that’s in the interests of the government as a whole.”View image in fullscreenDan York-Smith is a qualified international gymnastics judge.Photograph: HM TreasuryTim Leunig, the chief economist at Nesta, who advised Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor, agreed that part of the problem had been a lack of direction from No 10. However, he suggested any number of new appointments would make little difference without a clearer sense of what the prime minister wants.“I think all this adds up to absolutely nothing, untilKeir Starmerdecides what he stands for, and what he stands against,” he said. In particular, Leunig said that would mean deciding which groups to single out to bear the brunt of tax rises – which are widely viewed as inevitable, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to downgrade its growth forecasts.“Unless Labour are willing to say: ‘We’re never going to be a good government unless we’re lucky enough to get growth,’ then they’ve got to learn to pick some losers,” he said. Another former Labour adviser said these risks were particularly grave during tough economic times, when the Treasury tends to go into “finance ministry mode” – focusing above all on balancing the books.However, Labour’s first year in power has underlined the political challenges of either cutting spending or raising revenue – particularly given the manifesto promises they made not to touch key taxes, including income tax.Business groups have reacted with fury to Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions, which has been blamed forputting the brakes on hiringandexacerbating inflation, while backbenchers forced the abandonment of £5bn-worth of disability benefit cuts. The removal of the winter fuel allowance from most pensioners was also almost completely reversed after months of damaging criticism.Memories of previous disastrously received fiscal statements abound – including George Osborne’s “omnishambles” budget and, of course, Liz Truss’s “mini-budget”, much of which subsequently had to be ditched in the face of market chaos. With bond markets already skittish, the pitfalls are obvious.As one Labour insider put it, the government’s task in the budget – which is still at least 10 weeks off, with no date yet announced – is to “fill a hole, in a way that makes it not look like they’re filling a hole”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Murray’s successor is another graduate of Bell’s former thinktank the Resolution Foundation – the MP for Chipping Barnet, Dan Tomlinson.Shafik, too, had some involvement at Resolution, serving as one of the commissioners on its landmark Economy 2030 review – although she is better known as an expert on the international economy.Margaret Thatcher famously used her economic adviserAlan Waltersas an intellectual battering ram against the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, ultimately leading to the latter’s resignation in 1989.Few at Westminster expect Shafik to play such a divisive role, however. “She’s not like an Alan Walters figure: she’s not an ideological person,” one Labour insider said.But given the political somersaults required, Portes argues that it will take serious political commitment from the very top of government to make another tax-raising budget stick. “No 10 and No 11 have to argue it out, agree, and then come out and sell it together,” he said. “And Starmer has to own it, not just Reeves.”Explore more on these topicsEconomicsKeir StarmerBudget 2025Rachel ReevesBudgetTax and spendingUK cost of living crisisanalysisShareReuse this content"

But here are five questions she will face when she does speak publicly about it.1.Where does she actually live?Rayner spends time in three properties: a constituency home in Ashton-under-Lyne, a grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House on Whitehall, and a new flat in Hove.When she bought the flat in Hove in May, she classed it as her only property, allowing her to pay an estimated £30,000 in stamp duty rather than the higher rate of £70,000.The problem with this is that she has separately listed her constituency home as her primary property, in a move which allowed her to avoid paying about £2,000 a year in council tax on her grace-and-favour apartment in London.The Ashton home has now been put fully into a trust, allowing her to remove her name from the deeds and buy the Hove flat. But she still spends a lot of her time in that house, given her children live there and it is the only property out of the three which is in her constituency.2.Why did she put the Ashton house in a trust?The Mail on Sundayrevealed over the weekendthat Rayner had put her Greater Manchester house partly in a trust in 2023, before fully selling up this year. The trust was administered by Shoosmiths, a law firm which has a private wealth team to help rich clients manage their financial affairs.Some have suggested Rayner used a trust to avoid her children paying inheritance tax when she dies. However, experts say that if she is living there at the time of her death, they will still have to pay the tax, regardless of whether it is held in trust. That implies there may have been non-tax reasons to choose a trust, including making sure that none of her children can sell their share in the house without the agreement of the others.It may be significant however that at the time the property was put in trust, its value was listed at £650,000. If it had been a pound higher, Rayner would have had to pay an inheritance tax charge at that point.3.Has she broken any tax laws?Most tax experts agree with Rayner’s allies, who insist she has not broken any actual rules. There is nothing wrong, for example, with listing one property as a primary residence for council tax purposes but another for stamp duty purposes.Some however, believe this constitutes a loophole which Rayner has successfully exploited. “I have long said we should allow HMRC to communicate with councils so they can be consistent in their tax treatment of properties,” said Heather Powell, a partner at the accountant Blick Rothenberg.But some say tax inspectors could still revisit the question of whether Rayner should have paid more stamp duty on the Hove flat.“Simply removing your name from a deed is not enough to persuade the Revenue that that is not your primary property,” said Henry Pryor, a property agent. “If you are still living at that property, Revenue could deem your new one a secondary property for stamp duty purposes.”4.Why are her arrangements so complicated?Allies say Rayner’s family life makes her finances more complex than most. She had a child aged 16 with her then partner, Neil Batty, but the relationship did not last. She then married Mark Rayner, a trade union official, in 2010, and the couple had two sons.She and Rayner split in 2020 and are understood to have divorced in 2023, which was when they put the Ashton house into a trust, of which both served as trustees. She is now understood to alternate in the house with Mark, while their children remain there permanently.More recently Rayner has entered a relationship with Sam Tarry, the former Labour MP for Ilford South. The couple are reported to have spent time together at the Hove flat.Others however point out that many of her property decisions have also had the impact of minimising tax. “These arrangements are probably legal, but Mr and Mrs Average don’t do it – they can’t afford it,” said Powell.5.How is Labour planning to change property taxes in future?One reason the revelations have particular resonance is that they come just as Rachel Reeves looks for ways to repair her fiscal black hole, with property taxes reported to be in her crosshairs.The chancelloris reported to belooking at ways to tax second homes more, whether that is through a replacement to stamp duty, or more likely, higher rates of capital gains tax.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, spent Monday trying to highlight exactly that dichotomy, talking to homeowners in Reigate about what she believes the chancellor will announce at her budget later this year.That being said, Rayner did receive backing from an unexpected quarter last week, when the Reform UK leader insisted the row was confected. “This whole sort of hair-shirt approach – most of the press want politicians in sackcloth and ashes, would like all of us to be vegan and give up drinking,” said Nigel Farage. “Well, it’s not happening here.”Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerHousingLabourStamp dutyTaxPropertykey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Smaller cities such as Cleveland, Ohio and Greensboro, North Carolina, held rallies of their own as a part of the nationwide action.The May Day Strong group, a coalition to labor unions, organized Monday’s efforts, along with AFL-CIO, the US’s largest federation of unions; the One Fair Wage, a non-profit advocating for fair wages for restaurant workers; and other labor groups.“This is about organic, grassroots organizing, and we intentionally wanted it to be outside ofWashington DC, because that’s where the impacts are being felt,” said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, about Monday’s efforts.In New York, hundreds gathered across the street from Trump Tower in the city’s Midtown district, USA Todayreported. Separate protests were held throughout New York state,including inAlbany, the state’s capital.US senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who represents New York, made an appearance at an Albany demonstration. “It’s Labor Day [and] we want to celebrate working men and people in this community,” said Gilibrand. New York state, the middle class was built on the labor movement and it’s time to recognize how important working people are to this community, to our country, to our great state,” she added.Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 residents in DC joined a protest against Trump’s federal takeover of the city,reported WUSA9. Participants of the event, dubbed the “Freedom Run”, ran and walked through DC while chanting.Christie Harlan, who took part in Monday’s run, shared her motivations for joining with WUSA9. “I feel bad for the families of the national guard members who’ve been deployed here to essentially be window dressing for this administration,” said Harlan.The Trump administration’s termination of federal employees, many who worked out of the DC area, also prompted others to take part in the run. “Firing folks left and right, some of the damage that’s being done is going to be irreparable whenever things come back,” said participant Janice Ferebee to WUSA9.Thousands also marched in the Los Angeles area early Monday, local affiliate KTLAreported. The rally was followed by a free picnic for community members, along with live entertainment.Several protests were organized in California’s Bay Area. Residents in Redwood City, about an hour from San Francisco, even formed a 17-mile human chain to Santa Clara as apart of the day’s protest, NBC Bay Areareported.Alongside the coordinated protests, workers at the Hilton Americas-Houston, one of Houston’s largest hotels, walked off the job as apart of a nine-day strike, the Houston Chroniclereported.The walkout came as Hilton failed to reach a deal with members of the Unite Here Local 23 Texas chapter, which includes the more than 400 workers at the hotel.Among several demands, workers are campaigning for a higher minimum wage of $23-per-hour, up from the current rate of $16.50. The strike, which is set to end 10 September, is the first in the union’s 25-year history, chapter president Franchesca Caraballo told the Chronicle.As thousands took part in the rallies, Trumppostedhis own Labor Day message to the Truth Social platform: a photo of himself shaking hands with workers.The image featured the caption: “Celebrating 250 years of THE AMERICAN WORKER.

Giuliani, the former New York mayor, was also criminally charged in two states; he has denied wrongdoing.Trump on his Truth Social platformcalledGiuliani the “greatest Mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot”.Rudy Giuliani hospitalized after car accident in New HampshireRead moreFor much of the past two decades, Giuliani’s public life has been defined by a striking rise and fall. After leading New York through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, he mounted a brief campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and became one of the most recognizable political figures in the country. But as Trump’s personal lawyer, he became a central figure in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Courts repeatedly rejected the fraud claims he advanced, and two former Georgia election workers won a $148m defamation judgment against him.The election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, said Giuliani’s efforts to promote Trump’s lies about the election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington DC for repeatedly making false statements about the election, and he was criminally charged in Georgia and Arizona in connection with efforts to undo Trump’s loss to Democrat Joe Biden.Giuliani, 81, was hospitalized after the Saturday night collision in New Hampshire. State police said he was a passenger in a rented Ford Bronco driven by his spokesperson, Ted Goodman, when the vehicle was struck from behind by a Honda HR-V. Giuliani suffered a fractured thoracic vertebra along with multiple lacerations, contusions and injuries to his left arm and leg, according to his security chief, Michael Ragusa. On Monday, Ragusa said Giuliani remained in the hospital but was expected to be discharged “soon”.The Medal of Freedom, established in 1963, is awarded to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the US, world peace, or cultural or other significant public endeavors.Explore more on these topicsRudy GiulianiDonald TrumpNew YorkUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They also warned that Kennedy’s leadership “should alarm every American, regardless of political leanings”.In aguest essayfor the New York Times, the former CDC leaders said Kennedy’s actions were “unlike anything we have ever seen at the agency”.The letter comes days after Kennedy sought to dismiss Susan Monarez, the CDC director he appointed just months earlier. Monarez refused to leave her post, and was later fired by Donald Trump. Monarez said through lawyers the clash came after she refused to sign off on Kennedy’s directives.RFK Jr says he’ll ‘fix’ a vaccine program - by canceling compensation for people with vaccine injuriesRead moreIn the essay, titled We Ran the C.D.C.: Kennedy Is Endangering Every American’sHealth, the former leaders, including Rochelle P Walensky, Mandy Cohen and Tom Frieden, said they were concerned Kennedy is “focusing “on unproven ‘treatments’ while downplaying vaccines” and cancelling medical research “that will leave us ill prepared for future health emergencies”.The former officials accused Kennedy of replacing “experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views”.The letter comes as theTrump administrationis pushing back on criticism of Kennedy’s leadership.The White House said last week that Trump and Kennedy aim to make the agency “more public-facing” and “more accountable,” and that they would be “strengthening our public health system and restoring it to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases, investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats”.The arguments over the direction of the CDC center in part on disagreements over vaccination policies.Monarez was reportedly fired after clashing with Kennedy over vaccine policy.In a sign that it is a debate even Trump can’t escape, the president on Mondayin a Truth Social postcalled on pharmaceutical companies to “justify” the success of the Covid vaccines that were initiated during his first term.“Many people think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives. Others disagree! With CDC being ripped apart over this question, I want the answer, and I want it NOW.”Trump added that while the drug companies “go off to the next ‘hunt’ and let everyone rip themselves apart, including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC”, they should “figure out the success or failure” of Covid drugs.The White Househas named deputy health secretary Jim O’Neill to serve as acting CDC director. O’Neill is a biotech investor and former speechwriter for the health department during the George W Bush administration. He can only serve as an interim leader of the agency until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.Following Monarez’s firing, hundreds of CDC staffers rallied outside the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta in protest. Three senior CDC leaders, Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis and Daniel Jernigan, resigned from their posts.In Monday’s Times editorial, the nine former CDC officials stepped in to Covid vaccine dispute, saying Operation Warp Speed “produced highly effective and safe vaccines that saved millions of lives” during the pandemic.“During our respective CDC tenures, we did not always agree with our leaders, but they never gave us reason to doubt that they would rely on data-driven insights for our protection, or that they would support public health workers,” they added.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationHealthVaccines and immunisationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That came after a festival-goer alerted a police officer that a man was found “lying on the ground, obviously deceased”.Part of the site was cordoned off as on-site police began investigating. Organizers with the Burning Man Project said it was cooperating with law enforcement. In a statement, Burning Man officials asked those still on the playa not to interfere with law enforcement.“The safety and well-being of our community are paramount,” Burning Man said.Sheriff Allen said “several participants in the immediate area” were interviewed.“Although this act appears to be a singular crime, all participants should always be vigilant of their surroundings and acquaintances,” Allen warned.“There is no further information available at this time but it will be released as appropriate to provide for communication, while still preserving the integrity of the complicated investigation of a crime in a city which will be gone by the middle of the week,” he added.Burning Man has become the site of unexpected attention in recent years. In 2023, it was washed out by strong rain storm that turned the desert to mud, killing one person; this year, a dust storm tore temporary structures away, including one named the “orgy dome”.The festival has previously experienced deaths, including when a man ran into the fire in 2017.Last week, Burning Man co-founder John Law made a rude gesture when he was asked to describe the festival, saying it had strayed far from its late stage counter-culture origins in the 1980s.“We were going to go out to the Black Rock Desert to just go crazy, and, you know, drive 100 miles an hour with the lights out, set bonfires and go up to the hot springs. We didn’t plan on bringing any art with us,” Law said.But he broke with the festival in 1996 when it grew large and more commercialized.“It’s a giant party for rich white people,”Law told SF Gate.“They’re selling the idea of freedom, and it’s not free. The whole philosophy, it’s a bunch of crap.” He added that the festival now demands conformity. “The star f–kers started coming around. It’s as clubby in its own way as the Elks or some hunting lodge in Minnesota.”Explore more on these topicsNevadaBurning Man festivalUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It said the Levi’s brand had “retained its attractiveness despite a tense consumer climate and declining customer frequency in the retail sector”.However, the accounts recently filed at Companies House listed one of its key risks and uncertainties was potentially changing sentiment towards US brands that could lead shoppers to develop “increasing willingness” to choose more “national or European” products.The risk was listed alongside other issues including competition from retailer’s own-label products and pressure on its department store stockists from “increased online competition and inflexible rents”.It said apparel brands were also competing with “more basic needs” and there was a risk that high inflation “has a direct impact on the willingness and ability of consumer to spend their reduced available money in apparel and fashion products”.Levi’s UK arm, which employs just over 1,600 people in the UK according to its accounts, is one of the first US brands to openly raise fears about the impact of the Trump administration on sales, in comments first reported by the Daily Telegraph.One brand that has clearly suffered in the UK is Tesla, which is led by Donald Trump’s former right-hand man Elon Musk. Tesla sales in the UKmore than halved in July, according to data from the main industry body. The electric vehicle brand’s UK market share shrank to 0.7% in July, from 1.67% a year ago.In Canada, protests against US-derived goods has been blamed for a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s whiskey, which many retailers have removed from their shelves.There have been reports ofCanadian shoppersturning US-made or owned products upside down in stores so they can be identified and avoided by fellow shoppers.

But many labor advocates say that Trump has consistently put corporate interests first in his second term as he has taken dozens of actions that hurt workers, often by cutting their pay or making their jobs more dangerous.Despite his vow to help coal miners, Trumphalted enforcement of a regulationthat protects miners from a debilitating, often deadly lung disease. He fired the chair of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog without a quorum to protect workers from corporations’ illegal anti-union tactics. Angering labor leaders, Trumpstripped one million federal workersof their right to bargain collectively and tore up their union contracts.“It’s a big betrayal,” Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the main US labor federation, said. “We knew it would be bad, but we had no idea how rapidly he would be doing these things. He is stripping away regulations that protect workers. His attacks on unions are coming fast and furious. He talks a good game of being for working people, but he’s doing the absolute opposite.”“This is a government that is by, and for, the CEOs and billionaires,” Shuler added.Trump has hurt construction workers by shutting down major wind turbine projects and ending Biden-era subsidies that encourage the construction of factoriesthat make renewable-energy products. In moves that will harm some of the nation’s most vulnerable workers, the Trump administration hasproposed ending minimum wage and overtime protectionsfor 3.7 million home-care and domestic workers. It has alsokilled a Biden plan to preventemployers from paying disabled workers less than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage.“There is a huge disconnect between Trump’s pro-worker rhetoric and the policies he’s putting in place. The gulf is enormous,” said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank. “In his second term, he’s been absolutely, brazenly anti-worker.”“I keep thinking about his taking away the Biden-era increase in the minimum wage for federal contractors. It’s unbelievably brazen,” Shierholz continued. (Trump ended the requirementthat federal contractors pay their workers at least $17.75 an hour.) “The minimum wage is incredibly popular. He just took away the minimum wage from hundreds of thousands of workers. That blew my mind.” As a result, many full-time workers will see their pay dropby more than $9,200 a year.The administration disputes all these criticisms. “The American worker has been left behind by the Democrat party for years, but President Trump has championed an agenda that puts the American worker first,” said Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary.Trump has “unleashed an economic boom”, she said. Inflation is cooling, native-born Americans are benefiting from private-sector job gains and blue-collar wages are rising fast. “Under President Trump’s leadership, Republicans are once again the party of the American worker,” said Rogers.Many labor experts say Trump is even more anti-union than Ronald Reagan, often called the most anti-union president of modern times. Reagan fired 11,345 air traffic controllers who went on strike, but the AFL-CIO’s Shuler said that “pales in comparison” to Trump’s ending collective bargaining for 1 million federal workers. “That’s the largest single act of union-busting in our history,” she said.“He is worse than Reagan when it comes to his approach to unions,” said Julie Su, who was acting labor secretary under Biden. “We saw what Reagan did in the 1980s. That began a long decline in unionization. This president wants to make America non-union again. He’s certainly trying to make the government non-union again.”Shierholz said the “absolute scale of crushing unions” under Trump is “on a whole different scale from what we saw under Reagan. Trump is saying it’s absolutely open season on union folks. He took an absolute chainsaw to the federal workforce. He’s giving the green light to the private sector and local government to do the same.”Justin Chen, president of an American Federation of Government Employees council representing 8,000 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) workers across the US, is angry that Trump halted collective bargaining for EPA employees, voided most of their union contracts and fired probationary workers. “Whatever he said about fighting for workers was a complete lie,” Chen said. “He treats federal employees with a great deal of disdain, not as civil servants valuable to make our government and economy run.”Many labor advocates say Trump’s signature policies, including tariffs and deportations, are hurting US workers. Trump’s tariffs are pushing up prices and slowing economic growth,economists say. Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax cut will harm millions of working families by cutting food assistance and causing many to lose health coverage. As for Trump’s deportation campaign, many workers say it’s undermining their employers’ businesses and forcing them to work harder because they have to do the work of their departed co-workers.In herannual State of the Unions address, AFL-CIO president Shuler said on Wednesday: “The state of working people in this country is they’re under attack.” She added: “We want cheaper groceries, and we get tanks on our streets. We want more affordable healthcare, and we get 16 million Americans about to be kicked off their coverage.” Shuler said unions will holdclose to 1,000 ralliesand other events this Labor Day across the US to kick off a year of mobilization.Jenny Smith, a home-care worker in Champaign, Illinois, said Trump’s plan to end overtime and minimum-wage protections for home-care workers shows contempt for struggling, low-wage workers. “Trump doesn’t know what it means to go to work day after day to earn a living,” she said. “If you take away these wage protections, it will take money out of these workers’ pockets. The majority of these workers are Black, brown and single mothers. You’re taking from their children’s mouths.”Smith voiced dismay that Trump hasn’t made good on his promise to reduce prices. “I’m very disappointed that prices aren’t going down,” she said. “I just bought a dozen eggs for $6.”She added: “I don’t think he cares about us, but he does care about the billionaires.”Trump has taken numerous steps that will weaken safety protections for workers. He is cutting staffing by 12% at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha). His administration has proposedeliminating a requirement for adequate lightingon construction sites. It is reducing the fines that small businesses pay for violating safety rules. It has proposed blocking the government’s mine-safety district managers from ordering upgrades in mine ventilation and safety. It has slowed action on Biden’s effort to protect workers from high temperatures.Trump alsofroze enforcement of a Biden-era regulationthat protects miners from silicosis, a serious lung disease.“Silicosis has become a major killer among coal miners, but theTrump administrationis trying to make silicosis great again,” said David Michaels, a professor of public health at George Washington University who headed Osha under Barack Obama. “The Trump administration has taken several steps that are devastating to the safety and health of the nation’s workers. Osha, which is under-resourced and underpowered, has become significantly smaller as a result of the Trump and Doge [Trump’s unofficial ‘department of government efficiency’] cuts.”Michaels warned that Trump’s cuts to Osha penalties will reduce incentives for companies to ensure safe conditions.Missouri’s governor signs repeal of state’s guaranteed paid sick leave lawRead moreAdministration officials point to the Trump-backed “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime” as clearly pro-worker. But Yale’s Budget Lab notes thatonly 4% of workersin the bottom half by income are in tipped jobs, while almost 40% of tipped workers earn so little they don’t pay federal income taxes.Moreover, the no-tax-on-overtime provision will reduce income taxes far less than most workers realize.The deduction applies only to the “half”in “time-and-a-half” overtime pay. If a worker earns $20 an hour and their overtime rate is $30, that worker can deduct only the $10 premium for each overtime hour, not the full $30.Shierholz said that if Trump were serious about helping workers, “he would raise the minimum wage, make overtime pay double pay and do away with the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers. That would truly help workers, but that’s not what he’s doing. He’s doing as little as possible to help workers, while helping employers.”While Trump says his deportations will create job opportunities for US-born workers, Shierholz’s economic institute forecasts that Trump’s effort to deport 1 million immigrants a year will resultin 5.9m lost jobs after four years: 3.3 million fewer employed immigrants and 2.6 million fewer employed US-born workers. “If you don’t have immigrant roofers and framers, you’re not building houses, and that means electricians and plumbers lose their jobs,” Shierholz said. “Plus, you lose the consumer spending from those workers.”Corey Mahoney, a 35-year-old cargo handler at John F Kennedy international airport in New York, said Trump’s policies have whipsawed workers at his warehouse. “The tariff situation has slowed down work, and many people lost their jobs,” he said. When Trump ended protected status for many Venezuelans and other immigrants, some of his Venezuelan co-workers left or were deported. “Some of the people I was working with tried to come to work, but they weren’t allowed,” he said. “We were left with less people, and we had to work twice as hard. It’s unfair.”“Trump is in an alternative universe thinking everything is good,” Mahoney said. “He doesn’t realize that normal people who are just trying to make a living aren’t happy with what he’s doing.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS unionsMinimum wageUS politicsWorkers' rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I thank Laurent for his years of service.”Freixe took over the chief executive role in September last year after Nestlé, which owns consumer goods brands including KitKat chocolate, Häagen-Dazs ice-cream and Nespresso coffee capsules, ousted his predecessor, Mark Schneider.Bulcke, who Nestlé announced in June is set to step down as chair next year, said Navratil was “recognised for his impressive track record of achieving results in challenging environments”.He said Freixe’s successor was “renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style. The board is confident that he will drive our growth plans forward and accelerate efficiency efforts. We are not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance.”Navratil began his career with Nestlé in 2001 as an internal auditor. After holding various commercial roles in Central America, he was appointed country manager for Nestlé Honduras in 2009.He assumed leadership of the coffee and beverage business in Mexico in 2013, and transitioned to Nestlé’s coffee strategic business division in 2020. He moved to Nespresso in July 2024, and joined Nestlé’s executive board on 1 January this year.In September 2023, the chief executive of the oil multinational BP resigned afterfailing to reveal relationships with colleagues.Bernard Looney was subsequently formally dismissed from his one-year notice period for serious misconduct after an investigation by the BP board and its advisers found he had knowingly misled his fellow directors when they sought assurances regarding his disclosure of past relationships and his future behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is also attempting to remove Cook, who isappealing against the decisionin a case that could reach the US supreme court.In court on Friday, lawyers for Cook argued that she could not be fired without the notice or “cause” required to remove a Fed governor. She learned of her attempted removal via a post on social media, they said.Sacking Cook, whose term is not due to expire until 2038, would enable Trump to nominate a replacement. However, Cook has argued that the president has “no authority” to remove her.Lagarde said it would be “very difficult” for Trump to take control of Fed decision-making on interest rates. “The US supreme court, which is largely respected in the country and therefore I hope will be respected by [Trump] as well, has clearly indicated that a Fed governor can only be dismissed in the case of gross misconduct.”Trump received backing for his assault on the Fed last week fromLiz Truss, the shortest-serving British prime minister in history, who was ousted after a meltdown in the financial markets.Leading investors and economists have said political interference damages the credibility of central banks to keep inflation under control. US government borrowing costs have risen in recent months amid concern about the impact Trump’s tariff policies could have and questions about Fed independence.Borrowing costs havealso risen across other advanced economies. The rise is linked to the uncertainty in the US, alongside investor worries about elevated debt levels in several nations and the return of inflation after the Covid pandemic, and Russia’s war in Ukraine.Long-term borrowing costs for the UK government have risen close to the highest levels in 30 years, while the yield – in effect the interest rate – on French government debt has also risen amid a political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, she signalled that Paris was unlikely to need emergency support from the IMF, playing down a suggestion made by the country’s finance minister, Eric Lombard, late last month.Lagarde said the French banking system was better placed now than it was during the 2008 financial crisis. “Countries request IMF intervention in circumstances of serious budgetary deficit or when a country cannot meet its financial obligations … I do not believe that the banking system itself is in any way the source of the current risk – but markets, in all circumstances of this nature, assess the risk.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpChristine LagardeFederal ReserveEuropean Central BankUS economyEconomicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This time there were no tears, no consolations, only the sight of a four‑times major champion dictating terms again on the sport’s biggest stage.Is record-breaking Djokovic robust enough to keep rolling back years?Read moreGauff, 21 and seeded third, is the same age Osaka was when she broke the teenager’s heart six years ago on the same court. Then, Osaka had comforted the 15-year-old wildcard in a moment that went viral. On Monday the generosity stopped at the baseline. Osaka dominated from the first ball, ripping returns and taking control of rallies before the crowd could rouse their favourite. She breezed through her opening service games with the authority that once lifted her to the summit of the sport, winning 16 of her first 18 service points, and her confident body language stood in stark contrast to the brooding, stressed figure she has sometimes appeared since her return.Gauff’s serving woes, the recurring theme of her summer, surfaced immediately. In her opening service game she fell behind 15-40, hitting a routine forehand into the net to concede the break, and never quite recovered. She served a double fault three times in the opening set, the last on set point to hand it away after only 31 minutes.By then she had sprayed 16 unforced errors, 11 of them off a forehand that was in open revolt. The Labor Day crowd, eager to lift her, swelled behind her at every pressure point, but their encouragement could not dispel the nervous energy. Osaka looked liberated, striding confidently to her chair with a one-set lead, while Gauff disappeared into the tunnel for a bathroom break.“I felt it was the best I served all tournament,” Gauff said. “A lot of aces. Yeah, there were some doubles, but I thought that was a good performance from me serving. Off the ground I just made way too many mistakes.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s disappointing for sure, but it is a step in the right direction,’ said Coco Gauff after defeat by Naomi Osaka.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThe troubles on serve have been simmering for months. After winninga second grand slam at Roland Garrosin June, Gauff endured a turbulent summer of double faults and early exits, including a first-round defeat at Wimbledon that underscored the fragility of her delivery. She arrived in New York with a reshuffled team and a newly hired biomechanics specialist, Gavin MacMillan, who helped Aryna Sabalenka to turn her own serve from liability into a potent weapon en route to three grand slam titles and the world No 1 ranking.Early rounds suggested the transition was uneven – a grinding three-setter against Ajla Tomljanovic, then tears in her second-round escape against Donna Vekic – before she steadied with a better display on Saturday in a straight-sets win against Magdalena Frech. She had spoken of embracing a long-term process rather than chasing a quick fix, but under the Ashe sun there was little sign of the assured server who had appeared only in flashes.The second set followed a similar pattern. Osaka, serving at 2-2, fell behind on serve for the first time all afternoon but rattled off four straight points to hold. In the next game Gauff opened with a fifth double fault, then unravelled in a flurry of errors off both wings to gift Osaka another break. From there the match was all but a handshake away. Osaka pounded through the closing games without fuss, sealing her progress after just 64 minutes when Gauff dumped a forehand into the net for her 33rd unforced error.The statistics reflected Osaka’s clarity of purpose. She landed only 42% of first serves but won 32 of 38 points on her racket, including 94% of first-serve points. She finished with 10 winners to 12 unforced errors, content to sit back as Gauff’s erratic play kept rallies short and prevented her famed speed from becoming a factor.For Gauff, the defeat was a sobering comedown after an uneven but promising opening week. She had hoped a remodelled service motion would hold under pressure, but five double faults and more than four times as many unforced errors (33) as winners (eight) told the story.“It’s disappointing for sure, but it is a step in the right direction,” she said. “If I kept the way I was going in Cincinnati to here, I would have been out the first round.” She admitted the past three months had taken a toll. “It’s been a tough post-French Open for me. I don’t know, I feel like I put so much pressure on myself at 21.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seeded 23rd after reaching the Montreal final last month, she has now won 10 of her past 11 matches and appears to be gathering momentum with each week. This was her 14th career win against a top-10 opponent and the third since launching her comeback last year in Brisbane.View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka (left) and Coco Gauff embrace after their fourth-round match.Photograph: Brian Hirschfeld/EPAEvery time she has reached a grand slam quarter-final she has gone on to lift the trophy – 12 wins from 12 matches at majors in the last eight or beyond – a curious statistic that now hovers over the draw. She will face Karolina Muchova in the last eight, and on this evidence she will be no one’s idea of an underdog.Her elation was evident in the on‑court interview. “I honestly just had so much fun out here,” she said. “I was in the stands two months after I gave birth to my daughter watching Coco, and I just really wanted the opportunity to come out here and play again. This is my favourite court in the world and it means so much for me to be back here.”Asked when she started believing again, she pointed to Montreal. “I had played a match there where I had to save two match points. Ever since then I thought to myself anything’s possible. You just have to keep trying and keep a smile on your face.” She added: “I’m a little sensitive and I don’t want to cry, but I want to say thank you to my team. I looked up to Coco a lot – the way she carries herself is really special – and it means a lot to share the court with her again.”Whatever comes next, Monday felt like a landmark. One of only two mothers in the last 16 alongside Taylor Townsend, Osaka has spoken about rediscovering joy in her tennis. Here she found it in real time, grinning after big points and basking in the Ashe ovation.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisNaomi OsakaCoco GauffTennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool also stepped up efforts to sign the Crystal Palace captain, Guéhi, who had a medical in London in anticipation of joining Arne Slot’s side after Steve Parish, the Palace chair, accepted £35m plus £5m in add-ons for the defender.Away the lad: how Isak’s long and messy departure from Newcastle unfolded | Louise TaylorRead moreButPalace dramatically pulled the plugon the deal when they failed to sign an experienced replacement. Liverpool had submitted a deal sheet to complete the transfer after the 7pm deadline when it collapsed. A Palace bid for Brighton’s Igor Julio fell through and a move for another higher-profile centre-back also failed to materialise.Oliver Glasner, the Palace manager, is understood to have been furious at the decision to accept Liverpool’s offer and reiterated his plea not to sell his captain during heated talks with Parish. There were even fears that the Austrian, who led Palace to their first trophy when they won the FA Cup in May, could step down after making it clear that they must keep hold of Guéhi to have a successful season.The England international is in the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park and has no intention of signing an extension. Liverpool may renew their attempts to sign Guéhi in January but he could have interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich if he becomes a free agent next summer. Parish had said after Palace’s win in the Community Shield last month that it would be in the club’s best interests to sell Guéhi rather than lose him for free.Despite missing out on their main central defensive target Liverpool managed to end the summer’s longest and most acrimonious transfer saga in their favour with the record signing of Isak. Liverpool had a £110m bid for the 25-year-old rejected on 1 August. Newcastle’s position at that time was that Isak was not for sale. However, his subsequent strike and public statements allied to their£70m signing of Nick Woltemadeand attempts to sign either Yoane Wissa or Jørgen Strand Larsen encouraged Liverpool to submit a higher offer on Sunday night.Newcastle accepted a fixed fee of £125m with no add-ons. The cancellation of loyalty bonuses to Isak means the deal is effectively worth £130m to Newcastle, who paid£55m to sign Wissa from Brentford. Wissa behaved similarly to Isak to force his move to St James’ Park.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak scored 27 goals in all competitions for Newcastle last season.Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters“I want to create history. I want to win trophies,” said Isak. “That’s ultimately the biggest motivation for me and I feel like this is the perfect place for me to grow even further and to take my game to the next level and help the team as well.“I feel like this is the next step for me in my career. I’m super happy that I’ve been given this chance and I’m very motivated to do something well with it.”The fee for Isak falls short of Newcastle’s £150m valuation but still represents a British transfer record and the second time this summer that Liverpool have broken their own transfer record. The champions paid £100m plus £16m in add-ons for Florian Wirtz in June and the Isak deal will take their total summer spending above £440m. Liverpool have recouped more than £210m in player sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He refused to play in a pre-season friendly against Celtic and did not go on Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia, citing a thigh injury. Since then he has been absent from the squad, at one stage training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, and has not spoken to the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, for more than a fortnight. Howe said pointedly on Friday that morale was strong within the Newcastle squad after a difficult opening two weeks of pre-season. Isak was part of pre-season training for only the first two weeks.The centre-forward accused Newcastle of breaking a commitment that he could leave if a suitable offer came from a big club and refused overtures from the club hierarchy to reopen negotiations over a new contract. A meeting at his home last Monday proved decisive. Isak informed a delegation that included representatives of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Newcastle’s financial backers, that he would never play for the club again. The Newcastle contingent left within 45 minutes and moves were soon made to sign Woltemade.Liverpool’s deadline-day business did not end with Isak and Guéhi. The champions accepted an offer from Aston Villa to sign Harvey Elliott on a season’s loan with an obligation to buy the England Under-21 international for £35m next summer. Liverpool also received approaches from Milan, Brighton and Palace for Joe Gomez in the final 24 hours of the transfer window but doubts over the Guéhi deal – well founded, as it turned out – meant they did not consider letting Gomez leave. Including the £35m for Elliott, Liverpool recouped £245m in transfer fees this window.Liverpool believe their central defensive options of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, Gomez and the new signing Giovanni Leoni, who is regarded as a potentially elite talent, should cover the failure to sign Guéhi.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolNewcastle UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

In New York alone, he became the oldest man in more than three decades to reach the fourth round of the US Open, then he repeated the trick by winning that fourth-round match. Djokovic’s straight-sets victory against Jan Lennard Struff established the 38-year-old as the oldest man in the open era to reach the quarter-finals of all four grand slam tournaments in a calendar year.Djokovic’s late-career achievements are unprecedented but, for a player who has won every single significant trophy, only more big trophies will satiate those boundless ambitions. Once again, he has plotted his path back to the late rounds of a grand slam tournament full of hopes that fortune will fall his way, allowing him to pull off his greatest achievement: a 25th grand slam title.Naomi Osaka dominates Coco Gauff to power into US Open quarter-finalsRead moreAfter his semi-final defeat at Wimbledon, Djokovic opted to use his time between the grand slam tournaments to focus on his family and himself rather than competing. Rust was predictably visible on Djokovic’s game during his first two rounds but since his quality four-setvictory against Cameron Norrie,Djokovic has played himself into good form. His serving has particularly been spectacular, allowing him to play the brand of efficient, attacking tennis that is essential to his continued success.The question remains whether Djokovic will be physically robust enough through two gruelling weeks of best of five sets matches to compete at a high enough level against the very best players. In Australia, Djokovic retired from his semi-final match against Alexander Zverev because of a hamstring injury. At Wimbledon, he was clearly hampered physically in his defeat against Jannik Sinner and he later cast significant doubt on the ability of his ageing body to withstand the physical strain of these tournaments.Although his playing level has been moving in the right direction, Djokovic’s first four matches have only further underlined those issues. Almost every win has been accompanied by some sort of physical issue, with Djokovic calling on the trainer to attend to his neck, shoulder, lower back and other issues. He has been frank about his uncertain physical state.“I don’t think there is much more that I could do than what I’m doing now, to be honest,” he said. “If the body doesn’t listen to me when I go deep in the grand slam tournaments, as it was kind of the case last few slams, then that’s a hard one to swallow for me, because I know the amount of hours I’m putting in daily to care for my body, but at the same time, you know, biological age is not something that I guess you can reverse, and it is what it is.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz will face Novak Djokovic in the quarter-final at Flushing Meadows.Photograph: Adam Hunger/APThe next challenge is significant. Djokovic faces Taylor Fritz, the No 4 seed and a finalist last year, a player who has made such steady improvements over the years and who will enter Arthur Ashe Stadium desperate to put together a signature win at his home tournament.At a time when his peers, the likes of Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev, are all navigating certain struggles, Fritz quietly continues to rise and eke out as much of his talent as possible. This match-up, however, is illustrative of Fritz’s shortcomings, particularly his lack of athleticism and variation. Djokovic holds a 10-0 record against the American since their first meeting in 2019, with eight straight-sets wins.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a testament to the Serb’s unprecedented success and longevity that he will still head on to Arthur Ashe Stadium as the player to beat.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Novak DjokovicUS Open tennisUS sportsTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In that interaction, Suárez put his arm tightly around Vargas’s neck before being pulled away by Sounders players as players and staff from both teams joined the melee.At one point, after being pulled away from a large group confrontation, Suárez was shown on camera berating Sounders director of security Gene Ramirez, then spitting on Ramirez as he was pulled away by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari and a Sounders staff member.The incident is the latest controversy in a long career full of them for Suárez, including biting opponents onthreeseparateoccasions, numerous high-profile instances of simulation, and other moments of overly physical play or violent conduct.In the past,MLShas handed down multi-game suspensions for spitting. Last season, Héctor Herrera was given a three-match ban for spitting in the direction of a referee – one game for the red card he received after VAR intervention, and two more from the league office.

Messi and Suárez combined in Miami’s best move of the night, but the Argentinian surprisingly put his effort from just a few yards out over the bar. Tadeo Allende, also could have equalized for Miami in the second half.Osaze De Rosario, the son of former MLS great Dwayne de Rosario, struck first in the 26th minute, and Seattle sealed the trophy with two goals in the game’s closing stages as Miami pushed numbers forward.Of chief importance in Seattle’s resistance was Vargas, the 20-year-old Alaska native who plays for Mexico’s national team. The defensive midfielder broke up numerous Miami attacks in central midfield, successfully intervening to snuff out runs from Messi and ensuring that Suárez rarely had the service he needed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the playoffs looming, here are the narratives that have defined the second half of the campaign.Caitlin Clark’s injuries reshape the FeverUnfortunately for the Indiana Fever – and their passionate fans –Caitlin Clarkhas spent most of this season in a role no one expected: as a coach from the sidelines. The 23-year-old has been limited by recurring groin injuries during the second half of the campaign.She has not been the Fever’s only casualty. On 7 August the team lost Aari McDonald, to a broken foot, and Sydney Colson, to a torn ACL. Ten days later Sophie Cunningham tore her MCL, while newcomer Chloe Bibby – signed on 1 August to a rest-of-season contract – injured her knee on 22 August.The string of setbacks has forced the club to cycle through hardship contracts and reshuffle its roster every few games. That the Fever remain in playoff contention despite such upheaval is a testament to their coaching and resilience – but whether that will be enough to meet their 2025 ambitions is another question.Natalie Nakase proves a rookie coach can winIt’s not yet clear whether the WNBA’s newest team will reach the playoffs, but the fact that the Golden State Valkyries are even in contention is among the season’s biggest storylines. The league’s first expansion side since Atlanta in 2008 entered the year with a giant lavender question mark over their heads – andhave steadily erased each doubt since.Ride of the Valkyries: how the WNBA finally found a home in the Bay AreaRead moreThe Valkyries are led by Natalie Nakase, hired away from theLas Vegas Acesafter three seasons as Becky Hammon’s top assistant. While Nakase has brushed off talk of individual awards – “Honestly, I’m just being deadass, our goal is to make the playoffs,” she told Clutch Points last week. “It should be coaching staff of the year.” – the case for her as Coach of the Year is difficult to ignore.The achievements of the Valkyries in their debut campaign will be hard for anyone else to match.View image in fullscreenThe Aces’ A’ja Wilson has averaged 23.4 points and 10.1 rebounds, anchoring the team through their slump and driving their revival.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesThe Aces are back in contentionWe are on the brink of the playoffs and somehow the Aces – who had a 5-6 record by mid-June and were playing so poorly at the beginning of July thateven Becky Hammon questioned their abilities– ended August ranked No 2 in the league with a 26-14 record and are now within reach of a championship run. And sure, this is a team coming off six back-to-back winning seasons and two titles, but saying the Aces werebadbefore the All-Star break this year isn’t an understatement.At the core of the team’s rapid ascension is the inevitable A’ja Wilson, who is averaging 23.4 points and 10.1 rebounds this season and has found new and bolder ways to carry the team in their lowest moments and inspire them at their peak. Don’t be surprised if Las Vegas end up in the finals this season.A new name in the MVP raceFor most of the year the MVP race looked set to come down to A’ja Wilson defending her crown or Napheesa Collier wresting it away. That was the prevailing narrative at the start of 2025 – and both players did plenty to sustain it.But Collier’s ankle injury in early August opened the door for another contender. Alyssa Thomas, one of the most complete athletes in basketball, has seized the moment and is showing no signs of slowing down.The Phoenix Mercury forward is averaging 15.8 points, 8.9 rebounds and 9.2 assists, numbers that only hint at her impact. Thomas has produced a league-high seven triple-doubles this season and became the first WNBA player to record at least 10 points, 15 rebounds and 15 assists in a game (her line that night was 13-12-16). She has been both floor general and steadying presence, quietly steering Phoenix from opening tip to playoff chase.The Mercury have dropped 14 games, but rarely through any fault of Thomas. Since returning from a calf injury in June, she has been unshakable – and right now, she looks like the player most capable of reshaping the MVP conversation.Liberty injuries complicate a title defenceInjuries have reshaped the season, sidelining some of their biggest stars and leaving teams scrambling to adjust.No one has felt it more than the Liberty. They lost Jonquel Jones to an ankle injury in June, then Breanna Stewart to a bone bruise in late July. Sabrina Ionescu also spent time out with a toe problem, while Natasha Cloud has been sidelined with a broken nose. If Jones’s absence was damaging, Stewart’s seemed to send New York into a tailspin. The Liberty were 17-6 and second in the league when she went down; since then, they have slipped to No 5.That slide underscores Stewart’s value – and raises the stakes in New York’s bid to repeat as champions. To defend their title, the Liberty will almost certainly need a top-four seed to secure home-court advantage and avoid a punishing early clash with the Lynx. It’s a tall order, but with their roster finally healthy again, not an impossible one.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballUS sportsGolden State ValkyriesIndiana FeverLas Vegas AcesCaitlin ClarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The goal-heavy thrillers of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp rivalry were a welcome diversion, but they always felt oddly transgressive – were wesuremajor clashes were supposed to be that much fun? In that sense,Liverpool’s 1-0 win over Arsenal on Sundayfit into a long-established tradition; in time the tedium will fall away in the collective memory and all that will remain is the majesty of Dominik Szoboszlai’s match-winning free-kick.Two other more recent traditions were observed amid the anxiety of Anfield: thatArne Slotwill always somehow find a way, and that Arsenal will always somehow come up short. Few managers have ever had such a golden touch as Slot; he has a remarkable capacity to make decisions that don’t just change the outcome of a game, but do so in an obvious and unmissable way.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreLiverpool have not been anywhere near their best this season. They havelooked open and unbalanced. They are, of course, dealing with their grief at the death of Diogo Jota. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Luis Díaz and Darwin Núñez have been sold. Five senior players have arrived, withAlexander Isak set to join that list. And yet at the international break, they standtop of the Premier League tableas the only side with three wins from three. Against Bournemouth and Newcastle, they let slip two-goal advantages and then regained the lead with goals from substitutes.AgainstArsenal, they were more cautious, perhaps overcompensating for the wildness that had characterised the opening two games. According to Opta, they mustered an xG of just 0.4 against Arsenal’s 0.5, by a factor of almost two the lowest combined xG in a game so far this season. And yet they won.There had seemed a danger before the season began that Szoboszlai would be the odd man out. If Florian Wirtz, signed for £100m (about $135m), operated behind the striker in a 4-2-3-1, it seemed reasonable to assume that the two more defensive players in last season’s midfield trio, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister, would play as the pair in front of the back four. And so, since Gravenberch returned having missed the Community Shield as his partner gave birth and the opening game of the season through suspension, it has proved. But with Alexander-Arnold gone, Jeremie Frimpong injured and Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez returning to fitness, Szoboszlai found himself drafted in as an improbable auxiliary right-back.Who, honestly, can say they thought he had the skill-set to play at full-back? But he has taken to the role with gusto and has played a decisive part in the last two wins. Against Newcastle last week, Szoboszlai looked rather more comfortable than the career full-back on the other flank, his compatriot Milos Kerkez, who has had a difficult start to life at Liverpool. Then, having been released into midfield by the introduction of Bradley, it was Szoboszlai’s dummy that created the space forRio Ngumoha’s injury-time winner. On Sunday he arced a stunning 32-yard free-kick in off the inside of the post with seven minutes remaining.Will Szoboszlai remain at right-back? It remains implausible, and yet he has already performed creditably there against two of last season’s top five. While Mohamed Salah has had a slow start – his relationship with Hugo Ekitiké is still in its infancy, and his touch looks unusually deliberate – Szoboszlai has at least started to offer the sort of precise early passes that Alexander-Arnold gave the Egyptian, something Frimpong, more of a ball-carrier, did not.Temporary or not, Slot has found a solution that has worked. He has a glorious knack of shifting games to his will. The contrast withMikel Artetais obvious. Arteta has done a remarkable job in his five and a half years at Arsenal: he has turned a drifting club into serious title challengers. They are no longer the soft touches of old, unbeaten in 22 games against “big six” sides before Sunday (although whether Manchester United and Tottenham justify inclusion in that designation remains debatable). But equally, Arteta has never won at Anfield or the Etihad.Could he be blamed for caginess given he was missing Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz, with Martin Ødegaard restricted to a role from the bench and William Saliba going off early? Perhaps not. But Arsenal have a depth of squad these days. Mikel Merino in midfield and Noni Madueke on the right are not bad options.Liverpoolwere vulnerable, yet Arsenal barely tested them. Against Manchester United and Leeds, they had been similarly passive, waiting for a mistake, and then taking advantage. Liverpool did not succumb.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg, Matt Fitzpatrick, Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka received the captain’s call. Rory McIlroy, Robert ­MacIntyre, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood, ­Rasmus Højgaard and Tyrrell Hatton qualified automatically.Charlie Woods, son of Tiger, hits second hole-in-one in 12 months at Junior PlayersRead moreThe only change in the Europe team is Højgaard replacing his twin brother, Nicolai, representing the ­biggest carryover of players in Ryder Cup history.Donald is keen to emphasise the “different challenge” requiring “different strategy” when playing away. Europe has not won onAmerican soil since 2012and endured a10-point defeatthere in 2021.“Just because we have a very similar team it doesn’t mean we are going to roll out the same pairings or the same lineup in foursomes and ­fourballs,” Donald said. “I think over a two-year period, these players do change. Their profiles change and we’ll adapt to that.“This isn’t certainly a question of rinse and repeat from Rome. I’m ­trying to come at this one quite ­dif­ferently to what we did in Rome. It’s nice to have a continuity within the team, the memories, the experiences that we got to celebrate together. When it comes to thisRyder Cup, it doesn’t necessarily mean we are going to have the same partnerships.”Donald shrugged off the widespread sense the US team gained an early advantage when their ­captain, Keegan Bradley, opted not to play. Last week,Bradley chose not to pick himselfas a wildcard,­prompting comment that the 39-year-old’s selflessness will galvanise the hosts.“There’s been a lot of intrigue about whether Keegan would play or not,” Donald said. “That was ­obviously a big storyline at his press conference on Wednesday with his picks. We understand Keegan in whatever role as a playing captain or captain, is going to bring a lot of energy and spirit to the Ryder Cup. He loves it and is very passionate about it, and whatever role he plays he’ll be very good at it.”View image in fullscreenKeegan Bradley’s decision not to play as captain of the USA team has been well received.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APAnother theme has been the likely influence of an inevitably raucous New York crowd. There have been fears voiced that Europe’s ­players may be subjected to treatment that crosses the line. “We all live in ­America, or most of us do,” Lowry said. “We have all got a lot of fans in America. I don’t think they can turn on you that badly for one week but that remains to be seen.”Donald will urge his players to enjoy the backdrop rather than wilt. “We understand what’s going to happen to us,” the captain said. “It’s our reaction to that that’s really important.“So we all have fears. We all have anxieties and we all find Ryder Cups pressurised. But these are top ­athletes that understand how to walk towards that fear. You want to embrace what a Ryder Cup represents and then part of that is embracing the crowd and embracing that atmosphere. I think certainly these guys will be ready for that.”Donald told Matt Wallace that he would not make the European team moments after the ­Englishman broke down in tears during a TV interview after the Omega ­Masters. ­Wallace knew he had fallen short of a Ryder Cup debut.“I felt very emotional for him,” Donald said. “It just shows to me what the Ryder Cup means to these guys and how they are trying to ­desperately make the team and be a part of it.”Donald will take his team to ­Bethpage for a scouting mission after the PGA Championship at Wentworth.Explore more on these topicsRyder CupGolfUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Hungarian is an attacking midfielder by trade but since Jeremie Frimpong’s injury Arne Slot has found a new role for him at right-back. Szoboszlai had clearly learned some free-kick technique from Trent Alexander-Arnold over the years but his ability in the alien position was almost more impressive. He had almost no problems with Gabriel Martinelli and he quickly adapted to Eberechi Eze, who was a greater threat than the man he replaced, but Szoboszlai remained calm and collected throughout. He was able to defend well and also produced some stunning passes, distributing long and short, changing the dynamic of the match as Alexander-Arnold used to. The victory over Arsenal will be remembered for a split second of quality but Szoboszlai should take great credit for how he has adapted to help Slot and his teammates.Will UnwinMatch report:Liverpool 1-0 Arsenal2Sesko must seize chance to step upWhen Matheus Cunha’s sprint towards the Burnley goal was curtailed by a muscle problem, it was clear Ruben Amorim had to make a change. The Manchester United head coach had two realistic options, either the exciting new £72m signing Benjamin Sesko or the often-maligned Joshua Zirkzee. He went for the latter. Many were bemused when Sesko was picked as the final outfield player to take a penalty in theshootout loss to Grimsby, but Amorim suggests the two things are connected because the striker is not fit enough after an interrupted pre-season. Amorim belatedly introduced Sesko in the 72nd minute but he did not offer much, missing a couple of good chances to find a third United goal. There is a lack of sharpness to his play and he looked cumbersome but with Cunha and possibly Mason Mount set for spells on the sidelines, there will be greater opportunities for the Slovene to get up to full speed. United cannot afford to be patient with him.WUMatch report:Manchester United 3-2 Burnley3VAR denies King a crowning momentJosh King thought he had his dream moment. A dart down the inside-left channel, a piece of skill to throw off Tosin Adarabioyo, a deceptive finish to beat Robert Sánchez. It was the 18-year-old Fulham midfielder’s first senior goal and it was rather brilliant. The bungling officials, of course, had other ideas. They found a spurious reason to chalk it off, penalising Rodrigo Muniz for a non-foul in the buildup. “He’s going home not understanding why the goal was disallowed,” Marco Silva said of King. Most people shared Silva’s view. They also agreed with the Fulham manager’s assessment of King as a top talent. Away from the refereeing controversy, it was worth dwelling on the youngster’s performance againstChelsea. King has been given his opportunity this season, the departure of Andreas Pereira making space for him, and he looks ready. He is bright, quick and clever on the ball. King’s potential is some consolation for Fulham after an undeserved defeat.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Chelsea 2-0 Fulham4Trafford still adjusting to City No 1 roleOther than the result, James Trafford had a very good afternoon. It was his weak pass to Nico González that gave Tottenham their second goal last weekend, but against Brighton it looked as if he had made enough saves to earnManchester Citya point. He saved well from Kaoru Mitoma in the first half, and then he made an exceptional save from a deflected Jan Paul van Hecke effort near the end. But within a minute, Brajan Gruda was jinking round him to roll in the winner. Trafford’s pass completion of 77% was an improvement on the previous two weeks – remarkably so, given he played 17 long balls – but the bigger issue is his starting position. He does not sweep up behind the back line as Ederson does – few goalkeepers do – and that is contributing to City’s vulnerability to balls played behind their defensive line. While Trafford is only 22 and may develop that skill, he does not at the moment look like the right keeper for them.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Brighton 2-1 Manchester CityView image in fullscreenBrajan Gruda goes around the Manchester City goalkeeper James Trafford and defender Rayan Aït-Nouri to score Brighton’s winner.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images5Iraola is a manager going placesThere is so much to admire aboutBournemouth. After a summer in which Andoni Iraola rebuilt his defence after the departures of Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi to Real Madrid, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, his side’s performance in the deserved victory at Tottenham on Saturday suggested the Cherries will be a force to be reckoned with again. It’s a credit to Iraola – who potential suitors will have noted held talks with the club’s owner, the American billionaire Bill Foley, about extending his contract beyond the end of this season but has yet to commit his future – that the dominating £34m centre-back Bafodé Diakité has settled in seamlessly into the Spaniard’s system. Iraloa revealed Bournemouth were still hoping to add another defender on deadline day having previously held talks with Chelsea over a deal for Axel Disasi. “We’ve lost Dean and Zabarnyi so we need another central defender,” said Iraola. “But if not, we still have options, and we will deal with the situation, but it’s true that we are working on it.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Tottenham 0-1 Bournemouth6Leeds show their mettle in defenceIt said much for the paucity of quality on display at Elland Road that all the talk centred on those who were not playing, rather than who was. Both teams failed to ignite, with Newcastle’s Alexander Isak again absent and Nick Woltemade not registered in time to play after his £69m club record move from Stuttgart. It is now three games without a win for Eddie Howe’s side and the visiting fans made their feelings about Isak clear with one particularly vicious chant. Better news is that the 6ft 6in Woltemade should make his debut after the international break when Wolves visit on 13 September. Leeds have scored only once this season but have taken four points from three games and not lost in the league at home for almost a year. The midfielder Ilia Gruev lauded the hosts’ attitude. He said: “This performance showed we’re not scared of anything. We played with courage and self-belief from the first minute to the last.”Ross Heppenstallskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another slow start to the season, another summer where outgoings exceed incomings. This time last year, Pedro Neto departed. Now, Jørgen Strand Larsen wants to leave for Newcastle – although there is an insistence from the club that he must stay. The Norwegian missed theEvertongame through injury and was much missed. Sasa Kalajdzic came on as a late sub but, as Vítor Pereira remarked, the Serb is coming back from 560 days out with a knee injury and “can play 15 or 20 minutes”. Pereira was not shy in asking for more recruits before the transfer window closes. “We need someone, a solution in attack and we need a solution in midfield,” he said, adding: “I understand the supporters.”John BrewinMatch report:Wolves 2-3 EvertonView image in fullscreenVítor Pereira applauds the fans at Molineux but knows his Wolves side require reinforcements.Photograph: David Davies/PA8Le Fée on the money once moreAt 5ft 7in, Sunderland’s French midfielder Enzo Le Fée cuts a diminutive figure in increasingly loftyPremier Leaguecircles but his first touch is sensational, his ability to read the game superb. In scoring an equalising penalty and helping create Wilson Isidor’s 96th-minute winner, Le Fée ruined Jordan Henderson’s Wearside homecoming. It might have been different had Sunderland’s excellent Netherlands Under-21s goalkeeper Robin Roefs not saved Kevin Schade’s penalty, but Brentford failed to heed the warning issued when Anthony Taylor awarded that kick after Reinildo hauled Nathan Collins down. Taylor pointed immediately to the spot after Rico Henry dragged Habib Diarra to the floor. Referees are supposed to be getting tough on grappling so it was good to see this edict actually enforced. Cue Le Fée helping Sunderland overturn the lead Igor Thiago’s header briefly gave Brentford, who clearly missed their absent, unsettled striker, Yoane Wissa.Louise TaylorMatch report:Sunderland 2-1 Brentford9Wilson magic boosts under-fire PotterAfter West Ham’s first win of the season Graham Potter touched on the volatility of his job. He did so after a question about Mads Hermansen keeping his clean sheet, referencing a difficult start to life at the club. “You get written off in your job after a week, which is ridiculous,” said the West Ham manager. Callum Wilson presumably can vouch for that. The signing of the 33-year-old striker was derided in some quarters, but while Wilson has struggled with injuries, he demonstrated his goalscoring ability off the bench in the victory atNottingham Forest. Wilson twice went close before capping the scoring at the City Ground with his first league goal in 16 months, proving a handful for Forest after replacing Niclas Füllkrug. West Ham fans will hope there is plenty more where that came from.Ben FisherMatch report:Nottingham Forest 0-3 West Ham10Palace’s silver linings have cloudsCrystal Palace fans must wonder whether to laugh or cry as their team continue to defy the odds. Eberechi Eze scores the winning goal in the FA Cup final, then signs off on good terms to leave for his boyhood club Arsenal for good money. Marc Guéhi leads the team into their first ever European games to qualify for the group stages – of a competition one level below what their Cup triumph merited. They extend their 14-game unbeaten run to hit eighth spot in the Premier League before the first international break with a wonderful goal from Guéhi – who could now leave for Liverpool. Still, at least they’ve got Adam Wharton … who then pulls up with a groin injury that could mean he misses another opportunity to shine for England over the coming 10 days.Peter LansleyMatch report:Aston Villa 0-3 Crystal PalaceExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballArsenalAston VillaBournemouthBrentfordBrighton & Hove AlbionBurnleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were even fears that the Austrian, who led Palace to their first trophy when they won the FA Cup in May, could step down after making it clear that they must keep hold of Guéhi if they are to have a successful season.That, and their failure to bring in a direct replacement in time, eventually persuaded Parish to inform Liverpool the deal was off despite admitting after their victory over Arne Slot’s side in the Community Shield that he would probably have to be sold this month to avoid losing the 25-year-old for free next summer.Palace announced the signing of 19-year-old Canvot and had also been working on deals to bring in a more experienced replacement for Guéhi, although a move to sign Brighton’s Igor Julio on loan failed to materialise and they could not find other replacements in time to beat the deadline. Palace are also in talks with Tottenham over a loan move for Manor Solomon and are set to sign Nigeria forward Christantus Uche for €20m (£17.3m) from Getafe.Parish said after their victory over Arne Slot’s side in the Community Shield that Guéhi may have to be sold this month to avoid losing the centre-back for free next summerExplore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceLiverpoolTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Villa prioritised strengthening their attack but question marks surround Martínez, who wanted a fresh challenge this summer.Villa, who also signed the Sweden captain Victor Lindelöf, have added the 25-year-old Sancho on a season’s loan while Elliott has joined on loan in a deal with an obligation to buy for £35m. The versatility of all three players is attractive to Emery, who was determined to add at least one attacking player to his frontline. Sancho, who has spent the past 18 months on loan at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, rejected a move to Roma earlier in this transfer window.Transfer deadline day: Guéhi to Liverpool collapses, Isak, Jackson and Antony deals agreed – liveRead moreVilla are expected to pay about 80% of Sancho’s wages. Chelsea paid a £5m penalty to United for reneging on an obligation to sign the winger at the end of last season.Elliott was player of the tournament when England won the European Under-21 Championship this summer, scoring five goals. But he has struggled for game time and played once for Liverpool this season. In June Elliott said he does not want to be “wasting years” of his career and would consider his Liverpool future. He was limited to 18 Premier League appearances as Liverpool won the title last season, 16 of them as a substitute.Martínez, who is now on international duty with Argentina before World Cup qualifiers against Venezuela and Ecuador, was willing to depart Villa this summer and while Manchester United had a loan inquiry dismissed earlier in the window, the club did not return with a second offer and instead favoured an £18m deal for Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. Martínez was omitted from Villa’s squad for their chastening 3-0 home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday, a result which left Emery incensed.The transfer windows in Saudi Arabia and Turkey remain open until a week on Wednesday and Thursday respectively but Martínez, who turns 33 on Tuesday, is not thought to be keen and Villa are yet to receive any bids. Martínez would need to be registered by 11pm on Tuesday in order to represent a club in the Champions League. Marco Bizot, signed this summer from Brest as a No 2, started against Palace in place of Martínez but conceded a first-half penalty, which resulted in the first of Palace’s three goals.Lindelöf was a free agent after leaving United in the summer at the end of his contract after eight seasons. The 31-year-old defender, who can play at centre-back and right-back, has signed a two-year contract. Villa had been keen on a move for the 19-year-old Jaydee Canvot earlier in the window but the Toulouse centre-back joined Palace in a £23m deal.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The 24-year-old, who has fallen down the pecking order following the arrivals of Delap and João Pedro this summer, remained in Munich but his hopes of joining Bayern appeared to be over at the end of the weekend.Jackson emerged as a possible target for Newcastle when they accepted Liverpool’s offer for Alexander Isak on Sunday night, only for that path to close when the north-east clubagreed to sign Brentford’s Yoane Wissaon Monday morning.Optimism then rose when it emerged that Bayern were making another push for the Senegal international.Chelseawere hopeful for a permanent sale but a compromise was reached.

The 22-year-old is United’s fourth major signing of the widow, following Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, to take the club’s summer spending to £225.2mLammens travelled to Manchester on Monday afternoon prior to signing a five-year contract. United consider Lammens, who has nine caps for Belgium’s Under-21 side, a prospect for the future who can also challenge André Onana orAltay Bayindir for the No 1 spot immediately.Transfer deadline day: Isak and Wissa deals agreed; Sancho, Jackson, Donnarumma and more – liveRead more“I am extremely proud to be joining Manchester United,” said Lammens. “It is a real dream come true. The past few years have been an amazing journey, it’s now ended in an incredible destination and hopefully the beginning of something special.“You can feel the positive atmosphere that is being created here, and I know that I can make a real impact at the club in the coming years. I cannot wait to get to know my team-mates and begin working with Ruben and the coaching staff. This is the perfect place to keep developing, grow together with this exciting team and achieve my career objectives.”United had considered signing Martínez but the Argentina World Cup-winner’s £35m asking price and age – he turns 33 on Tuesday – ultimately made Lammens the club’s favoured option. With Tom Heaton also at United, Lammens’ arrival means Amorim has four goalkeepers. As Onana is expected to be part of Cameroon’s African Cup of Nations challenge for up to six weeks, starting in mid-December, the Portuguese is relaxed about having to manage the quartet.Following a troubled three years at United, Antony was sold to Real Betis for a €25m (£21.6m) package that includes a 50% sell-on clause. United also offloaded Jadon Sancho toAston Villaon a season-long loan that sees the Midlands club cover 80% of the winger’s wages. Rasmus Højlund also secured a season-long loan move to Napoli that includes an obligation for the Serie A champions to sign the Denmark forward on a permanent basis if they qualify for the Champions League.United ended the window with no new midfield acquisitions, though they made an enquiry to Atlético Madrid regarding the availability to Connor Gallager, while Kobbie Mainoo’s wish to leave on loan was not granted.

Milan and Como are also looking to play a Serie A fixture in Perth, Western Australia, in February.Transfer deadline day: Isak, Guéhi, Jackson and Wissa deals agreed, and more – liveRead moreSigning off those moves would, the fan bodies have warned, mean “setting a dangerous precedent” and “stripping clubs of their roots”.Those fears were expressedby Football Supporters Europe, the Independent Supporters Council, Football Supporters Association Australia and Accionistas y Socios del Fútbol Español in a letter sent last week to the Fifa secretary general, Mattias Grafström. They explained moving games abroad would undermine sporting integrity, unbalancing the regular home-and-away rhythm, while “reducing clubs to entertainment products detached from their tradition and communities”.The letter pointed out that local supporters would be alienated and the clubs’ cultural identities would be reduced; it also stressed the environmental cost and logistical burden of the associated long-haul travel.“Relocating domestic league matches abroad would set a dangerous precedent, stripping clubs of their roots and undermining the trust of supporters,” said Ronan Evain, the executive director of Football Supporters Europe. “Fifa must take a clear stand to protect the integrity and identity of domestic football.“Those behind the proposals claim they are only interested in a one-off event, a claim we reject. If permitted, this would open a Pandora’s box of disarray for football. Shortsighted commercial interests cannot take precedent over protecting domestic football and the communities our clubs grew out of.”The signatories noted that Fifa would be directly contravening its own regulations governing international matches, specifically those requiring domestic games to be played in the territory of their national association, if it gave the green light. In October last year Fifa set up a working group to review those rules but any outcomes are yet to be communicated.As the Guardian reported last week, Uefa’s executive committee will discuss next Thursday whether to give its own approval and in what form. Uefa, US Soccer and Concacaf must all accept the proposals before Fifa has the final say. Despite misgivings among Uefa leadership – voiced publicly by its president, Aleksander Ceferin – the push to move big-ticket matches to new markets has significant momentum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

WhetherErik ten Hagwill choose to get over his latest breakup with a tub of ice-cream in front of a rewatch of Notting Hill is open to conjecture but if he did, lyrics dotted through the film are sure to have an added poignancy.Ten Hag didn’t need telling that in only his second Bundesliga game in charge of Bayer Leverkusen, they and he hada bad afternoon. Going to a diminished and depleted Werder Bremen (it is probably too early to say lowly, even though we strongly suspect that is the part of the table where they may end up spending most of their time),Die Werkselfappeared to be on top of things, holding a 3-1 lead and a man advantage.Erik ten Hag sacked by Bayer Leverkusen after just three matchesRead moreNot so. A first senior goal for the 18-year-old Karim Coulibaly, deftly poked in from just inside the six-yard box after a chaotic spell of pressure, gave the home side a wildly celebrated and barely believable leveller. As this was the last image of Ten Hag in Leverkusen, Coulibaly’s surprise intervention – he was drafted in from the under-19 team for a first start after a slew of injuries – will feel like the full stop, the moment that pushed the coach over the edge.That will not quite be true. It has been a brutal end and a historic failure, for both coach and club, with noBundesligaclub ever having appointed a new coach and then removed him after two games. Yet for anybody around Leverkusen in the buildup to the trip to Bremen, it can’t be said to have been a surprise. It was evident that for Ten Hag’s second Bundesliga game in charge (yes, it bears repeating), he was already under enormous pressure not just to produce a result but to produce a performance, some evidence of direction and leadership in the team’s on-field efforts.None of those things were forthcoming. If Leverkusen had escaped the Weserstadion with a win, it would have been just that. It had been, in the words of the captain Robert Andrich, “misery versus misery”, an entertaining spectacle but not one of high class and not one where Ten Hag’s team had really looked like bringing their superior quality to bear. Andrich was the only Leverkusen player to come forward and face the media afterwards but that’s all that was needed. The Germany midfielder is always direct and clear, and he was here.“What happened then is emblematic of our current situation,” he fumed. “We have too many people who are preoccupied with other things, too many who are only concerned with themselves, and that’s what the game looked like. Everyone played for themselves.” Some of this had been clear, not least in the unseemly dispute over who should take the penalty that Patrik Schick eventually scored to make it 3-1. Schick and Exequiel Palacios argued, Andrich stepped in to settle it and gave the ball to Schick – “We can’t stand around on the pitch and play rock-paper-scissors for two minutes,” was how the skipper framed it – and Palacios then kicked the ball away in frustration.View image in fullscreenRobert Andrich was left exasperated after the 3-3 draw at Werder Bremen.Photograph: Ibrahim Ot/AFP/Getty ImagesIf Andrich had reason to bring the blame on to the players, it said little for Ten Hag’s authority, as the coach himself implicitly conceded in his post-match press conference. “It was very clear who the [penalty takers] were and they simply didn’t implement that,” he said, describing the situation as “unacceptable”. But if Ten Hag’s own words had little impact, Andrich’s did. Just as his words describing the squad’s shortcomings had prefaced the fall of Gerardo Seoane, which led to the appointment of Xabi Alonso.Andrich’s words cut through because of the content, because of his delivery and because of their solitude. Both the sporting director, Simon Rolfes, before the game, and the chief executive, Fernando Carro, had been given opportunities to publicly back Ten Hag but they had declined to take them. Their nothing at all, to recall the ballad, said it best. Whatever the result in Bremen, it was really hard to imagine anything turning the tide.For if they had been bad in Bremen, they had been truly atrocious the week before in the curtain-raiser against Hoffenheim. Even that, though, could be argued to be more symptom than cause when we look at the fall of Ten Hag. Nobody is suggesting that the former Manchester United coach was dealt anything other than a difficult hand, with over €200m worth of player sales this summer and the loss of key leaders like Lukas Hradecky, Jonathan Tah and Granit Xhaka besides.Even if one takes into account the good reputation that Ten Hag enjoyed in Germany from his previous association with Bayern Munich, he began on the back foot not just because he followed Alonso or took charge of a changing squad at the end of an era, but because he wasn’t first choice. The club thought at one point they had a deal for Cesc Fàbregas to replace his former international teammate, but Como weren’t for turning and Fàbregas was not keen on forcing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was the infamous 5-1 defeat to Flamengo’s under-20s on a promotional tour of Brazil, aimed at continuing Leverkusen’s eager global brand expansion. Ten Hag could have reacted in many ways but while acknowledging that the result shouldn’t have happened, the headlines became his lines that “the game came too soon” and that he “couldn’t give a shit about results in pre-season”.View image in fullscreenSimon Rolfes, Bayer Leverkusen’s sporting director, did not publicly back Erik ten Hag.Photograph: Jörg Schüler/Bayer 04 Leverkusen/Getty ImagesIt kept coming. The Xhaka exit was perhaps a turning point, not because Leverkusen were losing an important influence of the rampantly successful Alonso era but because Ten Hag – inexplicably to the club – came out and publicly said that he didn’t want the Switzerland midfielder to go and aimed to keep him. Rolfes and Carro were blindsided, with the sporting director having described getting good money for an ageing player and key piece of a previous regime as “a win-win-win” and having discussed it (and from their perspective agreed the strategy) with the coach behind the scenes.There was more: the all-new coaching team who hadn’t worked together before feeling disjointed and the lack of any real reaction to the Hoffenheim loss, after which the recently arrived Mark Flekken felt comfortable enough to tear his team’s performance apart publicly to journalists. It will be a busy transfer deadline day for Leverkusen with Eliesse Ben Seghir having already arrived from Monaco and more players of considerable stock to come. Those actions, and that a new coach will be tasked with guiding them into the top four, will say more than anything Rolfes or Carro could have in a statement.PosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich2762Eintracht Frankfurt2563Cologne2464Borussia Dortmund2345St Pauli2246Wolfsburg2247Augsburg2138Stuttgart2039Hoffenheim2-1310Union Berlin2-2311RB Leipzig2-4312Bayer Leverkusen2-1113Mainz2-1114Borussia M'gladbach2-1115Hamburg2-2116Werder Bremen2-3117Heidenheim2-4018Freiburg2-50Explore more on these topicsBundesligaEuropean club footballErik ten HagBayer LeverkusenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the Serie A club were unable to agree a deal for him, admitting defeat over the weekend and moving instead for Loïs Openda from RB Leipzig.Spurs had been interested in Kolo Muani in January when Ange Postecoglou was their manager. They have now moved decisively to secure him on a season-long contract with no obligation to make things permanent next summer.Transfer deadline day: City agree Donnarumma deal, Guéhi to Liverpool move collapses – liveRead moreKolo Muani, who has 31 caps and nine goals for France, can play up front or off the left. The 26-year-old cost €75m plus €15m in add-ons when he joined PSG in 2023 from Eintracht Frankfurt and Spurs will register him as a non locally-trained senior player in the Champions League.The club already had too many of this profile of player; they are permitted to name up to 17 of them on their 25-man “A”’ list. A further complication is that they are allowed to have only four association-trained players and they have six – Djed Spence, Ben Davies, Archie Gray, James Maddison, Brennan Johnson and Dominic Solanke.Maddison has a long-term injuryand will not be available for the league phase of the Champions League, which concludes at the end of January. Clubs can register a maximum of three new players for the knockout rounds. If Frank wanted to include each of the other five, one of them would have to take a non locally-trained spot.Uefa’s deadline for the submission of Champion League squads is 11pm BST on Tuesday and Frank is likely to have to omit a clutch of players. When the nailed-on selections are factored in, it would appear that Frank will have to choose two from the following – Radu Dragusin, the new signing Kota Takai, Dejan Kulusevski, Wilson Odobert, Mathys Tel and the odd one out from the association-trained group. This group does not include Yves Bissouma, who is out of favour and has been linked with a move to Turkey, where the transfer window does not close until Friday week.Kulusevski may be at risk because he is expected to be unavailable until around the turn of the year as he recovers from knee surgery. The final two ties of the league phase are scheduled for 20-21 January and 28 January. Complicating matters yet further is Spurs’ situation with their club-trained players, who are the other element of the locally-trained cohort. They have only one – the third-choice goalkeeper, Brandon Austin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is about the central crisis in the life ofman-mountain Mark Kerr, America’s pioneering MMA and ultimate fighting champ, who in 1997 found himself in the ring, or maybe the cage, with his demons after the unthinkable humiliation of losing for the first time.This feature is in fact developed froma 2002 documentary about Kerrwith the same title. He confronted his substance abuse, relationship anxieties and the question of what the heck life is for if you can’t simply win all the time. Kerr is played by Dwayne Johnson, a colossus of muscle topped off with a head the size of Indiana Jones’s boulder, a body on which the only visible fat is rippling at the nape of his neck. Johnson’s appearance is modified by close-cut frizzy hair and facial prosthetics that make him look like Jon Favreau playing the Hulk. No other casting was remotely possible – not unless Timothée Chalamet fancied bulking up. (Sacha Baron Cohen could do it these days, and would probably want to play it every bit as seriously and non-satirically as Johnson.)The terrible, existential nightmare of losing – a possibility for which no one in Kerr’s professional or personal circle appeared to have prepared him – causes that giant statue of a man to wobble and topple. Kerr has to throw his opioids in the trash, enter rehab and deal again with the important people in his life; one of them is his best buddy, sometime coach and fighting rival Mark Coleman, slightly woodenly played here by Ryan Bader, an actualMMAfighter with no acting experience who doesn’t look as exotically jacked as Kerr.In those early days of MMA, the championship took place in Japan and it was called Pride; those hugely built male specimens would snarl, grapple and tussle under this title, and a cheekier, less brand-respectful film might have tried a gag here, or wondered if there were emotional aspects of the sport which had been left unexplored. The other person in Mark’s life, however, is his girlfriend Dawn, played with sympathy and wit byEmily Blunt, who has to cower and flinch as Mark, in a towering rage, will occasionally put his fist through the kitchen door. Immediately after the loss, Kerr has a breakdown which causes him to collapse; upon regaining consciousness, he remembers the medic testing him by asking him who the president is – he answers “Ronald Reagan”, a moment of droll political significance that Safdie doesn’t stress.Johnson’s testy and petulant post-rehab scenes with Blunt are shrewdly insightful; he scolds her for not pruning his giant cactus properly and not getting the leaves out of the pool. Dawn realises that when her husband was drinking and the permanent throb of pain dulled with opioids, he was a sweet, loving boyfriend. Has sobriety revealed a nasty mean-minded guy who is always snitching on her to his AA sponsor? And is Dawn actually less important to Mark than his pal Coleman, whom he might have to fight for the world championship?It’s difficult to tell. The film does not really permit the various emotional crises and issues to supersede the importance of fighting all that much, and the fighting itself is not transformed or transfigured in the drama. Even the climax of the great Kerr-Coleman face-off doesn’t make it entirely clear if Kerr has in some sense chosen his girlfriend over his friend and his sport. The movie doesn’t reach for tragedy or extreme dysfunction, like Sean Durkin’s The Iron Claw from 2023 or Bennett Miller’s Foxcatcher from a decade earlier, nor does Safdie go for big set pieces, like a boxing movie might, with eve-of-battle scenes in the dressing room.However, there is one bravura moment when Kerr, in shock after his loss, walks through the corridors, politely complains to the sponsor about his opponent breaking the rules; still sweaty and in his trunks, he then goes down one floor in the elevator causing a member of the venue’s restaurant staff carrying bread to think twice about getting in with him … and then Kerr bursts into tears in his dressing room. These moments of vulnerability are touching, though I wished the film could have promoted the excellent Blunt to equal status in the drama.The Smashing Machine screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsUFCDwayne Johnson (The Rock)Emily BluntVenice film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

What happened next sparked tears, outrage, a detective hunt across social media and, finally, a grovelling apology.It came from Piotr Szczerek, a millionaire businessman from Poland, who had snatched the cap out of the boy’s hand and stuffed it into his bag. Videos of the incident showed the youngster looking deeply upset and asking: “What are you doing?” while Majchrzak – who was oblivious to the situation after his five-set victory against the ninth seed, Karen Khachanov – walked away.In a post on his Facebook page on Monday, Szczerek pleaded for forgiveness and said that he had given the hat back. “Due to the situation that occurred during Kamil Majchrzak’s match at the US Open, I would like to unequivocally apologise to the injured boy, his family, all the fans, and the player himself,” he wrote.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

On Saturday, Majchrzak appeared in an Instagram post shaking hands with the boy, named only as Brock, who had a bag of merchandise with him. Majchrzak’s caption read: “Hello World, Together with Brock we wish you a great day!”Meanwhile, in his Facebook post, Szczerek, who is said to have donated money to Polish tennis in the past, admitted the incident had given him a lesson in humility. “For years, my wife and I have been engaged in helping children and young athletes, but this situation has shown I think that one moment of disregard can ruin years of work and support.“It hurts for me, but a needed lesson in humility. I believe that only through actions can rebuild what has been lost trust. Again, I’m sorry to anyone I disappointed. Please understand – for my family’s sake – I decided to turn off comments on this post.”It is not the first time that a dispute among fans has made headline news and controversy. Last year when the Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani became the first player to achieve 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season, there was a fight for the ball in the stands.While the ball was later sold at auction for $3.4m, who actually caught the ball remains the subject of ongoing civil litigation. One spectator, Max Matus, said he “successfully grabbed” the ball in his left hand before “a muscular, older man” then trapped his arm “in between his legs and wrangled the 50/50 Ball out of Max’s left hand”.Another fan, Joseph Davidov, has also filed a suit claiming he was the rightful owner. However, a third man, Christian Zacek, actually walked out of Miami’s LoanDepot Park with the ball after gaining possession in the stands.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sky’s latest streaming TV aims to be a good, all-in-one budget option for your sitting room – and it achieves all those aims, leaving it standing strong in a field of mediocre, similarly priced appliances.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Glass Air is a lighter, slimmer and cheaper version of theGlass gen 2and is arguably the low-cost TV Sky should have launched first, coming in three sizes starting at £309 or just £6 a month on 48-month interest-free credit with £20 upfront.As with its pricier siblings, Glass Air requires a Sky subscription for full use, which costs from £15 a month for the Essential TV pack. It will function as abasic smart TVwith streaming apps,an aerialand its three HDMI ports, but you would not buy any Sky TV without the intention of paying for its TV-over-broadband service.Glass Air is best thought of as a cut-down version of Glass gen 2. It has the same service and internal smart hardware but lacks the integrated soundbar, aluminium body and has a different screen, making it a fraction of the weight and thickness.View image in fullscreenThe slim plastic frame is available in a choice of three colours with matching remote.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianIt also means all it needs is a power cable and an internet connection, be that via wifi or ethernet – no aerial or satellite cable required – and just one remote for all of your TV, streaming apps and services combined. It also has Sky’s voice-control system with integrated mics, so you can turn it on, search, control the volume and playback by simply saying “Hello Sky” followed by your command. You have to speak up a bit but it works well. Alternatively, you can press and hold the mic button on the remote and speak into that.The 60Hz screen is a bright and crisp 4K LCD panel with HDR support, but it lacks the superior local-dimming backlight technology present in Glass gen 2 and other higher-end TVs. That means the picture has one brightness across the whole scene, reducing the difference between light and dark areas. As a result, some high-contrast scenes look less dramatic and lack a little depth, while bright landscapes can look a little bleached out.Despite this, the television does a good job of displaying an engaging picture, looking great with everyday TV shows and doing a solid job with bright animation or moody movies.View image in fullscreenGlass Air has three HDMI ports, an optical port, two USB ports, ethernet and an aerial socket, but only needs power and wifi to actually work.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 15W stereo speakers are surprisingly good for a thin TV without a soundbar. They can get loud enough to fill medium-sized rooms and produced clear vocals at anything up to 90% volume, which can’t be said of most TV speakers.They lack bass and any attempt at surround sound, but are certainly good enough for watching Bargain Hunt or the Premier League. You can use one of the three HDMI ports to connect a soundbar for more immersive sound, although you will need to raise the TV otherwise the soundbar will block a portion of the screen.Sky OSView image in fullscreenThe modern Sky interface puts all of your content, whether live or on-demand, in one easy to use system.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne of the biggest advantages of Glass Air compared with similarly priced budget TVs is that the software running on it is actually good. Sky OS hasimproved dramatically over the last few yearsand runs well on the Glass Air.It combines live broadcast with on-demand content seamlessly through its excellent playlist feature, which makes keeping track of your shows and films easy. Watching live TV, pausing it and rewinding it works great. Almost every major streaming service is supported, including BBC iPlayer, ITV X, Channel 4, Apple TV+, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+ and Discovery+.Glass Air also supportsAirPlay 2for sending content from Apple’s various devices and Bluetooth for connecting a set of headphones for private listening.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe TV switches to a screensaver before turning off when not used for a set time, detecting your presence through motion sensors in the remote.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe television isrepairable apart from the screen. It contains recycled plastic and solder. The company will recycle its old products and ships the TV in plastic-free packaging.PriceThe Sky Glass Air is available in three sizes with upfront costs of £309 for 43in, £509 for 55in and £649 for 65in. It is also available on 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans costing from £6 with a £20 upfront fee.The minimum required Sky package is Essential TV costing from £15 a month, which includes Netflix and Discovery+, with many other combinations of entertainment, movies, kids and sports channels available on 24 or one month rolling plans.VerdictSky Glass Air is a solid budget television with all the advantages of Sky’s pay-TV over broadband service built in.It is slim and light with stereo speakers that are far better than most slender TVs. It has a decent 4K picture that is bright and colourful, although it lacks a little contrast here and there. The physical bits of the TV are essentially good enough. Where it trounces other budget rivals is in the service and software, which is miles better than most low-end smart TVs.Of course you have to pay a monthly subscription for the privilege, but for those looking for Sky pay-TV you are not getting a worse software experience on a cheaper television. And it still has the genuinely great all-in-one convenience of every TV and streaming service in one box with one remote and just power and internet required.You can get better-looking mid-range TVs discounted to around this price if you shop savvy. But the Glass Air is great for the money and stands out against the sea of unremarkable budget TVs at this end of the market.Pros:all-in-one streaming and pay-TV device, decent vocals, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, great software, excellent search and playlist functions, all major streaming apps, voice control, custom picture modes.Cons:no local dimming means lower contrast, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, no Chromecast support, requires subscription.View image in fullscreenThe TV slots on to two metal prongs on a sturdy plastic stand with no tools required or it can be wall-mounted instead.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGadgetsTelevisionSky (Media)Sky (Business)reviewsShareReuse this content"

But she began to feel as though she was being watched. Could her friend be using hidden cameras to spy on her?Heidi tellsHelen Piddabout her frightening experience and how she discovered the truth, while freelance journalistAnna Mooreexplains what she discovered when she wrote in the Guardian about thesinister rise of voyeurism and spy cameras.“They’re cameras that are disguised as everyday domestic items, even disposable coffee cups that could be left in a changing room,” she says.“I write about violence against women and girls, and I’ve always looked at those cameras and wondered: how can that be legal?”She tells Helen how widespread the problem may be, and what campaigners say must be done to stop it.Photograph: Denniro/Getty Images/iStockphotoExplore more on these topicsWomenToday in FocusCrimeEspionageSexual harassmentSurveillance"

From there, it progressed to Reddit, memes and TikTok.And is it really the best we can do, insult-wise?Popular culture has spawned other anti-robot slurs – there’s “toaster” from Battlestar Galactica, and “skin-job” from Blade Runner – but “clanker” seems to have won out for now.It seems like a stupid waste of time, but I guess it’s harmless enough.You say that, but many suggest using “clanker” could help to normalise actual bigotry.Oh, come on now.Popular memes and spoof videos tend to treat “clanker” as being directly analogous to a racial slur – suggesting a future where we all harass robots as if they were an oppressed minority.So what? They’re just clankers.“Naturally, when we trend in that direction, it does play into those tropes of how people have treated marginalised communities before,” says linguist Adam Aleksic.I’m notanti-robot; I just wouldn’t want my daughter to marry one.Can you hear how that sounds?Ihave a feeling we’re going tobe very embarrassed about all this in 10 years.Probably. Some people argue that, by insulting AI, we’re crediting it with a level of humanity it doesn’t warrant.That would certainly be my assessment.However, the “Roko’s basilisk” thought experiment posits that a future artificial superintelligence might punish all those who failed to help it flourish in the first place.I guess calling it a clanker would count.We may end up apologising to our robot overlords for past hate crimes.Or perhaps they’ll see the funny side of all this?Assuming the clankers develop a sense of humour some day.Do say:“The impulse to coin this slur says more about our anxieties than it does about the technology itself.”Don’t say:“Some of my best friends are clankers.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Pass notesRobotsChatbotsSmartphonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I believe AI can help us do that, because as it lowers the cost threshold to produce stuff, and as every month goes by, it lowering it and lowering it, we can do more for less, and we can hopefully retain more ownership of those projects,” he says.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningProyas’s next film, RUR, is the story of a woman seeking to emancipate robots in an island factory from capitalist exploitation. Based on a 1920 Czech satirical play, the film stars Samantha Allsop, Lindsay Farris and Anthony LaPaglia and has been filming since October last year.Proyas’s company, Heretic Foundation, was established in Alexandria in Sydney in 2020, and Proyasdescribed it at the timeas a “soup to nuts production” house for film. He says RUR can be made at a fraction of the US$100m cost it would have been in a traditional studio.This is partly due to being able to complete much of the work directly in the studio via virtual production through a partnership with technology giant Dell that provides workstations that allow generative AI asset creation in real time as the film is made.View image in fullscreenProyas’s 2004 film I, Robot was made when AI was much more firmly in the realm of science fiction.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe production time for environment design can be reduced from six months to eight weeks, according to Proyas.In Proyas’s 2004 film I, Robot – made at a time when AI was much more firmly in the realm of science fiction – the robots had taken on many of the jobs in the world set in 2035, until it went wrong. Asked whether he is concerned about what AI means for jobs in film, particularly areas such as visual effects, Proyas says “workforces are going to be streamlined” but people could be retrained.“I believe there will be work for everyone who embraces and moves forward with the technology as we’ve always done in the film industry,” he says.Guardian Australia is speaking to Proyas in the same week Australia’s Productivity Commission came under fire from creative industries for opening discussion onwhether AI companies should get free access to everyone’s creative worksto train their models on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Butin the datasetsthe trial has released, it took some users between 10 minutes and an hour to get through the process.That’s before taking into account whether the system has correctly estimated their age.Trial of tech that could be used to keep Australian under-16s off social media finds some errors ‘inevitable’Read moreThe federal government and the trial report downplayed concerns about error rates in facial age estimation, but the report acknowledged there will be errors, particularly for users closer to the 16-year-old age limit.Yoti – one of the more mature age assurance technology providers tested in the trial – had results showing an error rate of 34% for 14-year-olds and 73% for 15-year-olds, where the system incorrectly said those users were 16.For a social media ban aimed at keeping 13- to 15-year-olds off social media, that’s a massive cohort that could potentially escape the planned ban.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe data reveals some of the age estimations can vary widely, particularly if you are non-Caucasian, female or older, according to the report. The data reveals one 12-year-old was estimated to be 85.The report conceded that errors in age estimation technology were inevitable and fallback options would be required for platforms where the user says they’re not the age the technology guesses they are.That would probably lead anyone wrongly assessed as being under the age limit to have to provide IDs such as passports to be able to get on to social media – a much more privacy-intrusive method of verifying age.Worryingly, the report found some of the providers offering age verification tools were preempting expectations from law enforcement that the identification data might need to be retained for other purposes, which the report noted could risk privacy breaches.Concerns around wrongful bansWhat if someone doesn’t have an ID or can’t get back on to the platforms despite the additional hurdles?The communications minister, Anika Wells, said the government was mindful that wrongful bans could be an issue, and under the rules there should be a way for people to appeal against a decision and that should happen quickly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whether the company develops a sudden sense of urgency for these accounts remains to be seen.Tellingly, in media interviews on the report on Monday, Wells talked up what is referred to in the report as “age inference”. This is the most frictionless and least privacy-invasive method.There is a view that social media companies collect vast amounts of data on their users already and, through this data, they can figure out the age of each user. A user, for example, who joined Facebook in theKevin 07era would be well past the age cut-off.There are also behavioural signs. Wells used the example of interacting on social media with retirees about caravanning being an indicator someone is older, and talking about Kpop Demon Hunters with 13-year-olds being a sign someone is a teenager.In an ideal world, in around 100 days when the ban comes into effect, the platforms will use this method for the vast majority of adults and no one will notice. That may be the case for some platforms – and we don’t know which method any of them will use yet – but smaller providers or those that deliberately avoid collecting much information on their users will have to employ some of the other methods.Some smaller providers may choose to opt out of Australia entirely. Twitter-X alternative Bluesky blocked users in Mississippi last month after asimilar age assurance law passedin the US state, citing costs in developing age verification systems and lack of resources.Bluesky has not said what the plan is for Australia yet, but it’s not difficult to predict some smaller companies will choose to opt out of Australia altogether rather than face either the cost of compliance or fines of up to $50m.Josh Taylor is Guardian Australia’s technology reporterExplore more on these topicsFacial recognitionSocial mediaAustralian politicsChild protectionInternet safetyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Forthcoming deck-building game,All Will Rise, seeks to interest players in political activism,Compensation Not Guaranteedaims to educate players about south-east Asian politics, whileMythMatchis ostensibly a puzzle game set in ancient Greece, but is also about building communities and challenging capitalism – while still looking cute and approachable.You play as Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, who is having to navigate the institutionalised sexism of Mount Olympus, here represented as a corporation infested with tech bros. In defiance, she decides to help the mortals of Ithaca build a new, more progressive world – and you do this by running around the little environments, merging items and animals to create helpful new beasts and objects. For example, when you’re cast down to Earth you accidentally smash a chariot belonging to Selene, the goddess of the Moon, so you have to match moon shards together to recreate the celestial vehicle. However, one of the shards has fallen into a greenhouse, so you need to solve a puzzle to gain access.View image in fullscreenAll-new Ithaca … Mythmatch.Photograph: Team ArtichokeThe game then is part narrative adventure, part social sim, part match-three teaser. “We ended up taking a lot more from automation games like Factorio, but where the automation happens through connection with the NPCs rather than building machinery,” says Moo Yu, founder and creative director at developer Team Artichoke. “And in Mount Olympus, we’re inspired by various arcade-style games like Money Puzzle Exchanger, Overcooked, and even Super Auto Pets.”With a diverse bunch of characters and a genuinely funny script, the emphasis is very much on forming friendships and a pleasant community. “I became obsessed with the theme of belonging,” says Yu. “As someone who has always struggled to make friends or find community, I just felt like there weren’t enough games about rejection and found family. So I started with some gameplay about moving goalposts and constantly being rejected by the gods of Olympus. Then when searching for where Artemis might actually fit in, I thought about some of the communities that I love and how they are about aligning our commonalities while embracing our differences.”Team Artichoke is a small studio with 10 staff, most of whom are working part-time on the project. At the helm, Yu is a veteran who’s worked at Media Molecule and Mind Candy as well as co-developing the hit adventureKnights and Bikes. When asked about the key influences behind Mythmatch, he immediately cites three films: Kung Fu Panda, Amelie and most prominently Legally Blonde, the Reese Witherspoon comedy which is visually coded to look like a romcom but also deftly analyses misogyny in the legal profession. “We wanted to create a caricatured world to give us the breathing space to venture on to more serious topics,” he says. “[There’s] a surface cuteness but with a layer of grittiness throughout. So while the game might not literally look like the world of Legally Blonde, we wanted to capture the space created by the exaggerated colour palette while also making sure there was a layer of messiness as well.”So while Mythmatch uses the core game loops of casual genres such as match-three and merge games, it has a fundamental message to impart about power and belonging. Yu sees this combination as important in the indie games scene of 2025. “I’m seeing more small games that are delivering new stories or pairing mechanics with interesting narratives that I think speaks to what creativity can accomplish with limited funds,” he says. “I wish the funds weren’t getting more and more limited, but I am always inspired by what people can accomplish with what they can scrape together.”Mythmatch is currently in development for PC, with a release date to be announced.Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesPuzzle gamesCasual gamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Moreover, he had attempted to take the unprecedented step offiring a board governor.b) The new US budget had been seen by the Congressional Budget Office asadding $3.4tn (£2.5tn) to the national debtover the next 10 years.By contrast, in the UK:a) The government had worked hard to stay within its fiscal rules and had made no attempt to interfere with the independence of theBank of England.b) In terms of the outlook for monetary policy, two-year yields in the UK and US had come down by about the same amount.Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for Van Winkle to expect that yields on longer-term US debt would have risen by more than in the UK. Hence, his astonishment when told that UK 30-year yields had risen by more than in the US.In talking to investors, I encounter strongly divergent views regarding Van Winkle’s puzzle. One group believes that this represents an anomaly and, given a catalyst, UK gilts (bonds) should outperform US treasuries. By contrast, some others believe that the UK gilts market is heading towards a full-blown crisis because of fiscal sustainability concerns. This camp points to the historical tendency of the Office for Budget Responsibility to be too optimistic with regard to its fiscal projections. They also worry that the OBR’s growth projections are too high. They point out that the OBR did not believe that the October 2024 budget would boost growth over a five-year period and are worried that recent tax changes have driven entrepreneurs away and changed the image of the UK as a place to invest.It is important to recall that market pricing is often dominated by the prevailing narrative. At the moment, thebond vigilantes are also circling in France. It is therefore time for the UK government to be bold and to change the image of the UK. This requires highly significant and eye-catching measures. Tinkering will not do.First, the autumn budget needs to be seen to be credible in terms of the fiscal projections. This will necessarily require some tough decisions.Second, the budget should raise revenue without hurting growth. The achilles heel of the 2024 budget was the rise in employer national insurance contributions, which was seen as hurting employment. It is therefore time to be bold and the government should engage in significant tax reform. By way of example, the introduction of a tax on land could raise revenue and actually increase growth if taxes on work could thereby be reduced over time.Recall that the quantity of land does not react negatively to a tax on its return, while labour supply and capital investment do. Continuing to raise taxes in ways that hurt growth might intensify fears that the current government is caught in a “doom loop” whereby each budget needs to raise taxes further because prior taxes hurt work or investment. I am therefore encouraged by recent speculation that the government is looking afresh at property taxes.Third, policies that are widely seen as increasing growth would help. These policies need to have a significant wow factor. An example would be joining the customs union.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One way of doing so would be to allow the Bank to set its own inflation target.Fifth, I argued a couple of years ago that inflation expectations in the UK were running higher than the inflation target. I said then that this would make the Bank of England slower to cut rates when, as now, the labour market was weakening. At the time, I resurrected an idea originally proposed by many distinguished economists – a tax on companies that give their staff inflation-busting pay deals. I continue to believe that such a tax would be rewarded by the gilts market and would allow the Bank to cut rates sooner.Sixth, the Bank needs to play its part here. It needs to make it known that it takes unwarranted moves in gilt yields into account in its monetary policy decisions and would therefore respond to, for example, contagion from the US. It also needs to reconsider its policy relating to quantitative tightening.To conclude, the government has an opportunity to increase growth and reduce its debt interest bill at the next budget. Boldness will be rewarded by markets now and, very likely, the electorate eventually.Sushil Wadhwani is an economist and a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committeeExplore more on these topicsEconomicsBondsBank of EnglandUS economyFederal ReserveDonald TrumpGiltscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s almost sweet – if you remove the contextMon 1 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 12.44 EDTShareIf soldiers are going to be deployed to your city, what would you prefer they do: point a rifle in your face or mow your grass? This is not a question I ever expected to have to consider in my days on this planet, but life is full of surprises. As part of Donald Trump’s military deployment to address Washington DC’s so-called “crime emergency”, national guard troops are being tasked with variousgroundskeeping dutiesaround the United States capital. These duties include spreading mulch around cherry trees, picking up trash and general maintenance of public spaces. The president must have been too embarrassed to getFour Seasons Total Landscapinginvolved again, so he got the military to do it instead.It’s a real “swords into ploughshares” moment, or in this case, “M4 rifles into thosegrabber sticks you use to pick up plastic bottles full of piss.” It’s almost sweet, if you separate the move from literally all outside context and just think about a part-time soldier pruning your bush. The national guard is actuallytrained for sanitation and groundskeeping, but they are usually deployed for such purposes in a crisis like a natural disaster or even during the height of the Covid pandemic. Except: there’s no natural disaster, no stay-at-home orders due to a deadly virus, no wildfires, no floods. The only crisis here is man-made.America survived a coup attempt. Can it endure dictatorial creep? | Lawrence DouglasRead moreIt’s usually the responsibility of the National Parks Service to beautify spaces in DC, but amid recent cuts by the Trump administration, the number of parks employees in the city fell from 200 to a mere 20, according to theWashington Post. Still, the guard wasn’t deployed to toss cigarette butts. This is happening because of alleged rampant crime in a city where the violent crime rate before Trump’s deployment wasdown by about 20% over the same period in earlier years.Some estimates place the cost of the DC military deployment at around a$1m a day. I will happily rake your leaves for half that.The guards assigned to cleaning up the capital are not armed and may be happy to be on trash duty rather than engaged in more aggressive operations. I’m thrilled for them, to be honest. This is the best version of an awful situation, but from my perspective, it could be even better. Why are they just cleaning up parks when they could be doing so much more with $1m a day in taxpayer revenue? Let’s really put these people to work.Sure, I love visiting my local park or perusing the public square, but you know where I really spend the majority of my time? At home. On my couch. Watching television. I’d toss in an extra $50 if the national guard would organize my refrigerator. I never can seem to keep track of all the produce in there and it inevitably goes bad. I’d get that $50 back just from the cost savings of not having to throw out old spinach every week.How about car repair? My passenger side door has a small ding in it. Grab a hammer and pop that thing back out. I need to call my mother back. She’s in her late 70s and is clearly very lonely. Maybe someone from the national guard can stop by to check on her for me. Pop a finger under her nose just to be sure she’s still breathing. I make a mean spaghetti bolognese from a Stanley Tucci recipe. The guard should come over and have some. I always make too much, and then I forget the leftovers are in the fridge because … I can’t organize my fridge.You might say that these are all things that someone else (me) should already be doing. Sure, I cannot deny that calling my mother is actually my responsibility, but is that so different from the guard entering a city to do what an already well-funded police department is actively engaged in every day? How is this different from firing most of the DC-based parks service members, then spending thousands of dollars to have someone else do it? And until my specific needs are met, how can we, as a nation, truly be free? Someone has to do the dirty work of calling my mother. I don’t see any volunteers lining up, and as a taxpayer, I’ve already invested in this service. The national guard has entered my home town of Los Angeles,Washington DC, and potentially others in the future, without anyone asking me (or really any other actual citizen of those places). If I’m going to be stuck with an unwanted houseguest who costs me seven figures every day of their visit, then I ask them to please do their fair share.My mom would greatly appreciate it.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsUS militaryOpinionWashington DCDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

If you give the people the control over the border they want, the logic went, then Brexit will finally dissolve immigration as an issue that politicians can exploit, and the country can crack on with all the other important stuff that needs doing. And, well, let’s just say that this prediction did not pan out on such a colossal level that no follow-up conversation has been necessary.Because that’s just not how the whole immigration thing works. The goalposts always move. Nothing clarifies that more than Nigel Farage getting everything he has said he ever wanted, the country heaving itself out of the EU and ending free movement, only for another boil to fester around the issue of immigration – and guess what, only Reform UK can lance it! Nothing is ever enough. One only needs to look at the escalating crackdowns in the US to see how the net keeps getting wider and wider. In a matter of months, immigration crackdown has expanded so rapidly that immigrants, both documented and undocumented, areafraid to leavetheir houses to buy groceries or go to work, as the national guard patrols the streets.It starts with the border, a boundary so porous that it must be policed with military levels of force and those crossing it treated with maximum levels of punishment. People crossing the border are portrayed as “invaders” intent on carrying out some criminal or exploitative act. Rightwing politicians in the UK have beenspeaking of “invasion”for years. After Donald Trump came to office for the second time, he codified that notion, expanding the constitutional protection of states from invasion to include immigrants.The US’s southern border is now so militarised thatarmoured vehicles previously stationed in Iraqare positioned there. Border crossings have been falling since before Trump became president, but that decline has accelerated since he took office. In April this year, they were down 94% on the previous year. Is that enough? No. Because really, the numbers are irrelevant: the point is to maintain the flamboyant show of force. “Containment is at 95%. But 95% is not 100%,”said Brigadier General Jeremy Wintersin response to the drop.When the UK media suggests it may be time for “gunboat diplomacy” in response to small boat arrivals – which in 2024 made up about4% of total immigration arrivals to the UK– something similar is playing out. These responses are about posturing, not results.And it doesn’t stop, and, in fact, can’t stop there. Because what about those already in the country? Under new laws that empower US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), everyone from undocumented migrants to those who are law-abiding and with residencepermits have been arrested, while the Trump administrationsuggests that “criminality”is the main criterion for detention. Ice is on its way to becoming thebiggest police force in the US, and the powers it wields, its high-octane arrests in public spaces (someincluding flash-bang grenades) andconfrontations with the public, again conjure the appearance of a large, intractable problem, rather than solving it. Trump decided he wanted to deport millions, and if those millions don’t actually exist, then, through theinvoking of old lawsand their re-definitions, they can be created.Once he has secured the border by automatically deporting all who arrive on small boats, Farage intends todeport600,000 people over the course of a five-year parliament. That is a number, like Trump’s, plucked from the air, and then whole plans are devised around it. And that path only goes in one direction: towards creating large enforcement agencies, rewriting or unpicking laws and even reinterpreting the concept of legal residence altogether. It is entirely foreseeable that those who arrived irregularly and were then granted leave to remain could be grandfathered into illegality and thus be added to the numbers of invaders. If you think that’s dramatic fortune-telling, you have not been paying attention.Once that sort of climate sets in, of a nation battling immigrants on the borders and in the streets and in their workplaces, then how can it be prevented from extending to British citizens? The very concept of Britishness is slipping, redefined already by some to mean “born in Britain”. When the academic Matthew Goodwinstatesthat “more than 50% of social housing in London is now occupied by people who are not British”, he names a figure that corresponds to those not born in Britain, many of whom are naturalised citizens. The fixation on a non-native population with no rights then also extends that precariousness to those with citizenship. The result is that blended families, containing those with citizenship and those without, become tethered to those with the weakest protection. In the US, citizens,in some cases children, have been deported as part of the crackdown.One can make the argument that it doesn’t really matter what the facts or the numbers are, because asylum hotels are inflammatory and small boats make people feel deluged. And it is the job of politicians to assuage the public’s concernsand meet them where they are. But that assumes that the public is always in the same place, and not subject to political and media influences that reinforce a sense of crisis, and then constantly move it along to the next stage of crackdown. When Keir Starmer made his landmark speech announcing a raft of measures to ensure that migrants must “earn” the right to stay, theDaily Mail capslock headlinewas “NO CAP ON MIGRANTS IN LABOUR’S CRACKDOWN”.That is because the question at the heart of immigration crises isn’t “how many is too many”, but “how few is few enough”. The answer is “fewer than zero”. And because that is not a scenario that is possible, no matter what ever-escalating pledges, solutions or policies are offered, nothing will ever be enough. And each time that one decisive solution is executed – whether that be Brexit, increasing deportations, mobilising the navy – a chorus of voices will tell us that these are necessary placatory measures, and then promptly forget when the next one is demanded, and sign up to that as well.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUK newsOpinionImmigration and asylumNigel FarageReform UKDonald TrumpIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)commentShareReuse this content"

It’s time they learned to live, laugh, loveMon 1 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 20.14 EDTShareMillennials are a generation infamous for their love of avocado toast, craft beer, Harry Potter, inventing the idea of a Disney adult and girlboss feminism. For that they’ve been subject to the brunt of our zeitgeist’s wrath in the years since.Resentful boomers began the anti-millennial crusade. That’s to be expected; older people griping about the kids is nothing new, but rather a rite of passage that signifies a healthy ecosystem within the age groups. Hell, even gen X occasionally joins in on the action.But now millennials face a brand-new beast of an enemy: their younger, meaner and far more tech-literate younger sibling, generation Z.It’s not hard to find anti-millennial sentiments on practically every mainstream social media site out there – zoomers are the new apex predator of the internet after all – even coining an antonym custom-fit for millennial uncoolness: cheugy.I was born at the tail-end of 1997, making me either the most fresh-faced millennial or the oldest gen Z hag, depending on who you ask. I’m otherwise known as a “zillennial”.The unexpected benefits of cringingRead moreSo as a generational fence-sitter with a foot in both camps, I reckon that I’m an excellent candidate to unravel this sibling rivalry.First, let’s point out the obvious: I’m sorry, dear millennials, but you are pretty easy to make fun of. From your bygone affinity for putting moustaches on literally everything, inventing stupid words like “doggo” and letting BuzzFeed control the culture for a couple of years, you really have a lot to answer for.I’ll be the first to admit I’ve partaken in bullying millennials but I’ve begun to hold back because – let’s face it – it’s pretty mean, and it’s not as though zoomers are that much cooler. Sure, they talk a big game but I don’t think the generation that made Labubus, JoJo Siwa and broccoli haircuts popular has a solid leg to stand on.Clearly, there is a cringe goldmine to be found in both generations. So why is it that it’s mostly millennials taking the heat?The truth is, millennials (for the most part) take cringe in their stride. Gen Z, on the other hand, is deeply terrified of being perceived as anything other than a specific type of curated cool.The poet and authorOcean Vuong spoke to the ABCin July about this phenomenon, saying “cringe culture” is holding young people back from enjoying life and pursuing what they want, whether related to their career, relationships or hobbies.Both generations share the dismal reality of never owning a home (without parental assistance) and being young under an ever-increasing threat of climate devastation. But while millennials unabashedly cultivated modern nerd culture and weren’t afraid to be seen as sincere online and IRL, gen Z find themselves weighed down by the heavy shackles of irony culture.Perhaps this type of swagless bravado is the only antidote we have to the hellscape we find ourselves inTo be perceived as earnest is a fate worse than death for the self-conscious, aura-farming zoomer, which leads them to lash out against those who do not follow the rules of their anti-cringe world.Millennials grew up quite literally alongside the internet, complete with awkward phases, while zoomers have never known a world devoid of near-constant and hyper-polished social monitoring.The digital landscape once ruled by millennials was “awesome”. Think back to those days when Photoshopped edits of cats in space, AutoTuned news reports and chaotically creative seven-second Vines were commonplace.Meanwhile, zoomers inherited AI slop, fascist influencers and megalomaniac tech overlords who also play a hand in global politics. How is that fair!?And while gen Z might bemaking more money than millennials, they alsohave more debt, might be havingless sex,fewer partiesandseem generally unhappier.We can chalk that up to unease about the state of the world and an unprecedented access to witnessing the successes of their seemingly happier peers. Things that millennials are all too familiar with.As the saying goes, millennials walked so that gen Z could run … and then make fun of them for it.I propose that gen Z open up their hearts and see that millennials, despite their cheuginess, share more commonalities with them than differences. Maybe then, after they finally embrace their own cringey attributes, they’d see that their “too cool” exterior is a prison of their own making.And yes, sure, millennial cringe is sometimes a bit too much to bear – I for one put forward that we completely remove the phrase “but first, coffee” from the lexicon – but perhaps this type of swagless bravado is the only antidote we have to the hellscape we find ourselves in.To be cringe is to be free. Live, laugh, love.Besides, gen alpha is steadily but surely on their way to dethrone the zoomers from their top spot, so are you ready to be bullied by the “skibidi toilet” generation with no one there to back you up?Eleanor Burnard is a production assistant at Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionGenerational inequalityYoung peopleInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

Doing the same at a national level would be an antidote to Reform UKMon 1 Sep 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 11.04 EDTShareWake up to the peril. As MPs return to parliament, they should abandon that self-deluding pretence that it could never happen here in our “moderate” and “tolerant” land. On the contrary, Britain is at more risk of a populist right takeover than many of our European neighbours. With Labour in an electoral slough of despond, and the Tories looking dead already, the reptilian grin of Nigel Faragehaunts the political landscapeafter his satisfactory summer spent stoking division and cynicism.Our first past the post (FPTP) elections make us particularly vulnerable. As Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University,notes: “This is now a Farage-friendly electoral system.” Reform UK has reached the tipping point where winning as little as 30% support in our corkscrewed lottery of a voting system could propel him into No 10, however much that appals the other 70% of voters. “It’s certainly possible” he could be prime minister, was Farage’simplausible boast, a year ago. But as thelatest pollputs his party on 35% to Labour’s 20%, it keeps getting a little more credible.As it happens, in the Commons on Tuesday, MPs will be voting on afairer electoral system. Not, alas, for themselves in this most unrepresentative parliament in all history, where Labour commands almost two-thirds of the seats on just 34% of the vote. MPs tomorrow are voting on the more minor matter of restoring a fairer system for electing mayors in England,abolishing FPTPintroduced in the Elections Act 2022 as aTory gerrymander, returning instead to a supplementary vote system: a first and second choice. Expect sarcastic comments from the many electoral reformers in the house as the government solemnly explains why FPTP voting is unfair and leads to some grotesque results – but only when it’s a mayoral contest.Voter support for electoral reform in all-important general elections nowstands at 60%– its highest ever. People used to believe our system brought Britain strong and stable government, but the chaos of recent years has demonstrated that this isn’t the case. Since 2016, the UK has had six prime ministers, and among western democracies, UK cabinet ministers serve the shortest average terms. If once Britain once thought that its system kept the populist right out of parliament, it does no longer. Instead of being a barrier to dangerous outsiders it has become a springboard, catapulting Reform UK closer to power.Every Labour MP should study thenew reportfrom Compass, which analyses how a system designed to keep the lid on the pressure cooker of populism has become its dangerous enabler. With the old duopoly supplanted by five – soon to be six – UK-wide parties, having one winner take all and seizing the elective dictatorship of a Commons majority only increases voters’ political disengagement. Compass’s report, the Temper Trap, looks at the rise of populist-nationalist parties across the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Italy and Austria, and shows how their inclusion in coalitions under proportional representation (PR) forced them to moderate their extreme demands. Even in Italy, where populist-right voices are in the majority in cabinet, PR has softened their agenda.If the UK thinks itself a moderate country, analysis of its policies of the last 16 years shows how much more extreme it has been even than neighbours with coalitions that include the populist right. It has delivered some of the most immoderate policies in Europe: Brexit is wildly beyond anything done there. British policies on immigration, prison sentencing, deportations, austerity, deregulation, inequality and social justice were all delivered by radicalising a nominally “centre-right” Conservative party from the outside. With virtually no parliamentary presence,Reform UKand its spiritual predecessor Ukip transformed the political landscape.By way of contrast, look at Geert Wilders’ Freedom party (PVV) in the Netherlands. Despite winning the most votes its leader was denied power and the party had to compromise in coalition negotiations, putting to one side its positions onleaving the EU, banning Muslim schools and effecting mass deportations. It’s the same story with Finnish and Austrian populist parties, which negotiated their place in government by compromising on EU withdrawal, mass deportations and bans on foreign students. But, without PR as safety valve, Farage could take absolute power without moderating anything.Here’s the paradox: proportional representation allows populist-right parties into parliament but can stop them governing unchecked. FPTP keeps them out of parliament, but forces mainstream parties to co-opt their policies: see how the idea of withdrawing from the European convention on human rights is no longer a fringe issue.Labour, too, has undoubtedly been pushed further right by populist outsiders.No crystal ball can predict an election still nearly four years ahead. But Labour has the power and the duty to protect the country from the worst possible result, a hard-right populist government elected by a thin minority. The risk is substantial. It’s no longer in Labour’s self-interest to refuse a reform backed by nearly two-thirds of voters. Theparliamentary group on fair elections, by far the largest all-party group in parliament, on Monday published its reportcalling fora national commission on electoral reform. “The government needs to get to grips with this,” says the group’s chair, Labour MP Alex Sobel. Keir Starmer could set up a commission right away and implement change before the next election. He’s been accused of lacking purpose, but here is a strong (cost-free) cause that would protect democracy.Labour voted forelectoral reform at its 2022 conference: its national policy forum saysFPTP is driving“the distrust and alienation we see in politics”. While over half the all-party group are Labour MPs, the cabinet has a few adamant tribalists who resist PR as it would force coalition compromises: that old argument for not watering down socialism looks pretty weak now that Liberal Democrats and Greens in a coalition would push Labour leftwards. I’m told Starmer and Angela Rayner are said to be flexible pragmatists, along with Morgan McSweeney, who would back it if it helped Labour. Rumours suggest Reform UK, pushed hard by Richard Tice,might start dropping supportfor PR at its party conference this week. That should alert any Labour reluctants to the peril of staying with FPTP.An election bill is due shortly, having been delayed by the departure of Rushanara Ali, the homelessness minister who had the odd add-on of democracy minister. Who gets the latter job, and whether it’s taken more seriously, may indicate Starmer’s intentions. If the bill lands with no promise of a commission on electoral reform, a great many Labour MPs will sign an amendment to include it – that would be a serious rebellion on a fundamental principle. Better by far for Starmer to seize the initiative and make this his political challenge to the right and his lasting legacy.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That statistic is shocking enough – but behind every number is a child, and what this statistic means is children arriving at school hungry, living in insecure housing, and missing out on the activities that help them thrive.I visited a school in the north-east of England a couple of years ago where many of the pupils turned up with empty lunchboxes. There was a breakfast club that fed them on arrival. They were eligible for free school meals, so got a hot lunch. After school, trestle tables were set up in the playground laden with food donated from the local food bank. As they went home, they filled up their lunchboxes so that they could have some tea.I have rarely been so shocked. This is the reality of child poverty. This is the normal situation for far too many children and families. Childhood should be full of opportunity. For too many, it begins and ends in struggle.Last week, I spent the morning at the Junction Multibank in Middlesbrough, a town where more than 40% of childrengrow up in poverty. The organisation brings together charities and companies to ensure surplus goods – clothes, furniture, sanitary products – reach those who need them. In less than a year, it has distributed 1.5m items to more than 224,000 people. The work is inspiring, but also deeply sobering. That so much crisis support is necessary in a wealthy country such as ours should be a source of national shame.Of course, leaders face difficult choices with public finances. But let us be clear: policies such as the two-child limit and the benefit cap are not neutral. They deliberately hold back hundreds of thousands of children, restricting support worth £3,500 a year for each third and subsequent child in low-income families. This policy may appear to save money in the short term, but it stores up far greater costs for the future.Childrenwho go to school hungry are more likely to fall behind, and those lost opportunities reverberate through their lives as adults – economically, socially and personally.You only get one childhood. If it is blighted, you may never recover. If so many lives are blighted in this way, the whole of society suffers. There is therefore no route to ending child poverty that does not first end the two-child limit. Scrapping these welfare caps would lift up to half a million children out of poverty overnight.As a church leader, I often reflect on the moral principles that underpin and guide our society. Surely, commitment to children should be something we can all agree on. But I worry about our commitment to the flourishing of every child when we design policies that deny support to so many because of the accident of their birth order. And even if you think that parents should not have more than two children, what is gained by making the child the one who suffers and store up so many more problems for the future?We need creative thinking and ambitious action. But above all, we need the will to make the right choices for our children. The cost of such change is real and must be paid for. Gordon Brownmakes an interesting suggestionthat simply raising a handful of gambling taxes in line with other comparable countries would be a good way to start raising the revenue needed. But if we don’t do anything, the cost of inaction – to the next generation and to our society – will be far greater.Local initiatives such as the Junction Multibank and countless other community and church projects play a vital role in supporting families in crisis. But charity alone cannot solve a problem on this scale. Only government can make the systemic joined-up changes required to reduce poverty and restore dignity.I have three daughters. These are the ways the two-child benefit limit affects us every single day | AnonymousRead moreJesus said, love your neighbour as yourself. How can we tolerate a society where only some children have such opportunity, and so many have none? In one of the richest countries in the world, the level of child poverty in the UK at the moment is quite simply unacceptable. We can do better than this.I already see hope in the compassion and resilience of communities such as the ones I visited inMiddlesbroughlast week, the tenacity and creativity of local church and community leaders, and the generosity of those determined to help. But there is more to do and if we seize this moment, we can turn that hope into change. This must include ending the two-child limit and benefit cap. Other more holistic changes to the benefit system will be needed as well. We must try to take these issues out of party politics and see that it is in all our best interests for children – all children – to have a fair start in life. Because every child, without exception, deserves the chance to thrive.Stephen Cottrell is the archbishop of York and primate of EnglandExplore more on these topicsChild benefitsOpinionChildrenPovertySocial exclusionBenefitsCommunitiesMiddlesbroughcommentShareReuse this content"

Children sit at screens making PowerPoint slides or clicking through apps such as Dr Frost or Quizlet. Lessons are often punctuated by pop-up adverts and cookie-consent banners – the gateway tosurveillance and profiling. Others chase Duolingo streaks, supposedly learning French, scramble coins or fight for leaderboard spots on Blooket. Teachers, meanwhile, are handed dashboards from platforms such as Arbor or NetSupport, where pupils appear as scores and traffic-light charts – a thin proxy for the complexity of classroom life. All the while, these systems are entangled in corporateturf warsand profit-making.Across this work, I’ve seen echoes of the same tactics once used by big tobacco (on health):manufacture doubtto delay regulation and market uncertainty as progress. Parents often feel a quiet unease watching their children absorbed by screens, yet worry that pushing back might leave them behind. That self-doubt is no accident. It mirrors the marketing logic that kept people smoking for decades – big tobacco sowed doubt and turned public concern into private guilt by fundingskewed researchinsisting that there is “not enough evidence” of harm, shifting responsibility on to individuals and pouringvast sums into lobbyingto delay regulation.As these systems scale and cheapen, however, a troubling divideis emerging: mass, app-based instruction for the many, and human tutoring and intellectual exchange reserved for the elite. What is sold as the “democratisation” of education may be entrenching further inequality. Take Photomath, with more300mdownloads: snap a photo of an equation and it spits out a solution. Convenient, yes; no need for a tutor, perhaps – but it reduces maths to copying steps and strips away the dialogue and feedback that help deepen understanding.Amid this digital acceleration,parents’uneaseis not misplaced. The industry sells these tools as progress – personalised, engaging, efficient – but the reality is more troubling. The apps are designed toextract datawith every click and deploy nudges to maximise screen time: Times Tables Rockstarsdoles out coinsfor correct answers; ClassDojo awards points for compliant behaviour; Kahoot! keeps students absorbed through countdown clocks and leaderboards. These are different veneers of the samepsychological leverthat keeps children scrolling social media late at night. Even if such tools raise test scores, the question remains: at what cost to the relationships in the classroom or tochild development and wellbeing?And here the gap between promise and reality becomes clear: for all the talk of equity and personalisation, the evidence base for ed tech is narrow, industry-driven andshaky at best. There’s little record of the time children spend on school devices, what platforms they use, or the impact these have on learning – let alone on wellbeing and development.One study foundthat to achieve the equivalent of a single GCSE grade increase, pupils would need to spend hundreds of hours on one maths app in a year – with no evidence this closed attainment gaps for the least advantaged. The absence of definitive evidence is spun as proof of safety while digital promises are built on the appearance of certainty where none exists.Meanwhile, UK public fundingcontinues to supportclassroom digitisation, with calls for AIeven in early years settings. Schools in England feelpressured todemonstrate innovation even without strong evidence it improves learning. A studypublished this yearby the National Education Union found that standardised curricula often delivered via commercial platforms – are now widespread. Yet many teachers say these systems reduce their professional autonomy, offer no real workload relief and leave them excluded from curriculum decisions.Moreover, all this is wrapped in the language of children’s “digital rights”. But rights are meaningless without corresponding obligations – especially from those with power. Writing privacy policies to meet data privacy lawsisn’t enough. Ed tech companies must be subject to enforceable obligations – regular audits, public reporting and independent oversight – to ensure their tools support children’s learning, a demandwidely echoedacross the education sector.View image in fullscreenA table of high school students holding multiple digital devices.Photograph: Lbeddoe/AlamyIt’s time to ask tougher questions. Why are apps rooted in gamification and behaviour design – techniques developed to maximise screen time – now standard in classrooms? Why is a child’s futurenow assumedto bedigital by default? These are not fringe concerns. They cut to the heart of what education is for. Learning is not a commercial transaction. Childhood is not a market opportunity. As educational theoristGert Biesta reminds us, education serves not only for qualifications and socialisation, but also to support children in becoming autonomous, responsible subjects. That last aim – subjectification – is precisely what gets lost when learning is reduced to gamified clicks and algorithmic nudges.We can’t stop technology from entering children’s lives, but we can demand that it serves education, not industry. My message to parents is this: alongside teachers, your voices are crucial in holding tech companies to account for what they build, how they sell it and the values they embed in classrooms.Dr Velislava Hillman is an academic, teacher, writer and consultant on educational technology and policy.

While Starmer has taken the traditional time off, the Reform UK leader has been in overdrive, fromholding seven(increasingly chaotic) press conferences to featuring inglossy profiles in the broadsheetsand adorning a further 22front pages. Throughout it all, Farage has had the air of a conman seeing how long he can get away with playing at prime minister before anyone notices.That this hasn’t needed to involve any actual governing has suited the I’m a Celeb alumnus perfectly. Rightwing populism breeds on complaints rather than cabinet meetings, with Reform enjoying the media coverage of a major player and the lack of scrutiny of a nonentity. The impact of this has been staggering: concern over immigration – already seen by the public as the most important issue facing Britain – hasshot upeight percentage points since July, according to Ipsos. And that’s before any bounce from Reform’s party conference this week.It is not as if Farage’s PM cosplay has been made difficult for him. He was given free rein to set the agenda this summer by a bored and willing press, with the same editors keen to oversaturate him at any time of year grateful for content to cover the “silly season” (protests by the far right are not the typical definition of silly). Farage has utilised being permitted to spread the myth that migrants are a threat to British women largely unchecked, testing out an ever-more divisive and adversarial racial line (as herecently put itin the Times: “Whose side are you on?”)Few have made it easier for Reform to fill the void than Starmer, who could have hardly done more if he had subletted Downing Street out to Farage and washed the towels. It is not that the prime minister hasn’t been working – last month, he disrupted his family holiday in Scotland tofly to Washington DC– or that he should not have had a break, of course, but that after pushing through thedisastrous welfare bill, the entire government has seemingly disappeared from public view. The most pressing issues – immigration misinformation, far-right mobilisation,starvation in Gaza– have come and stayed in recent weeks with next to no input from our elected leaders.Ministers have been noticeably missing in action from media rounds, with Rachel Reeves – the most recognisable figure on the frontbench after Starmer – out of sight working on the autumn budget. The government in effect put its out-of-office on for August (“Taking time away until September. See you in Liverpool!”) and left the inbox to max out.This has only been compounded by the fact that, on the few occasions Labour has spoken out this summer, it has done so on Reform’s terms. When Farage announced his plan todetain and deportundocumented migrants last week, the Labour party chair, Ellie Reeves,lamented thathe “can’t say where his detention centres will be”, as if the problem with interning human beings en masse is the challenge of finding a big enough car park.The bar has felt so low through the hot restless weeks that you could almost find yourself willing Labour to act, if not as the government, then at least as the opposition. Or to put it another way: it isn’t just that Farage has been allowed to set the agenda for the summer, but that he hasn’t even had to worry about Starmer’s team trying to challenge it. AddKemi Badenoch’s complicity(her critique of Reform’s mass deportation policy was that the party had actually stolen it from the Conservatives), and the result is a political class that has given up its defences to the hard right, or even any pretence of one. We are seeing in real time where this takes a society. On Saturday, a group of masked menattempted to break into a hotelfor asylum seekers in west London.The danger is never simply that the “bad guys” bleed fringe ideas into the mainstream – it is that the “good guys” (whatever that means any more) either do nothing, or worse, embrace them. Capitulation sometimes looks like politiciansadopting ever-more hardlineimmigration policies; sometimes it looks like saying nothing when the other side pitches one. Often, it’s both.A desperate, opportunist press and vicious politicians: no wonder the debate on refugees is so awful | Jane MartinsonRead moreLabour’s summer has been defined by this indifference and inaction, as a government elected on a landslide only a year ago acts as if it were a tired spectator helpless to the political winds (or whichever way Farage and the media choose to blow them). There is a mix of defeatism and despair to it, both about the electorate and the country at large: the notion that Britain – increasingly characterised by the right as lawless, broken and invaded – is already lost.The Labour right has a default get-out clause to this: the only thing that matters is being electable. But that is hardly going well. A YouGovpoll last weekshowed Labour has sunk to its lowest approval rating in six years, with only 20% of the public saying they would vote for the party at the next election. As he returns to work, Starmer isreportedly reshuffling his aidesat No 10 to regain ground. But the real issue is not personnel – it is the project. What is the purpose of a Starmer government? And what courage can he find to deliver it?There is an alternative timeline in which Starmer acted decisively this summer. In this Sliding Doors scenario, the Labour leader stood firm against Israel, pulled the welfare cuts bill and challenged anti-migrant sentiment. It would be easy to be wistful for such an era of humane and fair governance until you remember this is meant to have really happened: the Conservatives were ousted, the “good guys” were elected, the human rights barrister was put in charge. As the weeks pass and the days darken, Starmer will try toregain the spacethat he left wide open. Whether Farage is willing to vacate it is another matter.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While in a sense this is true, the problem with this framing is that it exceptionalises theevents we have seen unfold over the weekend, providing an alibi to “mainstream” Australia.The fact that supposedly legitimate concerns about immigration have aligned so strongly with overt white nationalism highlights the proximity between so-called “extreme” and “mainstream” nationalisms. And this is a problem with which Australia must now contend.To understand the success of March for Australia, an appreciation of the politics of language is crucial. This is because euphemism is a central political strategy of the far right and one they are particularly adept at weaponising – whether to launder their public image or to mobilise political violence.I never thought my race would be under scrutiny here. After the March for Australia protests, how do I feel safe? | Jafrin KabirRead moreFar-right activists will use terms such as “protest” to invoke a sense of legitimate grievance, “anti-immigration” as an obvious dog whistle for racism, and “Australian heritage” or “Australian culture” as a stand-in for ideas of racial purity.Even the word “Australia” itself can be deployed as a euphemism, supposedly invoking something everyone would want to protect and preserve, and in the name of which to mobilise. However, when we consider that one of the National Socialist Network’s slogans is “Australia for the white man”, the euphemism quickly unravels and March for Australia is revealed as “March forWhiteAustralia”.Another place where euphemism was deployed was in the kinds of symbols and imagery used during the march. Pamphlets advertising the event called for the use of all sorts of flags – specifically the Australian, red ensign and Eureka flags.To the everyday ear, that doesn’t sound particularly unusual for an event like this. However, in white supremacist circles, these flags all carry specific meanings which signal an affiliation to white supremacy. For example, the red ensign flag has become a symbol of white nationalism due to its prevalence during the time of the White Australia policy. Similarly, white nationalists have often appropriated the Eureka flag as a symbol of government resistance, denoting opposition to immigration and multiculturalism. Then there is the Australian flag itself, which white nationalists fly upside down to signal the idea that the nation is under attack bydemographic forcesthat pose a threat to the nation’s racial purity. All of these flags and practices dominated the march.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the rally in Melbourne.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianWhile it is easy enough to see through these euphemisms, there is another potential danger, which is that in attempting to reveal the “truth” about events such as March for Australia, critics can fall into a similar pattern.The main way we have seen this occurring in recent days is through the deployment of language that exceptionalises March for Australia.For example, critics will say, “March for Australia isn’t a legitimate protest, it’s just a bunch of far-right extremists and neo-Nazis.”While in a sense they’re not completely wrong, the problem with this framing is that by overemphasising the role and presence of certain individual actors – such as neo-Nazis – the extent to which events such as March for Australia tap into and rely upon widespread and banal forms of racism and nationalism is obscured.To put it simply, the building blocks of March for Australia cannot be confined to discrete actors at the margins of Australian society – such as neo-Nazis. So too we must look at “mainstream” Australia itself.This snaps into focus when you consider the Albanese government can openly condemn the organisers of March for Australia – by saying that multiculturalism is a key part of Australian national identity – inthe same week that the government sign a secret $400m deal with Nauruto deport approximately 350 asylum seekers, de facto reopening offshore detention. There is a structural similarity between these two positions in that both are predicated on the assumed authority to decide who can come to the nation and who cannot along racial lines.Neo-Nazis attack Indigenous protest site after anti-immigration rally in Melbourne as officer allegedly assaulted in SydneyRead moreWith this in mind, March for Australia cannot be blamedsolelyon so-called “extremists”. That too would be a euphemism that obscures the enabling conditions of the events we have seen play out over the weekend.While it is clear that far-right nationalists deploy euphemism to launder their public image and attract support, it is also important to understand that as a strategy, euphemism cuts both ways: it doesn’t just allow far-right messaging to spread unknowingly, but provides an alibi to the “mainstream” who want to participate and with whom their messages resonate.Equally, it is important to understand that critics of the far rightare themselves often invested in laundering the public image of “Australia”. And this is precisely what they are doing when they attempt to explain events such as March for Australia by overemphasising the role of “extreme actors” who are supposedly located only at the fringes of Australian society. What this obscures, of course, is the place they have always occupied at its centre.Dr Liam Gillespie is a lecturer in criminology at the University of Melbourne whose research concerns far-right political violence, ethnic nationalism and white supremacyExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinionProtestRaceFar rightMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Like many Irish citizens, I refuse toMon 1 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 04.17 EDTShareHundreds of people from 44 countries are sailing to Gaza in theGlobal Sumud Flotilla this week. I am among them. We aim to non-violently break Israel’s illegal siege by delivering much-needed supplies. I joined the mission because, as an Irish person, I have watched my government meet what ourtaoiseach acknowledges to be a genocidewith little more than the occasional round of three Hail Marys.In fact, that framing is overly generous. The Irish government is not just passively useless in the face of genocide; it aids and abets the perpetrators. US military planes potentially carrying arms to Israelroutinely pass through Ireland’s Shannon airportwithout inspection. A 2018 Occupied Territories bill originally intended to ban all trade with illegal Israeli settlements is now in its seventh year of legislative limbo, withendless ditheringas to whether it should include services. By Israel’s choice, Ireland’scentral bankis, since Brexit, the sole regulating authority in the EU that approves for trading Israel’s explicitly marketedwar bondsfor sale across the bloc. Selling bonds allows Israel to raise cash internationally that it is openly using to fund its campaign in Gaza. In June, the Irish governmentdefeated a motionto end the central bank’s facilitation of the sale of these bonds. There is a dystopian irony in actively choosing to remain Israel’s “home” country for bonds approval – in the financial terminology –while claiming to condemn its forced dispossessions.Ireland’s solidarity with Palestine is easily romanticised by those abroad and by the Irish ourselves. We take a strange exceptionalist pride in having recognised Palestinian statehood in May 2024, nearly four decades after the first wave of 89 countries did in 1988-89. We were the 142nd country to do so.But the Palestinian activists we claim to stand with are intensely aware of our government’s hypocrisy. At any big protest in Ireland, you’ll hear speakers who’ve recently fledGazacondemning their complicity. Nor does the state’s purely rhetorical support fool those in Northern Ireland; pro-Palestine campaigners there are as critical of Dublin as of the UK government. From many Belfasters’ perspectives, it makes perfect sense that the 26-county republic would collaborate with colonial occupation while paying lip service to hoping it will end.Within the EU, Ireland faces little scrutiny for its complicity in Israel’s war crimes compared with the amount understandably directed at Germany. I was living in Berlin whenIsraelbegan its bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for the crimes of Hamas on 7 October, which themselves occurred after decades of illegal Israeli occupation and a siege on Gaza dating from 2007.I was detained twice by German police simply for being at pro-Palestine demonstrations but I witnessed far worse repression against other protesters, with Muslims especially targeted for violence. German policing of Palestine protests has becomeeven heaviersince I returned to Ireland in January. Last week, a 25-year-old Dubliner, Kitty O’Brien, was twiceviolently assaulted by policeat a Gaza demonstration in Berlin. This violence led to spontaneous protests in Ireland, and expressions of deep concern from the taoiseach and Ireland’s ambassador to Germany.Everyone will have always been against what was happening in Palestine once it’s safely in the past tenseI have found Ireland a less hostile environment to protest in. But the necessity to protest at all comes from my government’s failure to respond on a policy level. There is the illusion of a debate among European countries: we’ve got Germany backing Israel, and countries such as Ireland and Spain (along with Norway) backing Palestine, so let’s see how they resolve it in the grand old marketplace of ideas. This fiction flatters all involved. The countries relatively critical of Israel evade scrutiny for still not having domestically sanctioned it; they’re pushing for this to happen at an EU level, after all. And Germany benefits from a conversation held on the premise that all EU countries maintain economic and diplomatic ties with Israel. Its critics’ authority in condemning the genocide is diluted by their failure to treat it in practice as one.Domestically, Irish campaigning on Palestine is now focused on a 2 September deadline to renew the central bank’s approval of Israeli bonds. The bank already renewed their approval last September, nearly a year into the genocide. The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC) group holds weekly protests on the issue, usually outside the central bank. Another coalition of demonstratorshas committed to “civil disobedience” every weekfor the foreseeable future, with its first actions consisting of stopping traffic in central Dublin. Trade unions have been increasingly involved at protests, including an Irish representative of the Marseille dock workers who have been blocking shipments of military aid to Israel. There is a growing sense in the movement that lobbying is insufficient and that industrial action is needed: the 11 Dunnes Stores retail workers who refused to handle South African produce in 1984 are a frequently cited example and one of them, Mary Manning,spoke at a national IPSC rally last month. If the bank renews the bonds on 2 September, it could well serve as the catalyst.Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has justdivested from five Israeli banks and from Caterpillar,the US construction equipment manufacturer that supplies Israel with bulldozers to destroy Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank. The fund held stakes in 38 Israeli companies as of 14 August, and has not promised to divest in all cases, only to review potential human rights violations. The Spanish government is aiming to pass a full arms embargo against Israel, with Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister, under pressureto recall the country’s ambassador in Tel Aviv. These moves are progressive compared with other EU governments, but lag years behind public opinion.In Ireland, we are all too familiar with our governments acting only once public pressure becomes unsustainable, then peacocking about their progressive credentials. I screamed in frustration when international media fawned over the supposed governmental achievements of our marriage equality and abortion rights referendums being passed in 2015 and 2018 respectively. Both campaigns forced citizens to knock on doors begging our neighbours for our rights, to stay composed when they called us perverts and baby killers. Activists fought for decades before our supposed leaders brought either matter to a vote, and in the case of marriage equality they could have just legislated for it.Everyone will have always been against what was happening in Palestine once it’s safely in the past tense. While it is happening, EU governments stay complicit. Some leaders call it a genocide, some don’t. They allstill trade with its perpetrators.My government can watch the mass murder in Gaza and continue with business as usual. I can’t; that’s why I’m sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla. The broader Global Movement to Gaza behind the flotilla is a massive civilian-led international movement for the Palestinian cause, based on the human need to keep trying. If we reach our destination, we will break a siege that our so-called leaders haven’t dared to even sanction. If we fail, at least our own response to a genocide will not have been to keep regulating the perpetrator’s war bonds.Naoise Dolan is an Irish writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Facts are under assault. Truth is being murdered. The casualty? Trust … making it impossible to govern. Only dictatorships thrive when there’s no trust.And here are the three sentences I’ve said over and over since 2016 when I first said it in Silicon Valley, backed by data and hard-fought experience. Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without trust, we have no shared reality.We can’t begin to solve any problems, let alone existential ones like climate change. We can’t have journalism, we can’t have democracy.In January, as the first speaker to kick off the jubilee year in the Vatican which normally happens once every 25 years, I told Pope Francis that an atom bomb had exploded in our information ecosystem. Just as new technology enabled the rise of fascism in the 1930s, today’stechnology companies are enabling the weaponisation of informationat an unprecedented scale.And here’s what we’ve learned through painful experience: online violence is real-world violence. Tactics that were once used to radicalise the Bali bombers, other extremists and terrorists have now been unleashed on the public at large. The information wars being fought on these platforms don’t stay virtual – they spill into the streets, into voting booths, into policy decisions that shape our world.From Ukraine to Gaza to Sudan to Myanmar, in my part of the world – they’re all connected by the corruption of our shared information ecosystem. Every war, every humanitarian crisis, every environmental catastrophe we face today – thePhilippineshas an average of 20 typhoons every year – is made worse by the systematic destruction of our ability to agree on basic facts.How to Stand Up to a Dictator by Maria Ressa review – tales of a moral giantRead moreThis isn’t hyperbole.I lived through it in the Philippines. Now I’m watching it unfold in real time in America … and it is giving me both deja vu and PTSD.I’m deeply concerned about similar patterns emerging in democracies around the world – including here.Australia sits at a critical juncture.Press freedomis not constitutionally guaranteed in your country but a hyperconcentration of the media combined with occasional pressure from the authorities on media professionals endanger public interest journalism.This makes Australia uniquely vulnerable. Your constitution has no bill of rights. Both the US and the Philippines has a bill of rights so that is not really a solution either, but you have no explicit guarantees of individual freedoms, including freedom of expression. What you have instead is an implied freedom of political communication – a threadbare protection in an age of information warfare.The statistics are sobering. Australia has enacted 82 national security laws since September 11 2001 – more than anywhere else in the world. Many grant the government uniquely severe powers. When combined with defamation laws that make it relatively easy to bring and win suits, you’ve created a perfect storm for the erosion of press freedom.2:23Moment Maria Ressa learns of Nobel peace prize win during Zoom call – videoBut … you’re actually having the conversation that many democracies are not. The “Right to Know” campaign, the calls for a media freedom act, the constitutional referendum proposal – these are signs of a democracy that’s fighting back before it’s too late.The greatest threat we face today isn’t any individual leader or government – it’s the technology that’s amplifying authoritarian tactics worldwide, enabled by democratic governments that abdicated their responsibility to protect the public.Technology platforms have become weapons of mass destruction to democracy. Their algorithms spread infection. An MIT study from 2018 [showed] lies laced with fear, anger and hate spread faster than facts. The business model that rewards engagement over facts has made us all complicit in tearing apart our societies.Australia has a choice to make. You can be leaders in defending democratic values and building the information infrastructure that humanity needs, or you can watch them erode while hoping it won’t happen here.The good news is that Australia has many tools many countries lack. Your public broadcaster, the ABC, maintains relatively high public trust. During your elections, the ABC ran a story about how information warfare poisons chatbots.You have strong journalistic traditions. You have a civil society that’s still mobilising for press freedom.Pass a media freedom act with real teeth. Create shield laws that protect journalists and their sourcesBut you also have vulnerabilities. Media ownership concentration, declining regional news outlets, and thousands of lost journalism jobs have created an information desert in many communities. When local news dies, democracy withers.The proposed media freedom act isn’t just good policy – it’s essential infrastructure for democracy. Just as you wouldn’t build a city without roads or bridges, you cannot build a healthy democracy without robust protections for press freedom.Let me suggest three steps that Australia can take:First, regulate big tech. Thank you, Australia, for your global leadership in your world-first social media ban for children under 16.By placing the burden on social media companies – not parents or children – to prevent underage access, you’ve shifted responsibility where it belongs. These platforms have been experimenting on our children’s developing brains for profit. Your law sends a clear message: there’s a place for social media but there’s no place for predatory algorithms targeting children.But don’t stop there. Australia abandoned its proposed law aimed at tackling disinformation on digital platforms last year. This was a mistake. The human rights we deserve in the physical world, we deserve in the virtual world. Platforms that profit from lies must be held accountable for the democratic damage they cause to users of all ages.Maria Ressa says her Nobel prize is for ‘all journalists around the world’Read moreSecond, build public interest tech. This is where I want to challenge every news organisation in this room. We cannot keep feeding the machine that’s destroying us. At Rappler, we’ve decided that empty promises from big tech are no longer enough. We decided this three years ago. We began building our own tech stack for the virtual world. We’re small. We’re from the global south, but this public interest tech stack, a place where real people can have real conversations without being insidiously manipulated, for power and money, is crucial.Our vision, our ambition is a global federation of news organisations. At least four other independent news groups are joining us before the end of this year. This federation allows us to build a global network of news from the bottom up – an extremely valuable community of trust. Think radical collaboration.Third:, strengthen press protections and invest in truth. Pass a media freedom act with real teeth. Create shield laws that protect journalists and their sources. Establish contestable warrant processes before raids on media organisations. Make press freedom a mandatory consideration in all government decisions.Invest in the infrastructure of truth. Support independent journalism financially. Fund media literacy programs. Create incentives for quality journalism and disincentives for clickbait and disinformation. Make it accountable. Democracy isn’t free – it requires investment.Australia has time that other democracies have squandered. You have advantages that the Philippines didn’t have. You have institutions that America may be losing. The question now is, what will you do with the advantages you have?The choice, ultimately, is yours. But don’t take too long Australia. Democracy’s enemies are not waiting.Maria Ressa is the 2021 Nobel peace prize laureate and CEO and co-founder of Rappler.

He talks about agoraphobia, ADHD and creating ceramic cuddlesEmine SanerMon 1 Sep 2025 11.12 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 13.30 EDTShareIn a cavernous room in an old pottery factory, Johnny Vegas is approaching his work and his face is a delight. “Is it wrong to love your own pieces?” he says, seeing his sculptures for the first time in the place they will be shown, on a table lit by beams of dusty sunlight. Called Just Be There, and made in collaboration with the sculptorEmma Rodgers, each form is the result of two people embracing around a soft clay column. The huggers are mostly from Stoke-on-Trent, where Vegas’s work in the British Ceramics Biennial, one of more than 60 artists included, is being shown. Some are collapsed – thanks to a bear hug. Some are more restrained, the clay holding the imprint of people’s feelings about personal space. They’re robust and beautiful, and Vegas looks absolutely thrilled.The first time he produced a body of work to be on public show, it was for his ceramics degree finals and it ended up accidentally being thrown in a skip. To his tutors’ dismay he insisted on making sculpture rather than the technical ceramics he was supposed to be doing, and had produced a series of abstract female forms. He adds with a laugh: “At our final show, everybody kept writing, ‘I like your candlesticks’.”View image in fullscreen‘Your ideas are valid’ … with mentor Emma Rodgers.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThat, the skip and a third-class degree meant Vegas went off in what he calls “my little huff”, and became a successful comic instead, his former life relegated to a gag (he has sent up the potters’ wheel love scene from the film Ghost more than once). “In a way, I feel I’ve cheated myself,” he says, when we leave his work to be installed. Showbiz, he says, was “a big detour. I never made the time [for art], and I wish I had. I have so much time to make up for.” Now, in his 50s, he is doing just that. Last month’s Channel 4 documentary followed Vegas as he made a public art installation in St Helens, Merseyside, where he lives, and his joint exhibition with Rodgers at Liverpool’s WalkerArtGallery ended in June after more than a year.In the 90s, comedy replaced what he had been trying to do in art. Standup, realised Vegas, “was something I could do on my own creative terms. It’s yours, rise or fall.” Often drunk, unruly and anarchic, his stage personaJohnny Vegaswas a vulnerable but demonic figure – the counterweight to his more anxious and sensitive real self, Michael Pennington. His 1997 Edinburgh show brought awards, attention and, inevitably, TV offers. “Then when you go into TV, everybody has an opinion and that slowly seeps into you.”Whenever I’ve needed it most – in education, in later life – art turned up and rescued meTelevision tamed him. On panel shows, adverts and presenting jobs, the character of Johnny had lost that edge. “You wonder what younger comics make of you,” says Vegas. “As you get older, you also go: how much time have you got left to make a difference? Rather than just have a career, and cling on to it? Don’t make telly for the sake of making telly.” It was the same feeling, he says, that made him not want to sit at a wheel, turning out pots. “I’m really fortunate that whenever I’ve needed it most – in education, in later life – art turned up and rescued me, and gave me a different sense of purpose.”A chance meeting a few years ago with the renowned Wirral-based sculptor Rodgers led to an invitation to spend a day at her studio. She helped Vegas make a Jester, a forlorn figure representing Vegas’s unease. “That was a big point in my career where you’re going, what is success? Where has it took you?” Returning to art was “like this light had come on that had been dimming. There’s still a self-conscious, working-class part of me, but Emma really made me go, ‘you’re an artist, your ideas are valid’.” Vegas now has space in her studio, working in several media including clay, bronze and 3D printing, and Rodgers has become a mentor, chivvying him when he needs it, or making him stop before he goes too far on a piece.View image in fullscreenGlazed and confused … Vegas eyes his efforts.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFor many years Vegas had also been appalled at “the constant decline of art in education”. In 2022, he was diagnosed with ADHD, which explained a lot about his life. As a child, growing up in the 70s and 80s, “I was just seen as this slacker: ‘He refuses to try, or to concentrate.’ But I just wasn’t interested.” Art was what he was interested in – his father, a joiner, lobbied for Vegas to get a place doing A-level art, because of his obsessive drawing – and it worries him that we’re not providing the same opportunities to children today. “If they’re not necessarily academic, but they have gifts that lie elsewhere, they are being ignored. As we’re becoming more neurodiverse aware, we’re stepping further away from something where [many of those] children can excel.”Throughout the time Vegas was considering all this, and his rediscovery of art, the world was afflicted by the pandemic. He spent the first lockdown working out of his local pub, doing food drops for frontline workers and sourcing PPE. “It was the most rewarding thing I’ve done in years,” he says. He was busy, felt useful and his son was living with him (he has two children from two former marriages). The later lockdowns were harder – he spent them in isolation and struggled. He’d had a kiln installed at home but wasn’t creating much. The negative aspects of his then-undiagnosed ADHD “flourished and took over”. He developed agoraphobia which, for someone in the public eye, was particularly difficult. “Never leaving the house, this fear of expectations of what people want. Then everyone was back to the ‘new normal’, and I just couldn’t make the adjustment. It had a much more adverse effect on me than I thought, which is why, I suppose, now a lot of my work is still about re-engaging with people, society, and finding acceptance as ‘Michael’.”I had dream of flying when I was nine. I’ve chased it every sinceThe idea for this current work came out of that period, “of how the first time somebody hugged me, it felt strange. Being so averse to a hug had suddenly become so alien. I want to investigate this idea of reconnection, and I wanted to find a way of capturing moments in time, how people interpret a hug.” A hug can feel overwhelming, or “it just lasts too long with somebody. It can be interpreted like an invasion of space.” Mostly though, he was aiming to express “the robust nature of love” – some of the “huggers” were couples, but others were friends, or parents and children. “I think those pieces are going, ‘Have a bit more faith in what you’ve got around you, family and friends, and society. Don’t give up’.”View image in fullscreenTunnel vision: Vegas looks through his ceramic sculpture.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianVegas is about to tour the live stage show of the beloved cult BBC sitcom Ideal, but he can’t really see a return to standup comedy. “You’ve got to be hungry for it, and right now, I’m hungry for sculpture.” The idea of flight is prevalent in his previous work. The clay form, the result of a hug with his partner Vikki, is daubed with slip which looks like wings. When he was a child, he had a recurring dream he could fly. “And then from about the age of nine I never had that dream again. I think it was the first time I started experiencing anxiety and that replaced that hopefulness. So there’s that I’m always chasing.”Does he care what people think about his work, if they like it or not? “I’ve always cared what people think,” he says. “I think that’s what created Johnny – he became a defence mechanism.” But with art, he says, he craves a debate. “It takes me back to being a teenage student in the pub and people going, ‘Why do I pay my taxes so you can make bloody ashtrays?’ I embraced being an outsider in art. It was the first time that I went, I’m grateful to be different. I don’t want to be a total outcast but I’m grateful that this winds you up, that you would have such a reaction to art.” He laughs and says, “I’m absolutely prepared for somebody to go, ‘You haven’t finished it off. It’s got no handles. Did you drop that?’” In his standup shows, he loved a good heckle, as long as it was considered, rather than plain abusive. The difference with comedy, he says, is “it’s you in a room, with everybody listening, it’s the arena of the unwell. The beauty of making an object and leaving it open to interpretation is far more freeing.”The British Ceramics Biennial is at various venues in Stoke-on-Trent from 6 September to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsJohnny VegasCeramicsSculptureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had to stand on a box’‘I skip one part when we perform it these days. As I’m in my mid-50s it would be creepy’Interviews byChris BroughtonMon 1 Sep 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 19.12 EDTShareNeil Hannon, singer/songwriterHaving made two albums with a chamber vibe, I was thinking, “Where do I go from here?” I started hearing your Suedes and Saint Etiennes, and Blur were referencing stuff from the 60s and 70s too. I could see the way the wind was blowing. That sounds quite knowing, but I already loved John Barry, the Kinks, Adam Faith and, of course, Scott Walker.I’d come up with a very eurocentricchord sequence, not the type you get in rock’n’roll, almost slightly Pet Shop Boys. Watching the 1995 adaptation of Cold Comfort Farm, I noticed that the grandmother’s repeated line, “There’s something in the woodshed,” scanned with the tune I was writing.The conversation between the woman in the song and the would-be Lothario evolved from that line. Of course, the guy gets his comeuppance, because that’s how my mind works. He goes down to the woodshed and the woman’s heavies assault and rob him. It was all a ruse.I returned to my favourite galloping snare drum groove, which had worked well on the last song of the previous album. That had been inspired by a documentary featuring Eurovision songs from the 60s, which included a clip of France Gall singingPoupée de Cire, Poupée de Sonfor Luxembourg. I thought, “That’s the best sound I’ve ever heard!” In those days it was harder to find a song again so I was working from memory. The engineer, Darren Allison, played the drum part and I had to fit everything else over the top as tightly as I could.One of the studios had a Hammond organ, which became the driving force on Weekend. When I said the track needed some giggling at the start, a young fellow working at Setanta said, “I’ll get my sister to bring a friend.” I put them in a little booth and they started giggling out of nervousness. Me doing that sort of Terry-Thomas voice was recorded separately. I skip that when we perform the song live these days – I’m in my mid-50s, it would be creepy.There hadn’t been any money for Divine Comedy singles before, but Keith Cullen, head of Setanta, knew that not promoting this song would be cutting off his nose to spite his face. We made a video in Venice. It was the first time I ate tiramisu. I thought, “My God, I’m living the life now!” They hired a statuesque Italian model to hang around with me, looking cool, but she was a foot taller than me. In the shots where you see us side by side on a boat, I was standing on a box.Chris Evans said something on his Radio 1 breakfast show about having been blown away by a song he’d heard at a friend’s house, by Divine something-or-other. My plugger, listening in the shower, battled travel chaos as he rushed to get a copy to the studio. He handed it in about 10 minutes before the show ended, and Chris played it twice.I was in a cab while doing promo in Paris when I heard we’d made number 14 on the UK charts. I don’t think I’ve ever been more excited. Super Furry Animals had an album out with a song of the same name. They changed it toSomething 4 the Weekendwhen they released it as a single a fortnight after ours, but their singer Gruff Rhys later gave me aRobin Sarstedt LPhe’d found in a charity shop that proved someone had beaten us both to the title by decades.Joby Talbot, orchestratorA friend had been playing cello with Neil, who asked him if he knew anyone who played oboe and piano. I remember meeting him and thinking, “Wow, he’s wearing eye makeup! What a rock and roll thing to do.” It turned out he had two black eyes after being punched in the face by a French journalist.For the Casanova album, Neil made demos on a four-track recorder. I’d take manuscript paper to whichever squalid garret he was sleeping on the sofa at and notate each part, so we could go into a studio and record it. We’d get a couple of days here, a couple there, and would be begging for more time as we bounced from one studio to another – it was a ludicrous way to make a record.I really just scored what Neil had demoed and tarted it up a bit. I conducted the strings, but I’m there in spirit more than performance, though I was one of the people who gathered round a mic to record the “Aaaaah-whooooo!” that leads into each verse.At the time, I was studying composition at the Guildhall and many people who played on the record were friends from there – the touring band was put together later. Robin Smith, who I got in to play the trumpet leading into the first verse, did take after take – his lips were turning blue. Eventually he said, “Look, I’ve been here for hours, I think I’m done.” Neil piped up over the headphones, “There’s another 20 quid in it if you can hit that high note,” which seemed to give him the impetus he needed. I guess that’s a lesson in how to deal with brass players.We were touring medium-sized venues in the French provinces when we got the call to appear on that week’s TFI Friday. We had to postpone three gigs, whiz back to London, grab a shower and rush to the soundcheck, having found a trumpeter, string players and someone to hit the tubular bells at short notice.I remember Neil being taken aside beforehand and given a pep talk by two girls from the record company: “Don’t mess this up.” His face was even greyer than usual. We managed one rehearsal, then there we were on live national TV. That changed everything. Until then, we couldn’t get arrested in the UK but we went straight back on tour and were being booked for every festival going.The Divine Comedy’s album, Rainy Sunday Afternoon, is out on 19 September. They tour from17 September to 25 October. The Royal Ballet’s Like Water for Chocolate, composed by Joby Talbot, is at theRoyal Opera House, London, 1-24 October.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Get the popcorn ready for a preposterous world of locked rooms, creepy gardeners … and bodiesLucy ManganMon 1 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareThe writer Matthew Barry and director Ashley Way gave us one of the highlights of 2023’s television output inMen Up, a witty, moving, compassionate treat of a drama about the development of the drug that would become known as Viagra and the group of Welshmen who were among its first guinea pigs.Their new offering is a more straightforward one, and if it doesn’t achieve the same success Men Up did, they can hardly be condemned for having set their bar so high.The Guest is a fast, furious, preposterous thriller of the kind that you can only pull off if everyone involved in its creation and consumption approaches it without an ounce of cynicism. Barry, Way and the high-calibre cast hold up their end of the bargain, delivering bags of propulsive plot. Viewers must hold up theirs via uncritical acceptance of the multiple twists, and bring along enough metaphorical or actual popcorn for the ride.Thus will happiness ensue as we embark on the tale of young have-not Ria (Gabrielle Creevy, in a really fine performance that does much to prevent the whole thing flying off the rails). She is working as a cleaner for various horrible people who fire her as soon as someone cheaper comes along (“If you’re going to be funny about it, let’s just call it a day, shall we?”), supporting Lee (Sion Daniel Young), the deadbeat boyfriend she has had since school, and stealing food so she can pay their rent on a grim illegal sublet while he complains about the lack of jobs. Into this unrewarding life arrives Fran (Eve Myles), a rich, self-made businesswoman and apparent fairy godmother. She offers Ria a four-day-a-week cleaning job at her luxurious mansion for decent wages and gives her inspirational speeches, which stir the longings and ambitions in Ria that have lain dormant since her mother died while Ria was still at school.View image in fullscreenThings quickly get more twisted and more intense … Eve Myles and Gabrielle Creevy in The GuestPhotograph: BBC/Quay Street Productions/Simon RidgwayOf course, Fran could be all benevolence, but a glimpse of a shadowy figure in the supposedly empty guesthouse, and the ominous strings scoring every scene Fran is in, tell the astute watcher otherwise, even before the aged gardener, Derek (Clive Russell), tells her to get out of there while she still can. It’s probably his memory going, though. It’s almost certainly nothing to do with the permanently locked room in the mansion, the imports Mr Fran is constantly sourcing abroad and sending home, or Fran having an affair with Derek’s son. Nor dropping hints about domestic violence or insisting that her childlessness is a happy choice she made so that she and her unsettling husband could concentrate on the business.Soon, Fran is offering her more money, more responsibility, more inspirational speeches, more clothes from her wardrobe, giving her pills from her stash and installing Ria in the guesthouse. She also encourages her protege to join dating apps to see what improvements Ria can make on the boyfriend situation now that Fran has shown her what she’s truly worth. A guy called Mike Rice (Joseph Ollman) seems nice!Not that Ria is a sap. She has an instinct for self-preservation (quietly whipping out her phone to record Fran and her lover shagging in the kitchen, though this may just be a reminder to double-Dettol the place rather than as future blackmail material) and enough smarts to keep her from being the kind of heroine you find yourself shouting at in frustration.With a sense of glorious inevitability, we move into a world of broken banisters and bodies, Instagram clues, police suspicions, hidden diaries, rolls of ready cash and more, while Fran and Ria’s relationship grows more twisted, more intense. The question of quite how dangerous it is to know each of them becomes more pressing.Oh, I almost forgot (I’m sorry – there is alotgoing on)! What of the previous cleaner, Anna, who was also promoted to Fran’s assistant, given a makeover, supplied with lots of pills and installed in the guesthouse? Why would anyone give that cushy number up? I’m sure there is not a reasonable explanation, and you will be too if you’ve gone into this with the right attitude, as recommended above.All four ridiculous, well-played, well-paced episodes slip down a treat. There’s nothing hugely earth-shattering or innovative here – apart from the sheer volume of plot contained therein – but you will have fun. That much I promise you.The Guest aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

What was the effect on you of living with a mother who was mad?” Ginsberg’s answer, mildly inflected by a laugh, is: “It gave me a great sort of … tolerance for eccentric behaviour.”Arundhati Roy, whose memoir is partly an account of her life with her mother Mary Roy, might recognise this insight. Arguably, all mothers appear to their children as mad: madness here meaning an unbounded force, at odds with what society imagines normal parenting to consist of. The manifestations of this madness are as disparate as those of love, and these two aspects – the abnormal, the overbearing, and the protective, the nurturing – can be, in our mothers, intimately intertwined (“She was my shelter and my storm,” writes Roy). It is through loving and depending on the mysterious and incomprehensible that we come to “tolerate”, even embrace, the strangest thing of all: life itself.Mary Roy was a kind of visionary, but she seemed to drive people around her mad, as well as being frequently driven mad by them. A Christian from Kerala, she escaped her parents by marrying a member of the Bengali bourgeoisie, known to his friends as Micky Roy, before leaving him when he became an alcoholic, “a Nothing Man”. She took her children, Arundhati and her brother Lalith, to a “cottage that belonged to our maternal grandfather” in Tamil Nadu, but came up against her family’s invocation of a law governing inheritance in her community: “daughters had no right to their father’s property and we were to leave the house immediately”. Finally they came to Aymanam, a village in Kerala (spelled “Ayemenem” by Roy, recognisable as the village inThe God of Small Things), staying first with their family, “extraordinary, eccentric, cosmopolitan people, defeated by life”, before once more falling out with them. Mary then set up her own home and, eventually, a school that developed a national reputation.Mary seemed to be perpetually at war, often for no clear reason, with her children, especially her daughterMary Roy’s years of doing battle allowed her to leave two remarkable legacies: her school, but also the case she eventually fought against her family, which went all the way to the supreme court, and resulted in the annulment of the discriminatory inheritance law. In the meantime, she seemed to be perpetually at war, often for no clear reason, with her children, especially her daughter: “In my effort to fathom my mother, to see things from her perspective … to understand what hurt her, what made her do the things she did … I turned into a maze … hoping to gain a vantage point for a perspective other than my own.”This attempt to understand the compulsion to love what seems hostile transforms Roy’s writing, lending her prose, especially in the first 130 or so pages, an unprecedented freedom. An astringent conscience-keeper in the political sphere, she finds herself, with her mother as the subject, on terrain that tests her in quite a different way. We discover, in these sections, an ability to transition between contraries, a fluency that is less “empathy” than something unpredictable and alchemical. Note, for example, the paradoxically liberating role the word “fortunately” plays in this sentence about her mother, brother, and herself: “He remembered being loved. Fortunately, I didn’t.” Or the defiantly jubilant assertion, “I loved killing them”, about the lice the family help would comb out of her hair.The world described in the first part of the book provides much of the material for The God of Small Things. But these pages aren’t significant for giving us access to Roy’s inspiration, or as a preamble to her life as a bestselling writer who would go on to become an oppositional political voice. Even if she were none of these things or had never written her novel, they would be utterly absorbing. They have a wonderful, self-assured self-sufficiency.In the late 1970s, Roy escaped her mother, arriving in Delhi and enrolling in the School of Planning and Architecture there. At this point the memoir also bears witness to a world-historical shift: the receding of a kind of modernity and politics which had given rise to experimental lives and ways of thinking. Both Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, despite the great gulf between their backgrounds and world views, embodied the open-endedness made possible by such experimentation. So did Mary Roy and her brother George Isaac in their various projects and vicissitudes. I’d also situate Micky Roy in this context: one of the funniest, most moving sections in this book has to do with Arundhati’s reunion with her father in a hotel in Delhi: “He was lying on his stomach with his knees bent, his feet waving at the ceiling.”This shift ultimately created the world we inhabit today. Even before the precipitous slide towards the far right now evident almost everywhere, there was the feverish globalisation that engendered a liberal elite just as bizarre as any of its political opponents. These changes are – explicitly and implicitly – the subject of the second half of the book. They are woven into Roy’s continual, courageous confrontations with the nation-state, including her criticism of its nuclear policies and opposition to Sardar Sarovar dam. Roy lovesIndiadeeply, but the nation-state isn’t India, and it doesn’t love her back. The conflict is comparable to, albeit profoundly different from, her relationship with Mary Roy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

That success was akin to an inheritance left to a writer in the 18th century by an obscure uncle: something Roy benefits from but whose meaning she must also grapple with. In the midst of this, Mary Roy re-enters her daughter’s life, the mother delighted by Arundhati’s celebrity, but also puncturing it occasionally with Dadaist zeal.

He talks about the joy of those early 60s pictures – and why they never made him richCharlotte JansenMon 1 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 1 Sep 2025 03.53 EDTShareBlack-and-white street shots of elegant, unimpressed elderly women. Classic cars in shadows cast by New York’s soaring tenement buildings. Street-corner preachers. Imposing wiseguys too busy posturing to notice the camera. Stephen Shore’s new book,Early Work, is full of such everyday New York moments turned into magic. Though he later won acclaim for thephotographs he took at Andy Warhol’s studio/hangout the Factory, the previously unseen Early Work may be some of Shore’s most uninhibited and daring pictures – and they were taken in the early 60s, when he was a teenager.Perhaps it’s understandable, then, that the photographer, now 77, can’t really remember taking them – though he does recall that he printed them himself, in a DIY darkroom set up in the bathroom of his parents’ home on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. “The memory of the prints I made then is hard to separate from the memory of the actual event of taking the photograph,” he admits over the phone. “I don’t remember what was on my mind then, but what I see looking at them now is a kind of formal awareness, which I guess I understood intuitively. I understood from the beginning that a camera doesn’t point, it frames. I also understood the gap between the world of the photograph and the world we experience – the world of the photograph has to make sense on its own, out of context.”View image in fullscreen‘I see a photographer observing the people and the city’ … Stephen Shore, from Early Work.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackHe does remember how he took a series of shots from an unusual high angle, a kind of giant’s eye view of passersby – as if the voracious young photographer were trying to grasp his home city from every possible perspective, to make himself big enough to understand it. “I put a very wide-angle lens on my Leica and held the camera over my head and took pictures randomly.”People were out on the street experiencing each other – not scrolling through TikTokThe idea for Early Work came after Shore returned from Rhinebeck Village in upstate New York, whereupon his studio manager Laura Steele presented him with a stack of prints made from his archive. The picture on top depicted Shore’s parents standing on a street corner – in Rhinebeck. Though Shore has lived nearby since the early 1980s, “I had no idea I had been there before.” The picture appears on the back cover of the book and is the one in the collection Shore is most attached to. Aside from sentimental reasons, it prefigures the formal concerns he would explore aged 23, when he travelled across the US with an 8x10 camera, taking the photographs that appear in his lauded bookUncommon Places, an expansive portrait of America’s diners, gas stations and national parks.View image in fullscreen‘I had no idea I’d been there before’: Stephen Shore’s parents in Rhinebeck.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackLooking through Early Work, it is remarkable how uninterested Shore seems to be in people his own age. Most of his subjects are over 40. Their generation, he points out, had lived through the Great Depression and the second world war – many were veterans trying to return to regular life in the city. The pictures suggest a reverence and respect for their authority, though Shore can’t remember whether he was feeling this when he took them. “I see a photographer observing the people and the city, observing their inner state, how they interact, looking at social and cultural meanings,” he says. “People who are drawn to the medium of translating the world into an image tend to be fascinated by the world.”Stephen Shore: ‘People would chase me off their lawns with my Leica’Read moreShore’s documentation of 1960sNew Yorkinevitably reveals how social habits have changed over the decades. “The city is crowded now, but people don’t hang out in the same way,” he says. “People were out on the street experiencing each other, engaging with each other and feeling free to roam the city, not scrolling through TikTok.” The pictures also convey a sense of liberation perhaps less accessible to New York kids today. “Parents were not as protective and determining of their children’s activities,” Shore says. “When I was eight and living in Manhattan, I went to school downtown alone on two different buses. That was typical in the 1960s.”It was Shore’s uncle Leo who introduced him to photography. Recognising his nephew’s nascent interest in chemistry, he gave Shore a Kodak ABC Darkroom Outfit as a sixth birthday present – a simple kit for making contact prints at home, complete with developing trays and chemicals. By 1962, the 14-year-old Shore had signed up to take photography classes at New York’s New School, where he studied briefly under the great Austrian American photographerLisette Model– whose influence can be seen in the confrontational approach and bold attitude of some of Shore’s shots of people on the street.View image in fullscreen‘Pictures sold for nothing – if they sold’ … Stephen Shore, from Early Work.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackHe became involved in a photography community who would get together once a month to critique each other’s work. “You’d get a little slip of paper in an envelope with a time and date for the meeting,” he remembers. “It was like a secret society – except we didn’t have any pretensions to exclusivity.”Photographywas hardly ever exhibited at museums or galleries at the time: “There was absolutely no notoriety involved in being a photographer, there was no remuneration, pictures sold for nothing – if they sold. Some people are drawn to the medium without any possibility of fame or fortune.”MoMA was one of the few New York art institutions to take photography seriously enough to have a curator dedicated to it,Edward Steichen, and at 14 Shore called him up, which led to MoMA acquiring three of Shore’s photographs. In 1971, Shore became the first living photographer to have a solo exhibition at the Met. Despite being awarded two prestigious fellowships in 1975 and a subsequent solo show at MoMA the following year, his pictures sold for as little as $125 each. Shore got by financially thanks to teaching – he has been the director of the photography department at Bard College, New York, since 1982. “I’ve taught every generation from X to Z.”View image in fullscreenA diner with Shore reflected in the window.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and MackEarly Work ends with pictures Shore took on his very first day at the Factory. He and Warhol had met at a screening where the latter premiered his underground movie The Life of Juanita Castro and Shore presented a 16mm film, Elevator. He would spend three years photographing the Factory almost daily, capturing “superstars” such as Edie Sedgwick, its house band the Velvet Underground, and the groundbreaking work its impresario was making. Warhol, Store says, “was always friendly and direct. He was 20 years my senior and would, if I said something inappropriate in a situation, correct me, somewhat like an older relative giving guidance, but otherwise he treated me as a friend.” As Shore was the only other person in the group who lived on the Upper East Side, “when we broke up for the evening, perhaps two in the morning after a late supper in Little Italy or Chinatown, Andy and I would share a taxi uptown. We had totally unguarded conversations.” Many of the Factory regulars were gay, as was Warhol, but “he understood that I was straight – and this was never an issue”.Factory records: Andy Warhol’s 1960s captured by Stephen Shore – in picturesRead moreWhile Shore got unprecedented access to the Factory, the pictures he took there lack the expansive experimentation and lucidity of Shore’s street shots. You can sense the photographer, still only a teenager, feeling his way into a new world. In his 20s, Shore would become one of the defining photographers of postwar America, but Early Work shows that his ability to articulate the mood of his country in images was present right from the start. “Painters start with a blank canvas and make marks to add complexity; photography is the opposite – you start with the whole world,” he says. “I don’t know what to do with a blank paper – but put me on a street corner and my imagination goes off!”Stephen Shore: Early Workis published by Mack on 1 September, £55Explore more on these topicsPhotographyStephen ShoreNew YorkAndy WarholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is one of the very few golden age stars still with us, and maybe the title of this film is a playful pun: at the very apex of Hollywood history, perhaps Novak feels dizzy looking down from her mythic height.Philippe himself is more than qualified for this kind of intensely personal exegesis, having in the past made intriguing films aboutDavid Lynch’s debt to The Wizard of Ozand about thePsycho shower scene. With a touch of mischief and misdirection, he begins his film by simply playing a voice note that Novak has sent him, in which she talks sombrely about her health issues and about how much time she has left. She does sound poignantly frail. Then you see her in person and she is sensational; articulate, vibrant, youthful in ways that have nothing to do with cosmetic work, very engaged with the questions that Philippe puts to her – but concerned also to discuss her own life and personality, particularly her interest in painting and what she owes to her parents. And, of course, she has something to say about the most germane issue of all: how Hollywood, and society in general, imposes its male views on how a woman should look and behave, a trope famously embodied by Novak in Vertigo.Novak conducts her interview with Philippe at home, a conversation interspersed with clips and home-movie archive footage – but what makes it so absorbing is that Novak has been persuaded to open up boxes of personal material, live on camera, that she has not looked at for 60 years. And the climax comes when she gingerly prises off the lid of a box to find inside thegrey two-piece suit that she worefor James Stewart’s Scottie in Vertigo. She even sniffs it to “find out if it smells of me”. For old Hollywood fetishists, that’s a real showstopper.Novak, who is of Czech heritage, began her career in her early 20s at Columbia Pictures, under the whip of studio chief Harry Cohn, who used an ugly racist epithet about her. (Cohn himself was reputedly subject to an antisemitic outburst from Walt Disney.) Cohn was irritable about any residual foreignness in the new acting name that would be assigned to her. Originally Marilyn Novak, she was renamed Kim with Cohn’s agreement and, perhaps oddly, the film does not talk about the other Marilyn. Novak herself talks about her passionate admiration for Greta Garbo, though two more different personalities can hardly be imagined.In the 1950s, Novak made the noir Pushover with Fred MacMurray, the romantic romp Phffft with Jack Lemmon, Pal Joey with Frank Sinatra and the stridently dramatic Jeanne Eagels with Jeff Chandler. Later, before her retirement in the 60s, she made bold and interesting choices with Of Human Bondage with Laurence Harvey and Robert Aldrich’s The Legend of Lylah Clare. For each of these (relatively) lesser-known films, it is possible to make the case that she gave a more animated and more interesting performance than the one she was most famous for: the tormented leading lady of Alfred Hitchcock’s great mystery thriller, who is often eerily still and trancelike. Novak herself has felt the corseted pressure of being a consciously created enigma.This is a very watchable and pleasurable film, though I was disappointed that Novak, despite speaking a lot about Stewart, had so little to say about Hitchcock himself. (Perhaps Philippe will now want to interview those other legendary Hitchcock survivors: Eva Marie Saint, 101, and Tippi Hedren, 95.) Either way, Novak shows herself to be a fierce, even heroic, figure.Kim Novak’s Vertigo screened at the Venice film festivalExplore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDocumentary filmsAlfred HitchcockThrillersVertigoFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2000, this cartoon-fronted project seemed like something fun for Damon Albarn to do between Blur albums, hiding behind Jamie Hewlett’s comic-book animations, but they’ve overtaken Blur almost everywhere but Britain. The number of children in the audience testifies to Gorillaz’s powers of self-rejuvenation – an ever-changing vehicle for Albarn’s ceaseless curiosity.Gorillaz are marking the occasion with an immersive exhibition, House of Kong, and four era-specific shows. This second night revives 2005’s Demon Days. Co-produced by Danger Mouse, it remains the most satisfying expression of the Gorillaz concept: focused in both its themes (innocence and violence) and personnel (rappers and the rap-adjacent). Dressed like a hip vicar, Albarn serves double duty as a frontman and a conscientious host, although the original cast of vocalists is inevitably depleted. The late MF DOOM and awol Shaun Ryder appear only on screen, while Skye Edwards replaces Martina Topley-Bird on All Alone. Thank goodness for the old-school stalwarts. Bootie Brown enters Dirty Harry like a red-and-white firework before De La Soul boom and cackle through Feel Good Inc.View image in fullscreenGorillaz with London Community Gospel Choir at Copper Box Arena, London.Photograph: Phoebe FoxStraight replication, though, is not the point. Beneath Hewlett’s helter-skelter videos, the band, choir and string quartet give the songs new mass and drama. O Green World builds to a startling frenzy and the climactic title track blossoms gloriously. As stained-glass windows fill the screen and the London Community Gospel Choir chant the cathartic refrain, “To the sun”, Albarn’s vicar gear suddenly makes sense. The encore of three contemporary B-sides, while admirably disciplined, is somewhat anticlimactic. The luminous Hong Kong, starring theguzhengvirtuoso Qing Du, ends the night on a melancholy question mark rather than an exclamation point.Then again, the singles notwithstanding, Demon Days isn’t exactly a party record. This product of the Bush-and-Blair years was pitched as “the world in a state of night,” drawing inspiration from horror soundtracks and the Specials’ queasy crisis-pop. The show opens with a wartorn newsreel montage and sporadically drenches the crowd in hell-red light. For obvious reasons, the album’s haunting protest against humanity’s appetite for destruction – of people and planet alike – sounds no less apt tonight. Demon days are here again.Explore more on these topicsGorillazPop and rockHip-hopRaplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now the criminal code reference has become a catch-all term forNigerian consand illicit financial activity.The most famous form 419 takes in the west is the internet con, also known asthe Spanish Prisoner, where the target (or “mark”) is offered a sizable cut from a sum of money that needs to be transferred out of the country, often by someone claiming to be working for a bank or a powerful figure (posing as thebrother of the Nigerian dictator Sani Abachawas a popular tactic in the 00s). But in Nigeria the term has a universal meaning. “It covers everything,” Ellams tells me. “From a five-year-old trying to get extra sweets from his parents to a businessman embezzling money from his company.”View image in fullscreenIt’s all connected … a market seller in Lagos.Photograph: Oluwamuyiwa ‘Logor’ LogoThe playwright first noticed the signs back in 2013. He had been in town to research his hit playBarber Shop Chronicles, the award-winning tale about African men and their relationships, when the seed for his latest project was planted.That project is The 419, a series of photographic portraits by Oluwamuyiwa “Logor” Logo and sonnets written by Ellams that combine to tell the story of how money and 419 culture weaves into every facet of Lagosian life. Actors will record Ellams’s sonnets so that you can hear the images “speak” as you gaze at them.Four one nine is the lubricant that greases the wheels of Nigerian localised capitalismThe story starts with Zaria, an area boy – a thug for hire – who sells weed, before we meet a trader called Ronke who needs a guide to get her through a local market. Things slowly move up the food chain of Lagosian society to show how the lives of work-site foremen, architects and even a governor are all connected by the money that flows through the country. “Four one nine is the lubricant that greases the wheels of Nigerian localised capitalism,” says Ellams.Logor’s portraits will hang on the walls of the West Wing gallery at Somerset House in London and depict real-life Lagosians who Ellams met and interviewed and whose stories he stitched together into sonnets. Those verses bind together as a crown of sonnets – meaning each opening line can be combined to create a new sonnet. The language evolves as the story progresses and the subjects become more middle class and managerial, as pidgin makes way for more formal English. It’s a fittingly intricate setup for a work that unpicks a byzantine world of money, bartering and power.Ellams and Logor aren’t the first people to find inspiration inthe phenomenon of Nigeria’s informal economy. In 2000, the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argued in his bookThe Mystery of Capitalthat the key to unlocking Nigeria’s potential lay in formalising the informal economy that 419 scams help to power.But Ellams’s new work has a different approach: perhaps, it posits, we’ve been thinking about 419 offences all wrong. What if this extra-legal system of money and power is entirely logical in a country without the kind of welfare state that Europeans take for granted?View image in fullscreen‘Somewhere it got corrupted’ … Ellams.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images“The more I went back to Nigeria as an adult, the more I realised that what we termed as 419 often is the necessity of surviving in a country where there isn’t any sort of social safety net,” he says. “And there’s always this need to try and make more money to survive, literally to survive.”Ellams has a work-in-progress theory about the evolution of 419 in Nigeria. He thinks that the tradition of always ensuring you didn’t turn up to someone’s house empty-handed (a yam, or other produce, was expected as a gift) has morphed into the contemporary “cash is king” culture.“I suspect that when capitalism came, the demand or the expectation for goods became the expectation for cash, then became ademandfor cash,” he says. “Somewhere it got corrupted.”The repurcussions of 419 culture are huge, linking the country with a reputation for corruption. The former prime minister Boris Johnson wrote in a Spectator column that young people had “an almost Nigerian interest in money”, while the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announcedthat she no longer sees herself as Nigerian.“There are several things I think about Badenoch, none of them are good,” says Ellams. “I think she’s suffered various identity crises, which have only deepened since she became leader of the Conservative party. And I think in her appeal to be more British, she’s trying to cut off things that are undivorceable from her being, from her physical being, from her identity.”What does Ellams hope people take away from The 419? “Art at its most primal is simply a mirror,” he says. “It just shows you who you are and asks you to confront the world. And that’s what I’m trying to say: these are individuals, they live in a different place. That different place requires them to act in a specific way. How would you act if you were in those exact situations?”The 419 is at Somerset House, London, 9-14 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designPoetryPhotographyNigeriaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He expands on the texts of a small but varied selection of authors, making the original a launch-pad to his uniquely different and contemporary planet.Anabase, bySaint-John Perse, translated from French to English by TS Eliot, has a particular hold on his imagination in this collection. In fact, its epigraph is from Anabase, canto 1:“et la mer au matin comme une présomption de l’esprit.”Eliot, the endnote reveals, translated this initially as “and the sea at morning like a pride of the spirit” before revising it to “and the sea at morning like a presumption of the mind”. Here’s the sea-phrase in its later context: “This husk of earth given over to our horses / delivers to us this incorruptible sky. The Sun is unmentioned but his power is amongst us / and the sea at morning like a presumption of the mind.”Perse’s 10-part allegory is set as prose, but, introducing it, Eliot is very firm in asserting it to be a poem: “Its sequences, its logic of imagery are those of poetry, not of prose.” He complains of the lack of an adequate term for such writing. The gap remains un-filled today: although we’d now want to mention the ‘prose-poem’ and, perhaps, the ‘lyric essay’, Perse’s sequence represents a distinct form.Anabase, also referred to as Anabasis,can be found here. In Anabase, IV, the “conqueror” who was only contemplating the building of a city in its first canto, has now reached the moment of its founding. McDonald dispenses with ancient grandeurs and takes us straight to the contemporary urban car park and the unfortunate gannet. Perse’s possibly mythical seabird is a very different creature. It appears only briefly at the end of the section. It seems to have made a lucky escape from the triumphant expressions of human achievement.From the perspective of McDonald’s speaker, the fun is nearly over for Earth’s conquerors. “Not the street-parties day and night tomorrow / But the morning after that.” We can assume that “the morning after” is now, or a period not far into the future, and it represents some wretched aftermath. There has been serious destruction – of “palm-trees” and “enormous wings” – for the bin-men to start “redding” up. The Scottish verb means “to make tidy”, but, as sound-association, it evokes the dropping of blood from the maimed wings. The morning light is lurid, the air “heavy” and threatening. The sight of the deformed gannet, a bird which has either suffered a horrible injury or represents some equally horrible genetic mutation, changes before our eyes, from “beautiful bird” to “beautiful ugly bird”. It may, likeBaudelaire’s l’Albatros, also symbolise human forms of alienation.The bright treasure plucked from Anabase is the “single blue egg” of the second single-line verse, on which Solitude ends. This is Perse: “Solitude! the blue egg laid by a great sea-bird, and the bay-leaves at morning all laden with gold lemons! Yesterday it was! The bird made off!” Such rhetoric seems to indicate the conqueror’s excited ambition for further exploration and conquest. It belongs to a moment when rich achievement is gloried in, but with a certain sense of emptiness, a hunger that asks for more. In the paraphrase, there is a different note altogether, a sense that the bird has laid its egg at the wrong time and in the wrong place – a damp, grubby, exposed car-park with a storm on the way. The literary origins of the paraphrase are never stressed, but it’s their visibility in the last line which heightens the tragedy. The solitude of the title becomes overwhelming. The bird will die. The egg will fail to hatch. There will be no migration, no anabasis. Although the colour of the gannet’s egg may hint at a mythological being, I felt bereft at the end of the poem, as if I’d been made to witness the extinction of a species.Peter McDonald’smemorably read selection from One Little Roomincludes Solitude.

It is a vehement, fervent, striking but sometimes baffling drama about thehistorical figure of Ann Lee, who endured religious persecution in 18th-century England as leader of the fundamentalist Shaker movement.As the embodiment of Christ’s second coming, Lee took her radical message to the New World and in pre-revolutionary America founded an enduring community of souls, persecuted all over again by the new patriarchy for being a woman and a pacifist. Her Shakers were known among other things for their skill in stylishly elegant and minimalist furniture – although the connection with Christ’s profession is unstressed. Lee is played byAmanda Seyfried, with Lewis Pullman as her brother William and Christopher Abbott as her oppressive husband Abraham, who appears to be partial to a bit of BDSM where he gets to be a Christian dom in the marriage bed.The movie looks sometimes like a Lars von Trier nightmare of ironised martyrdom, or a Robert Eggers horror film like The Witch, and then sometimes like a weird but spectacular Broadway musical melodrama, in which the shaking and shivering of the dancing faithful – ecstatically submitting to divine joy – is shaped into a choreography not unlike the musical Stomp. Atheists and rationalists in the audience might be tempted to ask … well … whatisthe testament of Ann Lee exactly? What is her message, her legacy for the 21st century?The answer would appear to be simply this: she established a Christian sect. (Some statistics about follower numbers are given over the closing credits.) Lee fiercely believed that all sex was wrong, and a wicked distraction from the spiritual. No follower in this film is so disloyal as to ask how then is humanity to be saved from dying out? Is it simply a matter of letting people outside the faith keep humanity going with their deplorable activities and the resulting children can be brought into the fold? And the shaking, the shivering, the speaking in tongues, to a modern audience, this will obviously look like collective hysteria and sexual repression, but the film cannot exactly bring itself to endorse this obvious diagnosis, because it wants us to take Lee seriously at some level.Yet Fastvold is arguably justified in wanting to show that this sexual repression generated enough redirected energy to take a religious group all the way from Manchester to colonial New York, and to make a real contribution to the new enlightenment and the debate over liberty. Lee shouts “Shame!” at a slave auction in this New World of liberty for white people, though it doesn’t occur to her to make abolitionism part of her Christian mission.This is a genuinely strange film, elusive in both tone and meaning, one which deploys the obvious effects and rhetorical forms of irony, while at the same time distancing itself from these effects and asking its audience to sympathise and even admire Lee, because she is not supposed to be the villain. Fastvold is perhaps asking her audience to take whatever elements from the film they find congenial. An enigmatic ritual that is not for everyone.The Testament of Ann Lee screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsVenice film festivalDrama filmsBiopicsChristianityPeriod and historical filmsThe BrutalistAmanda SeyfriedreviewsShareReuse this content"

Composed primarily of a series of corrida at which Peruvian star matador Andrés Roca Rey performs, this is an extremely tough watch for those with any kind of sympathy for animal rights. Director Albert Serra –lauded for his 2022 thriller Pacifiction– is not especially interested in the lives of the bulls, who all die desultory deaths, depicted with horrible intimacy here. What is even more shocking is the abuse and contempt heaped on them by the toreros. “Go join your fucking mother cow,” says one to a convulsing victim.Rather, Afternoons of Solitude is an unblinking look at bullfighting and the surrounding culture of bravado and machismo, expertly shot and edited with a sense of ritualistic order imbibed directly from the sport. Filming Rey in transit in a people carrier, getting apparelled in his hyper-camp getup, rehearsing his mannerisms in a lift, Serra is fundamentally interested in questions of performance and style. In the arena, he documents the finesse and attitude with which the matador confronts, corrals and quells the raw force of nature. In the ring, Rey has an extraordinary repertoire of gestures: preening head tosses straight from a Whitesnake gig; a glowering demon kill-mask out of kabuki theatre.Rey’s entourage praises the “truthfulness” of hismises à mort– but how much existential beauty can really be present in this theatre of cruelty and meaningless slaughter? There’s something almost insecure about the nonstop stream of compliments Rey’s entourage lavish on him. But then in one match-up, Rey first goes under the hooves, and afterwards is rammed repeatedly against the sideboards; both times he stands to face the bull once more. It’s hard not to feel an ancient pulse quickening.Deeply caught up in decoding this tradition, perhaps Serra is too beholden to it. If only this admittedly riveting examination of dark human compulsions had found a way to also articulate the perspectives of the animals for whom the arena is a lethal experience.Afternoons of Solitude is at the ICA, London, from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBullfightingSpainAnimalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since I dislike snakes but like rodents, it offers me Danish musician Astrid Sonne, who has sadly had to cancel ahead of the weekend. Nonetheless, the Top Tipper, by artists Mikesian Studio, is characteristic of the Wiltshire festival: playful, charming, with curation by an obviously human rather than algorithmic hand.View image in fullscreenHayden Pedigo.Photograph: Gem HarrisThe 13,500 people at this year’s EOTR are generous and enthusiastic listeners. Texan guitarist Hayden Pedigo seems bowled over by how many people turn up to watch him open the glade-like Garden stage on Friday lunchtime. He only started playing live a couple of years ago and professes to have terrible stage fright – though you wouldn’t know in the least from his delightful stage presence, telling us about how his Amarillo home is so flat that locals joke about being able to see your dog run away for three days. His widescreen, open-tuned instrumentals contain multitudes: proggy drama, nimble scurrying, Earth-like doom country and plenty of space.Cornish folk singer Daisy Rickman is a great complement, evoking craggier vistas from closer to home in her weighty, self-possessed songs, backed by a full band. A cover of the Velvet Underground’s All Tomorrow’s Parties makes a virtue of her stunningly deep voice and brings out the drone folk DNA in the original. For the last couple of songs, she hops on drums and sings, closing on a couple of numbers that almost have a Balearic heat in the sax. Her solo records are great, but she needs to make a full band record to capture their intuitive magic.On the low-roofed Boat stage later on, Mandy, Indiana make bucolic rambles a distant memory with their dystopian industrial racket, fuelled by grinding guitar and whippet-nimble drums, andCariboucloses the main stage with the sort of lethally efficient good vibes that you suspect Dan Snaith can parlay with his eyes closed.View image in fullscreenDystopian … Valentine Caulfield of Mandy, Indiana.Photograph: Chris JuarezBy Saturday, it becomes apparent that Friday was the last time the festivalgoers would ever know peace, ie remain dry. The New Eves cut through the torpor with their Raincoats and Velvets-influenced battle cries, while Lily Seabird leaves a quieter, deeper impression to a packed tent of people who discover magic while dodging the rain. The Vermont songwriter has some of Big Thief to her brawny, easy rockers, coupled with a gorgeously open-hearted voice that recalls Lucinda Williams and Frances Quinlan of Hop Along. She plays one new song solo: a stunning, rangy reverie that suggests an indie star in the making.But if EOTR has a true breakout talent, it’s Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti. On Saturday, Titanic, her duo with romantic partner and guitarist Hector Tosta, rework theirnew album– which isn’t even out for a week. That drive to reinvent speaks to a profound shared musical language, clear from the way the band visually communicate almost to the point of egging each other on to push things further. Just the opening bars of tectonic interplay between Fratti, Tosta, drummer Friso van Wijck and saxophonist Nat Philipps is stunning; Van Wijck can shift from blastbeats to chattering woodblocks in seconds; they evoke the squall of a charged city on the brink of collapse.View image in fullscreenTrue talent … Mabe Fratti playing with Titanic.Photograph: Gem HarrisFratti’s melodies are so pristine they could be produced as traditional chanson, but Titanic never do anything so predictable: at one point, the best comparison for what they’re doing is Maria Callas were she produced by Sunn O))), operatic desolation backed up by cliff faces of noise. Fratti’s voice is usually the piercingly calm centre of the music, but by the last song she’s starting to come apart vocally, and the raggedness of her singing is a thrill. Titanic is her maximalist side; her solo performance on Sunday with Tosta and Gibrán Andrade on drums is more minimalist and plaintive, making a virtue of space, always keeping you guessing and only breaking their immaculate tension with a sludge metal cataclysm right at the end.No one is doing it like these Mexico City musicians, though Moin are almost as exciting, an exercise in controlled collapse – with shades of Slint’s doominess – as drummerValentina Magaletticreates a striking sense of space in her playing. And certainly the only artist who could bring the sunshine – figuratively, at least – is Sofia Kourtesis, whose wistful, songwriterly house feels particularly heartfelt today, as does her shoutout to mentor Caribou, who comes on and gives her a huge hug. (Later, during his secret set as Daphni on the Boat stage, he plays their collaboration Unidos amid a set of heaters that thrive on being played under a low tarpaulin roof, unlike his big-tent hits.)That sort of warmth is missing from Self Esteem’s headline set, which feels too choreographed and stern to charm this festival crowd, not to mention bum-clenchingly basic in its Handmaid’s Tale-evoking vision of feminism. It feels like nature healing itself to leave to see Viagra Boys, a group of men literally singing a song called Sports, as is right and proper. The Swedish punks are not quite as riotous as expected – there’s almost a shocking maturity to their sax-dappled sound – but we later learn that they’ve donated their entire fee to Doctors Without Borders, one of several shows of support for Palestine at the festival. They loosen the night up again, as does Syrian dabke producer Rizan Said, whose set is relentless fun.No such thing can be said for the weather on Sunday. At lunchtime, a small girl is wailing to her parents that shejust can’t walk any more, a tearful refusal that I think many here five times her age would also like to scream at the filthy sky. But walk on we do: to Jake Xerxes Fussell’s plucky folk rambles, which bounce along with the verve of Richard Scarry characters; Ryan Davis and the Roadhouse Band’s amiable picaresque Americana; folk group Shovel Dance Collective, whose hungry remit quests from casting celestial spells to traditional fiddle-de-de. Blawan offers bracing blasts of bathhouse techno, laced with fun, demonic vocal samples, screaming fizz and industrial lockstep, and Squid bring back memories of one-album wonders Clor with their funhouse take on post-punk.View image in fullscreenLoose-limbed, ludic and romantic … Father John Misty at End of the Road festival.Photograph: Rachel Juarez-Carr/Rachel Juarez CarrAnd to these jaded ears at least, EOTR works some of its magic in getting me to enjoy some of Father John Misty’s headline set, having never been a fan. The clever lounge lizard stuff is still a bit offputtingly pleased with itself, but Screamland is disarming in its unvarnished desperation, a cosmic epic that hits like Coldplay having an existential crisis. Josh Tillman’s set is loose-limbed, ludic and romantic, and his old troll energy seems well and truly consigned to the dustbin of history; he’s ardently sincere, telling EOTR’s faithful “they don’t make ’em like you”. He’s right: in its capacity to surprise and delight, it’s a special place.Explore more on these topicsEnd of the Road festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsSelf EsteemCaribouFather John MistyIndielive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Forthcoming deck-building game,All Will Rise, seeks to interest players in political activism,Compensation Not Guaranteedaims to educate players about south-east Asian politics, whileMythMatchis ostensibly a puzzle game set in ancient Greece, but is also about building communities and challenging capitalism – while still looking cute and approachable.You play as Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, who is having to navigate the institutionalised sexism of Mount Olympus, here represented as a corporation infested with tech bros. In defiance, she decides to help the mortals of Ithaca build a new, more progressive world – and you do this by running around the little environments, merging items and animals to create helpful new beasts and objects. For example, when you’re cast down to Earth you accidentally smash a chariot belonging to Selene, the goddess of the Moon, so you have to match moon shards together to recreate the celestial vehicle. However, one of the shards has fallen into a greenhouse, so you need to solve a puzzle to gain access.View image in fullscreenAll-new Ithaca … Mythmatch.Photograph: Team ArtichokeThe game then is part narrative adventure, part social sim, part match-three teaser. “We ended up taking a lot more from automation games like Factorio, but where the automation happens through connection with the NPCs rather than building machinery,” says Moo Yu, founder and creative director at developer Team Artichoke. “And in Mount Olympus, we’re inspired by various arcade-style games like Money Puzzle Exchanger, Overcooked, and even Super Auto Pets.”With a diverse bunch of characters and a genuinely funny script, the emphasis is very much on forming friendships and a pleasant community. “I became obsessed with the theme of belonging,” says Yu. “As someone who has always struggled to make friends or find community, I just felt like there weren’t enough games about rejection and found family. So I started with some gameplay about moving goalposts and constantly being rejected by the gods of Olympus. Then when searching for where Artemis might actually fit in, I thought about some of the communities that I love and how they are about aligning our commonalities while embracing our differences.”Team Artichoke is a small studio with 10 staff, most of whom are working part-time on the project. At the helm, Yu is a veteran who’s worked at Media Molecule and Mind Candy as well as co-developing the hit adventureKnights and Bikes. When asked about the key influences behind Mythmatch, he immediately cites three films: Kung Fu Panda, Amelie and most prominently Legally Blonde, the Reese Witherspoon comedy which is visually coded to look like a romcom but also deftly analyses misogyny in the legal profession. “We wanted to create a caricatured world to give us the breathing space to venture on to more serious topics,” he says. “[There’s] a surface cuteness but with a layer of grittiness throughout. So while the game might not literally look like the world of Legally Blonde, we wanted to capture the space created by the exaggerated colour palette while also making sure there was a layer of messiness as well.”So while Mythmatch uses the core game loops of casual genres such as match-three and merge games, it has a fundamental message to impart about power and belonging. Yu sees this combination as important in the indie games scene of 2025. “I’m seeing more small games that are delivering new stories or pairing mechanics with interesting narratives that I think speaks to what creativity can accomplish with limited funds,” he says. “I wish the funds weren’t getting more and more limited, but I am always inspired by what people can accomplish with what they can scrape together.”Mythmatch is currently in development for PC, with a release date to be announced.Explore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCIndie gamesPuzzle gamesCasual gamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the first cousin to okonomiyaki in that it’s a crisp cabbage pancake, but with cooked rice as the main ingredient; after that, however, it’s up to you what you put in. I like to make this mini mushroom version because, miraculously, my children eat it. And the secret to a super-crisp pancake? A good gluten-free flour (I likeFreee) – the combination of flours in a gluten-free mix gives you an amazingly crisp pancake.Mini mushroom okonomiyakiI really like finely chopped kimchi and greek yoghurt on the side. After all,okonomimeans “as you like it”, which I take as a green light for “anything goes”.Prep15 minCook15 minServes2-32tbsp sesame oil, or neutral oil150g shiitake mushrooms, roughly chopped1garlic clove, peeled and finely grated2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated1½tsp flaky sea salt2eggs, beaten100g white cabbage, thinly sliced200g cooked white rice50g cheddar, roughly chopped40g gluten-free flour3 spring onions, finely slicedTo serveMayonnaiseand brown sauce, orKewpie and okonomi sauce, if you have itHeat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick frying pan, then add the mushrooms, garlic, ginger and a half-teaspoon of flaky salt. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until the mushrooms are just cooked through, then tip into a bowl.Add the beaten eggs, cabbage, cooked rice, cheddar, flour, spring onions and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the mushroom bowl, and mix well to combine.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, then, working in batches, add tablespoons of the mixture and flatten each one into a rough disc. Fry the mini okonomiyaki on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown (the cheese will melt in patches and crisp up), then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll and keep warm in a low (70C (50C fan)/gas very low) oven while you cook the rest of the mixture.Serve hot with your choice of sauces: Japanese mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce are traditional, but regular mayonnaise and brown (or, indeed, tamarind) sauce are good, too, if that’s what you have.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyVegetablesSnacksStarterCheeseRiceJapanese food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy raw celery – it has an earthy pepperiness that I find quite moreish – but I adore it in cooked form, especially with soy and garlic, and today’s recipe is a take on a wok-fried celery dish that we often eat at large banquets in Malaysia. But first, a silky, fragrant curry with tender baby aubergines and a golden coconut base that’s perfect with hot steamed rice and a scattering of fresh herbs. These baby purple aubergines are perfect for one person, and hold their structure well in a curry. I adore them.Yellow curry with baby aubergine (pictured top)This is more for a day when I’m pottering around – the paste seems a bit laborious, but I don’t believe that cooking for yourself always needs to be quick; love and care and time can also be put into the process, especially when you get this golden, rich and nourishing curry at the end.Prep20 minCook40 minServes1200ml coconut milk1 tbsp coconut oil3 babyaubergines, cut into 4cm chunks4–5 curry leaves¼ tsp ground turmeric½ tbsp fish sauceJuice of ¼ lime, or to taste½ tsp palm sugar, or brown sugar1 pinch of salt¼ tsp MSG(optional, but lovely)For the paste1 small shallot,peeled and chopped1 small thumb of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 tsp)1 small thumb of galangal, chopped (about 1 tsp)½ stalk lemongrass, tender part only, finely sliced1garlic clove,peeled and chopped1 dried red chilli, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes, drained and chopped1 small fresh red chilli,chopped¼ tsp belacan(shrimp paste), dry toasted until crumblyTo serveSteamed jasmine riceDill sprigsCrispy garlic(optional)Put all the paste ingredients in a blender and blitz to a rough paste; if need be, add a splash of water to help it along.In a small pan, reduce the coconut milk on a low-medium heat until it thickens and starts to split slightly – this will help bring out its natural oils and sweetness. In a second pan, heat a little coconut oil, then fry the aubergines in batches until golden and soft. Transfer to a rack or plate lined with paper towel to drain any excess oil.In the same pan, fry the curry leaves in a touch of oil until they start to pop, then add the paste and cook gently on a medium heat, stirring continuously, for five to seven minutes, until fragrant and the oil begins to split – this is when the magic happens. Add the turmeric and fry for another 30 seconds.Stir in the reduced coconut milk, season with the fish sauce, lime juice, a little sugar, salt and MSG, if using, then taste and adjust until it hits that beautiful balance of salty, sweet, sour and creamy. Return the aubergines to the pan and simmer for a few minutes so they soak up all that rich flavour. Serve with steamed jasmine rice and topped with fresh dill and crispy garlic.Chinese-style spicy garlic celeryView image in fullscreenJulie Lin’s Chinese-style spicy garlic celery.Once you get the knack of the timings, you can switch up the flavourings to whatever you fancy; if you want a more floral version, say, add some fried ginger. Again, this is a dish bursting with flavour and something I make for myself when I need something green with a satisfying crunch.Prep10 minCook15 minServes12 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine3 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp white sugar2 tbsp vegetable oil1 bunch celery, sliced on an angle5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely diced1 tsp cornflour, mixed with 3 tbsp water to make a pasteSalt and white pepper1 tsp Malaysian crispy prawn chilli, or crispy chilli oilIn a small bowl, mix the rice wine, soy sauce and sugar.Put the vegetable oil in a wok on a high heat, then add the celery and stir-fry for a minute, until a little translucent. Add the garlic and stir-fry for two to three minutes, until fragrant, then add the rice wine, soy and sugar mixture, followed by the cornflour paste, and stir-fry until everything thickens slightly and all the flavours come together. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and ground white pepper.Finally, stir in the crispy prawn chilli or crispy chilli oil, make a few final tosses, then serve piping hot.The Chinese-style spicy garlic celery is an edited extract from Sama Sama: Comfort Food from my Malaysian-Scottish Kitchen, by Julie Lin, published by Ebury at £28.
