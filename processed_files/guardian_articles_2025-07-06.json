What’s going on?Clare FinneySun 6 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 16.35 EDTSharePub roasts, grannies, Sunday lunch, Ah! Bisto!: gravy triggers nostalgic food memories for Britons like little else. But unlike complex French sauces, for example, gravy is brown and plain, not gastronomic alchemy. Its homely bedfellows – potatoes and pies – have had fancy makeovers, but gravy’s potential hasn’t been much exploited on the modern menu. Until now.The nostalgic wave sweeping Britain’s food scene is reviving this ancient staple, but with a twist: gravy is going gourmet. It is appearing as a dip for burgers in London at the upmarket chain Burger & Beyond and at Nanny Bill’s. It is served with brioche and black pudding at Tom Cenci’s modern British restaurant Nessa in Soho, and even does a turn at Shaun Rankin’s Michelin-starred Grantley Hall in Yorkshire, where it is styled as beef tea andserved with bread, bone marrow butter and dripping.More radically, Hackney Gelato and KFC collaborated on gravy gelato recently – and it sold out in days. “It features rich notes of peppercorn and, of course, chicken,” itscreators wrote. “It stinks … is it for cats?” a TikTok reviewerresponded, revolted by the combination of sweet cream and meat.Regardless of where you stand on chickeny ice-cream, there is no doubt that gravy is undergoing “a gastronomic reawakening”, says Gurdeep Loyal, a food writer. “Good gravy is a vehicle to amplify rather than dilute – so it’s gone from an everyday sauce to something that can take a dish to the next level.”He adds: “Gravy should taste more of the meat than the meat itself. That’s the magic of it; it’s an intensification.” Rankin agrees: “Previously chefs have been focused on sauces with no fat, but now it’s all about strong flavours and you only get that with natural fats.” He has created a dish called Bread, Butter, Dripping,BeefTea, which is based, he says, “around my childhood memories of Sunday lunch at home where my mum would lift the roast beef out of the oven, then give me a slice of bread to dip into the juices. I brought all those flavours together for this bread course.”As the title of Loyal’s new bookFlavour Heroes: 15 Modern Pantry Ingredients to Amplify Your Cookingsuggests, it is all about amplification. Like custard, potatoes and pies, gravy taps into nostalgia, but also has the potential to transform texture and enhance taste. “For ages people were obsessed with making everything crispy and crunchy: pangrattato – crispy breadcrumbs – and so on,” says Loyal. “Now we’re after the antithesis: drowning. The celebration of the soggy!Your taste buds are concentratedon the sides and the tip of your tongue, so you’ll get more taste from something drowned.”View image in fullscreenSticky, stocky … a gravy-dipped burger at Nanny Bill’s.“Gravy is not jus. It is not a glaze. It is gravy,” says chef Stevie Parle, in the matter-of-fact manner of a Birmingham man known and loved for his unfussy approach to cooking.At the chef’s latest opening,Townin central London, gravy is served with a hunk of potato sourdough as a snack. It is rich, brown and laced with meaty bits. “I don’t know that I am elevating it,” he says. “I’m just making a really, really good one.”“There’s nothing nicer then meat left over from a roast, made into sandwiches and dipped in gravy,” says Craig Povoas, co-founder of Burger & Beyond. The dips there include a pot of bone marrow gravy, and it is also selling posh sandwiches with dips, such as the British French Dip, a baguette filled with rump steak, gruyère cheese and caramelised onions with beef gravy on the side. “It’s inspired by the French dip sandwich which is popular in the United States,” Povoas says – an invention that is French only insofar as a baguette is generally the vehicle for the generous pot of gravy that comes with it.Squash them flat, pile them high: the rise and rise of the smash burgerRead more“Gravy is evolving,” says Zoe Simons, senior brand development chef at Waitrose, which has recently seen “a big push towards using broths and stocks to create more sophisticated gravies at home”. Even the culinary director of Claridge’s, Simon Attridge, a man you would expect to stick to the script as far as tradition is concerned, is partial to dipping french fries into a mix of mayonnaise and red wine gravy. One of his favourite gravy dishes is “a rich madeira-based chicken gravy, infused into butter with crispy chicken skin and served with soft milk bread”.There is a thrill in taking something golden and crisp like yorkshire pudding and drowning it in gravy, but there’s a cultural dimension, too, to the nostalgia and to the rebellious streak in gravy. Though almost every other “British” food is not British at all, gravy is “something the British have proudly made up, all by ourselves”, the food historian Pen Vogler writes in her bookScoff: A History of Food and Class in Britain. Even the word itself is believed to have derived from a mistranscription of the old French for “ingredient”,grané.That is as French as gravy has ever been, Vogler says. Where French sauces are skilfully conceived in a pot with vegetables and quality meat, gravy is the stuff that comes out of the meat as it roasts, and the sticky bits left in the pan. It is what gave us an international reputation for dry meat, which is perhaps why gravy became a little “déclassé, something demanded by the sort of diner who has not been educated in the highest flights of French gastronomy to despise overdone meat”, says Vogler. The more the joint was squeezed for gravy, the drier the meat, the more gravy was necessary, creating “a culinary vicious circle” that left cooks scrambling for increasingly inventive ways to make enough gravy to lubricate their meal.View image in fullscreenGood times … traditional roast beef with roast potatoes, yorkshire puddings, vegetables and gravy.Photograph: mtreasure/Getty ImagesBefore the invention of Bisto and the Oxo cube in the early 20th century, gravy was firmly in the “bung it in and see” school of culinary thought. Vogler lists “caramel, salt, pickles” as examples of “supplements” for gravy – to which my grandma would add leftover veg, any dregs of cream or fat she had saved in the fridge, and a splash of raw batter from the yorkshire puddings. “That’s a very Yorkshire thing,” Rankin says. “My mum also used part of the pudding mix as a thickening agent, adding a splash to the tray the beef had roasted in, where all the juices were.” Povoas says: “Everyone has their own take, whether it’s Bisto or elevated.”Unlike with French sauces, there are no definitive gravy recipes. Vogler points out that “recipes for anything like ‘gravy’ in French, Italian, Spanish or other cookbooks are notable by their absence”. The food historianAlan Davidsondescribed gravy as “a term comprehensible to those who use it, but something of a mystery in the rest of the world”. In the past, this placed it beneath the regard of British chefs intent on proving themselves – and their meat – worthy of gastronomic consideration. But now nostalgia, quality produce and the trumping of fat and flavour over pared-back sophistication have made gravy a go-to item for chefs wanting to celebrate Britain’s culinary heritage and have some fun.“It’s not cheffy in the way that chefs like to refine and refine,” says Parle. “It’s about scraping all those tasty bits in the pan. It’s about getting down and dirty.” The bone marrow gravy at Burger & Beyond may taste better than the one you grew up with, says Povoas, but it’s still gravy. “It’s just one of those British things that everyone loves.” There’s an insouciance to this sauce, which steals flavour from the meat only to return it tenfold, covering everything in an umami wash of brown.“I don’t know what makes gravy, gravy,” Parle says with a shrug, “but I do know that if someone says: ‘It’s all gravy,’ it means they are having a good time.”Explore more on these topicsFoodRestaurantsBeeffeaturesShareReuse this content"

At 20 years old, she just finished a four-year degree in psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in only three years, earning the highest honors along the way. Yet, despite her accomplishments, she still can’t graduate. Her diploma is being withheld by the university, “not because I didn’t complete the requirements”, she told me, “but because I stood up forPalestinianlife.”View image in fullscreenSereen Haddad.Photograph: Olivia CunninghamHaddad, who is Palestinian American, had been raising awareness on her campus about the Palestinian fight for freedom as part of her university’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. The struggle is also personal for her. With roots inGaza, she has lost more than 200 members of her extended family to Israel’s war.She was part of a group of VCU students and supporters who attempted to set up an encampment in April 2024. The university called in the police that same night. Protestors were pepper sprayed and brutalized, and 13 were arrested. Haddad was not charged, but she was taken to the hospital “because of the head trauma that I endured”, she told me. “I was bleeding. I was bruised. Cuts everywhere. The police slammed me down on the concrete, like, six different times.”But last year’s attempted encampment wasn’t even the reason Haddad’s degree is being withheld. This year’s peaceful memorial of it was. And how that scenario played out, with the university and campus police constantly changing the rules, illustrates something worrisome far beyond the leafy confines of an American campus.Israel’s war in Gazais chipping away at so much of what we – in the United States but also internationally – had agreed upon as acceptable, from the rules governing our freedom of speech to the very laws of armed conflict. It seems no exaggeration to say that the foundation of the international order of the last 77 years is threatened by this change in the obligations governing our legal and political responsibilities to each other.We are ignoring the collapse of the international system that has defined our lives for generations at our own collective perilThis collapse began with the liberal world’s lack of resolve to rein in Israel’s war in Gaza. It escalated when no one lifted a finger to stop hospitals being bombed. It expanded when mass starvation became a weapon of war. And it is peaking at a time when total war is no longer viewed as a human abhorrence but is instead thedeliberatepolicy of the state of Israel.The implications of this collapse are profound for international, regional and even domestic politics. Political dissent is repressed, political language is policed, and traditionally liberal societies are increasingly militarized against their own citizens.Many of us disregard how much has shifted in the last 20 months. But we are ignoring the collapse of the international system that has defined our lives for generations at our own collective peril.View image in fullscreenOn 29 April 2025, a group of VCU students met on a campus lawn to remember the forcible dismantling of an encampment briefly erected on the same space the year prior. The gathering was not a protest. It was more akin to a picnic, with some students using banners from past demonstrations as blankets. Others brought actual blankets. Students sat on the grass and studied for their finals, tinkered with their laptops, and played cards or chess. A handful of the 40-odd students sported keffiyehs.It turned out the blankets were a problem.Almost two hours into their picnic, a university administrator confronted the students over a social media post that had advertised the gathering. (“Come be in community with one another to commemorate 1 Year since VCU’s brutal response to the G4Z4 Solidarity Encampment. Bring picnic blankets, homework/finals, art supplies, snacks, music, games,” a local Palestinian solidarity group hadposted.) Because of this post, the university considered the picnic an “organized event”, and since the students hadn’t registered the event, it was deemed a violation of the rules.The rules at VCU had beenchangingbecause of protests for Gaza since February 2024.The administrator told the students they could relocate to the campus free-speech zone, an area that had been established in August 2024 because of the protests of that year. “An amphitheater next to four dumpsters” is how Haddad described the area to me.When students expose the violence of Israel’s occupation and genocide, institutions [...] become fearfulSereen HaddadThe campus free-speech organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) iscritical of free-speech zonesbecause they “function more like free speech quarantines, banishing student and faculty speakers to outposts that may be tiny, on the fringes of campus, or (frequently) both”.Rather than move, the students announced a formal end to their gathering, and they remained quietly on their campus lawn. But since the banners they were sitting on expressed a political point of view, the administrator told the students they would have to take them to the free-speech zone, according to Haddad. The lawn should be for everybody, the students countered. Several different conversations with campus police officers and different administrators ensued, with the students being told different rules each time.Over a dozen campus police officers appeared later that afternoon (as seen inthis video). “You’ve been asked not to have any blankets in the park. You have one minute to collect the blankets and to leave the park. Otherwise, you will be arrested for trespassing,” an officer told them.How Israel has made trauma a weapon of warRead moreBut the police continued to change the rules. First the students were told they would have to roll up the blankets and leave. Minutes later, police said they could stay if the blankets were gone. The students removed the blankets and, as the officers were leaving, the students began chanting: “Free, free Palestine!” One raised a sign, referencing last year’s protestors beingpepper sprayedby police, that read: “Gonna gas us again, you fucking monsters.” He was arrested. The others became angry and frustrated.“You know what made this a demonstration?” a student yelled at the police. “When you bring fucking cops to a picnic! That’s what turns it into a fucking demonstration!”Eight days later, Haddad and another student, identified by the university as leaders, were served notice of policy violations due to the unauthorized gathering. Their degrees were being withheld.View image in fullscreenStills from a video showing police at Virginia Commonwealth University cracking down on a student picnic marking the one-year anniversary of when the university dismantled their pro-Palestinian encampment in Richmond, Virginia, on 29 April 2025.Composite: sjpvcu/Instagram“When students expose the violence of Israel’s occupation and genocide, institutions like VCU, which are deeply entangled with weapon manufacturers and corporate donors, become fearful,” Haddad said. “So they twist the rules, they rewrite the policies, and they try to silence us … But it’s all about power. Our demands for justice are a threat to their complicity.”The strategic rewriting of the rules isn’t unique to VCU. It’s taking place across the United States as university administrators clamp down on protests supporting Palestinian rights. In one of many other examples, dozens of faculty members and students weretemporarily suspendedfrom Harvard’s library in late 2024 after they sat quietly reading in the library with signs that either supported free speech or opposed the war in Gaza, though a similar protest inDecember 2023carried no such sanction.Had any of these students been protesting Russia’s war on Ukraine, you can be sure these administrations would have responded with adulation. Universities, after all, pride themselves on being the testing grounds for society’s collective values. As sites of contemplation and exploration, they function as incubators for future leaders.But when it comes to the question of Palestine, a different pattern begins to emerge. Rather than listen to students who want to hold Israel accountable for its actions, those in positions of power in the university are opting to change the rules instead.Such dubious rule changes are not just for our students. In a damningreportpublished in January, ProPublica dissected the many ways that theBiden administrationkept shifting the goalposts in Israel’s favor after 7 October 2023. Remember the threats of sanctions against Israel forinvading Rafah? (It’s a “red line,” Biden said.) Or the 30-dayultimatumplaced on Israel to dramatically increase the food aid? But nothing happened. Outside briefly pausing a shipment of 2,000lb (0.9 tonne) bombs, the military hardware kept on coming.View image in fullscreenPeople make their way past the rubble of houses in Rafah on 20 January 2025, a day after a ceasefire deal in the war between Israel and Hamas came into effect.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe Leahy law requires restricting assistance to military units of foreign governments engaged in gross human rights violations. It has never been applied to Israel. In April 2024, it looked like secretary of state Antony Blinken was about to sanction Netzah Yehuda, a notorious battalion in the Israeli Defense Forces, under the Leahy law. In the end, he punted, and the battalion not only escaped US sanctions, butaccording to CNN, its commanders were even assigned to train ground troops and run operations in Gaza.The fact that we are watching a people being entirely stripped of its human dignity should really shock our collective conscienceMirjana Spoljaric Egger“It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the red lines have all just been a smokescreen,” Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School,toldProPublica. “The Biden administration decided to be all in and merely pretended that it was trying to do something about it.”Leahy isn’t the only US law that Israeli impunity is pushing to a breaking point. In late April 2024, the US government’s leading agencies on humanitarian assistance concluded that Israel was deliberately blocking entry of food and medicine into Gaza. The US Foreign Assistance Actrequiresthe government to suspend military assistance to any country that “restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance”. Blinken just ignored the evidence provided by his own government. “We do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian assistance,” heinformedCongress.View image in fullscreenPalestinians trying to receive food from a charity distribution point in Khan Younis, Gaza, on 5 June 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe rules bend like reeds when it comes to Israel, which in March 2025 alsobrokethe ceasefire that the Trump administration had helped negotiate in January. And now we are witnessing a new level of cruelty: the use ofstarvation as a weapon of war. Meanwhile Israeli politicians openly call for ethnic cleansing. Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister,braggedthat Israel is “destroying everything that’s left of the Gaza Strip” and that “the army is leaving no stone unturned.” He added: “We are conquering, cleansing and remaining in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed.” And his idea of Hamas is expansive. “We’re eliminating ministers, bureaucrats, money handlers – everyone who holds up Hamas’s civilian rule,” he explained. Killing civilian members of government (as they are not combatants) is a war crime.The US and the international community, again, do nothing.Every day, the previously unheard of is not just spoken aloud but also acted upon – precisely because it elicits little reaction. Two retired Israeli air force pilots wrote in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz’s Hebrew edition that “a member of the Knesset even boasted that one of the [Israeli] government’s achievements is the ability to kill 100 people a day in Gaza without anyone being shocked” (an excerpt of the Haaretz article was quoted by columnist Thomas Friedman in theNew York Times.)View image in fullscreenA Palestinian child suffering from malnutrition is treated by a nurse at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on 10 July 2024.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesThis steady shift of the acceptable has resulted in criminal policies and practices of forcible displacement, mass suffering and genocide, all conducted under passive acquiescence or active complicity of powerful countries. Even the normally reticent Red Cross is speaking out in horror. “Humanity is failing in Gaza,” Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee for the Red Cross,toldthe BBC’s Jeremy Bowen recently. “The fact that we are watching a people being entirely stripped of its human dignity should really shock our collective conscience,” she lamented.Yet, official outrage is at best muted as all that was once considered institutionally solid melts into air.View image in fullscreenWhat is it about Israel that enables it to get away with murder? The United States has long shielded Israel from international criticism and supported it militarily. The reasons offered for that support usually range from the “unbreakable” bond shared between the two countries to thepowerof the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) in Washington. One could reasonably argue that the only thing different about this current war is the scale.But it’s not just Washington. Israel and the question of Palestine produce incredibly fraught divisions throughout much of the western world. Denmark recentlybannedchildren gearing up to vote in a nationwide youth election from debating Palestinian sovereignty. Why?In aconversationwith the New York Times’ Ezra Klein, professor of international human rights law Aslı Bâli offered one explanation for what’s different about Palestine. In 1948, she notes, Palestine was “the only territory that had been slated to be decolonized at the creation of the United Nations … that has [still] not been decolonized”.Israel, in short, is an anachronismTony JudtSouth Africa was once in that category. For decades, Palestine and South Africa were “understood as ongoing examples of incomplete decolonization that continued long after the rest of the world had been fully decolonized”. Today, Palestine is the last exception to that historical process – a holdover plainly clear to the people who were once subject to colonization, but that the western world refuses to acknowledge as an aberration.In other words, for many in the US and much of the western world, the creation of the state of Israel is understood as the fulfillment of Jewish national aspirations. For the rest of the world, the same fulfillment of Jewish national aspirations has rendered the decolonization of Palestine incomplete.In 2003, the historian Tony Judtwrotethat the “problem with Israel [is] … that it arrived too late. It has imported a characteristically late-19th-century separatist project into a world that has moved on, a world of individual rights, open frontiers, and international law. The very idea of a ‘Jewish state’ – a state in which Jews and the Jewish religion have exclusive privileges from which non-Jewish citizens are forever excluded – is rooted in another time and place. Israel, in short, is an anachronism.”Judt’s idea that Israel is a relic of another era requires understanding how the global push for decolonization significantly accelerated after 1945. The result was a new world – but one that forsook the Palestinians, leaving them abandoned in refugee camps in 1948. This new world, emerging out of the ashes of the second world war, became what we today call “the rules-based international order”, of which international law is a key component.International law became much more codified in this time as well. The year 1948 was not only the date of the Palestinian Nakba (Arabic for “catastrophe:) and Israel’s independence. It was also the year that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was passed. Along with the UN Charter of 1945, the UDHR serves as the principal basis of international human rights law.But what good is a “rules-based international order” if the rules keep shifting?The truth is that we’ve never really lived in a “rules-based international order”, or at least not the one that most people imagine when they hear the phrase. The idea that international law establishes limits on the actions of states did not prevent the Rwandan genocide. The “rules-based international order” didn’t stop the US’s “illegal” invasion of Iraq in 2003. Long before 2023, Israel routinelyviolatedSecurity Councilresolutions. It didn’t stop Hamas from committing its war crimes on 7 October.The problem with international law is not just the lack of an enforcement mechanism to compel compliance of rogue states. The problem with international law is that “it is more likely to serve as a tool of the strong than of the weak,” the legal theorist Ian Hurd writes in his 2017 book, How to Do Things with International Law.We tend to think of the law as an agreed-upon limit on our actions. As Dwight D Eisenhower famouslysaid: “The world no longer has a choice between force and law. If civilization is to survive, it must choose the rule of law.”But what if law is better understood as a system that, yes, restricts behavior but more importantly validates what’s possible? Whoever gets to define the limits gets to define what’s acceptable. As such, the powerful are far more likely to shift the ground of what’s acceptable to their advantage. As Hurd explains, international law “facilitates empire in the traditional sense because strong states … shape the meaning of international rules and obligations through interpretation and practice”.Though international law generally bans warfare, it carves out an exception for self-defense, and powerful states are the ones that can shift the line on what constitutes legitimate self-defense. (Israel broadly claims self-defense for itsaggressionon Iran, for example, asRussiaexplicitly claims self-defense for attacking Ukraine.) In his book, Hurd examines how the US has justified its use of drone warfare and even torture by appealing to international law. International law, for Hurd, is not a system that rests above politics. It is politics.The point I take from Hurd is not that international law doesn’t exist or that it’s not valuable. Clearly, there’s a need for rules to protect civilians and prevent war. International humanitarian law is also a living and breathing thing that adapts and expands.Additional protocolsto theGeneva conventionswere adopted in 1977. TheRome Statutethat established the International Criminal Court was passed in 1998.Gaza [...] is a test of the American public’s tolerance for the levels of death and destruction that such kinds of warfare entailColin JonesBut international law is also repeatedly put under stress, routinely violated, and consistently pushed into the service of strong states. As such, international law in practice is better understood as a constantly shifting line of acceptable behavior. We may now be reaching the point where that line has shifted so far from the founding intentions of international law that the system itself is on the brink of collapse.Israel’s campaign in Gaza carries the terrifying possibility of such a radical shifting of the line of acceptability that it makes genocide a lawful weapon of war. If you think I’m being hyperbolic, consider what Colin Jones wrote in theNew Yorkerearlier this year. Jones consulted key lawyers in the American military establishment about their views on Israel’s campaign in Gaza. What he found was a US military that is deeply concerned about being hobbled by international law when prosecuting a future war against a major power such as China – so much so that Israel’s “loosened restraints on civilian casualties” usefully shifts the goalposts for future US conduct.To the US military, Jones writes: “Gaza not only looks like a dress rehearsal for the kind of combat US soldiers may face. It is a test of the American public’s tolerance for the levels of death and destruction that such kinds of warfare entail.”What future hell are we currently living in?View image in fullscreenIn his book, Hurd also illustrates a fundamental difference between domestic and international legal regimes. The expectation we have of domestic law, he says, is that it is “clear, stable, and known in advance”, whereas international law is up to the consent of states.Trump’s contempt for institutions of international law couldn’t be clearer. He placedsanctionson judges and jurists of the International Criminal Court after arrest warrants were issued against Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. (He issuedsimilarsanctions in 2020.) Hedefiedthe UN Charter by bombing Iran, a sovereign nation not posing an imminent risk to the United States. The global response? A mildrebukefrom the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and full-throatedsupportfrom Nato secretary general Mark Rutte.What Trump and leaders like him seek is not so much to destroy the law as to colonize itHis disdain for domestic institutions of law is just as visible. He has invoked phony emergencies to claim “emergency powers” like no president before him, enabling him to get around Congress and, essentially, rule by decree. He deployed military troops in California, against the wishes of its governor, and anappeals courthas even authorized his decision. He is walking the line of open defiance of various judicial orders.View image in fullscreenFrom left, Jade Chan and Zoe O’Brien protest Donald Trump on 17 February 2025 in Austin, Texas.Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesWhat is happening? It’s tempting to think that we are living in a new era of lawlessness, but that would fail to capture the change staring us in the face. This is not about the lack of law. It’s about the remaking of the law. What Trump and leaders like him seek is not so much to destroy the law as to colonize it, to possess the law by determining its parameters to serve their interests. For them, the law exists to bend to their will, to destroy their adversaries, and to provide an alibi for behavior which, in a better version of our world, would be punished as criminal.Maybe it’s not surprising that something as vulnerable as international law could crack under today’s pressures. What may be surprising is how we’re also losing our domestic sense of stability, peace and security along with it and how connected the struggle for Palestine is to this domestic dismantling, especially when it comes to free expression. Just ask Sereen Haddad orMahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian rights activist who spent 104 days in detention for his constitutionally protected political speech and still faces the prospect of deportation.The convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide was, like the UDHR,approvedin the fateful year of 1948. Its arrival was urgent and necessary after the Nazi Holocaust of the Jewish people, and modern international law was constructed on the understanding that together we in the international community would work together to prevent future genocides. While we have failed to live up to that promise in the past, today it is Israel’sacts of extermination and genocideof Palestinians in Gaza, funded and enabled at every turn by a complicit west, that has contributed the most to the demise of the global, rules-based order. The way it looks today, the system won’t make it to 100 years.If there’s a glimmer of hope [...] it can be found in the growing number of people around the world who refuse to be intimidated into silenceAnd its collapse can be directly attributed to the hypocrisy with which the world has treated the Palestinians. No other group has been subjected to such a prolonged state of loss in the post-1945 liberal order. Palestinian refugeesconstitute“the world’s oldest and largest protracted refugee situation” in the modern world. And the demands placed on Palestinians simply to survive get more barbaric by the hour. In Gaza, desperate Palestinians aregunned downby snipers and drones daily as they wait for food. A drought is imminent because Israel’s attacks havedestroyedmost of the strip’s wastewater treatment plants, sewage systems, reservoirs and pipes. Up to 98% ofGaza’s farmlandhas been destroyed by Israel. This is a form of total war the modern world should never see, let alone condone.View image in fullscreenPeople carrying sacks of flour walk in western Jabalia on 17 June 2025, after humanitarian aid trucks reportedly entered the northern Gaza Strip through the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty ImagesNo one knows what will come to replace the international system that is currently collapsing around us, but any political system that prioritizes punishing those who protest genocide rather than stopping the killing has clearly exhausted itself.If there’s a glimmer of hope in all this rage-inducing misery, it can be found in the growing number of people around the world who refuse to be intimidated into silence. We may have seen a small example of that courage in New York City recently, and I’m not talking only about Zohran Mamdani winning the Democratic party nomination for mayor. That same day, two of Brooklyn’s progressive politicians,Alexa AvilésandShahana Hanif, were running for renomination. Both supported Palestine, both were relentlessly attacked for their positions on Gaza, and both refused to change their views. Pro-Israel donors poured money into their opponents’ campaigns. Yet both handily won their races.The ugly truth of American violence has never been plainerRead moreMultiple factors go into winning any political campaign, but any expressed support for Palestine used to be a death knell. Could it be that we’re on the cusp of change? Maybe Palestinian freedom is no longer a liability but is now a real winning position in politics?Palestine is perhaps the clearest expression today, as Haddad told me, of how “power feels threatened by the truth.” She continued: “If they are so afraid of a student with a sign or a chalked message or a demand for justice, then we are stronger than they want us to believe.” She better be right. For all our sakes."

But plying his jocular menace in the modern Hollywood era gave the actor expanded possibilities for movie violence that elevated him, at certain moments, to a timeless screen presence.When he severed a policeman’s ear in Quentin Tarantino’s 1992 debut Reservoir Dogs, aftersadistically bopping to the sounds of Stealers Wheel’s pop hit Stuck in the Middle With You, it became Madsen’s calling-card scene. He had originally auditioned for the part of Mr Pink, the role eventually played bySteve Buscemi, before the director realised his imposing qualities were perfect for the loose-cannon psychopath, Mr Blonde. “Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?” Madsen taunts Harvey Keitel’s Mr White, sipping a soda.This was Madsen’s breakthrough role, in which he incarnated Tarantino’s notions of freeze-dried cinematic cool; the start of a long association between actor and director. The pair fell out for a time after Madsen declined the role of Vincent Vega – the brother of his Reservoir Dogs character – inPulp Fiction; he was contracted to the now forgotten 1994 westernWyatt Earp.But after reconciling, Madsen went on to play notable parts inKill Bill: Vols 1 & 2 (2003 and 2004),The Hateful Eight(2015) andOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood(2019). He appreciated the director’s loyalty: “I would have been dead and buried long ago if it wasn’t for Quentin,”he told Deadline Hollywood.With his rangy frame, dark Italianate looks and Eastwoodian squint, Madsen was an obvious casting choice for 1990s crime films, convincing as both detective – in the LAPD thriller Mulholland Falls (1996) – and felon –in the 1994 remake of Sam Peckinpah’s The Getaway and in the revisionist gangster film Donnie Brasco (1997).View image in fullscreenMichael Madsen and Susan Sarandon in Thelma & Louise, 1991.Photograph: TCD/AlamyThough his brooding aura could also be refashioned to romantic ends – asshown in another early role as Susan Sarandon’s boyfriendinThelma & Louise(1991) – he was soon typecast as an American badass (also the title of a 2023 documentary retrospective dedicated to him). After his 90s breakthrough, quality control quickly dissipated; his filmography ballooned to more than 300 titles, most straight-to-video dreck with titles such as Piranhaconda, A Cold Day in Hell, and Garlic & Gunpowder.In the scrabble for a pay-cheque, he rued the narrowing effects on his career. “They bought my name, and they bought my face to put on the DVD box with a gun,”he told the Independent. “What people don’t always understand is that I established a lifestyle for my family.”Madsen was one of the dying breed of actors who brought blue-collar grit to the profession. Born inChicago, he was one of three children of Elaine (nee Melson) and Calvin Madsen, growing up alongside his sisters, Cheryl and Virginia. His father was a second world war Navy veteran and firefighter; his mother worked in finance but, after divorcing “Cal” when Madsen was nine, later became a film producer. Raised by his father, who physically beat him, the wary youth had a delinquent adolescence, including jail terms for car theft, assault and burglary.View image in fullscreenMichael Madsen in The Getaway, 1994.Photograph: Universal/Kobal/ShutterstockLater working as a mechanic at Joe Jacobs Chevrolet dealership, idolising the Nascar champion driver Richard Petty, Madsen was at first more enthused by motor racing than the arts. Watching Mitchum in the 1957 wartime romance Heaven Knows, Mr Allison altered his course. “When I saw that movie, I thought: ‘I could probably do that.’” Not long after having his first child, Jessica, with his girlfriend Dana Mechling, Madsen was stunned by a 1981 production of Of Mice and Men by theSteppenwolf Theatre Companyin Chicago; the star John Malkovich encouraged him to enrol in scene-study classes.Madsen later downplayed the importance of this tuition, even after appearing in another production of the same play as Carlson, the ranch hand who shoots a dog. This was his true education, he told the Independent: “That fucking dog was the best acting teacher I ever had. When I was really into my character, the dog would get scared and I’d have to drag it offstage before I fired the blank gun. But if I wasn’t into my performance, the dog would just be happy, and when I walked off it would follow me, which was just as upsetting for the audience.”Aided by his more studious sister Virginia, who already had an agent and would later star in the 1992 horror classic Candyman as well as the 2004 wine-country drama Sideways, Madsen landed an early role in the techno-thriller WarGames (1983); he playedan air-force officer with no compunction about pressing the nuclear button.Still pumping gas at a Union 76 gas station in Beverly Hills for stars including Fred Astaire,Jack Lemmonand Warren Beatty, he subsisted largely on TV jobs for most of the 80s, including Miami Vice, Tour of Duty and Cagney & Lacey. Madsen married Cher’s half-sister Georganne LaPiere in 1984; they divorced four years later.View image in fullscreenMichael Madsen in Kill Bill: Vol 2, 2004.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyAfter scene-stealing first as the poet Tom Baker in Oliver Stone’s biopic The Doors, then inReservoir Dogs, the actor could not convert the Tarantino cachet into leading-man status. He hovered on the fringes of the mainstream in films including Free Willy (1993); the sexed-up Alien rip-off Species (1995), as a black-ops mercenary; and another career high as a rising mafia capo in Donnie Brasco.But whether because of Madsen’s renegade reputation, or his lesser bankability compared to the rising stars of the time, other roles eluded him. He was outflanked byWoody Harrelsonfor Natural Born Killers and Russell Crowe for LA Confidential.During this period, from 1991 to 1995, he was married to the actor Jeannine Bisignano, with whom he had two sons, Christian and Max. In 1996 he married the actor DeAnna Morgan, while filming Donnie Brasco, and they went on to have three sons, Hudson, Kalvin and Luke.Tarantino kept the faith, casting Madsen as the Stetson-hatted assassin Budd, who buries Uma Thurman alive in the Kill Bill films; then as the saloon-lurking, coffee-poisoning cowboy Joe Gage in The Hateful Eight. A rumoured Reservoir Dogs prequel, featuring Madsen and John Travolta as the Vega brothers, never transpired.As Madsen upped his output to provide for his multiple families, averaging close to 10 movies a year by the 2010s, he also branched out into videogame voiceover work, including in Grand Theft Auto III and the Dishonored franchise.The real Madsen had rough edges; he lived a turbulent life, even as a family man in middle age and beyond. With drink-driving arrests in 2012 and 2019, he struggled with alcoholism. But the tough exterior concealed an observant and tender psyche. Though he only fleetingly tapped into it on screen, he gave it fuller rein in several published collections of impressionistic poetry often written on the hoof during his travels; one on his own leg in the back of a New York taxi.Madsen was devastated by the suicide in January 2022 of his son Hudson, a US army sergeant, at the age of 26; a month later, he was arrested for trespassing in Malibu. Hereportedly assaulted his wife in August last year, though charges were later dropped; he filed for divorce in September.Such full-tilt recklessness, for good and ill, had been his modus operandi since he first broke into Hollywood, ashe later told Esquire: “In the early 90s I was constantly running a marathon, and although I won most of the races, I injured myself in the process.”He is survived by DeAnna, his daughter Jessica, his sons Christian, Max, Kalvin and Luke, his stepson, Cody, his mother, Elaine, and his sisters, Cheryl and Virginia.Michael Søren Madsen, actor, born 25 September 1957; died 3 July 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmQuentin TarantinoReservoir DogsChicagoOliver StoneUS televisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

She was inthree or four book clubs at the same time. She’d devour whatever texts my siblings and I were studying in school, handwrite notes for our lunchboxes and write in her diary every night. Our fridge door was a revolving display of word-of-the-day flashcards. Despite this, she also was and remains, by some margin, the worst speller I have met.By the time I was in primary school, she was already asking me to proofread her work emails, often littered with mistakes that were glaringly obvious to me even at such a young age. It used to baffle me – how could this person, who races through multiple books a week and can quote Shakespeare faultlessly, possibly think “me” is spelt with two Es?It was on one of these occasions that she first mentioned she had been taught the wrong alphabet. “Google it,” she said. “It was an experiment, so it doesn’t exist any more, but it was called ITA.”View image in fullscreen‘What the hell was any of that supposed to mean?’ Judith Loffhagen.Photograph: Thomas Dufffield/The GuardianAt first, I thought she was joking, or maybe misremembering some exaggerated version of phonics. But later, I looked it up and, sure enough, there it was – a strange chart of more than 40 characters, many familiar, others alien. Sphinx-like ligatures, odd slashes, conjoined vowels – it looked like a cross between English and Greek.“My memory is so poor, but I can still see those devilish characters,” my mum, Judith Loffhagen, says as we sit in the garden of my childhood home in London. “An ‘a’ with an ‘e’ on its back, two ‘c’s with a line across them.” She traces the shapes on her trouser leg. “What the hell was any of that supposed to mean?”View image in fullscreenA 1966 Ladybird book that used ITA.Photograph: Marc Tielemans/AlamyThe Initial Teaching Alphabet was a radical, little-known educational experiment trialled in British schools (and in other English-speaking countries) during the 1960s and 70s. Billed as a way to help children learn to read faster by making spelling more phonetically intuitive, it radically rewrote the rules of literacy for tens of thousands of children seemingly overnight. And then it vanished without explanation. Barely documented, rarely acknowledged, and quietly abandoned – but never quite forgotten by those it touched.Why was it only implemented in certain schools – or even, in some cases, only certain classes in those schools? How did it appear to disappear without record or reckoning? Are there others like my mum, still aggrieved by ITA? And what happens to a generation taught to read and write using a system that no longer exists?English is one of the most difficult languages to learn to read and write. Unlike Spanish or Welsh, where letters have consistent sound values, English is a patchwork of linguistic inheritances. Its roughly 44 phonemes – the distinct sounds that make up speech – can each be spelt multiple ways. The long “i” sound alone, as in “eye”, has more than 20 possible spellings. And many letter combinations contradict one another across different words: think of “through”, “though” and “thought”.It was precisely this inconsistency that Conservative MP Sir James Pitman – grandson of Sir Isaac Pitman, the inventor of shorthand – identified as the single greatest obstacle for young readers. In a 1953 parliamentary debate, he argued that it is our “illogical and ridiculous spelling” which is the “chief handicap” that leads many children to stumble with reading, with lasting consequences for their education. His proposed solution, launched six years later, was radical: to completely reimagine the alphabet.The result was ITA: 44 characters, each representing a distinct sound, designed to bypass the chaos of traditional English and teach children to read, and fast. Among the host of strange new letters were a backwards “z”, an “n” with a “g” inside, a backwards “t” conjoined with an “h”, a bloated “w” with an “o” in the middle. Sentences in ITA were all written in lower case.By 1966, 140 of the 158 UK education authorities taught ITA in at least one of their schools.The new alphabet was not intended as a permanent replacement for the existing one: the aim was to teach children to read quickly, with the promise they would transition “seamlessly” into the standard alphabet by the age of seven or eight. But often, that seamless transition never quite happened. Many children – my mum included – found themselves caught between two systems.View image in fullscreenA page from a book written using ITA.My mum grew up in Blackburn in the 1960s, a bright child who skipped a year and started secondary school early. She doesn’t remember the details of how ITA was introduced. “That’s just what we were taught,” she tells me. “I didn’t know there was another way, or that I was going to graduate on to something else.“I’m nearly 60, and poor spelling has dogged me my whole life,” she continues. “Teachers always used to make jokes about my spelling, and I’d get those dreaded red rings around my work.”English was always her favourite subject, but it quickly became a source of shame. “I remember that absolute dread of reading in front of the class, stumbling on words. And then, at A-level, I’ll never forget my English teacher said to me, ‘You’ll never get an A because of your spelling.’ That was crushing. English was the one subject I loved – I felt so aggrieved.”In the 60s, parental involvement in schooling was minimal, especially for working-class or immigrant families (my mum’s parents migrated from Nigeria in the early 60s). “Back then, parents wanted you to succeed in whatever you were being taught, but they didn’t really questionwhatyou were being taught,” she says. “There was also a reverence for British education, that whole colonial thing, the idea that the British know best.”Despite her inability to spell, she became a solicitor, and later started her own business. “Spellcheckers revolutionised my confidence in writing,” she says. “I  hate making mistakes. If I’m the slightest bit unsure of how to spell something, I’ll check it. I’m fanatical about the importance of getting those things right.”Prof Dominic Wyse, professor of early years education at University College London, says: “ITA is regarded now as an experiment that just didn’t work. The transition to the standard alphabetwas the problem. Children were having to almost relearn the real way the English language works. It doesn’t surprise me that it failed. Any teaching that is based on anything other than the reality of what has to be learned is a waste of time.”Prof Rhona Stainthorp, an expert in literacy development at the University of Reading, agrees. “It was a bizarre thing to do,” she says. “Pitman wasn’t an educationist, and ITA is a perfect example of someone thinking they’ve got a good idea and trying to simplify something, but having absolutely no idea about teaching.”Sarah Kitt, now 60, was taught ITA at her state primary school in Plymouth in the late 1960s. For her, the legacy of ITA has lingered long past childhood. “I can tell when a word is wrong,” she says, “but I can’t always make it right. I get these complete blanks.”Her memories of those early years are clouded not just by the outre alphabet, but by the emotional toll it took. “I hated English. I would get to the school gates, burst into tears, and turn around and walk home again,” she says. “I had a teacher who wasn’t very sympathetic. I felt so stupid. I used to wonder whether I was dyslexic.”When Kitt was nine, she moved to Exeter. She quickly realised that other children at her new school hadn’t been taught to read and write the way she had. “You just learned to mask it,” she says. “You found ways to avoid spelling altogether.”View image in fullscreen‘There was no explanation. No one ever followed up to ask: how did this affect you?’: Sarah Kitt.Photograph: Thomas Dufffield/The GuardianKitt was put off humanities, and went on to study economics and statistics at university before working at the Bank of England for more than a decade. Before the digital era, she relied on her mother to check her essays. “At university, we didn’t have computers and spellcheck. I would get my mum to read through things.”Now a parent herself, Kitt is wary of any classroom experiment that puts children at risk of long-term disadvantage. She says: “I’d be hugely concerned if my daughter was taught like that. There would be more parent power now – people would be questioning it in WhatsApp groups. We didn’t have that.” Like others who learned ITA, Sarah’s frustration isn’t just with the method itself, but with the lack of transparency. “It seemed to just disappear,” she says. “There was no explanation. No one ever followed up to ask: how did this affect you?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

While many former pupils who used ITA blame their lifelong spelling struggles on it, others have had no such problems.In fact, early reports of ITA’s effects were largely positive. Infant school teachers noted that reading ability among children taught with ITA outpaced those learning with the standard alphabet. But a 1966 study demonstrated that any initial superior reading fluency of ITA learners began to fade at around age eight.Toni Brocklehurst, who taught ITA for four years in Lancashire in the early 1970s, still believes it gave many of her pupils – especially those from socially deprived homes – a head start. “These were kids who had no books at home,” she tells me. “Once they’d learned those characters, they could decode anything in that alphabet. It gave them a huge boost in confidence.”However, she continues: “I don’t think it would work for all children. It wouldn’t work for middle-class children who are being introduced to reading books at home, because it would confuse them.”The biggest challenge to ITA’s success was always going to be the transition back to the standard alphabet. And because pupils did that at different ages, many teachers were left juggling both alphabets simultaneously within the same class.View image in fullscreenA chart showing the new alphabet.Photograph: WikipediaEven more puzzling is the way the system was rolled out. ITA was never adopted nationally, nor required. As Stainthorp explains: “At that time, there was no national curriculum – a headteacher could simply decide to implement it in their school, or a teacher in their class. There was no consistency.”In the early 70s, Mike Alder was a pupil at Devonshire Road infants’ school in Blackpool. He was strong at maths and science, placed in top sets, and on track for good O-levels. But English was always different.“We had little thin cardboard books,” he remembers. “Stories about Paul and Sally. The letters were odd – some of them were joined together, like an ‘e’ and an ‘a’ welded into one shape. At first, I didn’t question it. I just thought that’s how everyone learned to read.”For Alder, the abrupt transition from ITA to the standard alphabet felt like a betrayal. “It was like they said: ‘Right, we’ve told you a pack of lies for the past two years, now this is how you’re actually meant to read and write.’ My disgust at being lied to, that loss of trust, that stuck with me. I was never interested in English after that.”He believes that ITA has had a long-term impact on his attainment. “My spelling is still appalling,” he says. “In all my subjects, I was getting As and Bs, but in English I really struggled. I got a C at O-level.” He remembers one friend, also taught in ITA, who had to retake English years later at sixth form just to move forward academically. “It definitely held people back.”Now 58, Alder works as a technical specialist in electrical ground equipment at BAE Systems in Blackpool. Though he has built a successful career, spelling remains a daily obstacle. “I rely on spellcheck constantly. I sent an email today and 15-20% of the words had that red underline.”View image in fullscreen‘My spelling is still appalling’: Mike Alder.Photograph: Thomas Dufffield/The GuardianFor decades, Alder assumed ITA was just a strange footnote in his own education. “When I tell people about it, most say, ‘What’s that?’ No one’s ever heard of it. It’s like it never happened. I’d love to read a proper lessons-learned document from it. What did they find? What did they conclude? Because, to me, it felt like they tried something, realised it didn’t work, and just buried it. If either of my kids had been taught ITA,” he adds, “I’d have pulled them out of school with immediate effect.”The issue isn’t simply whether or not ITA worked – the problem is that no one really knows. For all its scale and ambition, the experiment was never followed by a national longitudinal study. No one tracked whether the children who learned to read with ITA went on to excel, or struggle, as they moved through the education system. There was no formal inquiry into why the scheme was eventually dropped, and no comprehensive lessons-learned document to account for its legacy.In some ways, ITA is an extreme manifestation of a debate about early-years education that is still relevant today. The “reading wars” – the long-running tension between phonics-led approaches, which involve breaking down and sounding out words,and those that emphasise context, comprehension and whole-language exposure – are very much alive. English’s chaotic spelling system continues to divide experts and frustrate learners.In 2022, a landmark study by researchers at UCL’s Institute of Education found that the current emphasis on synthetic phonics is “uninformed and failing children”, and “not underpinned by the latest evidence”.View image in fullscreenAnother Ladybird ITA book.Photograph: Courtesy of Candida Books and CollectiblesSome defenders of ITA, like Brocklehurst, think its logic wasn’t so far removed from phonics – now a government-mandated method for teaching reading in UK primary schools. But there’s a key difference; phonics uses the same structure of the alphabet as every other bit of English language.What ITA reveals is how tempting it is to try to simplify a problem that is, in truth, irreducibly complex. There was a clarity to its premise: let’s make English easier. But the cost of that simplicity may have been borne by a generation of children, many of whom are still unsure of its impacts.“You’ve only got one education,” my mum says. “I do feel really resentful. My parents aren’t alive any more, but on their behalf as well – and as a parent now – I’d be absolutely furious to think that my children were put into an experiment without me being asked.” She pauses for a moment. “We weren’t given a choice, we weren’t asked and we weren’t explained to. I think it’s telling that it seems like this experiment slipped in and slipped out quietly. Fifty years later, we’re still suffering as a result.”Explore more on these topicsEducationLiteracySchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the half-ruined town, as across the entire territory, few took their eyes off their phones, a television or better-informed relatives or friends for more than a few minutes.Um Fadi Ma’rouf, from the now destroyed town of Beit Lahiya in the far north of Gaza, said she was encouraged by the positive response fromHamasto the most recent US-sponsored proposal of terms for a deal.“I think this means it will happen. I really hope it goes through because this situation has exhausted us,” said the 50-year-old, who has been forced to move nine times during the conflict.Israel has so far rejectedHamas’s demandsfor changes to a 14-point draft agreement circulated last week but on Sunday despatched a negotiating team to Qatar for indirect talks. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, is scheduled to meet Donald Trump, who is thought to hope to announce a ceasefire himself, in Washington on Monday evening local time.In Gaza City, the mood was tense and subdued. In the early morning, barefoot children with torn clothes and dirty faces walked the cracked streets carrying pots in search of food or scavenged for rubbish that could be used as fuel. Later, many of those living in stifling tents headed to the coast in search of respite from soaring temperatures.View image in fullscreenMany people in Gaza are living in tents after being displaced multiple times by Israeli strikes across the territory.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“From time to time, we hear airstrikes, but they are very far away and barely audible,” one Gaza City resident told the Guardian. “We haven’t seen any planes but a warship came very close to the shore but caused no trouble. It didn’t open fire.”There have been two previous ceasefires in Gaza, one in November 2023, and a second this year which came into effect in January but collapsed in March when Israel reneged on a promise to move to a second phase that might have led to a definitive end to the conflict. A new Israeli offensive followed and an 11-week total blockade that led to almost the entire population facingthe threat of famine.‘They’re skin and bones’: doctors in Gaza warn babies at risk of death from lack of formulaRead moreThe near 21-month war was triggered by a Hamas raid intoIsraelin October 2023 in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostages. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, of whom more than half are thought to be dead.The ensuing Israeli offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble, displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population multiple times and killed more than 57,000, mostly civilians.Ma’rouf said: “During the last truce, I never expected the war to return. When it did, it was a tragic feeling – indescribable. I lost my sister in this war, along with around 20 other members of my extended family. My greatest fear is losing someone else from my family – one of my children, my siblings, or close relatives.”View image in fullscreenMuch of Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the near 21-month war.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesNineteen-year-old Shahd Ashour, whose sister’s fiance was killed just before the last ceasefire was announced, said she too was remaining cautious.“My biggest fear now is that the news of the ceasefire turns out to be false – just rumours – and the war and killings continue. I still have hope, but only a little,” she said.Many children share such fears. Lama al-Mubayyed, 12, said she was scared of being “torn apart, killed, paralysed or losing a limb”.“I was so happy during the last ceasefire. We felt a bit safe. But when the war returned, I cried a lot because it meant going back to the suffering of tents, the summer heat, and repeated displacement,” Lama said.Aid officials in Gaza said on Saturday thatsupplies of fuel, essential to run the generators that are the primary source of power in the territory, are close to being exhausted. Without fresh deliveries, they said, humanitarian operations would collapse, the few remaining hospitals would be unable to function and communications would be cut off.“We are hopeful about a ceasefire of course, but we need to know how much aid is going to get in and how fast, and who will be able to distribute it. There are a lot of questions that are unanswered,” one humanitarian official in Deir al-Balah said.In recent weeks the flow of aid into Gaza has varied, though it has been little more than a fraction of what is needed, UN officials said.Hundreds have died seeking foodfrom looted trucks or a small number of distribution hubs. Prices for the limited basics available in the few markets vary wildly from day to day, though remain far too high for almost all in the territory to afford. On Sunday, a kilo of flour was selling for the equivalent of $10, a kilo of lentils for $12 and a kilo of rice or pasta for $14.View image in fullscreenHundreds of Palestinians have died in recent weeks while seeking food as the flow of aid into the territory has been a fraction of what is needed.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The greatest hardship we’re facing now – myself and everyone in Gaza – is finding food and water each day,” said Adel Sharaf, 18, who is from Beit Lahia but is living in a tent after his home was destroyed.Many in Gaza are bracing themselves for bad news. Ahmad, from the al-Shujaiya neighbourhood that has been almost entirely destroyed in repeated Israeli military operations, said he was pessimistic “because everyone was lying”.“Every week they hear about a possible ceasefire, and then it falls apart. This is always what happens, just like in previous times,” the 35-year-old said.Abu Adham Abu Amro, 55, said he was afraid to hope because he had already lost 25 family members in the conflict.“We pray to God that the ceasefire succeeds this time. Our days are full of hardship – struggling to access water and food, dealing with a shortage of resources, and the rise in prices,” Abu Amro, who is from Gaza City, said. “Right now, I have no fears other than the possibility that the ceasefire won’t happen this time.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are hoping there will be proper engagement around it, but we are worried about some of the signals we are picking up.”Another said: “People are really, really worried about this. It is one of the things that is going to make people feel very, very uncomfortable.”The letter published in the Guardian is evidence of growing public concern, despite reassurances from the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, that no decisions have yet been taken about the fate of EHCPs.Signatories to the letter include academics studying disability and neurodiversity such as Prof Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the University of Cambridge’s autism research centre, and campaigners including Rosa Monckton, as well as parent-led group Special Needs Jungle.“As new education reforms loom, every sign from the government suggests the right to an education, health and care plan (EHCP) is to be removed from children attending mainstream schools. Local authorities want EHCPs drastically reduced, or removed altogether, to relieve them of duties they often find costly and troublesome,” the letter states.“Without statutory support, underpinned by necessary extra resources for schools, it’s extremely unlikely that ministers will achieve their aim of more children with Send thriving, or even surviving, in mainstream education.“A reduction or complete snatching-away of EHCPs in mainstream education wouldn’t mean their needs magically vanish. It would, instead, increase applications for already overcrowded special schools or mean they would be forced out of school altogether.”The right to an education, health and care plan must be retainedRead moreAlthough ministers contend that policies are still being developed, discussions are said to include the phasing out of EHCPs over a number of years, or restricting them to the most profound level of need.Fears about the fate of EHCPs were raised in May when Dame Christine Lenehan, the government’s strategic adviser on special educational needs and disabilities, said EHCPs would “probably” change because there were questions if they were “the right vehicle”.One Labour backbencher said several MPs had requested meetings with Phillipson and Catherine McKinnell, the school standards minister, to question them on the plans. The MP added that the meetings so far had been unsatisfactory because ministers told them only that no decision over EHCPs had yet been made.Marie Tidball, the Labour MP who gave an emotional Commons speech against the welfare bill last week, said the Send reforms were now a major focus for many of her fellow backbenchers.Speaking on a live edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast at the Crossed Wires festival in Sheffield, Tidball said: “There’s going to be lots of work done over the summer on this, and I know that colleagues will be very keen to involve backbenchers who’ve got huge amounts of experience on that issue.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is totally inaccurate to suggest that children, families and schools might experience any loss of funding or support.“This government is actively working with parents and experts on the solutions, including more early intervention to prevent needs from escalating and £740m to encourage councils to create more specialist places in mainstream schools.”One supportive MP said Phillipson and her team had done a lot of outreach to MPs to try to prevent a repeat of last week’s dramatic Commons scenes.Councils face millions in extra Send costs as overhaul delayedRead more“The education team are doing a really, really good job of engaging with people,” the person said. “There will be a consultation and a proper process.”But they added that many Labour MPs were concerned because of the amount of mail that was being generated by anxious parents. “Parents of Send kids are climbing up the walls right now,” they said. “Our job is to get them down from those walls.”EHCPs were introduced in 2014, and give statutory force to plans agreed by parents and local authorities about the additional support for children and young people up to the age of 25 with assessed special needs or disabilities.But as the number of EHCPs has rocketed above 600,000, in part because of increasing assessments of autism, ADHD and speech and language difficulties, thestrain on local authority high needs budgets, as well as related transport costs, has pushed many councils in England towards insolvency.Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsBridget PhillipsonSchoolsDisabilityChildrenChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

How do I know? You cannot prove it, because she’s local they can say whatever. You took the game away from me,” Pavlyuchenkova said after Kartal won the point and went on to break for a 5-4 lead. “They have stolen the game from me, they stole it.”A Wimbledon spokesperson said the club had apologised to the players after finding that the technology was “deactivated in error on part of the server’s side of the court for one game”.Pavlyuchenkova went on to overpower Kartal, who later said she was “devastated” that her fairytale run had ended with a 7-6 (3), 6-4 defeat on her Centre Court debut.Cameron Norrie became the last Briton standing after battling through to the Wimbledon quarter-finals in a five-set epic which also was not short of drama.The 29-year-old defeated his Chilean opponent Nicolás Jarry in four and a half hours and became the only British player to reach the second week of the tournament despite a promising start from several hopefuls.Norrie, the British No 3, fell to the floor after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (7), 6-7 (5), 6-3 win in front of a roaring No 1 Court crowd. Spectators appeared to boo Jarry when the South American confronted Norrie as the pair were shaking hands at the net.Jarry, the 29-year-old world No 143, had earlier complained to the umpire after appearing frustrated with how long Norrie was taking to serve.“It is not a nervous tic, it is something he can control,” Jarry said. He later denied there had been a spat, saying all he had told Norrie at the net was the Briton had deserved to win.In an on-court interview after the match, Norrie said of the five-set epic: “I just had to keep fighting.”The former top 10 player, who was knocked out of the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022 by Novak Djokovic, went on: “I think at the beginning of this year I was struggling a little bit with confidence and had some doubts – and just wanted to enjoy my tennis a little bit more.“I’m doing that and I enjoyed it today, so it was a bonus today, but I was more happy I was enjoying it and I was playing point for point, that’s what mattered.”When asked about the courtside drama, he added that Jarry had told him he was “a little bit vocal”.Kartal, ranked 298 in the world this time last year and 51 now, earlier said she was proud of her performance this week.“Probably for the rest of the day I’ll be a bit sad,” the 5ft 4in Brighton native told reporters.“But I think tomorrow I’ll probably wake up, and I can look back on this week and be super proud of it and step back and think, you know, fourth round of a slam, it’s the first experience, and for it being here, having beaten the players that I did to do that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her match was as dramatic as the weather after the embarrassing malfunction with the AI-enhanced Hawk-Eye technology.After an investigation which included speaking to the players, Helwerth, Hawk-Eye operators and a review official, a spokesperson for the All England Club said: “It is now clear that the live electronic line calling (ELC) system, which was working optimally, was deactivated in error on part of the server’s side of the court for one game by those operating the system.“In that time there were three calls not picked up by live ELC on the affected part of the court. Two of these were called by the chair umpire, who was not made aware that the system had been deactivated.Cameron Norrie sinks Jarry in five-set epic to reach Wimbledon quarter-finalsRead more“Following the third, the chair umpire stopped the match and consulted with the review official. It was determined that the point should be replayed.“We continue to have full confidence in the accuracy of the ball tracking technology. The live ELC system relies on the Hawk-Eye operators, the review official and the technology to work in harmony. This did not happen.“In this instance there was a human error and as a consequence we have fully reviewed our processes and made the appropriate changes.”Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper, the British No 1s, have both complained about the new technology and questioned some of its calls.Speaking after her win, Pavlyuchenkova said she believed the umpire should have called the ball out rather than making them replay the point.“He was probably scared to take such a big decision. I think they should … that’s why we have a chair umpire,” she told reporters.“Otherwise, I think soon let’s just play without them, right, and then we’re going to have everything automatic. I think we losing a little bit of the charm of actually having human beings … it just becomes a little bit weird and, like, robot sort of orientated.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025TennisWimbledonnewsShareReuse this content"

The shock was compounded when it was revealed that the atrocity was the work of British-born terrorists, supported by Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida.View image in fullscreenNeil Basu.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianBasu was head of counter-terrorism until 2021 and said the current level of attack threat to the UK was higher than in 2005. Other sources confirm that grim assessment.Basu said the 7 July attacks contributed to a growth in suspicion of Muslims and damage to race relations that left people of colour fearful, reversing progress made since the 1980s.They also came two years after the UK, then with Tony Blair as prime minister, joined in the US invasion of Iraq, on the false pretext that it had weapons of mass destruction.Basu said: “A driver of the 7/7 attacks was foreign policy and Iraq. That does not excuse in any way what they did.“That foreign policy decision has radicalised and made extremists of people who might not have been radicalised or extreme. And if they were on the pathway, it’s pretty much guaranteed …“All terrorists will have a freedom fighter story. Bin Laden would have had a freedom fighter story. We might think it’s crap. We might think it’s self-justification, but he will have had a story about liberating his lands from the great invaders.”View image in fullscreenThe tube train that was bombed at Aldgate station in London on 7 July 2005.Photograph: EPABasu said it did not mean a terrorist threat should dictate foreign policy but governments needed to be honest that such decisions might mean “you’ll be less safe when you’re at Westfield on a Saturday afternoon”.The 7 July ringleader was Mohammad Sidique Khan, a teaching assistant and community worker, who was married and a father, and had been to a terrorist training camp in Pakistan.In a suicide video after his death he attempted to justify the acts of murder by him and three others, claiming in his Yorkshire accent: “We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation.”Basu said: “There is no one path for any single individual to go down a terrorist route. There’s a multiplicity of paths, and one of them is: ‘I’m right, you’re wrong.’ Now that looks obscene to us … They are on God’s side. We are on Satan’s side.”He said thebacklash against Muslims in Britain, a fraying of the social fabric and rise of extremism were what the terrorists would have hoped for: “When terrorists hide behind a religion to commit an atrocity, people blame every follower of the religion and the religion itself. We ought to stop doing that.“That causes a fear and suspicion of people who don’t look like you, think like you, eat like you, worship like you. That has got worse, not better, and that has been caused exactly as terrorists want, by dividing a society by committing the shocking act.”View image in fullscreenThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, laying a wreath at the 7 July memorial in Hyde Park, London, on the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA MediaProgress in race relations, “a trajectory of tolerance” since the 1980s, had reversed after devastating terrorist attacks.Basu said:“That’s what I think has been most soul-destroying … It has interrupted a trajectory of tolerance that I was becoming very familiar and happy with …“It started with 9/11 … 7/7 accelerated that in this country. The relationship between races is worse today, or as bad today as it was in the 70s and 80s. That period of tolerance is over, and feels very much over.”All Muslims being tarred with suspicion after terrorist attacks had caused wider damage.Basu, who is of mixed race, said: “How can that not possibly have set in a lot of people who were undecided about whether they wanted a multicultural, racially integrated society? How is that going to affect them? In exactly the way the terrorists wanted. It was going to make them say, we don’t want those people here.“The zeitgeist has changed. If I as a 6ft, ex-police officer with quite a few skills and lots of mates and the ex-head of counter-terrorism feel more vulnerable today than I felt in pretty much most of my adult life, I think that there is a change.”Basu said greater societal resilience was needed and that over the past 20 years the extremes had fed off each other, with events such as last summer’s riots part of a bitter legacy.Survivors call for tighter UK media guidelines on reporting terror attacksRead moreHe said: “The ringleaders in those events who are causing the most anxiety you can trace way back to the ‘war on terror’. You know where [Tommy] Robinson came from, where the EDL [English Defence League] came from … You can trace all the way back to being mobilised by these horrific terrorist acts.“I look at the rise of extreme rightwing terrorism in this country …of rightwing racist attitudes towards black and brown people, and I look at the rise in hate crime reporting … and can’t help but think we’ve got a vicious cycle that started when certain vicious groups started killing people on western soil. I think they were intending to do that, and they have succeeded.”Basu said that when the police focus had to shift to terrorism after 2005, attempts to stamp out prejudice in the ranks waned, after the inquiryinto the Stephen Lawrence murder and police errors that left his killers free.He added:“Events like 7/7 in 2005 blew apart the whole post-Lawrence diversity agenda. It literally destroyed it.”Robert Quick, the head of counter-terrorism between 2008-09 said the number of counter-terrorism operations he was overseeing was up to 100, with about 2,500 people of concern. Now that figure is 600 operations, with many more people suspected of potential involvement and support for terrorism.Islamist attack plots dominate the work of counter-terrorism officials, followed by those from the far right and also those where there is no clear cause. In addition, there is now the threat from hostile states, mainly Iran and Russia.Explore more on these topics7 July London attacksMetropolitan policePoliceLondonIslamReligionUK security and counter-terrorismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite a government promise to “smash” the gangs organising crossings, more than 20,000 people have crossed to the UK in the first six months of this year, up 48% on the equivalent period in 2024.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Even though we’ve heard so many times before about a possible truce, it always fails, and now we’re afraid to even feel hopeful,” said Abu Adham Abu Amro, 55.“There is no more trust left because of the ongoing disagreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides – one side agrees, the other refuses, and so it goes.”The war in Gaza was triggered on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched a surprise attack into southern Israel, killing about 1,200, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Hamas is still holding approximately 50 hostages but fewer than half are thought to be alive.In Israel, public pressure is mounting for a deal to free all the hostages still in Gaza.Vicky Cohen, the mother of a soldier being held by Hamas in Gaza, said Israelis could only recover from the trauma of the 2023 attack if all the hostages were returned.“Israelis care for each other … we will not leave anyone back there and we will bring them all back. These are the values that Israel is based on. I hope our prime minister is brave enough to do the right thing,” she said.Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, displaced almost all of the 2.3 million population and reduced much of the territory to rubble.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had no immediate comment on the individual strikes in Gaza reported on Sunday, but said 130 targets were struck across the territory in the previous 24 hours, including militants, Hamas command and control structures, storage facilities, weapons and launchers.View image in fullscreenPeople remove a metal scaffolding from a building hit by Israeli bombardment in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesThe IDF also said a strike on a cafe in Gaza City last Monday that killed or wounded about 100 people, including many women, children and elderly people, had targeted a meeting of senior Hamas commanders. Experts have said the strike, which involved a500lb bombdropped on to a terrace crowded with waiters, families and students, could constitute a war crime.IDF sources told the Times of Israel newspaper thatRamzi Ramadan Abd Ali Salah,who led Hamas’s naval force in northern Gaza, and several other Hamas commanders died in the attack.Hundreds of Palestinianshave been killed by Israeli soldiers in recent weeksas they have gathered in large crowds to get food from looted convoys, from distributions by the UN, or from sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial US- and Israel-backed private organisation that started operations last month.On Saturday, Israel’s security cabinet said it would allow aid organisations to resume convoys into northern Gaza, where the humanitarian crisis in the territory is most acute. The move was opposed by far-right members of Israel’s ruling coalition, who say any aid will be stolen by Hamas and that none should be allowed to enter Gaza.The head of a Palestinian armed group opposed to Hamas and accused of looting aid in Gaza confirmed in an interview with public radio on Sunday that it was coordinating with the Israeli military.“We keep them informed, but we carry out the military actions on our own,” Yasser Abu Shabab said in an interview with Makan, Israel’s Arabic-language public radio broadcaster.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHamasDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The lion later returned to the owners’ farmhouse and was relocated to a wildlife park, police said.Keeping exotic animals such as lions is considered a status symbol by some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the legal requirements and high fees associated with ownership.InTurkey, a lion that escaped from a theme park near the resort of Antalya was shot dead on Sunday after attacking a man, the local governor and media reports said.The lion, reportedly named Zeus, escaped his enclosure at the Land of Lions animal theme park in Manavgat, about 40 miles (65km) east of Antalya, in the early hours of the morning, the governor said.According to the BirGün newspaper, the lion attacked an agricultural worker called Suleiman Kir who was asleep in a pistachio field with his wife. Kir tussled with the lion before it ran off. He was injured but not badly and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.“We were covered with blankets to protect ourselves from mosquitoes and when the prayer call sounded, I tried to stand up but I couldn’t,” he told the newspaper. “Suddenly I felt something touch my left foot and when I eventually managed to get up, I saw it was something huge – I thought it was a dog.”In a video posted online, he described the moments wrestling with the lion. “We called for help but there was no one around. As the lion was biting my calf and my neck, I grabbed him around the neck and began to squeeze and he backed off. At that moment, the security forces came,” he said. “If I had not been strong, I wouldn’t be here right now.”Antalya’s governor said the lion had been tracked down and shot dead. “It was not possible to catch the escaped lion alive because it posed a danger to people and the environment, so it was shot,” he said.He indicated that an investigation had been opened into the incident. BirGün said there were about 30 big cats at the Land of Lions.Explore more on these topicsPakistanAnimalsTurkeySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Forty per cent said they would consider a legal challenge if dissatisfied with the outcome of their claim. Consumers also showed little trust in the ability of banks and lenders to check records and distribute compensation.There are also concerns that some consumers could miss out becausemost bankspurge customer dataafter six years. The FCA ordered lenders to cease doing so in January 2024, when it launched the investigation, but files relating to customers with contracts that ended more than six years earlier may have already been lost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s no ambition on Europe to get growth. The10-year NHS planfailed to mention social care and failed to mention family carers. It could turn out to be the most expensive sticking plaster in history.“We’ve seen the chaoson welfare. Even on defence, they’re not taking the steps we need and with the foreign agenda where we’re supposed to be doing so well, I don’t think their position on Donald Trump has yielded the sorts of deep results that we need.“It’s almost as if, like Sunak, a tweak here, a tweak there is all he thinks needs to be done.”View image in fullscreenThe Liberal Democrats leader, Ed Davey.Photograph: House of Commons/AFP/Getty ImagesDavey, whohas talked aboutcaring for his son, who is disabled, and for his mother when she was ill, praised Starmerfor discussingin a recent interview how he had personally sorted through the possessions of his brother, Nick, after he died late last year.“I think it’s important that people do hear that, because with the distrust in politics and politicians, it’s important people do see that politicians value things like family,” Davey said.“But as prime minister, there needs to be something that people can get behind. He needs people to understand where we’re going. And I don’t think anyone, even his own party, have a real feel for where he’s going.”In comparison not just withLabour, but also the Conservatives and Reform UK, Davey’s party has enjoyed a relatively undramatic year since the election, winning more seats in May’s local elections and pushing ahead with a stance of “constructive opposition” to the government.The Lib Dems are generally scoring only a few points above the 12.2% support they received in the general election in national polling, but while they have on a couple of occasions scored above the Tories, Reform are far ahead in first place.Davey, however, argued that local byelection results, such as one on Thursday in which the partytook a seaton Durham county council from Reform, showed the extent of the Lib Dems’ appeal, and the limitations of national polling.“In parts of the country where we haven’t been doing so well we’re really coming back, and I can see a pathway for us doing something very special in the next election. I think we will surprise people again,” he said.“During the last parliament, if I’d I said ‘look, we’re going to win 72 seats,’ I think they would have questioned my objectivity and rationality. But we knew what we were doing.”On the rise of Reform, Davey argued that one factor was the disproportionate coverage given by the BBC to Nigel Farage and his party, something he said was “just completely disproportionate”.“I come to this debate as essentially someone who supports the BBC,” he said. “But I fear that they’re allowing themselves to be seen, by some at least, as an organ of Reform. They seem to bend over backwards to please Nigel Farage. They’re almost like a mouthpiece for Nigel Farage, he’s on so much, and this is a guy who wants to destroy them.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerEd DaveyLabourLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rosaviatsiya, Russia’s civil aviation authority, reported temporary airport closures in the two cities and other regional centres and said dozens of flights had been delayed.In Ukraine on Sunday,Russian drones injured three civilians in Kyiv and at least two in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, located in the north-east, officials said.

He had been invited to Mayfair for the launch of a book byPeter York, profiler of London’s most privileged bons vivants. But before he left the house, Geldof watched the BBC television news and areport by Michael Buerkabout a hellish famine in Ethiopia.Among the many startling, blackly comic archive clips inLive Aidat 40: When Rock ’n’ Roll Took on the World is footage of Geldof at that glitzy party, reeling from what he had seen on TV and remarking to a fellow guest that it was “gross” for them to be enjoying champagne and canapes. That tension between glamour and guilt is at the heart of this three-part retrospective that doesn’t ignore the flaws in Geldof’s grand plan to use music to feed the world. It’s a fascinating portrait of a complex man’s imperfect attempt to solve an impossible problem.The grand achievement commemorated in the title of the series isLive Aid, the Geldof-organised mega-concert that took place in London and Philadelphia in the summer of 1985. Episode one, however, is all about the smaller but still massive cultural moment that resulted from Geldof’s initial impulse to raise funds for Ethiopia:Do They Know It’s Christmas?, a single by the hastily assembled supergroup Band Aid.Having written the song with Midge Ure of Ultravox, Geldof sets about convincing every pop star in Britain to gather at a recording studio in west London on 25 November 1984. For the first time but not the last, something that shouldn’t be possible happens very quickly: Geldof has the balls to demand participation from A-list stars, who have all seen the Buerk report and are keen to help.View image in fullscreen‘All the rage, all the shame’ … Bob Geldof in Live Aid at 40.Photograph: BBC/Brook LappingPop is far too globalised, atomised and digitised now for such a project to take off: at best in the 21st century, the equivalent celebrity charity effort would be a co-authored viral video. Geldof and Ure both make the point that in 1984, pop gods were overwhelmingly from working-class backgrounds, which is also much less true today. But however it came about, everyone turns up, from Spandau Ballet to Duran Duran, Phil Collins to Sting, Status Quo to Bananarama.The footage of them there together is still intoxicating. George Michael sings a line, looks dissatisfied then fixes it, changing “but say a prayer” to “BUT say a prayer” on the next take.Bonomight be characteristically cringeworthy in his 2025 interview, with his talk of how he and fellow Irishman Geldof “have the folk memory of famine” and are thus particularly attuned to the cause, but he also knows exactly what he’s doing when a lyric sheet and a microphone are in front of him: having been given the song’s darkest, most difficult line, he shifts “Well tonight thank God it’s them, instead of you” up an octave to the top of his register, doubling its impact.Once the single has sold a zillion copies, we witness Geldof’s transformation from musician to activist. Before long he is meetingMother Teresa(“She played the old lady shtick but boy, this was showbusiness”) and telling world leaders what he thinks of them: the documentary has dug up a clip of him ambushing Margaret Thatcher over her initial insistence on collecting VAT on every record sold. In a situation where one could so easily think of the right thing to say afterwards when it’s too late, Geldof rather magnificently knocks down her glib defence of western inaction there and then. He is even more unapologetic with the president of Ethiopia, swearing at him to his face, although sadly there’s no footage of that and we have to rely on Geldof’s recall.The most stunning moment is another Geldof recollection, from when he was in a desert in Ethiopia and heard Do They Know it’s Christmas? on the radio: when he gets to the part about listening to that Bono line while looking directly at the horror it referred to, the present-day Geldof suddenly bursts into tears. “All the rage, all the shame” is his bluntly eloquent summary of emotions that are still with him, and he is frank here about becoming a white saviour figure who placed himself in the spotlight – but had to do that to keep the media interested.Whether Geldof ultimately struck that balance is explored in the two further episodes, as is the question of how the money was distributed and how much self-interest drove the artists who performed at Live Aid. But there’s no debating what an extraordinary phenomenon it was.Live Aid at 40: When Rock ’n’ Roll Took on the World aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionLive AidBob GeldofBonoFaminereviewsShareReuse this content"

But be warned, it is shockingLucy ManganSun 6 Jul 2025 16.00 EDTShareOK, I think it is incumbent upon me as an ethical reviewer to state something up top. I am conscious of our collective emotional fragility in difficult times, so need to say this: do not watch the first episode of Jimmy Doherty’s Big Bear Rescue without some kind of mental fortification to hand. I am no great animal lover. I prefer them to people, obviously, but given absolute freedom of choice I would be without any sentient being in the bunker with me. I’d like to draw the deadbolts across the blast-resistant doors, switch on the air-filtration system, open a tin and a book and wait out my time in silence without responsibility for any other living soul, thank you.However, it’s 72 hours since the closing credits of this programme and I haven’t stopped crying. If that’s an unwanted spoiler for some, so be it. I think I’ve saved you some pain overall.So. You remember Jimmy Doherty, yes? Childhood friend ofJamie Oliver, became a pig farmer, met his wife, Michaela Furney, who was a runner on Jamie’s Kitchen when it came to film on the Cumbrian farm where Doherty was working in 2002. He came to televisual prominence a year or two later with several series of the reality show Jimmy’s Farm, chronicling the ups and down of his sausage-making venture in Essex and other sustainable food/Oliver tie-ins thereafter.In recent years, it seems, the farm has grown in size and scope to become at least in part a rescue centre for animal waifs and strays. Apparently this is what happens if you’re careless enough to settle in the countryside. The Dohertys (the couple have four daughters) have taken in llamas, emus, camels, tapirs, crocodiles, camels and a giant anteater, I presume from zoos and overambitious exotic-pet owners far stupider than their poor abandoned charges.The family now must take on their biggest challenge yet: providing a suitable home for two polar bears, whose zoo in Sweden has been bought by developers. Now staff and animals alike are being turfed out.View image in fullscreenA lot to bear … Ewa in her enclosure.Photograph: Jimmy’s Farm, Red SkyThe ursine duo, mother Ewa and son Mikke, were born and raised in captivity and cannot be released into the wild. They need all the things polar bears need – acres and acres of space, a den, a bear house, woodland, and lakes – and the Dohertys set about providing it all, under the watchful eye of the polar bear expert Douglas Richardson and their vigilant bank manager. When the project is complete, it will be a 28-hectare (70 acre) haven and Europe’s biggest polar bear reserve.Foundations for the bear house are dug, ground is broken for the lakes and almost nine miles of extremely robust fencing – plus a shipment of telegraph poles for posts – is bought. It is repeatedly emphasised that Ewa and Mikke are not the cuddly creatures of children’s picture books but members of one of the biggest carnivore species on Earth and an apex predator. This is brought home to us when Michaela notes that half a dozen employees have been sent away to train as the firearms team that will be needed in the event of a bear-related emergency.In the meantime, Doherty, Richardson and the park director, Stevie Sheppard, visit the Orsa Predator Park in Sweden to learn all they can from its zoologist, Linn Larsson, and the keeper, Johanna Berglund, about their beloved bears (once they leave, says Larsson, “the heart and soul of this mountain will be gone”).Then they begin the mammoth task of transporting the bears more than 1,200 miles across Europe to their new home. Everything is minutely prepared and goes smoothly – we see Ewa and Mikke chomping delightedly on their food as they sail overnight on the ferry from France to Dover – right up until what suddenly becomes a very bitter end. “I want to scream,” says Jimmy, looking shattered. “I want to kick something very hard … It’s heartbreaking. But there was no alternative.”But the Big Bear Rescue remains, despite the shock, an uplifting story. It’s a tale of people who prize something above profit banding together to mitigate the damage others have done, to give animals who would otherwise have been put down a second chance at life. Next week, the new reserve will receive more polar bears and a dozen Arctic wolves. I hear talk of reindeer, too. Hopefully there will be a happier ending – and I will have stopped crying by then.Jimmy Doherty’s Big Bear Rescue is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAnimalsWildlifeZoosConservationDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

For almost two and a half hours, the soul-funk-pop legend rifles through his back catalogue with the glee of a small child deciding which toy to play with next. At various turns he’s peacemaker – encouraging world leaders to “lead us to a better place” – then 1960s soul man, balladeer, funkmeister and synthesiser soul explorer. Such are Wonder’s musical treasures that the 26-song setlist can pile through Higher Ground’s glorious elasticated groove in the first four numbers and omit Uptight, Happy Birthday, He’s Misstra Know It All and many other classics altogether.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Blind since shortly after birth, he swaps sunglasses and jokes “I can’t see without my glasses”, then leads the crowd into an impromptu burst of You Are My Sunshine by way of intro to You Are the Sunshine of My Life. Given his age and the length of the show, it’s understandable that he takes a break. There is a slight lull as backing vocalists take the spotlight, and later his son Mandla Morris sings I Can Only Be Me.However, in the second half Wonder turns full-on human jukebox, delivering Golden Lady, Living for the City, Sir Duke, Isn’t She Lovely, a riotously joyful I Wish and many more with barely a pause between them. He perhaps mercifully shortens I Just Called to Say I Love You, which signalled his later career excursions into schmaltz. Still, Lately, his 1980 dissection of the pain of a lover’s infidelity, is simply stunning in both rawness and vocal range. With the curfew beckoning, he finally ends with a blistering 10-minute Superstition, yelling “I love you” at the crowd and then as if by magic turning the phrase into a new hook.This show is very much a celebration of roads travelled, but offers a timely reminder of the brilliance, endurance and uniqueness of one of pop’s true greats.AtUtilita Arena, Birmingham, 7 July.Then touringExplore more on these topicsStevie WonderPop and rockSoulreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sam said that’s already happening with Labour scrapping NHS England. But my understanding is that, while the organisation is being abolished, nobody’s being made redundant.

People think it’s intelligent enough to self-learn. I haven’t seen any evidence of that.SamI fully agree that technology can be a force for good. But I don’t think companies like Meta and Google have our best interests at heart. We’ve seen that with electioneering and the way they manipulate people’s data to target them.

To me, safe routes are the answer.MattAs one of the top countries in the world, we have a right and a duty to take care of people who are coming to the UK because they’re at risk of harm, but I think we’ve got to get quicker at identifying those who are at risk, and then dealing with those who aren’t by processing them quicker, and returning them to their rightful abode.View image in fullscreenTakeawaysDining across the divide: ‘He didn’t believe women still face discrimination in the workplace’Read moreSamThe world would be a better place if we could all have a chat.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 6 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTShareAnnie, 36There’s quite a seductive element of being a bit like a teacherI’ve always been pretty horny and have found it quite easy to connect with people on a sexual level. In general, if I’ve wanted to get laid, I’ve managed to do that quite easily.Because of that I’ve taken periods of celibacy in my life, as I think sex can be a bit distracting sometimes. It’s happened about three times, each for about a year or so, usually after a time of change in my life. It brings me clarity.Removing sex gives you more headspace to focus on other things, and those periods have been some of the most productive of my life. And then, when you come out the other side, you’re reacquainted with sex in a way that sparks that sense of enjoyment.One of the things I found drew me to him was that he feels like a very sexual personI met Leon about six months after I’d come out of one of these celibate periods. We were both coming from a similar place but in very different ways, ready to re-engage and get excited about sex.He was going through a divorce at the time, and part of that was due to a dead bedroom situation where they very rarely had sex. He was quite upfront that his re-engagement with the dating scene was just to get his rocks off and reacquaint himself with his sexual side.One of the things that drew me to him was that he is a very sexual person.Sexembeds itself very easily into our daily lives. We don’t have to schedule intimacy; it’s something that feels very natural.We have a lot of sex, and lots of different types of sex. I’ve had a lot more sexual experiences than Leon, such as BDSM and group sex. There’s quite a seductive element of being a bit like a teacher. Before me, he’d had very vanilla sex with the same person for about 15 years, so it has been exciting to introduce him to new ideas, whether that’s toys or role play, or even just unconventional positions.There’s a sense of exploration in our sex life, which I think is one of the things that has kept the spark growing between us.It’s empowering for both of us.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Part of the reason for this has been me rediscovering myself as a sexual person.I’d never felt able to freely express myself sexually. I went to an all-boys school, so I didn’t really get to interact with girls much until my late teens. Then when I was 20 I met the girl who became my wife. So that set the boundary in terms of experiencing different partners and understanding what sex is to me.Annie and I met while I was going through a difficult divorce. I’d lost my mojo, and was confused and ashamed that I wasn’t initiating sex. I felt like there was something wrong with me.I’m really keen to not settle into a routine. And I think I’m scrambling to make up for lost timeSince meeting Annie, I’ve been able to come out of my shell and explore some of the things I think I’ve always been interested in. Annie wears her sexuality on her sleeve, and she’s not afraid to say what she likes.She’s a very powerful, confident woman and it’s very invigorating for me to be with someone who can just lead the way. It takes the pressure off me, which is really freeing. I’m having all these new experiences like role play, toys and restraints, and she is taking on a more dominant role which we both enjoy.I’m really keen to not settle into a routine for very obvious reasons, so I’ve always got that impetus to keep making sure we’re still engaging in a fun and experimental way. I think I’m scrambling to make up for lost time.We see each other once or twice a week so we’ll have a lot of sex when we are together. It’s not always kinky. If one of us has had a difficult week, we’ll be there for each other in a more emotionally supportive and intimate way, and that’s the kind of sex we’ll have. And if we’re feeling good and we go to the pub and have a few drinks, then the gloves are off.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result? Cruel cuts and a chronic fear of desperately needed public spendingSun 6 Jul 2025 08.35 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 13.25 EDTShareOn 6 September 2022, Liz Truss entered No 10 with a clear vision for the country; the country asked her to leaveless than 50 days later. But nearly three years on, even though all that remains of her premiership at Downing Street is a portrait she didn’t stick around long enough to see hung, it is she who really runs Britain.Not through her influence – which has since been reduced to poorly attended speechesat far-right conferencesin the US – but through the fear she left behind. Truss may be gone, but what remains is the shadow her failure cast, and the rigid fiscal caution that grew out of it.Last week’sbenefits bill fiascois a case in point. While all the talk from this government was about getting disabled people into work, they presented no real evidence that siphoning money away from this group will achieve this. The benefit cuts were driven by a rush to find government savings after GDP growth forecasts were lower than expected, threatening the chancellor’s ability to meet her own fiscal rules. If this strikes you as an odd way to make major policy decisions, then you’re not alone.We’ve ended up in a world where aone percentage point differencein a GDP forecast cascades down into a series of reforms that would have pushed hundreds of thousands into poverty. Why? Because the possibility of not meeting the fiscal rules was apparently spooking the markets.The chancellor has been consistent with these fiscal rules. She told theGlobal Borrowers and Bond Investment Forum(ie bond investors, the same people who turned on Liz Truss) that they were essential for underpinning financial stability.But fiscal rules have become a religion. In this self-imposed straitjacket, governments believe they can only spend if the economy is growing and borrow if the bond markets nod approvingly. These rules weren’t created by Truss, but their new totemic status in British politics was forged in the fire she left behind.The result? We’ve boxed ourselves into a corner. Our public sector needs money. Growth is flat and threatened by global instability. Interest rates are high. But under these arbitrary rules, we’re left with just two levers: raise taxes or cut spending.MPs and the public have shown that they are unwilling to tolerate further cuts, seemingly more alive than the government to the fact that they will create further costs in the long run. Who can blame them? The public isn’t irrational. They have seen the state decay after 14 years of cuts; they don’t believe it will be able to stand another round. They have also lived through years of stagnant wages and will be wary of tax rises on the back of already squeezed household budgets.Plans to means-test thewinter fuel paymentled to this government being accused of attacking elderly people. Last week, £5bn of rushed and flawed benefit cutswere rightly destroyedthrough a rebellion from the government’s own MPs.And while there is a growing consensus about the need to tax wealth fairly, this government so far appears unwilling to make these trade-offs. The closest we have come to anything resembling a bold wealth tax is a fairly meagre change tocapital gains tax rates.And so here we are, being informed that there is a “black hole” in the public finances that must be filled at all costs, yet with no politically acceptable route to make this happen. But there is a third lever that they should consider: rethink the fiscal rules themselves, and with them, our assumptions about debt and growth. Instead, Westminster treats these constraints as sacred.That’s the legacy of Truss.Her mini-budgetmay have collapsed in days, but the fear it left behind governs us still. The bond market is now our unofficial second chamber. Every policy is measured against its hypothetical response. It doesn’t matter that the markets themselves aren’t demanding cuts, only that politicians think they might.After the welfare vote debacle, this much is clear: Starmer must change. Labour MPs will demand it | Rafael BehrRead moreWe are approaching a fundamental choice: do we continue trying to appease the markets by clinging to a set of self-imposed constraints that block the kind of spending needed to improve living standards and revive growth? Or do we remove those constraints and make the decisions necessary to fix our economy? I know which I’d prefer, not least because public investment can boost growth, raise tax revenues and ease pressure on the national debt over time. The alternative of more austerity risks doing the opposite: choking off growth, weakening the economy and actually making our debt burden harder to manage as a result.The fear is that markets will punish us for daring to spend. But that fear has become self-defeating. In reality, the financial returns from well-targeted public spending – on infrastructure, childcare, health, skills – are often far higher than our anaemic assumptions allow. The economic returns are bigger, the benefits broader and the risks lower than we have conditioned ourselves to believe. A politics that always talks down the impact of spending ends up justifying stagnation.That fear is how you end up with a government paralysed by its own Truss trauma, an exhausted politics where every problem is diagnosed but none are treated, because every solution breaks a taboo. And the longer we stay in this holding pattern, the more brittle the state becomes – and the more we’re left asking why nothing ever seems to change.Until someone finds the courage to govern without flinching, we will remain stuck in this loop, where fear dictates policy, and decline is dressed up as stability. Until then, this is Liz Truss’s UK – we’re all just living in it.Max Mosley is a senior economist at the NewEconomicsFoundationExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionEconomic policyTax and spendingLabourRachel ReevesLiz TrussEconomic growth (GDP)commentShareReuse this content"

In the UK, public support for development, once solid enough to encourage David Cameron to embrace the target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid, started tofall away from about 2012-13.More recently, the world has become a much more fragmented, multipolar place. Middle-income countries such as China and India have demanded more prominence on the global stage. Russia’s territorial aggression in Ukraine prompted its expulsion from the G8 – now the G7 – and killed off any lingering hopes that free trade and capitalism would ultimately usher in liberal democracy.Global solidarity was hard to summon, then, even before Donald Trump’s second term unleashed chaos in the global trading system.The budgets of many rich-country governments have taken a battering from repeated economic shocks, at the same time as pressure mounts for more defence spending to confront potential threats. Labour ministers are quite right when they say “the world has changed”.Yet despite the more fraught global backdrop, the campaigners who worked alongside Blair and Brown at Gleneagles and beyond have been profoundly shocked by the British government’s casual disregard of development.Three years ago, Keir Starmer waspromising to undo Boris Johnson’s “misguided” decisionto absorb the Department for International Development back into the Foreign Office.Labour’s manifesto dropped this idea. It suggested the UK had “lost influence” as a result of the Tories’ neglect of international development and promised to “turn the page to rebuild Britain’s reputation”, restoring aid to 0.7% “as soon as fiscal circumstances allow”.Instead, Labour slashed the aid budget, with little discussion, when Starmer wanted to promise Trump he would raise defence spending on his White House trip in February.Jenny Chapman, the development minister who replaced Anneliese Dodds when she resigned in protest at this deep budget cut, has insisted the UK still wants to lead on development. Yet it is hard to take the moral high ground while admitting that no area of policy, including projects to support women and girls’ health and education, will be safe from the cuts.Labour has said it wants to create respectful partnerships with developing countries; but Save the Children UK’s director, Moazzam Malik, told me recently that the cuts would be felt by many countries not as a new-found era of collaborationbut as a withdrawal.As the UK steps back at the same time as Trump is dismantling USAID, the challenges in some of the world’s poorest countries have only intensified.In particular, a blizzard of recent expert reports hascalled for action on the unsustainable debtssqueezing many governments’ budgets.The UN-backed Financing for Development conference in Seville last week ended with promises of reform, including the wider use of “pause clauses” to halt repayments during natural disasters, for example – something the UK has supported.More radical solutions that might have included debt write-offs did not make it through the negotiations, but South Africa hopes to use its chairmanship of the G20 to press for more progress in the coming months.Michael Jacobs, a former Brown adviser, now a visiting professor at the Overseas Development Institute, insists there was a sense of momentum on debt relief in Seville.“It was the single most significant topic of debate. There is rising pressure on the creditor countries – including China – to act. So, as in 2005, the moment for a new international debt relief package may be arriving,” he said.Other campaigners returned from Seville notably downbeat, however, pointing to the difficulties of assembling a global coalition of the willing on development in a time of tight budgets and fraying international bonds.Summoning the spirit of Gleneagles may be too much to hope for, two decades on. But after a string of economic shocks and as the climate emergency accelerates, the moral imperative to act remains – even if this Labour government can’t find it in a focus group or on a spreadsheet.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomics viewpointG8Debt reliefGlobal economyTrump administrationAidcommentShareReuse this content"

As Trump wields the axe, who will fight to save it?Simon TisdallIf the US cuts off the cash it will have world-changing effects, but it’s not the only country falling short in its obligations to the United NationsSun 6 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 13.33 EDTShareThe United Nations and its agencies have long struggled with funding shortfalls. Now an entrenched problem is becoming an acute crisis in the shadow of Donald Trump’s executioner’s axe. The US is the biggest contributor, at 22%, to the UN’s core budget. In February,the White House announceda six-month review of US membership of all international organisations, conventions and treaties, including the UN, with a view to reducing or ending funding – and possible withdrawal. The deadline for decapitation falls next month.Trump’s abolitionof the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and scrapping of most aid programmes, has already badly damaged UN-led and UN-backed humanitarian operations, which rely on discretionary funding. Yet Trump’s axe symbolises a more fundamental threat – to multilateralism and the much-battered international rules-based order. The basic concept of collective responsibility for maintaining global peace and security, and collaboration in tackling shared problems – embodied by the UN sinceits creation 80 years agolast week – is on the chopping block.The stakes are high – and Washington is not the only villain. Like the US, about 40 countries are behind in paying obligatory yearly dues. Discretionary donations are declining. The UN charter, a statement of founding principles, has been critically undermined by failure to halt Russia’s illegal war of aggression in Ukraine (and by last month’s US-Israeli attack on Iran).Chinaand others,including the UK, ignore international law when it suits. The number and longevity of conflictsworldwide is rising; UN envoys are sidelined; UN peacekeeping missions are disparaged. The security council is often paralysed by vetoes; the general assembly is largely powerless. By many measures, the UN isn’t working.A crunch looms. If the UN is allowed to fail or is so diminished that its agencies cannot fully function, there is nothing to take its place. Nothing, that is, except the law of the jungle, as seen in Gaza and other conflict zones whereUN agencies are excluded,aid workers murderedand legal norms flouted. The UN system has many failings, some self-inflicted. But a world without the UN would, for most people in most places, be more dangerous, hungrier, poorer, unhealthier and less sustainable.The US is not expected to withdraw from the UN altogether (although nothing is impossible with this isolationist, ultra-nationalist president). But Trump’s hostile intent is evident.His 2026 budget proposalseeks a 83.7% cut – from $58.7bn to $9.6bn – in all US international spending. That includes an 87% reduction in UN funding, both obligatory and discretionary. “In 2023,totalUS spending on the UN amounted to about $13bn. This is equivalent to only 1.6% of the Pentagon’s budget that year ($816bn) – orabout two-thirdsof what Americans spend on ice-cream annually,” Stewart Patrick of theCarnegie Endowment for International Peace noted. Economic development aid, disaster relief and family planning programmes would be gutted.The impact is potentially world-changing. Key UN agencies in the firing line include thechildren’s fund, Unicef– at a time when the risks facing infants and children are daunting; theWorld Food Programme(WFP), which could lose 30% of its staff; agencies handling refugees and migration, which are also shrinking; theInternational court of justice(the “world court”), which has shone a light on Israel’s illegal actions in Gaza; and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s and others’ nuclear activities.Trump is already boycotting the World Health Organization, the Palestinian relief agency (Unrwa) and the UN Human Rights Council, and hasrescinded $4bnallocated to the UN climate fund, claiming that all act contrary to US interests. If his budget is adopted this autumn, the UN’s 2030sustainable development goalsmay prove unattainable. US financial backing for international peacekeeping and observer missions in trouble spots such as Lebanon, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kosovo, currently 26% of total spending, will plunge to zero.Israel is a rogue nation. It should be removed from the United Nations | Mehdi HasanRead moreThe withdrawal of USAID support is already proving lethal, everywhere from Somalia and Sudan to Bangladesh and Haiti. UN officials describe the situation in post-earthquake, conflict-riven, aid-deprivedMyanamar as a “humanitarian catastrophe”. Research published in the Lancet found that Trump’s cuts could causemore than 14m additional deathsby 2030, a third of them children.The WFP, the world’s largest food aid supplier, says its projected $8.1bn funding deficit this year comes asacute hungeraffects a record 343 million people in 74 countries. And other donor states are failing to fill the gap left by the US. So far in 2025, only 11% of the $46.2bn required for 44 UN-prioritised crises has been raised. The UK recentlyslashed its aid budgetby £6bn, to pay for nuclear bombs.UN chiefs acknowledge that many problems pre-date Trump. António Guterres, the secretary general, has initiatedthousands of job cutsas part of the “UN80” reform plan to consolidate operations and reduce the core budget by up to 20%. But, marking the anniversary, Guterres said the gravest challenge is the destructive attitude of member states that sabotage multilateral cooperation, break the rules, fail to pay their share and forget why the UN was founded in the first place. “The charter of the United Nations is not optional.It is not an à la carte menu. It is the bedrock of international relations,” he said.Guterres says the UN’s greatest achievement since 1945 is preventing a third world war. Yet respected analysts such as Fiona Hill believeit’s already begun. The UK and other democracies face some pressing questions. Will they meekly give in to Trump once again? Or will they fight to stop this renegade president and rogue states such as Russia and Israel dismantling the world’s best defence against global anarchy, forever wars and needless suffering?Will they fight to save the UN?Simon Tisdall is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUnited NationsOpinionTrump administrationUSAIDAidUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

They have lived through a global pandemic. Their social media accounts are frightening them with stories of political upheavals, global warming, indiscriminate violence, riots, chaos and anarchy. Older generations got this kind of news maybe once or twice a day. This generation gets it fed to them every minute. They yearn for security. And one way is to save their money.The question is, are they doing enough? What more could be done? Here are three things we should be considering.Maximizing‘after-tax’optionsThanks to the Secure2022 legislation, employers can now not only offer Roth 401(k) plans for their employees but can also contribute to those plans. We should all have one. That’s because – within income limitations – contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made after taxes have been paid but then grow tax-free and can be withdrawn without any tax liability after the age of 59 1/2. gen Zers – who are likely to be paying less in taxes now due to their relatively lower salaries – can put this money away at lower rates, rather than just defer taxation to a future year when, under regular 401(k) rules, distributions become required. And they can let these sums grow without worrying about paying any more taxes in the future. As an employer, you can provide investment options that can help maximize their returns too.Another great after-tax vehicle is the 529 plan. By offering this plan, an employer can help their employees – both younger and older – put after-tax money away that will grow tax-free and can then be withdrawn if used to pay for higher education, private school or religious school. It’s a great way for gen Zers to save for their future kids’ education instead of paying for it out of funds that would be used for their own retirement years down the line.Offering an HSAHealth Saving Accounts have exploded in popularity over the past decade, and it’s no surprise why. With these accounts – which need to be paired with a high deductible group insurance plan – employees can sock away pre-tax dollars to be used for medical expenses that are not reimbursed by their health plans. Gains and withdrawals are not taxed. The beauty of these plans is you don’t have to use them or lose them – any unused balances just roll over to the next year. Some call it a 401(k) for healthcare, and they’re not wrong. It’s a great way for younger employees to put away money that could help pay for their future healthcare costs without interfering with their retirement savings.Matching student loansAgree or not, the Trump administration has reversed course with its predecessor and is now demanding student loan repayments. The result is that many younger people are going to need to face the reality of making good on their debt. One fallout will surely be less cash available to put away for retirement. But as employers, we can help. The Secure 2022 legislation now makes it legal for us to match their student loan payments with contributions to their 401(k) plans. This way even if they don’t have enough funds to put away for the future, employers can help make up the difference. This is something we should all consider.Providing counselingAs a certified public accountant, I have spent my life dealing with money – both my own and my clients’. And yet every day I learn something new and still have to rely on the internet to clarify and research financial questions that I have. Now, imagine being a 25-year-old trying to figure out all the options. It’s impossible. A good employer should have an outside financial counselor on retainer who can provide one-to-one advice for their employees once or twice a year. My best clients do this. And it’s not just about retirement. It’s buying a house, getting insurance, owning a car … all the financial decisions that in the end affect what’s left over for retirement.According to a recentGoldman Sachs survey60% of gen Z respondents report “having a personalized financial plan, not just for retirement but also for goals like buying a home or a car” and 68% “believe their savings are on-track or ahead of schedule”.Sounds great. But I’m betting that “plan” could be improved. Employers should be providing more help to help save for retirement. And the good news is that they have got a generation eager to take it.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS retirementUS personal financecommentShareReuse this content"

Only eight steps separated me from the walkway that led to the front door as my Uber driver idled behind me. I clasped my camera in my hand, the shutter echoing in the quiet of a snowy February day. I looked more like a too-curious-tourist than a concerned writer researching the literary legacy of a man who had inspired me all my life.The house was ordinary, painted in an aging beige that was deepened with crisp, burgundy accents. At the top in an attic space the burgundy was most prominent. I’d learned before this visit that Hughes had lived and written there. I’d also known going into this trip that the house had at one point been atrisk of being demolished, efforts that were subverted largely in part due to local librarian Christopher Bucka-Peck’s intervention.Located on the east side of Cleveland in an area that has been historically Black for generations, this home, which is crucial to understandingLangston Hughesand his creative origins, remains unmarked and vacant as it was then. The longer I stood, instead of soaking up the moment in awe, unending questions tugged at me. Such as: why was there no marker? Would it be in danger of possibly being demolished again? And if the city of Cleveland didn’t care about his legacy then who would?That trip in 2023, and the crushing disappointment that encircled it, became a silent quest I’ve carried with me. I wanted to see more homes of the Black literary forefathers and foremothers, the ones I draw inspiration from in order to write.The anger and discontent are somethingTara L Conley, an assistant professor at Kent State University’s School of Media and Journalism, felt herself in 2019 when she visited Toni Morrison’s childhood home in Lorain, Ohio, a mere 30 miles from where I landed in Cleveland four years later. Morrison’s powder blue home also has no marker and continues to fall further and further into a dilapidated state.“My initial reaction was, ‘Why isn’t anyone doing anything here?’ Even to this day I wonder why Northeast Ohio feels so stuck. And if you talk to other Black folks who grew up here you might hear the same thing,” Conley said.View image in fullscreenToni Morrison’s childhood home in Lorain, Ohio.Composite: AlamyMorrison’s home, according to Conley during her visit, is privately owned, as demonstrated by Donald Trump signs she saw surrounding the property. As of now, there are no efforts for a historical marker or any other kind of preservation of the home. Hughes’ home in Cleveland has endured many changes throughout the yearsbeyond the planned demolition in 2009– including arenovation before being sold for $85,000to a private owner in 2013. Being privately owned means the hurdles for historical markers or any other designation of its status fall into the owner’s hands, if they choose to pursue it at all. These homes, however, represent a much larger pattern of neglect of integral legacies of Black writers, even after their deaths.The statistics on preservation of African American historical structures reflect this.Only 2% of the 95,000 entrieson the National Register of Historic Places focus on the lives, experience and culture of African Americans.That means there’s larger systemic failings and inequities to be addressed for cases like Hughes’ and Morrison’s homes in Ohio, despite the issue of their current ownership. And the countless other homes of Black literary figures throughout history, those who have held us together and dazzled us in written form on the page. These legacies matter and have personal and collective stakes. What is preserved, after all, molds what we remember and what is known about Black writers of the past. Our Black creative memory, too, is sculpted from these things.Preserving spaces such as historic Black literary homes from an official capacity entails certain complexities–completing extensive paperwork, securing funding, time spent waiting to hear back once nominations have been submitted.The process has prevailed in some cases, such as Richard Wright’s childhood home, Lucille Clifton’s and where Zora Neale Hurston lived in the years prior her death. Some of the homes of Black authors of the past have some sort of historical marker, whether as a result of being designated a national historic landmark, included on the National Register of Historic Places or local recognition whether from the state or town/city municipality of which they are located.National historic landmarks(NHS) and theNational Register of Historic Placesare both guarded by the National Park Service (NPS). Established in 1935 due to the National Historic Sites Act, an NHS designation requires a nomination and evaluation of the property. The NPS advisory board reviews nominations and determines whether to recommend it to the secretary of interior, who has the power to name landmarks.Getting a historic home or other property on the National Register of Historic Places is simpler. The National Register was established in 1966 per the National Historic Preservation Act and also requires prepared nominations that next proceed through the state’s historic preservation office. The state historic preservation officer can then officially nominate a property, kicking it up to the NPS where the keeper of the National Register, who has the authority to list the property.In urgent response to the dire statistic, the National Trust for Preservation launched the Cultural Heritage Action Fund in 2017. Helmed by architect and preservationist Brent Leggs, who acts as executive director, the aim was to intensely focus on gathering these Black touchstones and treating them as precious.“What’s so beautiful about the African-American Cultural Heritage Action Fund–as we’re eight years in as an emerging social movement advocating for an increased recognition and celebration of Black people and Black history–is that we’re creating a big tent of advocates,” he said.View image in fullscreenA placard outside Richard Wright’s childhood home in Natchez, Mississippi, in 2016.Photograph: GlobalNewswire via APLeggs was instrumental in helping to preserve the homes of other Black cultural legends – Nina Simone and Alice and John Coltrane – as both have designation and have been preserved through varied mechanisms.Simone’s childhood homein Tryon, North Carolina is bounded by non-profit Daydream Therapy, a collective of artists Ellen Gallagher, Rashid Johnson, Julie Mehretu and Adam Pendleton who bought the home together for $95,000 to save it.When the fund originally launched in 2017, a five year $25m campaign began an “audacious and bold vision” according to Leggs. The intent, he said, is to intentionally partner in what is longterm work of expanding the African-American story by preserving spaces and homes like those of Black writers of the past–to offer these lived spaces as testimonies of the reality of Black lives lived. As of now, $150m in funding has been secured and the organization has collaborated with 353 preservation organizations across the country to make it happen.Historical markers, whether national or local, are purely an architectural designation – what the owners of the home choose to do with the property is at their discretion. There is no mandate, for instance, that historic homes be opened to the public, though some Black literary homes have taken that pathway in service of writers of new generations. Overall, the paths are varied.The novelistRichard Wright’s childhood homein the historically Black Woodlawn historic district of Natchez, Mississippi, has had ahistorical markersince 1998. This marker is local, however, as the Mississippi department of archives and history erected it. Wright’s home is solely a historic structure as it’s not open to visitors, though visitors can take pictures and peek in from the outside.The historic East Harlem brownstone that Hughes called home during the Harlem Renaissance is another that falls in this category. Now privately owned, it has hada markersince 1981 per the New York Landmarks Preservation Foundation. Hughes’ former Harlem home hasstruggled with directional instability throughout the years, with current managing director Louie P Sosa committed to ushering forth a new era for the home, centered in structured programming and establishing a non-profit organization to guide its future.“The goal of the Langston Hughes Home is to exude Langston’s personality and all its facets,” he said.In Baltimore, Maryland isthe Clifton House, a tribute to the legacy of poet Lucille Clifton who lived there with her husband Fred Clifton and her six children. When foreclosure in 1980 forced them from their home, it was traumatic. But when her daughter Sidney Clifton reached out to former owners on the ninth anniversary of her mother’s death in 2019, she learned the house had been put on the market that very day. She purchased the home, intent on recapturing the communal space she remembered.“What this house always wanted to be was what my parents established there and it’s what it means to be there,” she said. “The house needs to be that place where we are focusing on providing sanctuary for emerging writers, poets, artists, activists and people that walk those intersections. And to be a place of nurture, feeding, spirit, growing and possibility.”As the home is already considered a national historic landmark and appears on the National Register of Historic Places, the most challenging aspect of preserving the legacy, according to Sidney, has been managing the business side. Though the non-profit organization that guides the home–including that of writing workshops and residencies–does make it somewhat less challenging.And down south in Fort Pierce, Florida, the Agape senior recreation center where the novelist, anthropologist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston died from a stroke in 1960 has no designation whatsoever, though a home she rented in the years prior to her death receivednational historic landmark status in 1991.The Zora Neale Hurston Florida education foundationacquired the building where Hurston diedfrom St Lucie county in 2019. They’ve made significant strides in renovating to turn it into a community center and museum–they received a$500,000 African-American cultural and historical grantfrom the Florida department of state to actualize these needed changes.Marina Santos, vice-president of the organization’s board, said hopes are that renovations for the building will be completed no later than this summer. “Currently we’re about 50 percent completed on the renovations on the inside,” she said. “Our vision and mission is not only to preserve and celebrate the life of Zora but to also encourage, inspire and educate the community by ways of helping authors and creating space where authors can come in and work.”Thinking about seeing Hughes’s home in Cleveland years ago and others attached to Black writers, thinkers and culture shifters – spaces and places scattered throughout this country – remains an amalgamation of anguish and hope. Anguish for how displacement, dispossession and rejection of personhood for Black people is commonplace. But hope for how writing down these narratives in this piece itself is a reclamation and can’t be erased even if obscured. Perhaps through communal effort, collaboration, funding and public awareness, preserving these legacies aren’t as fraught as it seems. During my conversation with Leggs, he shared similar sentiments.“Even in moments of fragility […] I believe that we can create a more knowledgeable and empathetic society that will begin to bear witness to Black humanity,” he said. “And if we can use historic preservation to create that–to facilitate learning and reconciliation in a way that strengthens everyone’s individual capacity–that for me is the beauty of the work.”Explore more on these topicsBlack US cultureLangston HughesToni MorrisoncommentShareReuse this content"

An early Februarypollfrom Emerson College showed Andrew Cuomo with a 23-point lead in a hypothetical Democratic primary matchup. None of the four leading progressives even approached double-digit support – including the then unknown assemblymanZohran Mamdani. He polled at 1%.In the days before ranked-choice voting, the Working Families party’s endorsement process might have looked quite different. Like-minded candidates would have drawn sharp distinctions between each other. Party officials might have looked to nudge candidates toward the exits, behind closed doors. Before any votes had been cast in the primary, the party would consolidate behind just one choice. It would have been bloody and left a bitter taste for everyone.Instead, the opposite happened. Working Families, knowing that majorities rule and that no one can spoil a ranked-choice race,endorsedfour candidates. Instead of a single endorsement that served as a kiss of death for other progressives, they backed a slate, allowing voters time to tune in and for candidates to make their pitches.

And while Mamdani ultimately would have won a plurality contest or a ranked-choice one, his super-long-shot candidacy might have been squelched at the very beginning under the old system with its different electoral incentives. His victory shows how much more real power voters have under ranked-choice voting.To be clear: RCV is a party-neutral and candidate-neutral tool. Its job is to produce a majority winner with the widest and deepest support from any field of more than two candidates. It puts an end to spoilers and to the impossible, wish-and-a-prayer calculation that voters otherwise have to make when faced with multiple candidates, some of whom they really like and some of whom they do not. Liberals, conservatives, independents and moderates have run and won under RCV, from coast to coast.But while RCV might be strictly non-partisan, it is decidedly pro-voter – and almost always produces amore positive, issue-focused campaignthat looks to drive up turnout and appeal to as many people as possible. A ranked-choice campaign rewards engagement and encourages coalitions; it’s a race where instead of tearing down opponents, candidates point out areas of agreement and ask to be a voter’s second choice.Voters love RCV and find it easy to use. According to a newSurveyUSA pollof New York voters, 96% said their ballot waseasy to fill out. More than three-quarters of voters want tokeep or expand RCV. And82% saidthey had taken advantage of RCV and ranked at least two candidates. (These numbers aresimilar across RCV elections, and a powerful rejoinder to critics who insist, despite evidence to the contrary, that it’s too confusing.)A remarkable number of New Yorkers saw first-hand how RCV makes our votes more powerful – they had the freedom to express themselves and rank a long-shot first, but still had their vote count for either Mamdani or Cuomo in the ranked choice tally.Perhaps the high marks are of little surprise: voters received a campaign unlike most any other. The tone remained positive and issue-based. Instead of cutting each other down, candidates lifted each other up: Mamdani and Brad Landercross-endorsedeach other, cutting joint ads,riding bicycles togetherto shared events, sharing the couch onStephen Colbert, and even sharing a stage at Mamdani’s victory party. Jessica Ramos and Whitney Tilson endorsed Cuomo and said that they would rank him second. Mamdani helped Adrienne Adams with fundraising.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Trump is not | Samuel MoynRead moreVoters always say that they want more choice at the polls, candidates who engage with them, and a genuine, issue-based campaign. They got exactly that in New York City because of ranked choice. And the historic turnout levels – more than1 million New Yorkerscast ballots, thehighest number since the 1980s– shows that when voters get that kind of elevated, engaging campaign, they show up and get involved.When voters have the opportunity to consider new candidates campaigning in creative new ways, the frontrunner with the early name recognition and largest donors can be eclipsed by a newcomer who started at 1%. And instead of going scorched-earth on each other before the general election, even some of the “losers” seem to have had their status elevated: Lander finished third, and instead of being an asterisk, he has nowexpanded his base and likabilityfor a future campaign.The majority winner in this race was Zohran Mamdani. But it’s also easy to suggest the real winner might be ranked-choice voting. In a moment when so many of our elections are fraught and polarized, all of us looking for a more unified and hopeful path forward – the“politics of the future”, as Mamdani called it when he declared victory – should take a close look at what just happened in New York as proof that stronger elections are truly possible.What’s giving me hope nowOutside of Washington, cities and states are becoming laboratories of democracy once again. New York’s adoption of ranked-choice voting led to just the kind of campaign our politics so desperately needs: a giant field of candidates presenting their vision of the future, building coalitions, without any time squandered on “spoilers” or anyone pushed to drop out and consolidate early. In Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, voters modernized government and moved to proportional representation to elect the city council, broadening representation to groups and neighborhoods that have never before had a seat at the table. When voters make these changes, they like them, defend them, and expand them, as we have seen in New York, Maine and Alaska. And it won’t take long for people to ask why they can’t have ranked choice and proportionality in all their elections.David Daleyis the author of Antidemocratic: Inside the Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections as well as Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t CountExplore more on these topicsUS politicsFighting BackZohran MamdaniNew YorkUS voting rightscommentShareReuse this content"

I remember my own journey down to Exeter in 2022, the first stage in what I hoped would be an experience to set me up for the rest of my life. Little did I know that this was the calm before the storm, before anyone had heard ofChatGPT, or imagined the chaos that generative AI was about to cause for new graduates.Fast forward to 2025, and some of the young people I began this journey with have realised that they’ve spent the last three years training for graduate jobs that don’t exist.Many firms are now slashing their number of new hires. Big accountancy firms havecut back on graduate recruitment; Deloitte reduced its scheme by 18%, while EY has cut the number of graduates it’s recruiting by 11%.According to datacollected by the job search site Adzuna, entry-level job opportunities in financehave dropped by 50.8%, and those for IT services have seen a decrease of 54.8%.The main cause of this is artificial intelligence, which is destroying many of the entry-level jobs open to recent graduates. Companies are now relying on AI to replicate junior-level tasks, removing the need for them to hire humans. It feels like a kick in the teeth to students and recent graduates, who were already entering a challenging labour market. Once, graduates who had toiled through multiple rounds of interviews, battled it out with other applicants at an assessment centre, and made it through to the final round, could hope to get a job in a sector such as consultancy or accountancy. These historically secure, solid and (some would say) boring options guaranteed you gainful and well-paid employment and a clear career path.It’s true that my fellow students are embracing AI – but this is what the critics aren’t seeing | Elsie McDowellRead moreNow, those secure opportunities feel as though they’re evaporating. Since applicants can’t see jobs that no longer exist, their experience of this intense competition for fewer jobs is often limited to a series of disappointments and rejections.Should a student or recent graduate apply for one of these elusive opportunities, their application will frequently be evaluated and often declined by an AI system before a human even reads it. Friends who have recently graduated tell me of the emotional toll of talking to their webcam during an AI-generated interview in the hope that the system judges in their favour, a process that can be repeated again and again.So far, creative fields, and those that involve real-life human contact, seem more impervious to this trend. It will probably be a period of time before doctors or nurses, or professions that rely on genuine creativity such as painters or performing artists, find themselves replaced with an AI model. Even so, if people become increasingly unable to spot AI, and businesses continue to embrace it, the risk is that professions such as art and illustration also get devalued over time, and replaced by a bleak, AI-generated cocktail of eerily familiar “creative” work.Conservative politicians and the rightwing press have often suggested that the most valuable degrees are those that have a clear job at the end of them (and that those in more creative fields, such as the humanities, are by implication less valuable). As one Times columnistwrote recently, students who do “less practical” degrees are more likely to be “living at home, working on their script/novel/music/art portfolio while earning pocket money”, without either a profession or a useful skill.But what use is a degree in accountancy if you can’t then get an accounting job at the end of it? Why is this course more valuable than studying something that teaches you critical thinking and transferrable skills – anthropology, say, or (in my case) Arabic and Islamic studies? Cuts to higher education mean that we’re already seeing the end of some of those degrees often labelled as “useless”, yet the supposedly “useful” subjects start to look less valuable when the jobs associated with them are replaced by AI models that didn’t take three years to learn these skills.The end of university is already a terrifying time. Three or four years of preparing a bulletproof LinkedIn profile and creating a plan for the future suddenly becomes real. The last thing a person needs aged 21 is for an AI model to take the job they were told their degree was essential for. Today the playing field that exists is different to that of a year ago, and it will undoubtedly be different again when I and many other students graduate in a year’s time. The adults who implore us to embrace AI to streamline everyday tasks and improve the efficiency of the working day often alreadyhaveworking days, a promise that feels as though it’s drifting further and further away.Connor Myers is a student at the University of Exeter and an intern on the Guardian’s positive action schemeExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionChatGPTGraduate careersStudentsComputingHigher educationWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

In Britain, it may seem a distant prospect, but if universality can be dropped abroad, how long before it’s tested at home? With the BBC’s charter due for renewal in 2027, thefundingdebate is intensifying. What becomes of thelicence feewill define the broadcaster’s future.There is increased scrutiny of Auntie’s independence and impartiality after political pressure was applied throughcensure,funding freezesand contentious board appointments. What the BBC should look like in a fragmented media landscape is uncertain. A big question iswhetherthe licence fee levied on households should be replaced by subscription, limited advertising or public funding. The last option is surely a non-starter, opening the door to more direct political control. Carryingadvertswould force the BBC to compete with other broadcasters for cash, and destabilise existing providers. A subscription-style BBC, even iftechnicalhurdles were overcome, wouldn’t be anational institution. Those most in need of public-service media – navigating disinformation, political alienation or regional marginalisation – would be left out. Once you charge, the question isn’t how to inform, educate and entertain the public; it’s who can afford to be included. Partial subscription might keep some core services – like news – free, while others are paywalled. This would entrench a two-tier public service.The BBC is a large organisation and not without its faults. Butcriticswith vested interests often exaggerate them. What began as commercial pressure has been inflamed by culture wars. Success – from Peaky Blinders to Blue Planet – has not shielded it from attack. No wonder the director-general, Tim Davie, warned in May of a looming “trust crisis”. It’s now easier to list the political groups at war with BBC News than those who trust it.The row overGlastonbury– and the BBC’s retreat – underscores the pressure on Mr Davie. But the broadcaster’s fight isn’t just with critics. It’s also battling for attention in anecosystemflooded by algorithmic noise. Since the last charter renewal in 2016, streamers, podcasts and AI have disrupted the landscape, collapsing trust in “legacy” media. When outrage spreads faster than facts, and filter bubbles shape belief, the BBC’s global stature as a respected public institution matters more than ever.Every government leans on the BBC – at a price. The BBC pulled adocumentary, Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, citing vague concerns about “partiality”. Channel 4 aired it instead. Meanwhile, Robbie Gibb, a controversial Johnson-era appointee, helps shape BBC editorial priorities as a board member. A former Tory spin doctor, he became the Jewish Chronicle’sowner, appointing an editor who pushed a hardline pro-Israel stance and oversaw multiplescandals. He refused to reveal who was funding the paper. His role inguidinghow the BBC reviews its Middle East coverage raises concerns about impartiality. More than400 media figureslast week called for his removal. His departure is long overdue.In 1977, theAnnancommittee reimagined broadcasting for a changing Britain. Channel 4 was the result. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, who has sensibly called for a modernAnnan‑style review, is chary of backingMr Davie. But broader reform is needed in a time of distrust and disruption. For the BBC, this could offer not just a funding fix but a democratic roadmap. The charter review must rebuild a trusted civic platform – a public good, not a private preserve.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Experts think that the blades may even have been deliberately hidden – but not deep enough to conceal them from a novice metal detectorist,Glenn Manning. Next month, the public will get a chance to see the weapons when they go on display at the Corinium museum in Cirencester, to which they have been given.The items join a growing list of striking finds by hobbyists. These include a gold nugget found in the Shropshire Hills by Richard Brock, who located it with the help of an old machine that was“only half working”. Another newcomerdug up a gold necklacebearing the initials of Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon, which is now in the British Museum.There are an estimated 20,000 metal detectorists in Britain, with at least two factors having contributed to the activity’sincreased popularityover the last decade. One was the pandemic and the nudge it gave to some people to find a new way to spendleisure time. The other was the Bafta-winning BBC television comedyDetectorists, which ran for three series starting in 2014 and returned for a Christmas special in 2022.Written by Mackenzie Crook, this was a story about the hidden depths of male friendship as well as the Essex farmland where they did their detecting. While archaeology had been on TV before, in programmes such asTime Team, metal detecting was an unexpected focus for a popular drama.There was probably also something in the zeitgeist, sincemudlarking on the Thamessaw a boom during the same period – going from the obscure pastime of aficionados to something much more mainstream. Like metal detectorists, whose focus on precious objects sometimes comes intosharp conflictwith the scholarly priorities and painstaking processes of archaeologists,mudlarks(who sometimes use metal detectors along with other techniques) need authorisation to go on their scavenging hunts. From just 200 permits sought in 2018-19 from the Port of London authority, the total rose to 5,000 three years later. One result of this upsurge in interest is a new exhibition of350 mudlarked objects. Secrets of the Thames includes medieval carvings and Victorian forgeries, and opened at the London Museum last week.Not all metal detecting is focused on the distant past. A5,000-strong network of volunteers, the National Ring Recovery Service, helps living people find lost items. While this altruistic project is described by its founder, Morley Howard, as a “fifth emergency service”, the activities and motivations of metal detectorists who hunt for valuable artefacts remain controversial, and some believe that the legal framework is too lax. Archaeological sites have been damaged, and in 2019 two men were jailed for the illegal sale of coins and jewellery known as theLeominster hoard.But deeply regrettable though such losses are, they should not be allowed to overshadow the positive contributions of amateur detectorists, some of whom volunteer on digs led by experts – as Mr Manning did on the day he found the swords. This commitment to scouring the countryside for traces of ancient lives is a testament to an abiding curiosity about the past that is not limited to experts.Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyOpinionHeritageMuseumsHobbiesRoman BritaineditorialsShareReuse this content"

However, his furious McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, who finished second, was convinced he had been unfairly denied by a controversial stewards’ decision.Norris, now in his sixth season in F1, took the victory after Piastri had been given a 10-second penalty while leading but the 25-year-old still produced an assured drive in treacherous wet conditions to become the 12th British driver to win their home race since it was first held in 1950.Lando Norris wins F1 British GP from angry Piastri in rain-soaked Silverstone thrillerRead moreIt is the one grand prix Norris wanted more than any other and he revelled in his success. “This victory is everything I dreamed of,” he said. “Being on top at your home race is very, very special.”He said that as he sealed the final laps he was enjoying taking in his accomplishment and, most important, ensuring he did not let it slip away from him. “Looking up at the fans and seeing them on their feet, your mind just goes pretty blank,” he said. “I was just trying to enjoy the moment.“These are moments that none of you guys get to witness. This is only something that I and very few Brits have achieved. It is a selfish moment, in a way, but so special and incredible because it is such a rare thing to feel and witness.“For me, it is my best win, maybe not the best way to win, but in terms of what it means to me, winning at home, it is very memorable. Apart from winning a championship, this is as good as it gets.”Norris grew up watching Lewis Hamilton win the British GP, with the seven-time champion holding a record nine victories here. With Hamilton finishing fourth for Ferrari it was an emotional moment for Norris to have achieved a feat to match those who had inspired him.“Silverstone is where it all started for me, watching Lewis, Jenson [Button], Fernando [Alonso] and it was thatwet race here in 2008when I began watching Formula One,” he said. “Lewis won and I got that picture of him going round and all the fans are standing up, creating an amazing atmosphere. I dreamed of that for many, many years and today I got to see that through my own eyes and live that moment.”Norris endured one minor hiccup after the race when a photographer fell off a fence in the pit lane on to the celebrating driver. He suffered a small cut to his face but shrugged it off amid the euphoria and has now closed to within eight points of Piastri in the championship battle.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri follows the safety car at Silverstone.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/ShutterstockPiastri was penalised for braking erratically during a safety-car restart and thereby forcing Max Verstappen to take evasive action, but while he declined to speak critically of the stewards he was adamant he thought he had been wronged by the decision.“I felt it was well within the rules, and I did it once already in that race. I don’t really get it,” he said. “I didn’t do anything differently to my first restart. I didn’t go slower. I don’t think Max had to evade me. So I am a bit confused to say the least. I know I deserved a lot more than I did today and when you don’t get the result you deserve, it hurts.”After serving his penalty, Piastri had asked the team if he might swap places with Norris, which they declined. The team principal, Andrea Stella, noted that he wants his drivers to voice their positions and was happy with Piastri doing so.“Lando didn’t do anything wrong so I don’t think it would have been fair to swap, but I thought I should ask,” Piastri said. “It doesn’t change much for the championship. I felt I did a good job and I will use the frustration to make sure I win some more races.”Explore more on these topicsBritish Grand PrixLando NorrisOscar PiastriFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The left-hander had held a match point on his serve at 6-5 in the third set tie-break before Jarry turned the match around with his enormous serve, eventually forcing a five-set shootout.Cameron Norrie sinks Jarry in five-set epic to reach Wimbledon quarter-finalsRead more“It feels a little bit better and more deserved coming back from the injury and kind of coming back and trying to push back into the top of the game,” said Norrie. “So all the hard work, it’s paid off. I’ve been a dedicated professional and have a good team around me. These moments are the icing on the cake.”Having climbed as high as No 8 in the world rankings in 2022, Norrie, 30 next month, suffered a significant biceps injury last year and he has generally struggled with his form. In May he fell to No 91 in the rankings. Against Jarry, a qualifier, he maintained his composure as the Chilean fired down 46 aces. Norrie held each of his 25 service games, saving all eight break points in the match.“I didn’t want to let his game style kind of get me frustrated,” said Norrie. “When he’s serving lots of aces and nothing is happening in the match, and then suddenly he’s playing some really good points. So I wanted to stay fired up and really enjoy all aspects of the match.“If it’s a cheap point, I was enjoying it. If it was a long rally, I was enjoying it. If I had a forehand winner, I was enjoying it. And I wanted to keep that energy high. He served 46 aces in the match, and I didn’t want to let that bother me.”Norrie will next face Alcaraz after the Spaniard defeated the 14th seed Andrey Rublev 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. “Now it only gets tougher,” said Norrie.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Those fans headed home knowing that a quarter-final place beckons for Sundhage’s Switzerland.Providing her players do not stumble against Finland in Geneva on Thursday they should be on course to finish behind Norway in Group A and reach the knockout phase of a European ­Championship for the first time.No matter that they may well end up facing Spain in the last eight, all the indications are that this young team have started to lose their initial inhibitions and really enjoy themselves.“I’m so happy,” said the Swiss captain, Arsenal’s Lia Wälti. “We got carried, step by step, by our fans. It was an incredible atmosphere.”Initially though Iceland proved rather awkward guests, almost scoring inside the first minute when Ingibjörg Sigurdardóttir’s half-volley struck the crossbar following her connection with a long throw.After more than a week of glorious Swiss summer sun heavy rain lashed down on Berne, leaving players from both sides slipping and sliding on the pitch, and forcing the Iceland manager, Thorsteinn Halldórsson, to keep wiping raindrops from his glasses.Sundhage, sheltering deep in the dugout, watched her team whip in a corner and Svenja Fölmi head goalwards.View image in fullscreenAlayah Pilgrim celebrates after doubling Switzerland’s lead in the final minute.Photograph: Til Buergy/EPAWhen the ball hit Glódis Viggósdóttir it flew into the back of the net and, almost everyone bar the 2,000 Iceland fans present went wild. Or at least they did until VAR intervened to correctly disallow that effort for a foul in the preamble, namely Fölmi’s overly aggressive block on Viggosdóttir.For a while things turned ­thoroughly niggly and scrappy. There were far too many cheap concessions of possessions, snide fouls, substandard set pieces and disappointing final balls.Barcelona’s Sydney Schertenleib had the crowd on the edge of their seats whenever she ran at Iceland’s back line but sometimes wayward final decision making betrayed the exciting 18-year-old’s very real talent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When ­Schertenleib swivelled seamlessly and cued up a perfectly poised Reuteler to unleash a beautifully weighted low shot, ­Iceland looked condemned to an earlier than hoped flight back to Reykjavík.Indeed with Reuteler increasingly influential in midfield, a ­swashbuckling Swiss finale was crowned by Pilgrim’s fabulous, if deflected, 90th-minute finish from the edge of the penalty area.“We have a really young team,” said Wälti. “In some actions we can be a little but rushed and we wasted a lot of chances before, in the end, we took them.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballSwitzerland women's football teamIceland women's football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As Edna once waspishly told a fellow grand dame: “I’m trying to find a word to describe your outfit … affordable.” It was not dissimilar to the lacklustre Lions in Sydney: all dressed up and nowhere to hide.It has been an awkward few days all round, with increasing amounts of potential comedic ammunition available to Aussie hecklers. “Mr Farrell, welcome to our hotel, we’ve held the family suite for you.” “Mate, was the pitch really damp on Saturday or were you blokes just wallowing in your own mediocrity?” It is reaching the point where the Lions need to start delivering a few short sharp punchlines of their own.Wallabies maintain ‘quiet resolve’ for Lions series despite injuries, errors and uncertaintiesRead more“Maybe we should play Fiji instead?” was briefly a possibility as the Wallabies hovered on thebrink of losing their warm-up Testin Newcastle. But it is a dangerous game to play when, self-evidently, there continues to be a risk of the Lions rocking up underdone to Brisbane for the first Test on Saturday week. Australia may not be the best team in the world – they went into the weekend ranked eighth – but where does that leave the Lions if the series heads south?Among other things, it makes the first Test absolutely pivotal. This is not a hard and fast law – as recently as their last tour in 2021 the Lions won the opening Test in South Africa only to go on and lose the series – but we should expect Joe Schmidt’s Australia to grow stronger over the course of the three Tests.Hence the importance of picking the smartest-possible starting XV – and a complementary bench – for that challenge. In some ways Saturday’s scratchy21-10 win over the Waratahshas simplified the equation. Let’s just say it was not the worst game to miss. There are occasions when players’ reputations are enhanced simply by sitting in the stands and the Waratahs game was one of them.View image in fullscreenThe Waratahs celebrates Ethan Dobbins’ try.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPSo the moment has come for Andy Farrell to cease his ruminative beard-stroking, replace the light pencil with proper ink and get down to it, dah-ling. There is still the Brumbies game this Wednesday to assist deliberations further but the time for experimentation has all but expired.The front row, in theory, should be straightforward. The Lions may have waxed and waned to date but their scrums have gone pretty well. Dan Sheehan is first among equals at hooker and Ellis Genge and Andrew Porter, probably in that order, are both tough hombres at loosehead. But the picture at tighthead is murkier: do the Lions go with the proven farmer strength of Tadhg Furlong, the maturing Will Stuart or the previously little considered Finlay Bealham?If Furlong is back anywhere close to his best, Farrell will be tempted. But at this point a wider Irish question presents itself. The Lions could possibly select as many as 10 or even 11 players from the Ireland side who finished the Six Nations with a laboured 22-17 win over Italy. No disrespect to theAzzurribut there is rather less snap and crackle about some of Ireland’s leading lights than a year ago.That could mean the usual assumptions about the benefits of cohesion do not hold as much water. And if Maro Itoje and Joe McCarthy are bolted on to start in the second row it also raises other related back-row questions. On tour form alone Ollie Chessum might just be edging in front of Tadhg Beirne, and Jac Morgan a gnat’s nostril ahead of Josh van der Flier.Of course it matters not, in theory, where a qualified Lion hails from. But assuming Jack Conan starts at No 8, is there realistically enough time left to develop the kind of ingrained understanding the all-Irish trio possess? Possibly not, a scenario that will be niggling away in the back of Farrell’s mind.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which leaves the midfield and the bench. Do the Lions go for a they‑shall-not‑pass central defensive brick wall of Bundee Aki and Gary Ringrose or reunite Russell with Sione Tuipulotu and Huw Jones?View image in fullscreenCaptain Maro Itoje pledged ‘passion and energy and the zeal you would expect of a Lions squad’ back in May.Photograph: Billy Stickland/Inpho/ShutterstockIt would seem even Farrell remains undecided. At the weekend he acknowledged that Test matches tend to be tighter tactical affairs than the lead-up games. “We are good when we are direct,” he murmured. But the Lions could do with some extra pace – hence the likelihood of Henry Pollock being among the replacements – and Jones offers that. Farrell will further have noted the way in which Fiji ran at the Wallabies and kept their potentially influential centres quiet as a result.The Lions should also keep in mind their captain’s pledge at the squad announcement back in May. “I want us to play with passion and energy and the zeal you would expect of a Lions squad,” said Itoje back then. The cameras in the visiting dressing room at the weekend did not catch a tremendous amount of that and one or two individuals look to have plenty on their youthful minds.So stick or twist? Strip back the gameplan or keep the faith? Put Farrell Jr on the Test bench ahead of Fin Smith for pure psychological effect? It says everything about the concertina-ed nature of this Lions trip that such debates remain live at this late stage. But ultimately the answer is simple: go all out or go home.

A weight of great black clouds broke over the city while it was feeling its way into the day. On the streets people pressed themselves together under the cover of bus stops and awnings: revellers off to the Queens Heath pride festival, heavy metal lovers making their way home after Black Sabbath’s farewell gig at Villa Park the previous evening, and cricket supporters bound for the ground, most of them with last-minute tickets, split between anxious Indian and wry English fans, the only people in the city who were happy enough to be getting wet.The bad weather was about the only way England were going to get out of this match with a draw. A team who have spent three years learning how to do the improbable were in no position at all to attempt the unremarkable and bat out the match, even after the rain had washed out the first hour and a half of the day.Their attempt to play out the remaining 80 overs of the game was as good as up by the lunch break, broken by asuperb spell of fast bowlingby Akash Deep, who had played only seven Tests before this, but is 28 and has spent years in Indian first-class cricket learning how to get every last bit out of unhelpful pitches such as this one.Akash Deep wickets roll England as India level Test series with crushing winRead moreDeep took as many wickets in this match as England’s four quicks managed between them and gave them one long lesson in how to bowl in their own conditions. He produced more good balls in his first spell on Sunday than they had between them in the match. One of them got Ollie Pope, dismissed playing the sort of janky defensive shot that makes people question his spot in the order all over again, and another did for Harry Brook, who was beaten by a jaffa that nipped back off a crack and smacked into his thigh bone.So in cameBen Stokes, England’s last hope now the clouds had blown over. Strange to say about a man who’s performed so many wonders, but it felt like no hope at all. Stokes is just the sort of man you might hire to slay the Nemean lion, but it’s less obvious that he’s the one you would send in with a shovel to muck out the Augean stables.Time was when he could do it for you. It’s easy to forget, among everything else he’s done for England, that he’s played a series of rearguard innings over the years for captains before him, 66 off 188 balls against New Zealand in 2018, 62 off 187 against India at Trent Bridge later that same year.But anyone who’s watching knows those days are a way behind him. On Sunday, Stokes managed just over 90 minutes of batting. There was one of those familiar pull shots against Prasidh Krishna, like a lumberjack making the last cut on a California redwood, and a couple of crisp glances to fine leg, but that was about the best of it.He was, he always is, bamboozled by Ravindra Jadeja’s way of bowling into the rough outside off stump. It’s like watching a grizzly bear try to solve a Rubik’s Cube. He was eventually done, in the last over before lunch, by one of Washington Sundar’s innocuous off-breaks.View image in fullscreenAkash Deep (centre) produced a superb spell of fast bowling to lead India to victory.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesStokes has such a big influence as captain that it goes almost unnoticed that he has so little influence as a batsman. He has made one century in the past three years, and that was a bar-room brawl in alosing cause against Australiaat Lord’s, when he was furious that Alex Carey had run out Jonny Bairstow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His batting average was 39 in the first year of his captaincy, but was 28 last year and is just 19 in this one.Among all the other records Shubman Gill set this week, he outscored Stokes by 397 runs in the match, which is the largest gap between two captains in the history of Test cricket. Gill, of course, doesn’t have to do any of his team’s bowling. Stokes was superb with the ball at Headingley just last week.For all the hard work he’s put into that over the past 12 months, you wonder how he would be batting now if he had been willing, or able, to put the same sort of time into the other side of his all-round game. He didn’t play at all for Durham this year and, aside from his England commitments, he’s had exactly one red ball innings in the past year.It’s asking a hell of a lot of him to bat as well as he bowls, and bowl as well as he leads, but that’s what England need.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Ben StokesEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Caroline Graham Hansen’s late winner in Sion broke Helmarit hearts after Oona Sevenius had cancelled out Eva Nyström’s unfortunate early own goal. Switzerland’s 2-0 win over Iceland in the late game sealed their passage into the quarter-finals.It was Norway’s experience that eventually told when their decorated vice-captain struck in the 84th minute against the run of play.“Every player in this team is important,” their head coach, Gemma Grainger, said. “Caro today with the individual brains to get the goal and then [the rest of the team] for the work they put in. We’re a very together team. We understand where our strengths are.”“The most important thing is that you get the three points. At this level, at this tournament, the games are so competitive. You’re not going to have every moment of every game … we found a way to win and I am very happy to be sat here with the three points.”It had been a turbulent evening for Norway, who continue to frustrate. It proved a far from convincing outing once again as they struggled against hard-working opposition who dominated much of the encounter.Norway 2-1 Finland: Women’s Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreFinland have been one of the surprises of so far. The lowest-ranked team in Group A have looked good with their midfield press and their ability to break at pace, backed up by their energetic wingbacks, Katariina Kosola and Emma Koivisto.Marko Saloranta made one change. Sevenius is among several promising young players and the Rosengard forward came in for Sanni Franssi. Grainger also retained 10 players from Norway’s unconvincing win over Switzerland, with Mathilde Harviken replacing Maren Mjelde in central defence.Norway started brightly enough and found early joy. With the first attack of the game, the ever-dangerous Graham Hansen ghosted past Joanna Tynnilä before sending a low ball in to the danger area. Aware that Frida Maanum was lurking behind her, Nyström stuck out a leg to send it unwittingly into her own net.Saloranta’s side, however, were determined not to let that moment dictate the rest of the match. Their packed midfield, anchored by Eveliina Summanen and inspired by tireless Oona Siren, gave Norway little joy. They controlled 67% of possession in the first 25 minutes, an indication of their growing confidence. Cecilie Fiskerstrand was the first of the two goalkeepers to be truly tested, producing a fingertip stop to deny an instinctive half-volley from Linda Sällström.Norway had chances of their own. Ingrid Engen crashed a header off the bar before Anna Koivunen tipped a Vilde Bøe Risa corner on to a post. The Finland keeper then made a superb save from Ada Hegerberg.Finland were worthy of their equaliser when it did eventually come. Splitting open the Norway defence, Siren fed Sevenius, who sent her shot flying into the net. The celebrations from players and coach alike said it all as Saloranta danced down the touchline in delight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When they reflect on this one, they will surely rue their missed opportunities.With Finland’s energy levels dipping, Norway saw the opportunity to go for the jugular. The warning signs were there when Graham Hansen inexplicably skied a shot from inside the box. She was not going to make the same mistake twice and when she was afforded space with just six minutes remaining, she floated in what looked like a cross that clipped the far post and went in.View image in fullscreenThe Haut de Cry mountain and the Basilique de Valere loom over the game in Sion.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Norway women's football teamFinland women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If the band’s name is fitting, for a few more days at least, for England’s status as defending champions, by full time at the Stadion Letzigrund against France the artist’s name was more in keeping with the mood among supporters, because Sarina Wiegman’s side are in genuine danger of being chucked out of Euro 2025.England will point to Alessia Russo’s goal at 0-0 being ruled out for an offside that did not seem conclusive even from zoomed-in video assistant referee images, yet the simple truth is this: if England do not improve markedly when they face the Netherlands on Wednesday, they will probably be out before they face Wales in their final group match. Defeat would spell the end unless France lose to Wales later in the day.Ruthless France take advantage of Wiegman’s gamble on Lauren James | Nick AmesRead moreLosing 2-1 to Franceis, in isolation, no cause for panic. It is not as if England were beaten by minnows; France were semi‑finalists three years ago, are one of the world’s in-form sides in 2025 and their skilful, athletic team are contenders to win this trophy. It was the manner of England’s performance that signalled alarm bells. The Lionesses had two shots on target, lost too many duels – France winning 52 to 37 – and looked vulnerable to pace when possession was turned over. There were too many sloppy errors, too many players not on the top of their game.At half-time, the English pundits on ITV were expressing huge concern, Emma Hayes saying: “England have been bullied all over the pitch,” and Karen Carney stating: “We looked like we’ve never played together. That wasn’t good enough.”After the game, the England left-back Jess Carter admitted: “I think we played like we were a little bit scared today. Maybe we weren’t aggressive enough. We maybe were worrying about their threats in behind and what they can do rather than doing what we can do.“We didn’t do as well on the ball, or off the ball. The only positive to take is that last 10 minutes. For me watching it from the side I really believed we would get a goal, I really felt like we could get a second goal. We have to focus on that 10 minutes that we did have at the end and take that over to the next game. The energy the subs brought on was incredible, really pressing and being aggressive.”There were positives for the Lionesses, not least the late cameos by the promising young striker Michelle Agyemang and the midfielder Grace Clinton, who provided energy, and the fact that England were much the stronger team for the opening 15 minutes. It was those middle 70 minutes – gulp – that were the problem.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang provided a positive impact from the bench for England.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/EPAAs holders, England are there to be targeted. After five consecutive Women’s Euros between 1997 and 2013 where Germany successfully defended their title, the defending champions have gone out in the quarter-finals in the two tournaments since, the more recent fallen winners being the Netherlands. As it stands, England would be relieved to get that far.What will encourage England supporters – who sang their new song loyally in support of the head coach even at 2-0 down – is that under Wiegman the team have scarcely played two poor games in a row, tending to respond to disappointing results with some of their best football. Last summer in qualifying games, for example, they regrouped rapidly afterlosing to France at St James’ Parkandbeat the same opponentsin Saint-Étienne four days later with arguably their best performance since the World Cup. Asloppy loss to Belgiumin October 2023 was followed by animpressive home win over the Netherlands, and after this year’sdefeat in Belgiumcame a resounding6-0 victory over Portugalat Wembley in May.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There have almost been two England teams: the wasteful version who got anoff-colour draw in Portugalin February and the impressive England whobeat the world champions, Spain, at Wembley five days later; the England who have looked vulnerable to pace on the counterattack against technically inferior opposition – twice conceding three goals against Belgium – and the one resolute and organised enough to secure clean sheetsagainst the United States,Swedenand Spain.Grace ClintonWhich of those Englands will turn up against the 2017 European champions on Wednesday?

England will be out if they lose against the Netherlands and France get a point or more against Wales in the later kick-off.Lionesses will be going home if they do not shape up but history offers hope | Tom GarryRead more“A lot of the time, we thrive under pressure,” Hemp said. “Every game we go into we want to win. Based on how we acted in the last 10 minutes of the game, you can see we know what’s at stake. We obviously want to get as far as we can. We are reigning champions and that is important to remember and gain confidence from.“I love playing in football matches where we need to win – they’re the games you want to be involved in – so it’s important we take confidence from parts of yesterday.”England were unlucky that an almost invisible offside denied them the opening goal before France struck twice at the Stadion Letzigrund. Then a late rally was held off by a France defence without the dropped Wendie Renard and injured Griedge Mbock.“Obviously, we’re really disappointed with the result,” said Hemp. “It was back out on the grass for a lot of the girls today and I think you can see a lot of confidence too.”Hemp was talking pitchside after a community open training session at England’s base, at the home of Glattbrugg, who invited their women’s and girls’ teams to watch alongside other local clubs and schools and the local mayor. The forward said what had been missing against France was “quality in possession”.“We pride ourselves on that as a team,” she said. “Unfortunately, sometimes in games you fail to have that and make mistake after mistake, but it’s important that we reflect on that. We know that we can be better, but something that we can take from the game is the fight that we showed. Even when things aren’t going our way, we can still try to turn it around and we came close.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After it, off it, you’ve got to come together rather than push each other further apart. That’s what this team’s good at: getting around each other and supporting each other, because we’re going to need everyone back up to their best on Wednesday.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Negotiations are continuing over a fee for the 27-year-old, with Arsenal hoping to strike a deal for less than the£68m asking price.Gyökeres has made no secret of his desire for a new challenge, having scored 54 goals for Sporting last season, and is understood to have made clear hewants to join Arsenaldespite interest from elsewhere in the Premier League, including Manchester United.Transfer news has lost its sense of wonder and surprise in era of ‘my sources tell me …’ | Max RushdenRead moreArsenal had identified Gyökeres as one of their two main targets to add firepower, with strong interest also in RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. With Mikel Arteta keen to bring in reinforcements as soon as possible, Arsenal’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, is understood to have stepped up efforts to sign Gyökeres after the arrival of the midfielder Martín Zubimendi was confirmed on Sunday.Gyökeres, who joinedSportingfrom Coventry in 2023, is believed to have agreed a five-year deal at the Emirates. It is understood that his former club Brighton would be due money under a sell-on clause.Zubimendi, whoturned down Liverpoollast summer, has joined on a five-year deal. The Spain international was heavily linked with Real Madrid in recent weeks despite being understood in March to have a pre-agreement to join Arsenal.Arteta made the 26-year-old his primary midfield target as Arsenal attempt to bridge the gap after three successive runners-up finishes in the Premier League, and Zubimendi’s signing represents a major boost after the departures of Jorginho and Thomas Partey at the end of their contacts last week.Partey was chargedwith five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault – allegations he denies – three days after leaving.View image in fullscreenMartín Zubimendi, who has 18 Spain caps, says Arsenal’s ‘style of play is a good fit for me’.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArsenal are believed to have been searching for midfield replacements since last summer, with Zubimendi emerging as their preferred option thanks to his impressive displays for Real Sociedad and Spain. Their attempts to sign him last summeralongside Mikel Merino– who left Real Sociedad for about £32m – are understood to have been rejected because the Spanish side did not want to lose both players in the same transfer window.Arsenal were able to secure a pre-agreement in March after continuing talks. The fee is believed to be slightly more than his release clause of £51m after they fought off late interest from Madrid, whose new manager, Xabi Alonso, coached Zubimendi for Real Sociedad’s B side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Brighton native calmly went about her business in the first week, defeating the world No 21, Jelena Ostapenko, in the first round before dominant straight-set wins against Viktoriya Tomova and Diane Parry to reach the fourth round at a grand slam for the first time.But the fairytale run came to a halt as the unseeded Anastasia ­Pavlyuchenkova’s greater experience told, the 34-year-old winning 7-6 (3), 6-4 to return to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after nine years.“Obviously I’m finished here,” said Kartal. “For the rest of the day I’ll be a bit sad. But tomorrow I’ll wake up, and look back on this week and be super proud. I can step back and think: ‘Fourth round of a slam.’View image in fullscreenAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova reaches for a return against Sonay Kartal.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty Images“Hopefully I have inspired some people. It’s not easy coming out on Centre Court as a Brit.”It was a match not without its controversies, with the artificial intelligence-enhanced line-calling system failing at a crucial point for the Russian in the first set, an embarrassing moment for Wimbledon, which has received pushback for getting rid of line judges.Pavlyuchenkova made it to the last eight here in 2016, losing to the eventual winner, Serena Williams. “I always thought grass was very tricky for me,” said the Russian. “I’ve played a really good match today, considering this was Centre Court – my first time in many years – and facing such a tough opponent. She didn’t give me any free points.”Wimbledon 2025: Kartal bows out, Norrie in action, Sabalenka and Alcaraz to come – liveRead moreHer compact swings helped her hold to love in the opening service game and she followed it up with a break, forcing Kartal on the run for a second break point. ­Pavlyuchenkova responded to a lob with some great skill, stretching out and flicking her high backhand on the baseline.Three unforced errors by ­Pavlyuchenkova made it 0-40 on her serve and led to Kartal breaking back after the Russian mistimed a drop shot. Another hold and a break put her ahead.The frustration began to build for the Russian as her unforced errors racked up to 12 but she managed a forehand down the line to take it to deuce. She then earned the break by forcing Kartal to scurry across the baseline before finishing the point with a drop-shot winner, leaving the Briton staring in disbelief.The pair then each survived a nervy service game to make it 4-4 before a loud “stop, stop” halted play. The chair umpire, Nico Helwerth, ­confirmed the AI line-calling system did not call a shot from Kartal that was clearly long, when Pavlyuchenkova had game point.After a call from the line-system team, Helwerth said the system was “unable to track the last point so we will replay the point”, a disappointing decision given the Russian had technically won the game. It was particularly stinging after Pavlyuchenkova’s forehand volley into the net gave Kartal a 5-4 lead on the replay. At the change of ends she told Helwerth he “stole the game from her”.View image in fullscreenNico Helwerth, the umpire, on a call to the line-system team after it broke down.Photograph: BBC“I just thought the chair umpire could take initiative,” said ­Pavlyuchenkova. “That’s why he’s sitting on the chair. He saw it go out; he told me after the match … I don’t know if it’s because she’s local.“[Wimbledon] did explain it to me [afterwards]. They said the ­system was down. I understand, but it’s a big match. We should probably look into something else to have ­better decisions.”The Russian, feeling hard done by, put her emotions to one side, breaking Kartal with a firm forehand into the corner after the Briton squandered set point. ­Pavlyuchenkova then held to 15 before Kartal took it to a tie-break with a swift ace. A blasting forehand and an overhead smash later and the set was Pavlyuchenkova’s.Kartal lost serve in the opening game of the second set after Pavlyuchenkova dragged the Briton to the net with a drop shot before finishing with a lob. Kartal broke back and, much to the delight of the Centre Court crowd, the Briton needed only 60 ­seconds in a perfect service game to hold to love.Ben Shelton overpowers Fucsovics to equal best Wimbledon runRead morePavlyuchenkova roared in celebration after her own hold with her hard hitting. The Russian then sealed another break, the ninth of the match, after the 23-year-old dragged the break point long. Her good passage of play continued with two strong forehands to go 40-0 on her serve as Kartal tried – unsuccessfully – to out-hit her. Kartal did not allow herself to fall away in a must-win game though, with some strong first serves.With seven return winners to Kartal’s none, Pavlyuchenkova continued to hit looping forehands and clinched victory with a strong first serve and a winner down the line.Despite the end of her Wimbledon run, Kartal said she would be ready “for the American swing” after a couple weeks off. “I think this week I’ve proved to myself I can go deep into slams. I can beat some of the best players on tour. I’m going to go away with a lot of motivation.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s four years sinceI won my first stageon the Tour, so it was about time I won a second one.”Philipsen, who had started the stage in the yellow jersey afterwinning stage oneto Lille on Saturday, was distanced in the closing kilometres and Van der Poel took the race lead from the Belgian sprinter.“People said I was a favourite, but if you see which riders were in front, on the climbs, I did a really good job today to be there,” said Van der Poel, winner of the2023 World Road Race Championships in Glasgow. “The climbs were harder than I expected and [ridden at] a hard pace. It was a nervous day again.”Pogacar’s main rival, Jonas ­Vingegaard of Visma-Lease a Bike, followed the Slovenian across the finish line, with the Olympic champion, Remco Evenepoel, distanced on Saturday’s stage, showing greater vigilance to also finish in the front group.Away from the Tour, Vingegaard’s wife, Trine Vingegaard Hansen, told the Danish newspaper Politiken that the Visma-Lease a Bike team is pushing her husband “too far”. “I’m afraid he’s burning the candle at both ends,” she said of the double Tour winner. “I think people sometimes forget the human being behind the athlete. It could all backfire.”Primoz Roglic, only a year ago characterised as one of the Tour’s “big four”, finished in the lead group after ceding ground in Lille, but has done little so far to dispel the impression that he has relinquished any ­lingering hopes of contending for the overall title.View image in fullscreenA wet Tour de France peloton during stage two.Photograph: Martin Divíšek/EPAThe Slovenian is the winner of the Vuelta a España four times and also the Giro d’Italia in 2023, but told the media as the race began that he “didn’t really care” and just wanted to “make it to Paris for a glass of champagne”. He has been anonymous so far.The 35-year-old was, with his Bora Hansghrohe teammate Florian Lipowitz, among those who missed Saturday’s ­decisive split in the front group on the fast approach to Lille. “The guys were asleep,” Roglic’s sports director, Enrico ­Gasparotto, said of their costly error on the opening stage. “We talked about that stretch, the wind and the related dangers, but they were surprised. We are all aware of the opportunity we wasted: Roglic and Lipowitz lost the chance to gain time on Remco. We learned an important lesson.”Worse befell the hapless French rider Benjamin Thomas, who crashed on Saturday’s stage while fighting his compatriot Mattéo Vercher for a single point in the mountains ­classification on Mont Cassel. He woke on Sunday morning to the news that his bike, along with 10 others from the Cofidis team, worth about €140,000 (£120,000), had been stolen from their vehicles overnight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as the Leeds players punched the air in ­jubilation at full-time here, you could not escape the fact that this was a statement result on a significant weekend for the whole competition.With 10 rounds to go, Super League had threatened to become a tad dull at the top.Hull KRand Wigan, ­considered the best two teams by a distance, were streaking away towards the playoffs with few giving anyone else a chance of beating either in a semi-final to make Old Trafford.But the events of the last 48 hours have changed things in that regard. On Friday, fourth-placed Leigh defeated the champions to bring the race for the top two to life once again – and here, against the odds, Leeds underlined how this year’s title picture consists of at least four teams.The development the Rhinos have made under Brad Arthur in just 12 months has been remarkable. They have ­finished eighth in each of the last two years but he has dragged this Leeds side back into the competition’s upper echelons.There was one nagging doubt left: could they do it in games where the margins are razor thin? Here, at the home of the runaway league leaders, they silenced that doubt once and for all.View image in fullscreenHull KR’s Rhyse Martin goes over to score the opening try at Craven Park.Photograph: Nigel French/PAMake no mistake about it, Leeds are bona fide title contenders in 2025, and the try which settled a contest that would befit any Grand Final was of the highest quality. The Rhinos trailed 8-0 at half-time; it could and perhaps should have been more, but for an unusual lack of precision in attack from Rovers. But the withdrawal of the reigning Man of Steel, Mikey Lewis, with ­concussion on the half-hour mark was decisive. Without him Rovers did not score another point without him and, in truth, they didn’t even come close. “You expect it to look different but not totally different,” Hull KR’s coach, Willie Peters, said of Lewis’s absence.With the door left ajar for Leeds to respond, a wonderful solo finish from Sam Lisone coupled with two goals from Jake Connor, whose absence from the latest England squad this week is perplexing to say the least, made it 8-8 in the blink of an eye. But this Rovers defence, the meanest in Super League, would need unlocking again, and you always felt it would take something special to do so. Then, with 10 minutes to go, Lachie Miller fielded a ball from deep and Leeds chanced their arm, going wide on the very first play. The ball passed through six sets of hands, including Connor’s, with the decisive offload coming from the half-back to Miller, who scored under the posts for what could be the try of the season.Without Lewis there never felt much chance of a Rovers comeback. Suddenly the landscape at the top feels different.Finishing in the top two comes with huge advantages come the playoffs; the opening weekend off, plus a home semi-final to boot. Hull KR will still likely finish top but beneath them, there is some battle developing for second spot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Had the two big games of the weekend gone the other way, we could have been limping towards an uninspiring final 10 rounds. Now, the season feels very much alive.And so too do Leeds’ hopes of keeping Arthur beyond this year. He has repeatedly insisted he is torn between returning to his family in Australia and sticking with Leeds in 2026. A decision is looming on that front. “I absolutely love the place,” Arthur said. “That win helps [potentially committing in 2026].”But whether he stays or goes next year, it feels increasingly likely that Leeds will once again be in the conversation for the title under him this year.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRLeeds RhinosRugby leaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He then went on to claim that Musk was motivated by discontent over his plan to end subsidies to promote the purchase of electric vehicles.Trump also accused Musk of seeking improper influence by asking the president to nominate his friend, Jared Isaacman, to be Nasa administrator. After Musk left his role as a special government employee in theTrump administration, Isaacman’s nomination was withdrawn. “I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life,” Trump wrote.Elon Musk’s ‘America’ party could focus on a few pivotal congressional seatsRead moreEarlier on Sunday, Trump’s treasury secretary saidMuskshould focus on running his companies and keep himself out of politics, a day after the world’s richest person – and a former White House adviser – announced theformation of a new political party.“The principles of Doge were very popular – I think if you looked at the polling Elon was not,” Scott Bessent said on CNN’s State of the Union, referring to the so-called “department of government efficiency” that Musktemporarily headedafter Trump’s second presidency began in January.Opinion polls found Doge and Musk’s work implementing brutal spending and job cuts within the federal government to bedeeply unpopular. And Bessent alluded to how investors in Musk’s companies – including the electrical vehicle maker Tesla, whosesaleshave sufferedduring Doge’s existence – publicly pleaded for his time with the Trump administration to be short-lived.“So I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies,” Bessent remarked. “I imagine that those boards of directors did not like this announcement yesterday, and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.”Bessent’s reaction came after Musk delivered on his promise to form a new party, and accused his one-time ally Trump of “bankrupting” the country by signing his massive tax and spending bill into law.The tech billionaireannouncedthe creation of the America party in a series of posts late on Saturday and early Sunday to X, the social media platform he owns.“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,”he wrote.“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”Musk, who was appointed to slash federal spending through the unofficial Doge from January through May, has been avocalcriticof Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said wouldincrease the national deficitby $3.3tn (£2.85tn) through 2034.It provides substantial tax cuts for the super wealthy whileslashing federal safety net welfareprograms, with up to 10.6 million people losing healthcare insurance.The pair have feuded over its cost and impacts since Muskleft the governmentin May, and on Friday, when Trumpsignedthe bill into law in a Fourth of July picnic at the White House, the Tesla and SpaceX chief opened apoll on X: “the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system”.Respondents voted two to one in the affirmative, Musk announced late on Saturday. He gave few details about the structure of his new venture or a timeline for its creation. But his earlier posts suggested it would focus on two or three Senate seats, and eight to 10 House districts.Both chambers of Congress are narrowly controlled by Republicans.“Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” Musksaid.Bessent was one Trump ally to quickly take a swipe at Musk’s move.Musk’s series of posts to X, which continued into the early hours of Sunday, also appeared to indicate that his on-again, off-again relationship with Trump was firmly back in negative territory.When the pair fell out earlier in the summer, Musk lashed out during anastonishing social media duelin which he stated Trump’s name was in the files relating to associates of the late pedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Musk later deleted the post andapologized to the presidentas they embarked on an uneasy truce. On Sunday, however, Musk returned to the subject, reposting a photo of the jailed Epstein facilitator Ghislaine Maxwell that questioned why she was the only person in prison while men who engaged in sex with underage girls – a crime colloquially known in the US as statutory rape – were not.In other posts he said it would be “not hard” to break the two-party stranglehold inUS politicsenjoyed by Democrats and Republicans. And he questioned “when & where should we hold the inaugural American Party congress? This will be super fun!”If the US president threatens to take away freedoms, are we no longer free?Read moreTrump has made clear his feelings about his former friend in recent days after criticism of the bill.In response to Musk’s posts calling the bill “insane”, Trump said he might“look into” deportingthe South African-born, naturalized US citizen billionaire. The president also mused about slashing subsidies to his companies, especially SpaceX, which holds billions of dollars ingovernment contracts.“Doge is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be terrible?” Trump asked reporters on Tuesday.There is no requirement for new political parties in the US to register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) initially, butreporting regulations kick inonce spending surpasses what the FEC calls “certain thresholds”.Musk is estimated to have spent more than $275m of his personal fortune helping to get Trump elected to a second term in the White House in last November’s presidential election.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsTeslaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

She said it was “a hugely important step that acknowledges the often very significant impact of pre-24 week loss, not only for those experiencing the physical loss, but for their partners too”.The decision to extend the right to couples marks a victory for the Labour MP Sarah Owen, who has campaigned for the change. The women and equalities select committee, which Owen chairs,concluded in a report in Januarythat the case for it was overwhelming.A number of employers already offer the leave as an extra benefit, but the committee said it should become a universal right given the physical andemotional impacts of baby loss.About 250,000 expectant mothers in the UK suffer a miscarriage every year. Between 10% and 20% of pregnancies end in an early miscarriage within the first 12 weeks of gestation.Ministers have announced they will review the entire system of parental leave, declaring that it is “not working” for families. They plan to investigate support for new parents, including maternity leave, paternity leave and shared arrangements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bathing spots are located near to the Eiffel Tower – which is focused on swimming for families with small children – the Notre Dame Cathedral and the National Library.Lifeguards are present, and changing and shower facilities are available.

And I really disagreed with that. I did not think for a moment that over 2 million people would see it.”It was only her second TikTok live stream on her handle HelenWilsonWales – her first, about her weight loss, had no viewers at all – and initially she had not realised how many people were watching because the sun was shining on her phone screen.“But I could see that when you’re doing a live stream, loads of messages pop up and people can talk to you. So the screen was going mental. People were just like ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.“And I was like: ‘Oh, my God, something’s happening here,’ and so I just knew I had to carry on. People were saying to me: ‘Please keep going, do what you can, please keep going.’ And then that was it,” said Wilson, who grew up in Somerset and was working at the festival.View image in fullscreenKneecap performing on the West Holts stage at Glastonbury. The group called Wilson a ‘legend’ after she livestreamed the gig.Photograph: Hugo Philpott/UPI/ShutterstockThe stream was spreading through word of mouth, as viewers sent it to their friends and family, and Wilson found out later that at one point it was playing on a big screen in a pub in the band’s home town.“I have had a lot of trolling. When you rang, I was just in the middle of deleting some obscene comments off my business Facebook page.“There was somebody on Instagram just saying he sent me a message saying: ‘You’re just a wrinkled old woman looking for attention.’“[In a tabloid newspaper] I’ve been referred to as a middle-aged woman. Like, what has that got to do with anything?” said the 44-year-old.“This is about the genocide in Palestine, and this is about the failure of our government to act, to do anything about it.”She added: “More people need to know what is going on in Palestine. And we shouldn’t be censoring bands under freedom of speech, full stop. We shouldn’t be censoring anybody who is trying to raise awareness of the atrocities that are taking place.”Afterwards, Kneecap called her a “legend” and offered her free tickets to any of their shows.On Saturday, while supporting Fontaines DC in Finsbury Park in London, the bandonce againled 45,000 people in chants of “fuck Keir Starmer”.The band were far from alone in their sentiments at Glastonbury – dozens of acts and figures at the festival spoke out in support of Palestine, including CMAT, the Libertines, Gary Lineker, Joy Crookes, TV on the Radio, Sorry and Paloma Faith.Kneecap were also backed by Emily and Michael Eavis, the festival’s organisers, with Emily telling the BBC that “everyone is welcome”, before their set.Explore more on these topicsKneecapGlastonbury 2025ProtestSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

It is calling on club owners to contract private ambulance services.“It’s inconceivable that businesses with an income of millions of euros a year can’t provide this service which is saturating the emergency services at the expense of the local population,” the president of the local health services union, José Manuel Maroto, told elDiario.es.“The clubs are obliged to employ nurses and other health workers but not ambulances, the cost if which is borne by public services,” he said, adding that it was unjust that the island’s 161,000 residents should receive an inferior service because of the demands of 3.6 million annual visitors.According to Maroto, only one major club, DC-10, uses a private service.The island, part of the hippy trail in the 1970s, has been a mecca for clubbers since the early 1980s. The pioneering clubs were Amnesia and Pacha, but dozens have sprung up since, making the dance scene – and the drugs that fuel it – a major part of Ibiza’s tourism industry.The Hollywood star Will Smith was at the inauguration last month of UNVRS, the island’s biggest club, where the cheapest entry is €100 (£86) and a drink can cost €25.According to the regional government, tourists to the island spend €1.5 of every €10 on the dancefloor, but many clubbers complain the scene is now all about money and big-name DJs who command enormous appearance fees.A study by the local paper El Diario de Ibiza found that the island is the third most expensive destination in the Mediterranean after Saint-Tropez and Capri.Much of the money goes to a company founded by the former footballer and politician Abel Matutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of people have already been pulled from floodwaters that have killed nearly 70 people so far, many of them children at a summer camp along the banks of the Guadalupe River.July is peak flash flood season in the US, and centralTexasis known as “flash flood alley” because the necessary ingredients of tropical moisture and slow-moving storms come together often over hilly terrain there. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters caution that more floods could come this weekend and into next week.The scale of this latest climate disaster became apparent on Saturday asdrone footagetaken on Saturday morning showed entire neighborhoods inundated and rushing waters streaming through small town streets.Tales of survival and heartbreakwere plentiful.LiveDrone footage shows extent of deadly Texas flooding – video‘A river with a temper’ returns to calm after wreaking deadly devastation in TexasRead moreAn initial analysis of the downpours and the decisions by forecasters that led up to them by the Guardian shows that rainfall of this magnitude was exceedingly rare and difficult to predict, even for this flood-prone region.Friday’s totals of more than 10in (25cm) of rain in three hours could be expectedjust once in a “typical” 500-year periodfor Kerrville, Texas – three months’ worth of rain in just a few hours.Radar datashow that more than 4in per hour fell during the peak of Friday’s rains. That rainfall intensity was in excess of asimilar flash flood in 1987that also ended in tragedy for campers along the Guadalupe.Saturday’s rainfall totals actually exceeded Friday’s rainfall for a region slightly north of Friday’s peak rains. Nearly 14in of rain fell in five hours just west of Austin, Texas – rains that would be expected just once innearly 1,000 yearsgiven a stable climate.Despitefunding cuts and widespread staffing shortagesimplemented by theTrump administration, NWS forecasters in both the local San Angelo office and at the NWS national specialty center responsible for excessive rainfall provided a series of watches and warnings in the days and hours leading up to Friday’s flooding disaster.The forecast office in San Angelo has two current vacancies – typical for the pre-Trump era and fewer than the current average staff shortage across the NWS – and has not been experiencing any lapses in weather balloon data collection that have plagued some other offices.map of texas showing flood regionIn fact,weather balloon datagathered on Thursday from Del Rio showed record amounts of moisture present in the upper atmosphere above central Texas and added to the confidence that severe flash flooding was possible. The Del Rio office then began issuing a series of flood watchesstarting on Thursday afternoonthat cautioned the region to prepare for “excessive runoff” from “5 to 7 inches of rain”.The NWS’s Weather Prediction Center, based in College Park, Maryland, also issued a series ofmesoscale precipitation discussionson Thursday – highly detailed advance notices to other weather forecasters that a particularly rare event might be underway. In one of the discussions, forecasters noted that moisture content in central Texas was “above the 99th climatological percentile” – far in excess of normal and a clue that historic flooding was possible.In a final escalation, the NWS office in San Angelo issued aflash flood emergencyabout an hour before the water started rapidly rising beyond flood stage at theclosest US Geological Survey river monitoring gauge. A flash flood emergency is the highest level of flood warning available to the NWS, and sufficient toset off the Wireless Emergency Alert system, which would have triggered cellphone alarms in the region.The National Weather Service issueddozens of additional flash flood warningsthroughout the day on Friday and Saturday after the second wave of extremely heavy rains compounded the flooding’s scope across central Texas during the early morning hours.Even though watches and warnings were issued on time throughout the disaster – contrasting what local officials have said in press conferences – rainfall totals specified in the first flash flood watch were about half of what ultimately fell.Texas continues grim flood recovery with at least 50 killed, including 15 childrenRead moreCurrent weather forecasting technology is capable of knowing that near-record rainfall may occur somewhere in a given region about a day in advance, but knowing exactly how much and in which part of a specific river’s drainage basin over hilly terrain makes flood forecasting much more difficult – analogous to prediction exactly which neighborhood a tornado might strike a day ahead of time. Donald Trump’s staffing cuts have particularly hit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’sEnvironmental Modeling Center, which aims to improve the skill of these types ofdifficult forecasts.Though it’s unclear to what extent staffing shortages across the NWS complicated the advance notice that local officials had of an impending flooding disaster, it’s clear that this was a complex, compound tragedy of a type that climate warming is making more frequent.Rainfall intensity in central Texas has been trending upward for decades, and this week’s rains were enhanced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which made landfall in northern Mexico last week. Barry’s circulation pulled record amounts of atmospheric moisture up to central Texas from the near-record warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.The mix of Barry’s circulation and climate warming helped create conditions ofrecord-high atmospheric moisture contentover central Texas – in line with the trend towardsincreasing atmospheric moisture contentglobally as the world warms and the air can hold more water vapor.Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025US weatherExtreme weatherClimate crisisFloodingTexasanalysisShareReuse this content"

The US has resisted calls to regulate itTom PerkinsSun 6 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 08.01 EDTShareThe herbicide ingredient used to replace glyphosate in Roundup and other weedkiller products can kill gut bacteria and damage organs in multiple ways,new research shows.The ingredient, diquat, is widely employed in the US as a weedkiller in vineyards and orchards, and is increasingly sprayed elsewhere as the use of controversial herbicide substances such as glyphosate and paraquat drops in the US.But the new piece of data suggests diquat is more toxic than glyphosate, and the substance is banned over its risks in the UK, EU, China and many other countries. Still, the EPA has resisted calls for a ban, and Roundup formulas with the ingredient hit the shelves last year.‘We thought we’d got the numbers wrong’: how a pristine lake came to have the highest levels of ‘forever chemicals’ on recordRead more“From a human health perspective, this stuff is quite a bit nastier than glyphosate so we’re seeing a regrettable substitution, and the ineffective regulatory structure is allowing it,” said Nathan Donley, science director with the Center For Biological Diversity, which advocates for stricter pesticide regulations but was not involved in the new research. “Regrettable substitution” is a scientific term used to describe the replacement of a toxic substance in a consumer product with an ingredient that is also toxic.Diquat is also thought to be a neurotoxin, carcinogen and linked to Parkinson’s disease. An Octoberanalysisof EPA data by the Friends of the Earth non-profit found it is about 200 times more toxic than glyphosate in terms of chronic exposure.Bayer, which makes Roundup, faced nearly 175,000 lawsuits alleging that the product’s users were harmed by the product. Bayer, which bought Monsanto in 2018, reformulated Roundup after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a possible carcinogen.The new review of scientific literature in part focuses on the multiple ways in which diquat damages organs and gut bacteria, including by reducing the level of proteins that are key pieces of the gut lining. The weakening can allow toxins and pathogens to move from the stomach into the bloodstream, and trigger inflammation in the intestines and throughout the body. Meanwhile, diquat can inhibit the production of beneficial bacteria that maintain the gut lining.Damage to the lining also inhibits the absorption of nutrients and energy metabolism, the authors said.The research further scrutinizes how the substance harms the kidneys, lungs and liver. Diquat “causes irreversible structural and functional damage to the kidneys” because it can destroy kidney cells’ membranes and interfere with cell signals. The effects on the liver are similar, and the ingredient causes the production of proteins that inflame the organ.Meanwhile, it seems to attack the lungs by triggering inflammation that damages the organ’s tissue. More broadly, the inflammation caused by diquat may cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, a scenario in which organ systems begin to fail.The authors note that many of the studies are on rodents and more research on low, long-term exposure is needed. Bayer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Despite the risks amid a rise in diquat’s use, the EPA is not reviewing the chemical, and even non-profits that push for tighter pesticide regulations have largely focused their attention elsewhere.Donley said that was in part because US pesticide regulations are so weak that advocates aretied up with battlesover ingredients like glyphosate, paraquat and chlorpyrifos – substances that are banned elsewhere but still widely used here. Diquat is “overshadowed” by those ingredients.“Other countries have banned diquat, but in the US we’re still fighting the fights that Europe won 20 years ago,” Donley said. “It hasn’t gotten to the radar of most groups and that really says a lot about the sad and sorry state of pesticides in the US.”Some advocates haveaccused the EPAof being captured by industry, and Donley said US pesticide laws were so weak that it was difficult for the agency to ban ingredients, even if the will exists. For example, the agency banned chlorpyrifos in 2022, but a court overturned the decision after industry sued.Moreover, the EPA’s pesticides office seems to have a philosophy that states that toxic pesticides are a “necessary evil”, Donley said.“When you approach an issue from that lens there’s only so much you will do,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHerbicidesHealthAgriculturePesticidesUS Environmental Protection AgencynewsShareReuse this content"

But a lack of money threatens to delay changes and some smaller forces may oppose the changes.One source said any changes could start with smaller forces merging or being abolished. In the west, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire could merge. In the Midlands, Warwickshire could join with the West Mercia force or be absorbed by the much bigger West Midlands force.In the east, the Norfolk and Suffolk forces could merge. The West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire and the South Yorkshire forces could also merge.Gavin Stephens, the chair of the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council, told the Guardian: “Police reform is about restructuring policing so that it can keep up with modern criminality, retaining the bedrock of community policing whilst modernising our workforce to deal with national threats such as organised crime and violence against women and girls.“Our current model of 43 different police forces in England andWaleshas a wide range of geographical size, workforce size and operational capabilities. There is also real variation in financial resilience and the ability to invest, which means policing operates in subtly different ways with often incompatible technology, which leads to inefficiencies and inconsistency.“A smaller number of police forces, supported by a national policing organisation, would enable us to make decisions far quicker and maximise funding to invest in technology and our workforce. Making improvements to our service once and for all, instead of in 43 different ways, would help to end the postcode lottery victims face when reporting crime.”One senior source said: “Everyone is in agreement we need fewer forces. It would create efficiencies and greater effectiveness.”Another source with knowledge of discussions said: “Chiefs of smaller forces are nervous but accept this is where the tide is going. We hope for a phased reduction over the next decade.”No changes are expected to happen in this parliament, and any change of government after the next election could lead to the agreement to abolish police forces being scuppered.Politically, it was believed a reduction in the number of forces would have to happen under Labour. MPs representing Conservative areas, which tend to be less urban, feared police would move from more rural areas to areas where crime tended to be higher.One chief constable said that if their force absorbed a smaller force, people in more rural areas could be offered a guarantee about how many officers would be ringfenced to protect them.As yet, no detailed plans have been drawn up or presented to the government, but Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said he favoured a reduction to as few as 12 forces. It is understood that this is the number of forces senior police chiefs think should ultimately cover England and Wales.In a piece for the Sunday Times, Rowley said: “The 43-force model was designed in the 1960s and hasn’t been fit for purpose for at least two decades. It hinders the effective confrontation of today’s threats and stops us fully reaping the benefits of technology.“We need to reduce the number of forces by two-thirds, with the new, bigger and fully capable regional forces supported by the best of modern technology and making better use of the limited funding available.”In Scotland, forces have already merged into one organisation covering the entire country, which is the second largest in the UK behind the Met. Northern Ireland is also covered by a single force.Explore more on these topicsPoliceEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It forced carmakers to sell an increasing proportion of electric cars or face steep fines of up to £15,000 for every vehicle above their fossil fuel quota.UK electric car sales up by a third in first half of 2025, preliminary data suggestsRead moreHowever, in April the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, confirmed the Labour government would relax the rules after anintensive lobbying campaign by the UK car industryagainst the policy.TheVauxhall maker Stellantisblamed its decision to close its Luton van factory on the mandate, although earlier comments by executivesappeared to undermine that argument.Carmakers are aiming for a headline target of 28% electric sales to avoid fines this year, but “flexibilities” within the rules mean the effective target – as calculated by New AutoMotive – is much lower.That is because manufacturers are allowed to borrow electric sales from later years and to gain credit for cutting emissions by selling more hybrids. After the government climbdown manufacturers are to be given more freedom on how they meet their yearly targets and to face lower fines.Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive, said: “Carmakers are within touching distance of their targets for 2025 before taking into account the government’s decision to weaken the targets for this year.“This impressive progress should reassure ministers that ambitious targets spur the innovation and dynamism the UK needs to achieve net zero and get ahead in the global shift towards electric vehicles.”Weakening the rules could benefit individual carmakers in particular. New AutoMotive’s analysis suggests the Japanese carmaker Nissan is the farthest away from what it needs to achieve in 2025, as it waits for its factory in Sunderland in northern England to start production of its new Leaf electric car.Toyota and JLR, maker of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, are also well behind their effective targets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the board is offering members only an “advisory” vote at its annual general meeting (AGM) on 25 July, meaning there are no repercussions if they reject it.Virgin Money mortgage holders cry foul over owner Nationwide’s better dealsRead moreLarge high street banks are required to hold a binding vote on their pay policies at least once every three years, under laws governing large businesses listed on the London Stock Exchange. If shareholders reject the policy, they have to revert to the old pay plan and put a revised pay deal to shareholders within 12 months.Nationwide could do the same, but said it is already going further than required under the Building Societies Act, which requires binding votes only for the election of board members.A spokesperson said: “As part of our commitment to member engagement and transparency, Nationwide voluntarily puts the remuneration policy to the membership on an advisory basis at the AGM and we currently have no plans to change this approach.”While Nationwide has never held a binding vote on pay, it has also never proposed such a large remuneration package for its chief executive, which could result in a record payout, up from £4.8m now to £7m.That is close behind NatWest Group, which in April secured backing for a package worth up to £7.7m for its chief executive, Paul Thwaite.Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, described the situation as a “loophole in the governance of building societies”.“Mutuals are supposed to have a more collective approach to business than corporate banks, but while the banks are required to revise pay policies that are rejected by a majority of shareholders, and provide a response to the stock market if more than 20% vote against, building societies can in theory ignore their members,” he said.“The Nationwide case, where there may be significant discomfort with the huge pay out planned for the chief executive, highlights the need for the loophole to be closed.”Crosbie’s £7m pay deal has angered some members. “I’m a Nationwide customer and didn’t know about this? Please send me a voting form immediately,” one posted on X. “Building societies are supposed to be the good guys. The apple has fallen far from the tree,”another said.Sara Hall, the co-executive director at the campaign group Positive Money, said Nationwide “hiking its chief executive’s pay because that’s what the big banks are doing would be completely at odds with what building societies are supposed to stand for”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We always consider their views and at the last AGM over 94% of votes were in favour of the proposed remuneration policy,” they said.“Nationwide delivered record member value last year, we are still first for customer satisfaction among high street banks, and more people switched their current accounts to Nationwide than to any other brand.“We have managed this because we can attract, retain and motivate talented leaders.

Businesses have paused investment and the dollar posted its worst performance in 50 years in the first half of the year.Trump threatens 17% tariffs on food and farm produce exports from EuropeRead moreWith the clock ticking down to Trump’s 9 July deadline, the European Commission remains uncertain how he will treat the bloc, threatening €1.6tn of transatlantic trade.“Among member states, the big question will be whether we should reach a deal at all costs to avoid a trade war, or show muscle if the deal is not good enough,” one EU diplomat said.The German chancellor, , has said he wants a quick UK-style deal to avert a full-scale trade war, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, favours holding out for a better deal if a rushed deal is “imbalanced”.Giving a flavour of the aggression shown towards the EU, which Trump once called “nastier than China”, Brussels’ trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, was threatened last weekwith 17% tariffs on food importsduring talks with senior members of the Trump administration including Bessent.After announcing punitive“liberation day” tariffson nearly all countries on 2 April, Trumppaused them for 90 daysa week later.The US is nowon the brink of launching a trade assaulton dozens of countries as the 90-day period expires on Wednesday with only two deals in the bag – the UK and Vietnam.This has raised questions about the EU’s ability to strike anything other than apolitical framework agreement to extend talkswhile a baseline 10% tariff and other levies on cars, steel and aluminium remain in place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The payments were then ratcheted up in line with ever more dangerous demands.Judging by court documents, the surge in Iranian espionage efforts over the past year achieved little, falling short of Tehran’s aspirations of carrying out high-level assassinations of Israeli officials.However, so many Israelis were prepared to carry out modest missions that the spying campaign may have been successful as a way of crowdsourcing data on strategically important sites that would later become targets of Iranian ballistic missiles.Meanwhile, Israel spied on Iran to devastating effect, allowing the Mossad to locate and assassinate much of Iran’s high command and its nuclear scientists in a single instant in the early hours of Friday 13 June, among many other targets.Since the war began, the Iranian regime has arrested more than 700 people accused of spying for Israel, according to the Fars news agency. But the trials have been secret, and in at least six cases led to summary executions, making it impossible to judge how much of the alleged network is real and how much a figment of official hysteria.By contrast, in the case of the Israelis accused of spying for Iran, the prosecution has filed detailed indictments. Though there has only been one conviction so far from the recent wave of arrests, leaving individual guilt to be assessed, a clear picture has emerged from court documents of how Iran set about casting a wide net for potential agents.It typically began with a text message from an anonymous sender. One such message, from the sender “news agency”, asked: “Do you have any information about the war? We are ready to buy it.” Another, sent by “Tehran-Quds” (Tehran-Jerusalem) to a Palestinian Israeli citizen, was more overt, saying: “A free Jerusalem unites Muslims. Send us information about the war.”The message included a link to the Telegram app, where a new dialogue would begin, sometimes with someone using an Israeli name, with an offer of money for apparently simple errands. If the recipient expressed interest, they would be advised by their new mystery contacts to set up PayPal and an app for receiving funds in cryptocurrencies.In the case of one suspect arrested on 29 September, the first task was to go to a park and check if a black bag had been buried in a certain spot, for a payment of nearly US$1,000 (£730). There was no bag, and the recruit sent a video to prove it.He was later assigned other jobs that involved handing out leaflets, hanging up posters or spraying graffiti, most with slogans denigrating Benjamin Netanyahu, such as “We are all together against Bibi” (Netanyahu’s nickname) or “Bibi brought Hezbollah here” or “Bibi = Hitler”.The next stage entailed taking photos. An Israeli of Azeri heritage was hired to photograph sensitive facilities around the country and seems to have turned it into a family business, getting his relatives to take shots of the port facilities in Haifa (which later would be hit by Iranian missiles in this month’s 12-day war), the Nevatim airbase in the Negev (struck in a salvo in October), as well as Iron Dome missile defence batteries across the country, and the Glilot military intelligence headquarters north of Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenIsrael’s Iron Dome system fires to intercept missiles over Tel Aviv.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APThe same recruit who went to look for the black bag was asked to photograph the home of a nuclear scientist working at the Weizmann Institute. Israel’s premier scientific centre was the object of keen Iranian interest. Over the 15 years leading up to the war this month, five Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, almost certainly by the Mossad. In a long struggle over whether Israel would maintain its monopoly over nuclear weapons in the Middle East, Tehran wanted to strike back.Iran struck the Weizmann Institutewith ballistic missilesin the 12-day war, and it seems likely that the photos taken by its agents helped with targeting. The attempt to kill its scientists was a failure, however. In fact, neither Iran’s ministry of intelligence and security nor its Revolutionary Guards appear to have succeeded in assassinating any of their targets in the long shadow war.While the Mossad relied on infiltrating a cadre of highly trained operatives into Iran, the approach taken by Iranian intelligence was to test how far their green recruits would be prepared to go. Yossi Melman, an Israeli intelligence expert,quoted a Shin Bet officialas describing it as a “spray-and-pray approach, which seeks to develop a handful of high-quality recruits by making low-stakes investments in many others”.Once they had carried out simple tasks such as putting up posters and taking pictures, the recruits were asked to do more for more money. Having photographed the home of a nuclear scientist from the Weizmann Institute, one recruit was offered $60,000 to kill the scientist and his family and burn down their house.According to the indictment, the agent accepted and went about hiring four local toughs, all Palestinian Israeli citizens. On the night of 15 September, this would-be hit squad turned up at the gates of the Weizmann Institute, but they did not get past the security guard and meekly drove away.View image in fullscreenWeizmann Institute buildings were left in ruins after the Iranian missile strike.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersThe day after that fiasco, the Iranian handlers told the recruit to go back to the Weizmann and take more photos. With the advantage of being an Israeli Jew arriving in daylight, he managed to talk his way past the security guards and filmed the scientist’s car. He was paid $709 and asked if he would attach a GPS device to the car. He refused.This would be a pattern that repeats again and again in the indictments. Though the Iranian recruiters proved effective at finding plenty of Israelis ready to take photographs and distribute leaflets for Iranian money, the handlers in Tehran seem to have been in too much of a hurry to cultivate long-term agents.Several were abruptly asked, only a few days after completing their first tasks, whether they would try to assassinate high officials. The Azeri group were asked to find a hitman but refused. The same recruit who refused to place a GPS tracker on a scientist’s car was asked days later if he might consider throwing a petrol bomb at Netanyahu’s vehicle.Only one of the suspects has so far been convicted and jailed, after confessing to the charges against him.Million-dollar demandWhen Mordechai “Moti” Maman, 72, was approached by Iranian intelligence in spring last year, he was recently married to a much younger Belarusian woman, and in need of funds after the failure of several business ventures.Maman had spent some years in Samandağ, in southern Turkey, and in April, he contacted two businessmen brothers he knew there to see if they had any money-making ideas. The brothers said they had a lucrative business partnership with an Iranian acquaintance named Eddie importing dried fruit and spices and suggested Maman should meet him.In April, Maman flew to Samandağ via Cyprus, but Eddie sent two colleagues in his place, claiming he was not able to leave Iran for bureaucratic reasons. The next month, the Israeli was invited back to Turkey, to the town of Yüksekova in the far south-east, where he stayed in a hotel room paid for by Eddie.Once more, Eddie said he was unable to cross into Turkey, but he told Maman there was a way to smuggle the Israeli into Iran. He agreed and on 5 May he made the crossing concealed in a truck.Eddie and a second Iranian official met Maman in a luxury hotel inside Iran and made him an offer of thousands of dollars for three tasks. He was to leave money or guns at designated locations in Israel; he was to take photos of crowded places; and he was to pass on threats to other agents, specifically Israeli Palestinians, who had “received funds from Iran for carrying out hostile missions, but had not actually carried out their missions”.Maman said he would think about it and was smuggled back into Turkey. Back in Yüksekova, he was handed $1,300 in cash as partial payment for making the trip.In August, Maman was back in Turkey and was once more smuggled over the border to meet Eddie and his associate. This time the tasks were more daunting. The Iranians offered $150,000 for killing any of Netanyahu, Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet, or Yoav Gallant, then the defence minister.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant last October.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersAccording to the prosecution, Maman said he had underworld connections who might be able to get the job done, but he wanted $1m. That was too high for the Iranians who suggested a lesser target, the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, for $400,000. Maman allegedly stuck to his million-dollar demand and the talks adjourned without agreement.He was paid $5,000 and flew back to Cyprus and then, on 29 August, on to Tel Aviv, where Shin Bet officers were waiting for him.On 29 April, Maman wassentenced to 10 yearsin prison after pleading guilty to charges of contact with a foreign agent and unauthorised entry into an enemy state. His lawyer, Eyal Besserglick, described the sentence as excessive and has appealed.Besserglick said Maman believed until the last moment that Eddie was no more than an Iranian businessman dealing in raisins and spices, and he was unaware when he was being smuggled onboard a truck that he was being taken into Iran. He denies Maman asked for $1m, arguing that his client ultimately had to appear to go along with the Iranian plots, out of fear that a sudden refusal would get him killed.“What would have been better? If he had been kidnapped in a van or maybe been murdered?” Besserglick told the Guardian. He said Maman had been beaten up in prison and kept in a filthy cell with excrement smeared on the walls.“The mistake he made is serious,” the lawyer said. “But he should not die for that mistake, because in the end there will be no one to punish.”Bayan Rabee contributed reporting to this articleThis article was amended on 6 July 2025.

Seen together, they are remarkably similar in structure. An anguished narrator – Judas in 33 AD; Che in the mid-20th century – provokes and rebukes a protagonist to whom sanctity is attributed – Jesus; Eva – and who threatens the political classes with a revolution. Paul Hart’s staging for his innovative riverside venue in Berkshire benefits – as does Jamie Lloyd’s London Palladium Evita – from the current rise of political and religious populism, giving shows either side of 50 years old a strikingly topical context.Hart uses seventeen actor-musicians, strumming or blowing between lines, with only the title character not playing an instrument, making Jesus look like a vocalist with a massive backing band. But the power of the production is how the cast devastatingly excavate the emotion in the lyrics. Clearly knowing from the outset that he must die – and that his human incarnation makes him sometimes dread and fear this – Michael Kholwadia’s Jesus, unlike the serene hippy-magician in some productions, embodies the “haunting, hunted” look described by Christian Edwards’ Pilate, whose “Pilate’s Dream” is also sung in a tone closer to nightmare.This emphasis on the horror that Christ’s mission and passion would have caused to those around him extends to Parisa Shahmir’s tinglingly sung Mary Magdalene. By unusually stressing the line “He scares me so” in I Don’t Know How To Love Him, she makes exceptional sense of the later reboot plea, Could We Start Again, Please?View image in fullscreenTingling … Parisa Shahmir as Mary Magdalene.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianConversely, the Judas of Max Alexander-Taylor, displaying an extraordinary harmonic range, is more complex than the simple Biblical baddie. He truly believes that he is doing the right and nation-saving thing, as zealots everywhere will.With stage managers watching the sky as beadily as cricket umpires, the second half starts, if weather allows, outside in the Watermill grounds. The advantage is that the Gethsemane sequence takes place in an actual garden, but the inevitable delay in getting the audience back to their seats for the trial and crucifixion means that a show of otherwise exemplary pace briefly stalls.Evita review – Rachel Zegler is phenomenal but Jamie Lloyd’s rock show drowns out the storyRead moreLloyd-Webber still attracts much snideness but recent revivals of his Sunset Boulevard (with Don Black and Christopher Hampton) and now this twice-Rice mini-festival with Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, leave me happy to say that he is a great musical drama composer, tackling unlikely dark material in scores that perfectly serve both the tragic and comic notes of his librettists.At theWatermill theatre, Newbury, until 21 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreAndrew Lloyd WebberWatermill theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Then Lena Dunham came calling with the job of a lifetime. Is the actor ready to take centre stage?Sun 6 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 05.10 EDTShareWhenLena Dunhammessaged, Megan Stalter lost it. “Like d’uhh,” Stalter is explaining – delighting, really. “Who wouldn’t? I was at home: this really bad apartment in Laurel Canyon [in the Hollywood Hills]. The area is haunted, and it was actually a really scary building, and nothing ever got fixed because apparently in the lease I signed they didn’t have to repair anything! I don’t actually live there now …” Stalter, 34, has a tendency to wander off on tangents. So Dunham?“OK yes, so we were just about to start filming Hacks again.” The wildly popular, 48-times-Emmy-nominated HBO comedy in which Stalter plays nepo-baby Kayla, a chaotic and kind-hearted talent agent, her total-commitment-to-the-bit characterisation making her a breakout star. “And there Lena was in my DMs.” Stalter opened the message, which said: “I have a project I want to talk to you about.” “That’s when I lost my mind,” she adds. “Panic set in.”“I’m not,” Stalter clarifies, “a celebrity person. I don’t fangirl over people – but with Lena I do. She’s a creative genius; I’m such a Girls nut, and always felt so connected to her.” In its six seasons, Dunham’s HBO hit transformed television through its unflinching portrayal of millennial women. Eight years since the final episode broadcast, the Dunham buzz hasn’t abated.Breathe, Stalter had to remind herself. “OK, calm down, diva – ‘project’ is vague. It might be a commercial, an event, a task, maybe.” Not that Stalter was fussy. “Anything she wanted me to do, I would obviously say yes.” Turns out, Dunham didn’t need errands running. “And thank God, honestly.”Dunham was in the early stages of developing Too Much, her semi-autobiographical Netflix 10-parter, which is released on 10 July. Following Jessica (Stalter), an American thirtysomething workaholic who relocates from New York to England in the deepest throes of heartbreak, the show plays out as an offbeat romcom, with Will Sharpe (The White Lotus, Flowers) playing the indie-musician love interest.Stalter’s attempts at regional British accents, and a cocaine-fuelled dance break from Richard E Grant, are some of the show’s unexpected highlights. Loosely, it’s based on Dunham’s own experiences: after splitting from music producer Jack Antonoff, she met her now husband, British musician Luis Felber, in London. They wrote Too Much together.“Jessica is going through a really horrible breakup,” Stalter says, “and this person she was with previously made her feel she’s ‘too much’, and not in a good way. She falls for someone new pretty quickly who does accept who she is and, when she’s surrounded by people who appreciate her, realises she’s yes, a little bit much, in a great way.”In the show, Dunham plays Jessica’s older sister. “When Lena and I got on Zoom we just clicked. She said right away that if Girls was about sex and discovering who you are, Too Much is a story of love and discovering acceptance. For Lena, like Jessica, finding someone who accepted her the way she is encourages her to embrace herself.”View image in fullscreen‘When Lena and I got on Zoom, we just clicked’ … Stalter with Dunham in a scene from the series.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixPre-Hacks, Dunham had been introduced to Stalter by Andrew Scott, who drops by for a cameo in this series. “From the moment I conceived the character,” Dunham says, “even before I began collaborating with Luis, it was always Meg. I had a feeling that she could be both intensely funny and do something darker and more vulnerable.”Pre-Hacks, Stalter built a cult social media following, regularly posting clips of kooky skits and characters (small-town butter shop during Pride month;Woman flirts at a bowling alley) that caught Dunham’s eye. “Meg is never looking down on the characters she plays,” she says, “no matter how delusional or silly they may seem. She truly falls in love with, and goes to bat for, whoever she’s playing – and it’s contagious.”Hacks season three review – finally! TV’s best comedy makes it to the UKRead moreIt’s late March when I first meet Stalter, in the lobby of a central London hotel. Shooting on Too Much has wrapped, but it’s early stages in the months-long slog of a press and promo schedule a Dunham x Netflix collab demands. She’s late, 15 minutes maybe, although she’s staying right upstairs. “I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry!” she gushes, all smiles, dropping her teddy bear phone case on the table. “We were working on the ponytail for the day and got carried away! Almond latte?”Both Stalter and Dunham found bringing Jessica to life an intimate undertaking. Long before shooting started, they spoke extensively about the material and Dunham’s own experiences. Script by script, they’d dissect. “Lena had a small writers’ room where they’d bounce ideas together,” says Stalter, “then after that, it would come to me, and I would have lots of questions: her previous bad relationship; her family; how she was feeling.”View image in fullscreenBed fellows … Will Sharpe and Megan Stalter in Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixDunham remembers these well. “Meg is a very intuitive performer,” she tells me, “not method, but she hashermethod. She asks specific questions that may seem random or left-of-centre and then it always finds its way into the work.”Stalter made lists of how she and Jessica were similar, then differed. “So, like, in common: we are both very anxious people. Not in common: she’s lost her dad, I haven’t. Jessica is straight and I’m a mostly lesbian bisexual. But I have dated men. And Jessica might not date women, but sexuality is a spectrum … Me and Lena both agreed that if she’d explored a little, maaaaaybe she would have dated women.”We are made to feel small or too big, sometimes both at the same time, unless we’re neatly in a perfect boxOn set, over four months in London, this proximity continued. “If it felt like an emotional scene,” says Stalter, “I’d want a moment just with her, so I felt more connected.” There’s a post-coital scene where Jessica’s sexual self-confidence falters. “Lena and I talked a lot about how, after a breakup, no matter how hot or beautiful you feel and are, you can be so beaten down that insecurity hits.”The pair spoke extensively, too, about the show’s title, with its heap of gendered connotations. Is “you’re too much” a phrase she’s had lobbed in her direction? Stalter furrows her brow. “Excuse me, sir, no; people see me as calm, cool and collected.” Three seconds of deadpan, before the laughter erupts. “I am definitely seen as too much. Any loud woman will be told she’s  too much at some point. We are made to feel small or too big, sometimes both at the same time, unless we’re neatly in a perfect box. A lot of women experience it: me and Lena were both told we were too much, but then decided we like that about ourselves. I think it’s so sexy to be loud and funny, weird and strange, silly and goofy. It was at school that I realised those traits are often welcomed in boys, but not girls.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m a loud woman from a loud family’ … Megan Stalter.Photograph: Nolwen Cifuentes/The GuardianAt the Stalter family home in Cleveland, Ohio, this just wasn’t the case. “I’m a loud woman from a loud family: 20 cousins, mostly women, a few males thrown in, I guess.” Dad’s a tattoo artist, and mum a nurse. “I have two sisters, a brother and lots of aunts. These are funny, opinionated, not-very-quiet women with big personalities – and that was totally normal. So it was, umm, interesting to then be in the real world where women are made to feel they can’t be those things.” She scrunches her face, lugging her voice up an octave: “We’re told to be polite and small and dainty.” Pitch back down. “But that’s not me, girl.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Not popular. Teachers made me feel small and not smart. I found myself shrinking into myself, getting quiet and nervous, except in drama and performance. I’d never get good parts; people thought I was bad, but I could be myself at least.”Through her late teens, Stalter tried all sorts at community college. Teaching wasn’t a good fit. Neither was nursing. “Listen, nurses are incredible,” she says, “but I’m not supposed to be a nurse. I pass out at blood. Emotionally I was into it, but practically, it was not working.” Nothing was sticking. “OK so I also love Jesus,” she continues, no change in pace. “I’m a real God-girlie. If I wasn’t going to do something I loved, I wanted to do something that helped God. I tried some mission work, and stuff with my church.” She attended a Pentecostal church from a young age, and aged 20 spent six months with a Christian youth organisation in South America. She gave Bible school a go, too. “I tried for several years, but I really missed performing. I thought: ‘If this is in me, maybe it’s my service. Maybe God wants me to do what I really want to do, and share it with the world.’”Stalter joined a local improv class. “I thought I was so good,” she says, “but everyone there for some reason kept telling me I wasn’t? Later on, a friend told me I was a bit likeMichael Scott in The Office: walking on and messing things up. But I always felt deluded in my talent and how special I was, which really kept me going until I actually got good.”View image in fullscreenDog days … Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixAged 24, she moved to Chicago to pursue standup. “And I performed for years there. It went OK, but not much was happening for me.” Everything changed when she started posting – an art for which Stalter has a knack – launching a spoofself-titled online talkshow. “I was on Instagram live every night with a new theme. I’d set up weird things: ‘Crazy trip to Paris night’; be a travel agent and pretend to book things. That is when it all took off.” In 2019, she moved to New York, and the gigs kept coming: Hacks, indie film Cora Bora, sell-out standup shows and now Too Much.In June, we speak again over Zoom, Stalter now back at home in Los Angeles in a thankfully ghost-free residence, with her girlfriend. “Oh, and our two kitties, and a terrier who is really attached to me. Too attached, really. The separation anxiety is a problem.”It’s intense, Los Angeles right now: anti-ICE protests and the general bad Trump vibes percolating. “It’s really upsetting,” Stalter says, “devastating and scary.” She’s been to some marches. “People have to keep coming together to protest and support one another. We’re fighting for each other.” Throwing herself into Too Much has been a much-welcomed escape.It’s no affront to Stalter’s range to see a through-line from her characters: from those early viral creations all the way to Jessica. Whether self-invented for standup and socials, or brought to life from scripts on screen, they tend to be big, bold, slightly berserk. “What,” she’s grinning, “am I not as crazy as you expected? I like to play people who are nervous-confident: women who have a level of self-love but are falling apart and pretend they’re not. I do a lot of standup with a persona I’ve built, too, where the character – me – pretends to be really talented but the show crumbles.”View image in fullscreenAgent of chaos … Stalter and Hannah Einbinder in Hacks.Photograph: HBOStalter sees some of herself in these characters. “I’m wild in that way,” she says, “although I’m not horrible, I’m actually very nice. But I feel so confident on stage acting this crazy bitch. Something inside of me is over the top. When I’m at my most relaxed and comfortable, like on stage, it also comes out of me.” Playing characters who often move through the world unconcerned by judgment has made Stalter reflect.“There’s something really freeing about playing someone like that,” she believes. “In real life, I’m such a people pleaser. I struggle with wanting everyone to be happy all the time, for them to be happy with me, scared of upsetting someone or having someone be mad at me. It’s my greatest fear: like I’m going to die if someone is mad at me. It’s something I’m working on in therapy.”Might that be a tricky trait in her industry? Dunham told New York magazine in 2024 she refrained from casting herself as the lead in part because she “was just not up for having my body dissected again”. Too Much is Stalter’s first leading TV role, and it’s a big-hitter: there will be reviews, comparisons to Girls, so much more exposure.Stalter feigns a look of panic at the prospect. “Wouldn’t it be so funny if I passed out?” She smacks her hand on the table, leaving her latte wobbling. Another smile. She shrugs off the pressure. “I’m a woman comedian who puts stuff on the internet, babe,” comes her reply, “and I’m not skinny. So I’ve already had the meanest stuff said about me. Any woman posting – yes, skinny women, too – will get it. So I’m not worried when someone says something unkind, or doesn’t like me in a show, honestly. I literally have a viral clip that’s me reading out the worst, craziest abuse: ‘Fat white comedian does crazy bomb set.’”She pauses for a moment. “It’s only in my personal life that I’m a massive people pleaser. If strangers say they hate Too Much, or me, whatever: I think I’m hot, I love how I look, and I love my comedy. I am who I am, and can’t be anything but my loud self.”Too Much is on Netflix from20 July.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionLena DunhamTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It connects the globe by moving people and hauling goods. It loosens the grip of the weather by warming our homes in winter and cooling them in summer. It forges the steel that raises our cities and synthesises the fertilisers that keep half the world’s population from starvation. It increasingly empowers us by electrifying the technologies we rely on daily.It is also the great enabler of socioeconomic development. Monetary wealth and energy abundance move in lockstep: plot a graph of GDP per capita against energy consumption per capita, and you’ll draw astraight line. Low-energy, high-income nations do not exist. Prosperity and energy are inseparable; you cannot have one without the other.Sure, GDP per capita isn’t a perfect measure of socioeconomic development. It says nothing about how evenly that wealth is distributed, for instance. But it remains an excellent barometer, and one that all nations actively strive to raise, particularly less wealthy ones.Today,700 million people live in extreme poverty(defined as living on less than $2.15 per day). They won’t climb out of it without access to more energy. Making as much energy as possible available to as many people as possible ought to be a defining goal of the 21st century.But there is an elephant in the room: the climate emergency. Our energy supply is responsible forthree-quarters of our global greenhouse gas emissions. Plot a second graph, this time of carbon emissions per capita against energy consumption per capita: you’ll drawanother straight line. So, how do we promote energy abundance and the prosperity it enables without sacrificing the natural environment?The answer isnotto use less energy. Only a handful of countries – the UK, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and the USA, for example – have managed todecouple GDP from energy. They’ve grown richer over the past few decades, even though their energy consumption per capita has flatlined or even declined. But these countries are outliers: rich, highly developed economies with infrastructure already in place. For the vast majority, the link between energy and prosperity remains unbroken. Denying the developing world access to abundant energy would be a profound moral failure, not to mention an act of breathtaking hypocrisy. The answer is not less energy, butcleanerenergy, and more of it.Wind and solar power are often offered as the solutions. But their power is intermittent, energy industry jargon for “unreliable”. They’re fundamentally constrained by meteorology and celestial mechanics: wind turbines falter on still days, and solar panels don’t work on the side of the Earth facing away from the sun (colloquially called “night-time”). I would love to live in a world where wind and solar alone could replace fossil fuels, but there’s no beating the laws of physics.To replace fossil fuels and support renewables, we need something that’s always on, potent and, crucially, emissions-freeElaborate backup systems won’t cut it, either. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity – which represents95% of the world’s electricity backup capacity– and batteries discharge in minutes and hours. Yet wind and solar falter for days and weeks at a time. To replace fossil fuels and support renewables, we need something that’s always on, potent and, crucially, emissions-free.Nuclear reactors meet these ideals. They’re dispatchable, industry parlance for reliable. A single one generates enough electricity to power the lives of 2 million average Europeans, even after accounting for downtime and maintenance. And they don’t emit carbon dioxide.“But doesn’t nuclear take too long to build?!” Not necessarily. Between 1973 and 1999 France built 56 nuclear reactors with amedian construction timeof just six years, cutting the fossil fuel share of electricity in its grid from 65% to less than 10%. (Incidentally, France’s GDP per capita rose by 58% over the same period.)It’s true that sluggish build times torment the west today. Flamanville 3, France’s first and only reactor of the 21st century so far, was supposed to take five years to build but ended up taking 17. Hinkley Point C – the UK’s first since 1995 – is still a construction site seven years after breaking ground; the British government recently announced another power station – Sizewell C – will be online by the mid-2030s, but many fear the actual completion date will recede quickly into the future. Across Europe, the median build time since the year 2000 has dragged out to almost a decade. But it’s not a problem with nuclear power per se; it’s a symptom of the west’s chronic inability to deliver large pieces of infrastructure, an ailment that affects everything from laying high-speed railway lines, to building new housing estates, to filling in potholes.By contrast, rapid build times remain the norm in other parts of the world. China’s median build-time since 2000 is five years and 10 months; South Korea’s is six. The delays experienced by the west are regulatory and managerial failures, not technological ones.There’s also a perception that nuclear power is dangerous, yetthe datashow it’s as safe as wind and solar. People believe that it’s expensive, yet the International Energy Agencyfindsit to be “the least cost option for low-carbon generation”. Perhaps it’s bad for the environment? Well, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europeconcludesit has the lightest ecological burden of any power source. And how on earth do you solve the problem of nuclear waste? Finland – with a grid that’s40% nuclear– has aworking geological storage solution.In fact, nuclear power’s biggest obstacle is its terrible PR. It’s the bogeyman of the energy world, but like all bogeymen, the reality is rather different. It’s a tragedy that we’ve been splitting atoms in nuclear power stations for longer than we’ve known we were causing the climate to change.Solving the energy problem solves a tangle of others: economic, humanitarian and environmental. I envisage a future where nuclear reactors – complemented by wind turbines and solar panels – power the world. A future where clean, constant and plentiful energy awaits, and where prosperity doesn’t cost the earth.Tim Gregory is a nuclear chemist at the UK National Nuclear Laboratory and author ofGoing Nuclear: How the Atom Will Save the World(Bodley Head).Further readingMore From Lessby Andrew McAfee (Scribner, £9.99)Enlightenment Nowby Steven Pinker (Penguin, £14.99)Not the End of the Worldby Hannah Ritchie (Vintage, £9.89)Explore more on these topicsEnergyThe big ideaNuclear powerEconomic growth (GDP)featuresShareReuse this content"

On election day 2024, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voted forDonald Trumpfor the second time in three elections. Barack Obama’s upstairs-downstairs coalition lies in ruins, as Democrats struggle to connect with working-class voters across racial and ethnic lines.Last November, Trump came within just three points of winning a majority of Latino voters. Such Americans walked away from their presumed political home – in droves. A Trump endorsement by Roberto Clemente Jr, son of the late Pittsburgh Pirates baseball star, was a harbinger. Likewise, Trump posted double-digit gains among Catholics and Jews, once core constituencies in the Democratic party of FDR.To quote Bob Dylan, “The times, they are a changin’.” Into the fray jumps Salena Zito with her latest book, Butler, and its dramatic subtitle, The Untold Story of the Near Assassination of Donald Trump and the Fight for America’s Heartland.Zito is definitely a Trump fan, living in western Pennsylvania, a place that’s become part of Trumplandia. No wonder: her analysis is sharp-eyed and her anecdotes revealing – she walks among Them. Beyond that, she possesses roots and an affinity for her “Yinzers”.These days, she writes for the Washington Examiner and is a contributor to the Washington Post. Last time out, withThe Great Revolt, co-authored with Brad Todd in 2018, she painted a portrait of Trump’s base that was not standard GOP-issue and a Democratic party overly reliant on coastal elites. That take remains valid. Other than in faculty meetings, you can’t win elections solely with the votes of JDs, MDs and PhDs. More voters lack four year-degrees than those who have them.Butler, turns to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the failed July 2024 assassination attempt on Trump, as a serendipitously fitting backdrop and fulcrum of the events that preceded and followed. She had access to the Trump, JD Vance and the senior staff of the campaign.Trump delivers bouquets of compliments. Zito is flattered, even enthusiastic. She enjoys the rapport, admires her subject. Trump is not a lab specimen or patient. She is not his psychologist. Rather, he talks to her, expresses concern about her grandchildren, and offers a lesson in politics 101: empathy goes far.On the page, Trump takes Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to task for waiting a year before appearing at the village of East Palestine, Ohio, the site of a major railcar disaster, 42 miles from Butler.“They never showed up to see them,” Trump tells Zito. “Never. It’s a shame. I did, I came, I told them I would not forget them and I won’t.”Ohio, Vance’s state, went Republican by better than 10 points. All of Ohio’s top elected officials are nowRepublicans. In polarized times, ticket-splitting grows rare.Elon Musk talked to Zito too. There’s nothing like the zeal of a 12-figure convert, the world’s richest person. Given the current fallout between Musk and Trump, it is memorable stuff, a bromance before it went off the rails.Butler unintentionally delivers a packet of receipts.“I asked Musk if I could interview him, and he said: sure,” Zito recalls.“‘Who are the ones that are trying to silence free speech? That’s the Democrats,’” Musk advises.“They’re the ones trying to silence free speech,” he continues. “You know who the bad guys are – the ones who want to stop you from speaking. Those are the bad guys. It’s a no-brainer.”To put it mildly, irony abounds. Never mind what Musk did to X, formerly Twitter, in terms of promoting one sort of view and quashing another. Since their relationship turned to dust, Trump has threatened to deport Musk and cancel his government contracts.In hindsight, that the Trump-Musk relationship would last long would have been a bad bet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But whatever you think of the legislation or Musk, Trump holds a decisive advantage.Beyond the obvious, regarding simple power, Trump is a far better showman. Startling to say it, he is way less weird. Musk is the nerd who always wanted to hang with the cool kids.Zitodevotes attentionto the dichotomy between the “placed” and the “placeless” – “people who are rooted in their places versus people who are essentially nomads” – and its relationship to politics and Trump. The placed are with him; the placeless, not so much.Such demographic faultlines are global. They played an outsized role in the fight over Brexit. Populism is not restricted to the US.In 2017, David Goodhartwrote Road to Somewhere, which examined the forces that drove Brexit. He placed a premium on describing how a sense of belonging has come to shape politics, in an uncertain world.His typology divided society between “anywheres” and “somewheres”, with the archetypal anywhere possessing a degree or two from Oxbridge or the Ivy League, a portable skill set, and a spouse who shares similar credentials. By contrast, somewheres lack those markers, and find the world a less welcoming place.GDP figures and personal income statistics alone do not convey the entire story. In 2016, “fuck your feelings” was a Trumpian battle cry – though those shouting it did not take kindly to being called deplorable by Hillary Clinton or, eight years later, being called “garbage” by Biden.As expected, Zito calls out Clinton and Biden for their missteps. Trump or his base, not so much. Yeah, there’s asymmetry. But if you’re a Democrat, punching down is seldom a winning strategy.Butleris publishedin the US by HachetteExplore more on these topicsBooksDonald TrumpRepublicansreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bomer is tall and striking, in her mid-50s. I met her last year at a reading in Williamsburg, Virginia, where she seemed like someone who cared almost manically about literature and also like someone who would be fun to hang out with, two qualities not always confluent. I had heard of these anxious dogs before, when she and I met for dinner a few months ago, and she disclosed that her life was now spent managing canine neuroses.“I got them when my dad died,” she says, in between offering me matcha, coffee, tequila or wine (it’s 2.30pm on a Sunday; Bomer doesn’t drink any more, save a glass of champagne on selling her book, but doesn’t mind if others do). “The dogs were a mistake,” she says, “But that’s OK, I’ll survive it.”Bomer was involved with the cohort of mid-2000s US writing broadly characterised as “alt lit”, an irreverent internet vernacular-driven movement personified byTao Lin. She published anonymously on the websiteHTML Giantand had her first novel, Nine Months, in a drawer for 10 years. Mark Doten of Soho Press picked it up in 2012. Since then she has been widely admired in the literary world for her transgressive, vivid work, which often examines women at points of great pressure from an uncanny perspective – her fans include Sam Lipsyte and Jonathan Franzen. This admiration has not yet fully broken through to a mainstream audience, but her new book looks set to do so.Bomer’s latest novel, The Stalker, is all about the nastiest, most parasitic kind of survival. Its antihero, Robert Doughten Savile or “Doughty”, is the bearer of an entitlement so groundless and infinite that it obliterates anyone he approaches. Born to a once-wealthy Connecticut family but now without material means, he uses his charisma and total confidence to live in New York as he believes he deserves. He lies effortlessly, inventing lavish real estate deals while in fact whiling away his afternoons watching George Carlin specials, smoking crack in the park, and allowing older men to perform oral sex on him in Grand Central for a little extra cash. In the evenings, meanwhile, he is primed to identify and zone in on women who may prove useful.This is Doughty’s great gift, knowing what a woman needs and what she will tolerate to get it, how his cruelty is best deployed or concealed. To nauseating effect, his skill escalates operatically as the book continues. It’s a knockout novel, one I’ve passed around to friends, scenes from which I still feel a thrill of horror to recall.“Originally I wanted him to be the devil,” she says. “The actual devil, evil incarnate. But then I found myself humanising him. And I kind of regret it.” By the simple relentlessness of his presence, his unwillingness to allow the women enough space or thought to disengage from his influence, he comes to represent male intrusion on female life.“On a daily basis, if you leave your building you are dealing with some shitty man spewing garbage,” she says. “It wears on us, and that’s why I have a problem with critics being weary of the survivor-victim thing: ‘Oh just get over it, it’s boring, you can be strong.’ It’s like, I did try that. I did that: ‘I’m strong. I’m going to shoot pool with the guys.’ Although, I really do like to shoot pool.” We derail here while she leads me to her office, pleasantly cluttered with paintings like the rest of the flat, so that she can show me her pool cue, which she has had since she was 19. I ask if she was good. “You rank ’em out of six, I was a solid three. But on a good day I could beat a six.”Many, many people are ciphers. They will add nothing to your life, and they will leave with so much of youWe return to the question of victim fatigue, something that has been on my own mind lately, having just read a brilliant memoir called Trauma Plot by Jamie Hood, which exists partly in conversation with the cultural malaise around making art about having survived violence and abuse. Both Hood’s book and Bomer refer to a New Yorker essay by Parul Sehgal titledThe Case Against the Trauma Plot, which argues that overuse of trauma as a narrative device has led to constricted, rote work. Sehgal subsequently panned Sarah Manguso’s autobiographical divorce novel, Liars, describing it as “thin and partial”, and asking: “What is this vision of womanhood, of sexually indiscriminate infants running households?” Bomer, on the other hand, was so moved by Manguso’s depiction of infidelity and the violence of being lied to that she wrote Manguso a fan letter (one of seven she has written in her life, Philip Roth and Franzen among recipients of the others).“Sehgal misses the entire point of the book, which is that Manguso is now free – not bitter, free. Whenever you describe yourself as a victim, you’re immediately dismissed … I feel like finding Doughty’s voice in my book was my way, hopefully, to be heard – in the way that no one wants to fucking hear another story about women. And yet he’s such an everyman. So it’s like, here’s your cliche then.”Bomer was raised in Indiana by a French professor father and an Austrian mother who was a translator and a painter: “She refused to become an American citizen, for political reasons. Which really makes sense now, right? She was ahead of her time in a million different ways.” Her childhood was marred by the worry and dread following her father’s suicide attempt when she was five; she went on to study psychology in what she describes as “an attempt to cure” her father.She was married for 20 years and raised two children, writing as much as possible. When pressed for her strategy there she replies, “I had no social life and my house was a mess.” In 2011, she published her first story collection, Baby; her second, Inside Madeleine, followed in 2014. All were warmly received, but her moment of success around the publication of Inside Madeleine could not take hold fully because, in her words, she “disappeared”. Her father had killed himself not long before, and her mother was in the last stages of a long illness. “My father’s death was horrific and violent. My mother’s was slow. There was no way to process. People don’t want to be around you when you’re suffering.”Bomer was divorced 10 years ago, and describes The Stalker as a sort of divorce book, “but not divorcing a particular man, it’s divorcingmen– a kind of man,” she says, before instantly discluding her two sons and her many friends. After our meeting, she emails me to clarify some of her comments and concludes: “We don’t believe people the first time they hurt us, or the second, or the third – until we do. Because we want to have compassion and believe that if we show love and kindness … we will reap it back. And that is where we are wrong. Many, many people are ciphers. They will add nothing to your life, and they will leave with so much of you.”It’s difficult to reconcile the blunt fatalism of a statement like that one, or indeed the exhilaratingly ghastly novel she has written, with the generous and joyful woman I met. But perhaps the exorcism she has performed with this marvel – a divorce book with no divorce; a book called The Stalker with not that much stalking in it; a book by a middle-aged woman that, following five others, looks set to become her breakthrough hit – has made her so. Not bitter, as she says, but free.The Stalker by Paula Bomer is published by Soho Press. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Powerful emotions – tears, terror, ecstasy, despair – caused not by real events, but by the brain’s activity between sleeping and waking.Dreams and nightmares have long been studied by psychologists. Now they are the subject of a new exhibition featuring several artists that were patients at the world’s oldest psychiatric hospital, Bethlem (sometimes known as Bedlam), and its sister institution, the Maudsley hospital.It includes paintings by Charlotte Johnson Wahl, the late mother of Boris Johnson, who spent eight months as a patient at the Maudsley after a breakdown when her four children were aged between two and nine. She created dozens of paintings while there, and held her first exhibition which sold out. “I couldn’t talk about my problems, but I could paint them,” she said later.View image in fullscreenBetween Sleeping and Waking: Hospital Dreams and Visions is at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in Beckenham, London, from 14 AugustPhotograph: Bethlem Museum of the MindRachel Johnson, her daughter, said inan interviewearlier this year that her mother’s stay at the Maudsley “gave her relief from domesticity, and time to paint. We always accepted that painting was like oxygen to her. But when she returned to us, we could see she was still very ill.”Two of Johnson Wahl’s paintings are included in the exhibition, Between Sleeping and Waking: Hospital Dreams and Visions, which opens at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in August.The centrepiece of the show is a huge installation, Night Tides, by contemporary artist Kate McDonnell. She uses swathes of bedding woven with disordered words to evoke the restlessness and clashing thoughts of insomnia.According to Caroline Horton, professor of sleep and cognition and director of DrEAMSLab at Bishop Grosseteste university in Lincoln, “dreaming occurs during sleep, and sleep is essential for all aspects of mental and physical health.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This exhibition captures the intrigue of our night-time experiences, both positive and negative, while showcasing their intricate relationship with our mental health.”Among other works featured in the exhibition is London’s Overthrow by Jonathan Martin, an arsonist held in the “criminal lunatic department” of Bethlem hospital from 1829 until his death in 1838. In 2012, theGuardian described itas a “mad pen-and-ink depiction of the capital’s destruction due to godlessness”.In 1828, Martin, who was driven to expose corruption within the church, had delivered warnings to clergy in York, urging them to repent of the “bottles of wine, and roast beef and plum pudding”. When they failed to respond, he set fire to York minster. At his trial, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.An illustrated poem, “Epitaph, of my poor Jack, Squirrel”, by James Hadfield, one of Bethlem’s most notorious patients, who spent 41 years in the hospital, will be on display for the first time. Experiencing delusions about the end of the world, Hadfield became convinced that he must sacrifice himself to save humankind. He decided to engineer a situation where his life would be taken by others – an attempt to kill King George III.He was arrested and his lawyer successfully argued at his trial that he was “incurably insane”, and he was sent to a cell in Bethlem rather than prison. At the hospital, he was allowed pets, including squirrels, and he sold pictures of them to visitors. His autopsy revealed severe brain injuries dating back to his years as a young soldier.The dream diaries of a Maudsley psychiatrist, Edward Hare, will also be on display for the first time. Over half a century, from the 1940s to the 1990s, Hare recorded his impressions on waking of his dreams from the mundane to the fantastical.Colin Gale, director of the Bethlem Museum of the Mind, said the artwork in its collections reflected “an entire spectrum of dreams identified by sleep researchers”.Between Sleeping and Waking: Hospital Dreams and Visionsis at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in Beckenham,London, from 14 August.

If the director Mariame Clément felt any pressure, it didn’t show. Hers is a nuanced staging that manages to be astute, funny and moving all at once. It’s also extremely well sung.The opera is about many things, but a great deal hinges on the ancient concept ofdroit de seigneur, a barbaric medieval custom whereby a feudal lord was entitled to have sex with a female servant on her wedding night. Mozart’s Count, we learn, has made a show of ending the tradition, though he still hopes to bed the feisty Susanna, maidservant to his estranged Countess. Clément sets the show in its original period, allowing its parallels to resonate across the centuries with today’s audiences, and so they do.View image in fullscreenSparky … Johanna Wallroth as Susanna, with Charvet’s Cherubino.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThere is a powerful interrogation of character here: the determination and resourcefulness of Susanna, the aching loneliness of the Countess, and the testosterone-fuelled antagonism that develops between the Count and his increasingly implacable manservant, Figaro. Revolutionary feelings erupt at several points. Whether or not he prevails in his immediate sexual depredations, the Count’s days are plainly numbered. He might join in the final outburst of bonhomie, but as a predator his career is in tatters.Clément is clearly blessed with funny bones, as are most of her singers. At the opening of Act III, we hear the Count’s voice, seemingly from off stage. Moments later, as a wriggling foot emerges over its rim, we realise he was submerged in the bathtub all along. The fistfuls of documents concealed under Marcelina’s voluminous skirts, the rogue’s gallery of doddery old men, and a hastily improvised game of rock paper scissors all receive well-earned laughs.View image in fullscreenMadeleine Shaw as Marcellina, Alessandro Corbelli as Dr Bartolo and Ru Charlesworth as Don Basilio.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJulia Hansen’s rotating sets are a marvel, presenting a labyrinthine succession of pastel-painted rooms, corridors and gardens. Equally eye-catching are her vibrant costumes and Paule Constable’s atmospheric lighting, which never fails to pick out a face. Riccardo Minasi drives the score hard, though his flexible beat is always alert to the drama. The playing of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is exhilarating, though balance is sometimes an issue.The cast is led by Johanna Wallroth’s sparky Susanna and Louise Alder’s radiant Countess. The latter delivers an immaculate account of Porgi amor and a poignantly staged Dove sono. Michael Nagl is an appealingly bumptious Figaro, Huw Montague Rendall a preening, raptor-like Count, and Adèle Charvet engaging and entirely convincing as the reluctantly cross-dressed Cherubino. As Bartolo and Marcelina, Alessandro Corbelli and Madeleine Shaw are surprisingly tender in the paternity scene, another of Clément’s many thoughtful touches.At Glyndebourneuntil 21 AugustThis article was amended on 6 July to correct a picture caption that misidentified the mezzo-soprano Madeleine Shaw, who plays MarcellinaExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGlyndebourneMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, scammers are trying to cash in on this summer’s must-see gigs, claiming they can get you into sold-out events. So be on your guard.TheOasisgigs, that kicked off on Friday, are among the big-ticket events being used by fraudsters to trick unsuspecting music fans. Earlier this year, Lloyds Bank said that more than 1,000 customers had fallen victim to scams that offered access to the eagerly anticipated concerts. Fans lost an average of £436 each, with the biggest loss more than £1,700.According to the UK government,in 2024 more than £1.6m was lost to gig ticket fraud, and 3,700 reports were made to Action Fraud. Almost half of the Action Fraud cases related to offers made on social media, and there have been many stories from people who have lost money after responding to posts onFacebook.Some have reported that theirFacebook pages have been hijackedand then used by criminals to trick their family and friends into thinking ticket sales were genuine.Scammers are bold enough to answer questions before running off with your cash. A reader told us he had been convinced that tickets were genuine before transferring £150 to pay for them – as soon as he had, the fraudster disappeared.What the scam looks likePosts on platforms, such as Facebook, claim that people have spare tickets to sell, and say that they can show you proof before you pay. Scroll through posts on fan pages, or on X, and there are hundreds of people claiming to be selling. Some will be genuine, but there is no way of telling from just looking at them.What the messages ask forYou will be asked for a payment – probably by a bank transfer – in exchange for the tickets.What to doIf a friend or family has posted that they are selling the tickets you want, contact them directly rather than dealing with them through social media.Find the website of the venue or band – it will provide links to take you to the legitimate sites to use for ticket sales and resales.Use a credit or debit card to pay online – these give you extra protections if the tickets do not turn up.If you get an email saying tickets are available, check the address – Ticketmaster emails, for example, should come fromnoreply@mailings.ticketmaster.co.uk. Rather than clicking on links sent in emails, go directly to the ticket seller’s page.Make sure any company you buy through is a member of the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star). It has a redress scheme if things go wrong.Ticketmaster also warns to beware of printed tickets, as scammers can distribute the same ticket multiple times.Explore more on these topicsMusicScam watchConsumer affairsOasisScamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My two-year-old son just started losing it, so I was distracting him with silly noises and games. It was largely working and he was mostly laughing and squealing with delight. I registered that it was annoying some passengers, but the alternative would have been much louder and annoying for us all. Making matters worse, no one offered me a seat, so we were standing up and bumping into other people, who were getting pissed off.The kindness of strangers: a woman I’d never met heard we had flu and dropped a big pot of soup at our doorstepRead moreI was close to tears when an older lady moved forward and stood next to me. She was there for a while and could see I was getting very stressed out. Right at the point where I felt like the train would keep going forever, she put her hand on my arm and said: “You’re doing a great job.”It was so nice to hear. Those words of encouragement made a stressful situation a lot more bearable and have always stuck with me. I’ve no doubt she was a mother herself.I’m a midwife now and often when I see mums on the edge of the abyss, I think of that woman and try to share her kindness. I tell them: “Your baby’s loved and fed – you’re doing good.” Mums don’t hear that enough – in the public eye, mothers are under a lot of scrutiny, far more than fathers. I know first-hand how much a word of encouragement can turn the day around, and make things feel a little bit easier.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

She lives far from us all and doesn’t come home any more after being a real homebird. She hasn’t visited for over a yearand didn’t see any of us at Christmas or my birthday, which is not like her.When I visit her, it’s becoming clearshe isn’t making choices for herself any more– even the simplest ones are made by her partner and she concedes to everything he wants.He is also jealous of any other male family member who is spoken about positively.I was hoping this wasn’t the whole pictureand didn’t discuss it at home, still considering how to approach it, but another family member visitedand observed similar over a longer period. Even worse, her partner was openly encouraging my daughter to think badly of her family.It seems she has lost her sense of self. It reminds me of a relationship with an abusive partner I was in many years ago, which took me years to recover from. I feel she is being isolated but wants the relationship to succeed so badly that she will do anything to make him happy.I feel powerless to help her, and so hurt and sad for her. Others in the family already feel isolated from herand have lost the strong connections they had.I’m worried for her.I don’t know what to do other than just keep being available. If we get shut out, which I am afraid of, then she will be isolated even more.Domestic abuse, which is what you’re describing (especially in your longer letter, the details of which you asked me to not publish), is one of the most heinous crimes. The very place you should feel safe – home – you’re not. Watching a loved one in such a relationship is torture. So I really feel for you and your daughter. “Being available” is absolutely the right approach. I’m sorry you’ve also been through this, but you’ll also probably remember that it takes a long time to realise you are in a relationship with an abusive partner and to leave it (and leaving needs to be done with great care, as I explain later).I took your letter to National Counselling and Psychotherapy Society-registered psychotherapist Erene Hadjiioannou, who has worked with women in abusive situations. “Isolation,” says Hadjiioannou “seems to be a key theme. The daughter says she feels isolated from family; you feel isolated from you daughter. You feel that naming the behaviour as abusive or controlling would exacerbate the isolation. But complying with the notion that there’s nothing going on doesn’t make sense, especially as she’s communicating she’s distressed.”Many people lack awareness about lesser-known forms of abuse, such as coercive control, so your daughter may not recognise that she is experiencing domestic abuse. And, even if she does, talking about it will be difficult for her. As Hadjiioannou says: “It’s a place she can’t go to yet. Traumatic experiences are overwhelming and intense, including recalling them. However, this doesn’t mean that total silence is the answer – especially as silence is disempowering for all involved.”Respond to the impact of what your daughter is going through, rather than the specifics of the situationHadjiioannou suggests you try to “respond to the impact of what your daughter is going through, rather than the specifics of the situation. By doing this you can affirm your daughter’s experiences via their impact, while staying connected with her.” So if she comes to you saying she’s stressed or sad, you could try saying something like: “I can see this is hard for you, is there anything I can do to help?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

What can I do about him?Read moreI wasn’t sure where your daughter lives, but it’s important to remember that even if there’s no physical abuse, coercive control is now a criminal offence throughout the UK. I must point out that if your daughter does decide to leave, be aware that women areat most risk at this juncture.The charity Refuge runs anational domestic abuse helpline, which provides information and support.“People who are subjected to controlling behaviour,” says Hadjiioannou, “are left with very limited frames of reference on how to understand what’s going on, what’s normal, what’s abusive behaviour in a relationship, and how to feel about themselves personally. One thing you can do is take care to tell your daughter what’s likable about her, that she’s loved and cared for, and what her strengths are.”If she knows you’re there no matter what, when the time comes she’ll know where to go.

When I first tried this mattress last year, it was among the firmest of all contenders in my mission to discover thebest mattress. It was great-looking, easy to handle, andfirm. Several months later, it’s great-looking, easy to handle, and … soft?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Not quite. But Panda’s mattress is a fine example of what happens to memory foam after you’ve slept on it for a few months. The initially solid sleeping surface adapts to your body, becoming softer and cosier. My tests with weights reassured me that the mattress was still supportive and not sagging, but it definitely wasn’t as firm as in those early weeks.Being a hybrid mattress, the Panda Hybrid Bamboo contains springs as well as foam, although I’m not sure you’d know it. Hybrids cover a huge range, and this one’s very much at the “feels like all-foam” end. Here, I’ll explain why that makes it ideal for some sleepers – but not quite for me.View at PandaHow I testedView image in fullscreen‘We ran lab-style experiments with heat pads, weights and wobbly cups of water …’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBedding company Panda London sent me a double size Hybrid Bamboo mattress in autumn 2024. My husband, Alan, and I removed it from its bed-in-a-box wrapping and let it expand fully, then invited our familytesting panelto mark out of 10 on firmness and comfort. We also ran lab-style experiments with heat pads, weights and wobbly cups of water to measure sinkage, motion isolation, heat retention and edge support. Alan and I slept on the Panda for a month in winter, then again during the much warmer nights of June.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreen‘The geometric pattern on the cream-coloured fabric cover looks almost art deco.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianView at PandaThe Hybrid Bamboo is the cheaper of the two mattresses made by Panda London. It comes in nine sizes, including “small double”, and costs from £649 (UK single) to £1,050 (EU emperor) via £799 for a UK double. Those prices are roughly mid-range for a bed-in-a-box hybrid, but they’re much cheaper than Panda’s other mattress, the “orthopaedic grade”Hybrid Bamboo Pro, which costs from £950 to £1,750 and contains almost twice the number of springs.Like all hybrid mattresses, the Hybrid Bamboo contains pocket springs plus layers of memory foam of various densities. The individually wrapped pocket springs have a barrel-shaped design, which means they offer more pushback where your body needs it, according to Panda. The mattress contains 612 springs in its largest size, somewhat fewer than firmer rivals such as theOrigin Hybrid Pro, which has 5,700 springs in a double. Foam layers include an open-cell “BioCell” layer immediately beneath the surface, then a more dense “DualFlex” layer further down.The mattress lives up to its name with infusions of bamboo in the fabric cover and open-cell foam. Panda claims this bamboo content is naturally antibacterial, moisture-wicking and deodorising, with the power to “prevent the natural heat retention of memory foam”.The cream-coloured fabric cover is gorgeous, with a geometric pattern that looks almost art deco. You can unzip and remove the cover for washing in the machine when needed, but it comes off in one whole unit, like a shell. That makes it more tricky to zip back into place than most removable mattress covers. I managed it on my own, eventually.View image in fullscreenAt 25cm deep, the mattress is robust yet easy to move around.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThere are six layers in all, adding up to a depth of 25cm. That’s a nice medium depth, offering a balance of robustness and easy manoeuvrability, plus a snug fit for standard fitted sheets. Carry handles are hidden away on the underside of the mattress. As with most hybrids, the Panda is one-sided (only one side is designed to be slept on), so you don’t have to turn it. However, Panda recommends you rotate it 180 degrees every three to six months to prevent sagging.Panda describes the Hybrid Bamboo as “medium firm” and gives it 6.5/10 for firmness. When it’s newly expanded, it feels significantly firmer than that – but it softens to its advertised tension after being slept on for a few weeks. When my family testing panel rated the Hybrid Bamboo a week after unwrapping, it scored 8/10 for firmness and sank a maximum of 19mm under 7.5kg of weight. Six months later, including two months of being slept on, it scored 6.8/10 and sank 34mm. This is within the expected settlement rate for memory foam.You’ll need to take advantage of Panda’s 100-night free trial period before deciding whether this mattress is right for you.SpecificationsType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel initially rated as 8/10, then 6.8/10Depth:25cmCover:remove to wash at 30CTurn or rotate:rotate every six monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:freeSustainability credentials:foam is CertiPur approved; polyester content is made from recycled ocean bottles; will recycle old mattressDeliveryView image in fullscreenPanda will deliver the mattress to any room of your choice and remove the packaging.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe Panda Hybrid Bamboo was delivered to my door in standard bed-in-a-box manner: it was shrink-wrapped in the factory and then transported in a big cardboard box. Panda’s free shipping service promises more than most rivals, including delivery to any room of your choice and the removal of packaging. I opted to have the box left in my hallway.The Hybrid Bamboo took longer than average to expand to full size after unwrapping. Panda says to wait eight hours before lying on it, but I’d add at least two days to that. If you try sleeping on the mattress any sooner, it will feel soft and uneven, and the chemical “off-gassing” smell is unlikely to help you snooze peacefully.What we loveView image in fullscreen‘We noticed a distinct softening in the upper foam layer as the weeks went by.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianI was too hard on the Panda at first, because it was too hard on me. Along with my family, I found its sleeping surface unforgiving, especially for those of us who are small and sleep on our sides. Six months later, including at least two months of being slept on, the Panda Hybrid Bamboo turned into a much cosier mattress whose growing softness didn’t compromise its supportiveness.I’d initially allocated sleep-testing duties to my dad, Don. He’s fit as a fiddle at 85 but found the Panda to be “hard on my joints”, so Alan and I stepped in for snoozing. We’d previously found our sleeping sweet spot on the firmOtty Original Hybrid, and welcomed the spongy but robust surface of the Panda Hybrid Bamboo. It felt too firm on the first night, but over the first few weeks of March, it yielded just enough for comfort when we slept on our sides, and we slept very well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I didn’t mind this at first, because it felt consistent and natural, unlike the slight central sagging I’d noticed in theSimba Hybrid Pro. Our sleeping bodies made dents in the surface overnight, but it puffed back to flatness within a few hours and offered strong pushback when we lay down.The Hybrid Bamboo’s motion isolation is excellent, perhaps thanks to its high memory foam content. There’s no bounce to this mattress at all, so it does a great job of absorbing the movements of a restless partner – such as my husband and me.Foam can make you overheat at night, since it tends to hold on to the warmth of your sleeping body, but the Panda did well here. It performed above average in my heat-retention tests and felt cosy without making either of us clammy. We tested it in February and June under very different weather conditions, and despite its foamy feel, it didn’t overheat us on the hot summer nights. I also like that its cover claims to be hypoallergenic, because on high pollen days (and nights), I need all the help I can get to curb myhay fever.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreen‘I disliked the way the edge gave way beneath me when I got in and out of bed.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianIt seems odd now that the Panda’s firmness was its biggest initial flaw for my family testing panel. By the end of the two months, it felt too soft for me and my husband to sleep on comfortably, and perfect for my dad. Sorry, Dad, it’s going to charity.The softening of the Hybrid Bamboo’s upper layers is entirely to be expected, but it’s a distinctive quality of memory foam that won’t suit everyone. The spongy sensation can feel like you’re being hugged by a giant marshmallow, with no room for air to move. I also found myself worrying that I wasn’t being supported enough, and that affected my ability to sleep.I disliked the way the edge gave way beneath me when I got in and out of bed. When you sit on the side of the Hybrid Bamboo, it doesn’t really support you at all. There’s a frame of dense memory foam around the mattress’s layers to help maintain its shape, but it just doesn’t seem to have the intended effect.SustainabilityView image in fullscreen‘Panda does its best to limit the environmental impact of its foam.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianPanda’ssustainability effortsare generally good. The bamboo it uses in mattresses and other products is grown organically “without any fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides”, and the polyester in its vaguely described “durability layer” is made from “recycled ocean bottles”. It also uses 100% biodegradable “kraft paper” for its boxes, but there’s no word on the composition of the metres of thick soft plastic used to shrink-wrap the mattress for delivery.Memory foam, made from high-viscosity polyurethane, is not a green material by any stretch. Panda does its best to limit the environmental impact of its foam, includingCertiPurcertification and donating bedding to young people transitioning out of homelessness.The company says it designs its mattresses to last many years to prevent them fromending up in landfill. When I asked Panda for more detail on this “built to last” policy, it told me it randomly selects a few mattresses from its production line every six months for a “rigorous laboratory durability test” in conditions that mimic the moisture fluctuations of a real bed. “These stringent trials go far beyond standard industry checks,” Panda’s Natalie Cannavo told me. “They are integral to our quality assurance process and ensure that our 10-year guarantee is backed by evidence.”In keeping with this landfill-avoidance strategy, Panda offers cheaperrecyclingthan its rivals. It also makes its mattresses easier and cheaper to recycle than its rivals. Most mattress companies ask a fair whack to dispose of your mattress responsibly (Origin charges £54, for example), but Panda does it for free if you’re buying a mattress. If you’re not, the service costs £50. Panda will donate your old mattress to charity if it’s too good for recycling. Using this “Circle of Life Initiative” even gets you 20% off your next Panda purchase.Panda Hybrid Bamboo: should I buy it?View image in fullscreen‘A good choice if balmy nights drive you barmy.’Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe Panda Hybrid Bamboo is a mid-price, mid-softness hybrid mattress whose cushioned surface provides good pressure relief for side sleepers and anyone who loves a cosy bed. Its springs are much less noticeable than its memory foam, which absorbs motion brilliantly and softens over time.

Here’s how …Felicity CloakeSun 6 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTSharePublic service announcement: baba ganoush does not require smoked paprika, acidity regulators or indeed any kind of preservative beyond lemon juice. There are some dips I will happily buy – tzatziki, taramasalata, evenhummus,with due caution– but tubs of this smoky Middle Eastern aubergine dish always seem to be slimy and underpowered in comparison with the real freshly made deal.Prep15 minDrain30 minCook40 minServes2-42 large aubergines(about 650g)2 tbsp tahiniJuice of 1 lemon, plus a little extra to finish2 garlic cloves, peeled1 small bunch mint, or flat-leaf parsley, leaves pickedSalt, to taste1 tbsp pomegranate seeds(optional)2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 Griddle, barbecue, grill or roast?The key here is to blacken the aubergines over a high heat until the skin chars and the flesh roasts. The easiest and best way to do this is on a barbecue, but if you have a gas hob, you can also do it on there. Alternatively, use an overhead grill or hot oven, but doing so means you’ll miss out on some of that gorgeously smoky flavour.View image in fullscreen2 Prick and grill …Whichever approach you choose, prick the aubergines all over with a fork, so steam can escape while they’re charring. If using a barbecue, put them on a lightly greased grill over a high heat and keep an eye on them, turning until the skin is papery and burnt, and the flesh has collapsed. Do the same if using an overhead grill.3 … or cook on the hobIf you’re using a gas hob, put the aubergines directly on the flame, turning as required. If the aubergines are very wide, you can finish cooking them through in a hot oven – 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 – or bake them from scratch at the same temperature for about 40 minutes. If you have a blowtorch, it’s an idea to scorch them first.View image in fullscreen4 Remove the fleshSlit open the aubergines lengthways, then scoop out the long strands of soft flesh from the inside; discard the skins. Put the flesh in a sieve and, ideally, leave it to drain over the sink or a bowl for about 30 minutes, because that will give you a chunkier, more full-flavoured result. Alternatively, squeeze the flesh over the sieve to get rid of excess water.5 Now mix the flavouringsView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, put the tahini in a medium bowl (if it’s separated in the jar, which is absolutely normal, give it a good stir to reincorporate the oil first) and stir in the lemon juice; the mix will seize when you first add it, but keep stirring and it will soon loosen up.6 Add the garlic and herbsView image in fullscreenPuree the garlic (with a crusher, mortar or heavy knife) and add to the tahini mix. Strip the mint leaves from the stems (or trim the coarser stalks from flat-leaf parsley), then roughly chop until you have about three tablespoons’ worth. Stir two-thirds of the herbs into the tahini mixture, and save the rest as garnish.7 Mix in the aubergine fleshView image in fullscreenMash the drained aubergine strands gently with a fork, just to break up the long strands and make it easier to scoop up and eat without the need for a knife. Season with a little salt, then stir into the tahini mixture. Taste and adjust for salt or lemon juice, if it needs it.8 Plate and garnishView image in fullscreenTransfer to a serving bowl, if necessary, then top with the remaining herbs and a scattering of pomegranate seeds (though definitely not required, they do look very pretty. Alternatively, add a little grated lemon zest or some chilli flakes for a dash of extra colour – up to you).9 Dress with oil and servePour a moat of oil around the edge of the baba ganoush, then serve with warm flatbreads and other assorted meze, or with grilled meat. If you’re not eating it immediately, cover and keep at room temperature for a few hours, or in the fridge (minus the garnish, which should be added fresh) for up to three days. Bring back to room temperature before serving.Explore more on these topicsStarterFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodVegetablesSide dishesMiddle Eastern food and drinkBarbecuefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take thecave à mangerMarjorie’s in Soho, a brand new, Parisian-inspired wine bar serving small plates in London W1. “Oh God,” I said on learning that its proprietors are Michael Searle and Josh Anderson. “Never heard of ’em.” Sorry to quibble, especially seeing as this seems to be their first hospitality venture, and I am well aware that eating out for a living is a huge jolly, but eating in wine bars? Well, I amnota fan: too noisy, too boisterous, too give-me-my-bloody-dinner generally – not to mention too many drunken elbows in yourtoastie de fromagewhile a sommelier bores on about beaujolais nouveau. Also, Marjorie’s is alarmingly close to Carnaby Street, the natural habitat of the disappointed diner.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So I set off down Foubert’s Place, muttering to myself that at least I’m not heading for the nearbyKingly Court food hubthat brims with dining options, each of them more impersonal and oversubscribed than the next. Back in the noughties, Carnaby Street still gave a slight nod to its Swinging Sixties roots, with a few remaining independent shops selling goth gear, pantaloons and bongs. Today, however, it is a shiny row of sleek international flagship stores, with the wondrous, olde worldeLibertyat one end, clinging on for dear life, the poor love, before she is inevitably turned into aLululemon.View image in fullscreen‘Outstanding’: Marjorie’s brie de Meaux with beans and apricots.Anyway, it turns out that it is for all these reasons that we should actually be grateful for Marjorie’s, because, yet again and with no fear of this letting up any time soon, it also turns out that I am an absolute idiot. Marjorie’s may look like a wine bar, but Searle and Anderson have opened something tiny, brave, bespoke and appealingly odd. Oh, and delicious, too, because the duo have temptedGiacomo Peretti, formerly ofLe Gavroche, to cook for them. He has also worked at the crowdpleaserTemper, the wholly underratedFirebirdand the dependably brilliantthe Culpeper, and if you head down to the basement, where there are more tables, you’ll be able to watch him weave his magic.Snaring Peretti to do wine bar snacks and letting his imagination fly is a stroke of genius, because now you have a brilliant chef serving gooey chicken liver “rocher” – think rich, nutty, nibblable savoury Ferrero Rocher – pretty little yummy crab tartelettes made all the merrier by the addition of kumquat and a delicate and rather bizarre lamb tartare dotted with spring vegetables, goat’s cheese and a tiny fresh strawberry. Surprise! This is actually, and quite unexpectedly, a restaurant with serious food; in fact, it might well be the most earnest, accomplished, imaginative food being served in this square mile right now.View image in fullscreen‘Well worth the risk’: Marjorie’s bavette with an egg yolk emulsion is just one of several unexpected larger plates.Yes, you could play safe, grab a space at the long bar upstairs, order from the exclusively French wine list and feast only on a selection ofLa Fromageriecheese and rusticpainserved with a shedload of salted French butter, perhaps with some saucisson with cornichons on the side. But don’t do that: Peretti’s larger and admittedly stranger-sounding dishes are well worth the risk. There’s a bowl of escargots with seaweed in a silky pinewood cream and a soft, delicate salad of good, mixed green leaves with a sweet, citrussy, orange blossom vinaigrette. Original, perhaps offputting to some, but truly, madly good.Two other standouts were a stinky, slightly warm piece of runny brie de Meaux served with lush fresh apricot – outstanding – and some proper French soul food: poached chicken on white rice made decadent with brown butter. This was a rhapsody of classy, beige carbs, and I scraped at the bowl like a sad labrador released from her kibble diet. Slices of tempura courgette, almost like cigars to look at, came dotted with trout roe androuille, and were equally weird and wonderful.The dessert list offered amillefeuillewithcrème diplomateand strawberries, but my eyes had already been greedily drawn to a warm, frothy, olive oil-strewn bowl of fresh chocolate mousse topped with crunchy hazelnuts. Again, this was just heavenly.View image in fullscreen‘Just heavenly’: Marjorie’s hot chocolate mousse topped with hazelnuts and olive oil.As a non-drinker, I spend little time in wine bars these days – after all, as the old saying goes: “If you stay in the barber’s long enough, you’ll probably end up with a haircut” – but for Marjorie’s I’m making an exception. Service is prompt, the menu intriguing and there’s a sense that you’re in on a secret that no one else knows about. Go for the vin, the gossip, a bowl of nocellara olives and some great baguette; stay for a dinner that’s currently one of the best in London.

Guests included the actor Naomi Watts and, fresh from 18 months of South Korean military service, Kim Taehyung, from the K-pop band BTS, who attempted to shelter from the rain under a giant silkfoulardthat had been erected above a courtyard.It was a full-circle moment for Rider, an American designer who previously worked under Phoebe Philo during her tenure at the brand from 2008 to 2017.View image in fullscreenCeline spring 2026 collection.Photograph: Photo: Fior/Dragone/Gorunway.comWhile fans of her work, known as “Philophiles”, had hoped Rider would reinstate that era of louche tailoring and minimalism, his opening looks quickly curtailed such expectations.Instead of oversized silhouettes, there was a series of skinny jeans and even skinner trousers, hugging calves so tightly they should have come with a circulation warning.These lean silhouettes were a nod to his predecessor, Slimane, who honed his signature sharp-edged style during his stints at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme before introducing it toCeline.Despite initial criticism, Slimane proved lucrative for Celine’s parent company LVMH. According to analysts, he was estimated to have doubled Celine’s annual sales to €2.5bn (£2.1bn), transforming it into LVMH’s third-largest brand, behind Louis Vuitton and Dior. However, in October, he resigned amid rumours of failed contract negotiations.It’s now up to Rider to pick up that moneyed baton.Rider’s appointment comes at a difficult time in the fashion industry, with a significant slowdown across luxury markets (for the first quarter of 2025, LVMH reported a 4% sales drop across fashion and leather goods).At the annual general meeting in April 2024, LVMH’s chief executive,Bernard Arnault, said: “Celine is chic, hip, sexy fashion for young people even if the prices are what they are, and it works.”Rather than wiping the slate clean during this period of uncertainty, it appears that Rider is set on evolving on the brand’s existing tried and tested formula.Speaking backstage after the show, Rider said he “did not want there to be a sense of erasure”, adding that “there was a foundation to build on. That to me felt modern, it felt ethical, it felt strong.”Rider balanced this homage to the past by intertwining it with his own fashion story. There were nods to his American roots and recent stint as design director of Polo Ralph Lauren, with punchy, coloured knitted V-neck jumpers, neat Oxford shirts and striped ties. Simple evening looks in black including an off-the-shoulder dress and satin-lapelled blazers seemed to subtly recall his previous time at Celine.Accessories, which are easier for luxury brands to shift than a £5k coat, were a focus. Models’ fingers came covered in multiple gold and primary coloured rings. Chunky bangles were stacked on forearms. Giant chain link necklaces were mishmashed. Keyrings jingled with everything from dice to miniature Eiffel Towers.Rider said he wanted to inject an element of fun. “I would never want to be perceived as cynical. Having a sense of humour in the luxury space is a beautiful thing,” he said.Bags ranging from colossal woven baskets and enormous leather totes to dainty pouches were emblazoned with logos ranging from a simple C to a “Triomphe” monogram, first created by the house’s founder Céline Vipiana in 1971.Rider said he was drawn to a logo’s fluid nature. “They can move from something really tasteful to quickly something that is very different from that. They can be many things.”Explore more on these topicsFashionCelineFranceHedi SlimaneBernard ArnaultEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In others it’s walking along the prom. The fashionable ones push gastronomy, drink, street art, culture. Others stick to arcades, funfairs, kids’ stuff. Llandudno delivers all of these and a bit more besides – and it does so unpretentiously, warmly and ever so slightly Welshly.My introduction came in the 1980s, when we – my Lancashire family, or rather, families, as my divorced mum and dad took us separately to Wales – descended from our chalet or static above Abergele and hit Llandudno high street. There, I was bought my first serious football kit – Wales away, yellow with green and red upside down Js. The “shops were better” in Llandudno. They still are, with the main drag, Mostyn Street, boasting chains and independents, Victorian arcades and Clare’s department store – still going after almost a century.Llandudno was always busy, fun, a little bit upmarket. Perhaps an innate confidence has helped it fare better than other north Wales seaside towns. When I went last year, there were coach parties from Manchester and South Yorkshire. Locals – lots of them “expats” from England – were sunning themselves on benches. It was May, but sweltering, and the ice-cream vendors were scooping frantically, the chippies turning out endless trays of cod and chips. At the end of the pier there’s a pub – a great idea – and the alfresco benches were all taken.View image in fullscreenGreat Orme can be reached by a funicular tramway opened in 1902.Photograph: AlamyThe prom along the main beach, known as the North Shore, is a sweeping beauty of wedding-cake terraces, with a wide walking and cycling path running for almost two miles, shelters to use as shades or suntraps, a paddling pool and an Alice in Wonderlandart trail(the real Alice holidayed here).Dylan’s Restaurantis installed inside the former Washington hotel, a stunning corner building by prominent local architect Arthur Hewitt – also responsible for Llandudno’s Winter Gardens and Savoy and Palladium cinemas; the latter survives as a pub.Llandudno is framed by two limestone headlands – the Little Orme and Great Orme – at either end of town. The latter,mined in prehistoric timesfor copper and other ores, has acable-hauled tramwayand Kashmiri goats thatbecame famous in 2020during the pandemic, when they came down to the town centre looking for company, and hedges to eat. You can see the Isle of Man, Blackpool Tower and the Cumbrian fells from the top.Llandudno has been declared the daffodil capital, startup capital and fish and chip capital of north Wales. But no one disputes its status as the queen of Welsh resortsWest Shore, below the Great Orme, is backed by dunes and feels a lot more natural. It has lovely sunsets and lively winds, drawing kite-flyers and kite-surfers.Walking around town, which has sloping streets and narrow nooks to get lost in, you often catch sight of the rocky summits of Eryri (Snowdonia). I don’t know any other major resort in the UK that’s so close to serious hillwalking territory.Over the years, Llandudno has been declared the daffodil capital, startup capital and fish and chip capital of north Wales. At the top end of the A470 – the Welsh Route 66, which starts in Cardiff – it is arguably the region’s main urban centre, though Wrexham might have a thing or two to say about that. No one, though, disputes Llandudno’s status as the queen of Welsh resorts.View image in fullscreenLlandudno’s sand dune-lined West Shore.Photograph: John Davidson Photos/AlamyOne evening, during my visit last year, a sea fret descended on Llandudno Bay. I was walking along the prom from the pier towards Craig-y-Don – a sometime suburb long ago subsumed by Llandudno – and the Little Orme. Joggers and scooter riders appeared like wraiths out of the dense murk. The Alice in Wonderland statues looked spooky and out of place. The terraces looked grey and ghostly in the dimness. Suddenly, as I progressed east, the mist beat a complete retreat, warm sunlight pervading like an epiphany. Llandudno looked utterly beautiful, as if reborn, or at least rediscovered.Part of this was no doubt childhood memories flooding back. But it was also a sense of being genuinely taken aback. Llandudno is a major town and a resort, a place to live as well as to holiday, a Welsh location that has always welcomed outsiders, and an urban centre with wild edges. It has endured by maintaining traditions and keeping up. I think it’s special, a little bit magical.Where to stay:St George’sis a well-preserved seafront hotel dating from the Victorian era, with a great restaurant. Doublesfrom £114, B&BChris MossFolkestone, KentView image in fullscreenFolkestone has gained fresh appeal through its new Creative Quarter.Photograph: stockinasia/Getty ImagesWhen I cycle down Folkestone’s Earls Avenue, I can see the sea before I reach the end of the street. I turn left on to the clifftop promenade, the Leas, and the view across the Channel is suddenly expansive. This mile-long stretch is lined with Edwardian and Georgian hotels and modern apartments, in a spectrum that runs from faded to grandeur. Works in progress include another apartment complex and a 1930s toilet block being repurposed into a cafe. I have a drone’s-eye view of the curve of new-build apartments on the beach, but prefer to look across the water, where the stubby silhouette of Dungeness power station appears and disappears with the visibility.To swim, I can head down to Mermaid Beach, with its easy incline into the water. The Zig Zag Path is the way to get there (at least until the funicular Leas Lift is restored in 2026). The convincing grottos of this 1920s path were hewn from Pulhamite: fake rock with genuine charm, which still fools casual visitors.At the Harbour Arm, quirky food and drinks vendors have repurposed train carriages, shipping containers and even the lighthouseWell-heeled Edwardians once paraded on the Leas, and it’s cited as evidence of Folkestone’s glory days that Edward VII frequented the Grand hotel. Our French neighbours once thought Folkestone a prestigious holiday destination, as did many English. Booming summer seasons may have departed with budget flights, but the past two decades have delivered newsworthy regeneration. The logic of theCreative Folkestonefoundation – one of the ways through which philanthropist Roger De Haan has pumped tens of millions of pounds into the local economy – has been to make Folkestone a great place to live and work, on the basis that visitors will follow.The Grand is now private residences, and was crowned in 2014 with a Yoko Ono morse code artwork. There are several subtle contemporary artworks on the Leas, and tens more throughout the town and on its beaches – from an Antony Gormley statue gazing out to sea, to Lubaina Himid’sJelly Mould Pavilionon the boardwalk. These are the legacy of theFolkestone Triennial, Creative Folkestone’s flagship project since 2008. The open-air exhibition, which returns for summer 2025 (19 July-19 October), has helped transform the town’s fortunes, assisted by a game-changing high-speed rail link to London. To live here is to encounter art, gently and often. The one time I lost my children for a significant length of time, they turned out to be investigating a Mark Wallinger piece.View image in fullscreenOne of Antony Gormley’s figures gazes out from Folkestone Pier.Photograph: Sopa Images/GettyIn recent years, visitor numbers have risen, as have (thornier subject) house prices. In part, that’s down to the buzz of theHarbour Arm, where quirky food and drinks vendors have repurposed train carriages, shipping containers and even the lighthouse. I favourSail Box, on the very tip of the arm, for the scale of its sea view and pancake stacks. In town, the subsidisedCreative Quartersees independent businesses spill down theOld High Street– where Steep Street coffee offers a Parisian-inspired books-and-cakes combo – to the artists’ studios on Tontine Street.Folkestone has so many things it didn’t have 10 years ago: the world’s first multistorey skatepark; a New York Highline-inspired garden walkway, leading to the revitalised Harbour Arm; an annualPride, and LGBTQ+ bookshop; mini golf on the beach. A Labour MP. And, as of spring 2025, a Reform-led council. So, we’ve still got range.One of my favourite things is not new, it’s simply to linger on the beach whenever seals or porpoises are in the water. One Sunday, a pod of dolphins splashed about for 30 minutes in view of where I sat with friends and kids, beach-bar drinks in hand. It’s really hard to beat Folkestone on a hot day, with dolphins.Where to stay:overlooking the harbour a short walk from town, theLondonand ParisHotelhas 11 pretty rooms, doubles from £175, room onlySophy GrimshawScarborough, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenScarborough is in line for £20m from the government to fund regeneration.Photograph: curved-light/AlamyScarborough residents refer to visitors as “comforts”, because they have usually “Come for t’ day”, rather than the week, as was once the seaside norm. The negative shift helps explain why Scarborough will receive £20m from the government’s Plan for Neighbourhoods, to fund significant regeneration over the next decade.The plan is designed for “left-behind” communities. If Scarborough is left behind, it is also majestic, what with the great sweep of the two bays, divided by the verdant castle headland. Most of its main attractions – which tend to be commensurately large-scale – are unaffected by the current regeneration, since the town has been quietly maintaining them for decades, even centuries.View image in fullscreenScarborough’s spa is among its oldest attractions.Photograph: Martin Williams/AlamyTake the place where it all began, not only Scarborough tourism but seaside holidays in general.Scarborough Spastands adjacent to a spring, whose salty waters oozing from the base of a cliff were promoted as therapeutic in the early 17th century. The gentry came to drink them, along with other things. “Health is the pretence, dissipation is the end,” wrote one 18th-century visitor, and the spa was the focus of the jollity. A storm destroyed the first spa in 1836. Its replacement burned down in 1876, the present baroque palace arising three years later. Whereas the spa was once associated with dinner-jacketed palm court orchestras, a more characteristic modern bill-topper would be Tony Skingle (who “IS” Elvis). But the vision is consistent: a night out is improved by the proximity of the sea.Similar doggedness is evident in the history of the nearby South Cliff Lift, opened in 1875. Back then, the power was hydraulic. Today, the system is fully automatic, but the cars are still made of wood, one descending as the other ascends, like floating garden sheds.If Scarborough is left behind, it is also majestic with the great sweep of the two baysThey carry passengers up through the near-verticalSouth Cliff Gardens, recently refurbished and underpinned. Subdivisions include the genteel Rose Garden, which was created in 1883 and has been carefully tended ever since (it’s not easy to grow roses by the sea), including a major restoration in 2015.On the North Bay,Peasholm Parkwas opened in 1912, with an oriental theme, which (this being Scarborough) meant an Oriental Garden surmounted by a pagoda and surrounded by a fairy-lit boating lake. Such playfulness did not suit the brash 1970s, and the park went to seed, but a programme of renewal brought a Grade II listing in 1999. The narrow-gaugeNorth Bay Railwayalso runs through gardens, and has done since 1931, skirting theOpen Air Theatre, which closed in 1986 but was triumphantly relaunched in 2010.View image in fullscreenPeasholm Park has an oriental theme.Photograph: Paul Heaton/AlamyNow, let us return to the South Bay and the harbour, where the white lighthouse has stood like a cake decoration since 1806. Well, more or less. The original was destroyed by the German bombardment of 1914, its replacement erected in 1931. The harbour is attractively gritty: at low water, the pleasure boats are slumped in the mud. The kids with their crab lines seem to be emulating the adult fishers, who operate around the Victorian buildings of the West Pier.The current regenerationdoesinclude the West Pier, where a hoarding announces plans for a multimillion-pound refurbishment, “improving amenities for local people and visitors”. But when you ask the local people about this, you encounter eye rolls and dark muttering.

The coastal suburb of Edinburgh is only a 30-minute bus ride from the city centre, but “Porty” has its own identity, distinct from the capital.“I loved growing up here,” says Michael Pedersen, Edinburgh’s makar (poet laureate). “I loved the sea. I loved the arcade. I loved Arthur’s Seat looming in the background like a behemoth bull seal about to enter a brawl. But it didn’t feel like you were in a trendy, chic epicentre of a place. It felt like you were on the outskirts, trying to claw your way back in.”It is not nostalgia that draws people to ‘Porty’ today. It is the rebellious flair of the community and what they’ve createdThe neon storm ofNobles– a battlement-themed penny arcade on the promenade – offers a portal to Porty’s past. Portobello was incorporated into Edinburgh in 1896, when it was one of Scotland’s most popular seaside resorts. Cheap tram and train access brought the masses in from Edinburgh and Glasgow, and an open-air pool and pleasure pier awaited them. Both of those attractions are long gone – the rise of package holidays ending the boom – but the Victorian swimming baths (and Edinburgh’s only Turkish baths) remain, council-run. As I backstroke under bunting strung across the pool, the sun shines through the glass roof, illuminating the columns and gallery.It is not nostalgia that draws people to Porty today, though. It is – as well as veggie eateries such asGo Go Beetsand speciality coffee spotTanifiki– the rebellious flair of the community and what they’ve created. In 2017, for example, a Georgian church in town was due to be sold off. Luxury flats beckoned, but local campaign groupAction Portyintervened and led a rare urban community buyout. It’s nowBellfield– home to a community cafe, art classes and ceilidhs.“When we moved here in the 1990s, Portobello was very down-at-heel,” says Justin Kenrick, chair of Action Porty, as we stroll the promenade. “Newspapers called it dangerous. What we’re trying to fight off now is the place turning into one big holiday let. If there’s no community, there’s no point.”Thetown hallwas also saved by the community. It hosts regular events, such asPorty Pride’s annual ball, top Scottish comedians and sold-out showcases from Edinburgh’sDiscovery Wrestling.View image in fullscreenCiverinos pizzeria, on the Portobello waterfront, is a local institutionThe main draw for many visitors isThe Portobello Bookshop, a beloved indie with Corinthian columns. “You see people really warming to anything anybody does that is enhancing the community,” owner Jack Clark tells me. Their exceptional events programme has brought in authors from Eimear McBride to Zadie Smith. Pedersen packed out the bookshop in May to launch his debut novelMuckle Flugga, glimmers of which were inspired by his home town.Pedersen has seen the Portobello skyline demolished and rebuilt since his childhood. “It’s so important, as independent businesses get successful and the area becomes more affluent, to invest in community groups,” the poet says. “The fact that there are these buildings coming back into community leases and hands retains a lot of the integrity of the area.“I love Portobello in all its foibles and flaws; all its chintzy glamour; all its new-wave chicness.”Walk along the promenade, looking across the Firth of Forth to Fife, and it’s easy to see why.Where to stay:StravenGuesthouseis a traditional, family-run place close to the promenade, doubles from £107, B&B (minimum two nights)Stuart KennyExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysBeach holidaysFamily holidaysShort breaksDay tripsWales holidaysScotland holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Busy lives can leave us feeling exhausted, while increasing responsibilities leave little room for more intrepid pursuits.But maintaining an adventurous perspective is one of the best ways to keep life exciting. With this in mind, we asked readers to share their tips for reigniting a sense of adventure. Here are 10 of the best suggestions:‘I’ve tried a flotation tank, tarot, axe-throwing …’View image in fullscreen‘This year has felt longer, in a good way’ … Becky Colley.This year I made a resolution to do at least one new thing every month. So far I’ve tried a flotation tank, tarot, reiki and axe-throwing, and appeared on a podcast. And I am going to an over-30s day rave. Acupuncture, a sound bath and reformer pilates are also on the list. I’ve heard that, when you’re a child, one reason time feels slower is the abundance of new experiences. This year has definitely felt longer to me – in a good way. I’ve made more of it and had fun trying things I otherwise might never have gotten around to.Becky Colley, UX design consultant, Manchester‘Challenge yourself when you start to feel grouchy’Wake up curious about the world. Avoid the grumpy vortex at all costs and challenge yourself when you start to feel grouchy. Be open to learning. Keep reviewing your life’s balance … do you have the right amount of social activity, charity work, fitness and flexibility? If not, make a plan to be a more balanced and content person, ensuring you still have enough energy for the adventure.Em Elphick, former police officer, Oxford‘Nothing builds confidence like going into the wilderness for a week’View image in fullscreen‘I wish I’d done this back in my 20s.’My wife and I began backpacking a few years ago, in our 50s. I was a Boy Scout in the 70s, so I had backpacked many times when I was young, but never as an adult. It’s such an easy, cost-effective way to spend your vacation time – plus it’s healthy and rewarding. The upfront cost of purchasing quality lightweight gear can be steep, but once you’ve got your kit, the only expenses are the cost to travel to your hiking destination, your backpacking meals and stove fuel. We both thru-hiked the entire Appalachian Trail, plus numerous other trails closer to home. There is nothing that builds confidence like going into the wilderness for a week and surviving with only the items you’re carrying in your pack. I highly recommend that young people take up backpacking so they can see the natural world while still physically able. I wish I had done so back in my 20s.‘Jedi’, New York‘Try to get out of your comfort zone every day’Adventure does not have to be grand or ostentatious. You can adventure daily – as long as you are having fun, getting out of your comfort zone and being present in the moment. My recent adventures upon retirement have included: taking an improv acting class; joining an adult softball league; substitute teaching (never a dull moment!) and starting my own business.Virginia Leoni, retired teacher, Oregon‘Waking to see the sun rise in another country is magical’View image in fullscreen‘There is so much learned along the way’ … Hannah Stanton.I stopped flying in 2019 because of the climate crisis and, with my husband and two children (aged 11 and eight), have found a new sense of adventure in slow travel to Europe. Being rocked to sleep in a bunk aboard a clanking train and waking to see the sun rise in another country is magical. There is so much learned along the way: how to navigate train timetables, what to do when things go wrong, the idiosyncrasies of different cultures. Train travel to far-flung destinations is more difficult than flying – and all the more rewarding for it. Our children embrace the challenge so much more enthusiastically than we would have predicted.Hannah Stanton, school streets officer, Manchester‘Swimming in the sea has changed my life’View image in fullscreen‘For years, I had this recurring dream about floating in really cold water.’Photograph: Gary Yeowell/GettyGet in the sea! I grew up near the coast, always loved swimming as a kid. Then life got in the way: I discovered partying and struggled to hold down jobs and responsibilities. For years, I had a recurring dream about floating in really cold water and feeling so calm and at ease. I realised I needed to swim again – but since I find the noise and smells and people in swimming pools hard to cope with, I tried the sea. Now I’m addicted to it. My husband, Paul, and I moved to the coast last year, partly because of my desire to be in the sea. It has changed my life.Claire Dearden, Northumberland‘Spending time with people of all ages gives you a different perspective’View image in fullscreenKymon Hill and his son in New Zealand.Make time for people of all ages. If you only hang out with people around your age, you all have a similar worldview. Being around different generations gives you a different perspective – and this keeps your sense of adventure alive. It’s easy to slip into a routine – but then you blink and you’ve gone two years without doing anything out of the ordinary. Recently, my youngest wanted to go up a mountain to see the snow. I wasn’t keen but was so glad I made the effort.Kymon Hill, managing director of a catering company, New Plymouth, New Zealand‘Go on an inner adventure’View image in fullscreenQuilley Powers, retired social worker.Around menopause I moved toward what I call “inner adventure”. I really began to meditate with discipline and purpose. I went on long silent retreats, exploring breathwork and other techniques. At first, I still did lots of travelling and music events. Now, the inner explorations are far more exciting and have brought me to a level of contentment and happiness I never would have even imagined.Quilley Powers, retired social worker, paralegal and meditation retreat manager, California, US‘You don’t need to go all in’View image in fullscreen‘A new experience in my 50s made the rest of the world dissipate for a few perfect moments’ … Duff Armour.You don’t need to go all out to experience adventure. Images of surfers riding overhead waves or skiers funnelling through couloirs can be inspiring – but also intimidating. I took a surf lesson on waves that were all of shin-high, not expecting much, but the sheer thrill of it was on par with my best skiing days in St Anton. I looked terrible, and probably got a few laughs, but being lost in a new experience in my 50s made the rest of the world dissipate for a few perfect moments. Isn’t that what we’re all really seeking in adventure?Duff Armour, artist, Quebec‘I’ve turned every bike ride into an adventure’View image in fullscreen‘My outlook on life has improved’ … David Cross.When I retired at 60, my wife, Lynne, bought me a good-quality, mid-priced off-road bike. Every ride has become an adventure and I do it whenever I can – mostly alone, but occasionally with friends or family, and once a week with a group. As my wife rarely cycles, I use my cycle routes to plot walks we can do together. My outlook on life has improved, and I am getting plenty of exercise and fresh air, as well as meeting new people. Occasionally I come to a dead end, but more often than not I discover a new trail that I add to my ever-expanding library of adventures.David Cross, retired IT manager, BuckinghamshireExplore more on these topicsLife and styleHappinessHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Was he wrongly convicted?In a case full of surprising scenarios, the time and place of the murder were never established, and Nunn was found guilty despite a lack of forensic evidence. He is still maintaining his innocence, but will he ever be freed?Simon HattenstoneSun 6 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 04.10 EDTShareAfter the murder of his ex-girlfriend Dawn Walker, in 2005, Kevin Nunn insists he toldSuffolkpolice everything. Of course he did, he says – he was desperate to help them track down her killer. He explained how they had split up two days before she was found, how he had gone to her home after she had left a distraught voicemailon his phone and not turned up to work, how he had let himself in with a key she didn’t know he had, and how he went looking for her along their favourite walking routes by the River Lark, north of Bury St Edmunds. He then handed over the pair of boots he had worn when searching for her.The body of Walker, 37, was discovered close to where Nunn said he had looked for her. Not surprisingly, his footprints were also found. Six weeks after she went missing, he was charged with her murder. Nunn, 64, who has spent 20 years in prison, says telling the truth was the worst thing he could have done. He believes he unwittingly provided the police with everything they needed to build a case against him – the motive, the map and the circumstantial evidence that led to him being convicted of murder.View image in fullscreenKevin Nunn before his conviction.Composite: Guardian Design;  Mimi Mollica; Courtesy of Brigitte Butcher; Getty Images“It’s hard to look back at how naive I was,” he told me recently in a letter sent from his prison in East Anglia. “But when you’ve got nothing to hide and you’re innocent and you trust the police, you’re going to be open and honest. I had nothing to hide because I wasn’t involved in Dawn’s murder directly or indirectly. I didn’t see myself as a suspect, I saw myself as someone helping the police, and I think that’s the most foolish thing I ever did, in hindsight.” If he could have his time over again, he says, he would have hidden the boots or said he had worn other footwear – not because he would want to deceive the police, but because he thinks it might have protected him from being wrongfully convicted.Nunn grew up on a council estate in Bury St Edmunds. He was born prematurely, weighing less than 3lbs (1.35kg). “He was my little brother in every sense. He was so much smaller than the other boys at school,” says his sister, Brigitte Butcher, a former nurse with an easy warmth. She has always looked out for him in one way or another, and has campaigned for him ever since his conviction.Their father was a lorry driver, their mother a shop assistant who had come over from Cork, Ireland, at the age of 15. She had grown up in poverty and had high hopes of a better future for her children. “Mum always thought we were better than everybody, and in the end I think we believed it,” Butcher told me in 2013, when I first wrote about Nunn with the Guardian’s prisons correspondent, Eric Allison, who died in 2022. In 2013, Nunn had been in prison for eight years, and he seemed an unlikely killer. He had never been in trouble with the police, and had no history of violence.Nunn left school at 16, got a job as a gas welding equipment salesman, stuck at it and did reasonably well for himself. He worked hard, played golf and enjoyed nice holidays when he could afford them. “He was just my run-of-the-mill, slightly boring brother Kevin,” Butcher said at the time.In 2005, Nunn, who was divorced with two children, had been going out with Walker for about two years. It was an on-off relationship, and just before she was murdered it appeared to be off for the final time. They realised it wasn’t working out, and she admitted to him that she was thinking about returning to a former boyfriend. They had split amicably before, and, he says, they now did so again.On 3 February 2005, the morning after they split up, Walker’s employer called Nunn, her emergency contact, to say she had not turned up for work. Nunn has always claimed he had already planned to go round to her house because of the distressed voicemail, but this now made it an emergency. He knocked on the door, and when there was no answer he used the key he still had to enter her home. There was no sign of her. Later that day, Nunn says he went looking for her around the spots where they often went for walks. If she was still upset, he suggested, perhaps she was walking it off. He reported her as a missing person to the police the next day.A few hours later, at about 5pm on 4 February 2005, Walker was discovered by the River Lark, barely a mile from where Butcher and Nunn grew up. Her hair had been shaved off, her body had been set alight with petrol and she had been dumped naked from the waist down. The cause of death was never identified.View image in fullscreenDawn Walker.Photograph: Chris Ison/PAA week before the trial began, in October 2006, it was disclosed to the defence that semen, containing a small amount of sperm, had been found on Walker’s thighs and pubic bone. When Nunn was told this, he did not realise its significance, but his sister did. Nunn had undergone a vasectomy, which meant he could produce semen but not sperm. He was tested and, sure enough, no sperm was produced. Butcher had always been convinced that her brother would be cleared, and now she believed he had to be. But he wasn’t.In a story full of surprising scenarios, perhaps the most surprising was proposed by the prosecution. Although there was no evidence of Walker having had sex just before being killed, they insisted the sperm was unconnected to her murder, and had been picked up by a “secondary transfer”. She had been at the gym of the Suffolk golf club with Nunn on the evening the couple split up, and the women’s changing rooms were being decorated. It was suggested by the prosecution that Walker had used the men’s changing rooms and that the sperm was either the result of Walker sitting on a bench or a gym towel freshly stained with sperm. The forensics expert for the prosecution, Helen Hawarth, agreed this was a possibility, but conceded it was unlikely. The defence suggested a more likely starting point was that Walker’s killer had masturbated over her body, pointing out that the crime had the appearance of a sexual attack, as she had been left with her vagina exposed and a reed found in her anal passage.Butcher has always found the prosecution’s argument hard to countenance. “This is a respectable golf club and it’s an open changing room. I’m sure men don’t come in masturbating after their shower with everyone coming and going. It’s just not happening, is it? This is where she supposedly sat on the bench with this huge gush of sperm that washed up on her leg. Absurd. Are they saying she sat on it and it all splashed up? Is that how much there was there? But according to Helen Hawarth, there was only a small sample. They can’t have it both ways, can they? It’s farcical.”As far as Nunn is concerned, the investigation and trial were profoundly flawed. Ten days after the main witness for the prosecution, a neighbour who lived in the same close as Walker, had told the police she had seen nothing, she went to the police and changed her story. She said that she had heard people arguing in the street between 10 and 10.30pmon Wednesday 2 February and that they sounded like teenagers, although she wasn’t sufficiently worried to check. The prosecution argued that it was, in fact, Nunn and Walker arguing. (Another neighbour said he had seen a man arguing with Walker at her front door at about the same time.)The main witness said she had driven past Walker’s house two days later at 4.45am, on her way to an early shift at work, and that she had seen two suspicious-looking men struggling to load a large object that could have been a rolled-up carpet or a large laundry bag into the back of a silver estate car. The witness identified one of the men as being Walker’s “boyfriend”, and she later picked out Nunn at an identity parade. At the trial, however, she admitted that she had been asked by the police to pick out Walker’s boyfriend from the lineup. In court, the prosecution argued that the rolled-up carpet or large laundry bag contained the dead Walker. The police and forensics experts found the house undisturbed, with no sign of struggle.What makes the case even stranger is that a man called Nigel Hill was charged alongside Nunn. Hill worked with Walker, was a close friend and former boyfriend, and he drove a silver car. Nunn and Hill have always insisted that they knew of each other but had never met before Walker’s disappearance.Nunn knew Hill was a friend of Walker’s. When he found Walker’s house empty, he contacted Hill, and asked if he knew where Walker was. Hill said he didn’t, and he also turned up at her home. He later told Suffolk police that, like Nunn, he was worried and wanted to know what was going on. The police decided they were partners in crime. For Butcher, this was always a nonsense. “They’d both had a relationship with Dawn, that was their only connection. So what is the narrative? ‘I’ve killed your best friend from work, can you come and help me move the body?’ Was that the storyline? It’s just absurd, isn’t it?”View image in fullscreen‘The last thing my mum said on her deathbed was: you won’t give up fighting for Kev, will you?’ … Brigitte Butcher.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianThe narrative initially put to the prosecution was so elaborate that Nunn says he still struggles to get his head around it: Nunn and Walker had split up on 2 February, he had killed her inan unknown place, brought the body back to the house after visiting her home with Hill on 3 February, and then at 4.50am the next day had removed the body with Hill in a rolled-up carpet or laundry bag and deposited her by the river.Eventually, the prosecution agreed that it was absurd for Hill to be in the dock simply because he owned a silver car and had visited Walker’s home after she went missing. Midway through the trial, charges were dropped against Hill without him having given evidence. Nunn assumed he would be going home, too. After all, if the case against his supposed accomplice had collapsed, surely his would. But it didn’t.There were other improbabilities. Although Nunn was charged with a horrific murder, in January 2006 he was released on bail for 11 months until he was convicted. Throughout the trial, he walked to court from his rented property. “The judge at Ipswich said [to police]: you need more than this to keep him in prison till the trial,” Butcher says. “There were two psychiatrists who assessed Kevin to see if he was safe to be out on bail. Those two psychiatric reports [also] said there were no tendencies to be overly jealous or dangerous. I said to his probation officer: ‘Have you ever known anybody charged with such a terrible murder not to be held in custody?’ He said: ‘No, I have to say I haven’t.’”The various suspects were mainly former boyfriends of Walker’s, all of them local. The main witness was asked about another suspect, who we will call X, a former boyfriend of Walker’s with a conviction for exposing himself to young girls. X (who was also a witness for the prosecution) had boasted to the main witness that he knew how to carry out the perfect murder. Under cross examination, the main witness was asked: “And you agree that you found this particular conversation with him before Dawn Walker’s murder so disconcerting and frightening that it stuck in your mind and you felt you had to tell the police of this extraordinary confession he made to you?” “Yes,” she said. Walker was found at Duck Sluice Farm, close to where X regularly walked his dog. He had told the main witness that to commit the perfect murder he would “put his fingers near the windpipe around the neck so there would be no evidence left behind” and that he would have to “burn the hair to get rid of the DNA”. The witness acknowledged that there was “lots” that was “similar” to the details of Walker’s murder and the perfect murder that X had described to her.The prosecution portrayed Nunn as obsessive, jealous and devious. First there was the key. A few months earlier, the couple had briefly split up. Walker had asked for her house key back and he had made a copy of it. What kind of man secretly gets a key made for his partner’s house and keeps it after they split up? Nunn, who volunteered the information about the key, said that he had never given the key back because they usually got back together within hours, and this time they had only just separated. “It was very poor judgment on my part to get the copy made,” he told me recently. “People judge you on that, and say that’s his character. And it’s just not the case.”Then there was the evidence of another former boyfriend whom Walker was thought to be returning to. He told the jury that she had said Nunn was jealous, giving as an example the time she had left the gym to go for a drink with a fitness trainer and Nunn had followed them. Nunn admitted this was true, and said it had happened shortly after the couple had agreed they were in an exclusive relationship and that he had wanted to know where he stood. He followed her car in his car for a short distance, he said, then they stopped and had a chat. Walker told him she was going for a drink with the trainer and a few others, and asked him if he fancied joining them. Nunn said he declined and, although he’d been miffed, it wasn’t a big deal between them. But the notion of him being possessive was reinforced by Nunn’s ex-wife, who gave evidence for the prosecution. After an acrimonious divorce, she said he had acted as if he had “a kind of ownership” of her.As with many alleged miscarriages of justice, so much depends on the timing of events, and whose version is ultimately believed. In Nunn’s case, the disputed time starts with the CCTV footage at the gym that he and Walker attended the evening they split up. Nunn insisted that he was in bed asleep between 10 and 10.30pm, the time that Walker was alleged to be having an argument with a man on her doorstep. Yet he is shown leaving the gym at 9.30pm, and this was a key factor in the case. However, look at the timing on the car park CCTV, and something doesn’t add up. On an early February evening, footage from before he arrives says the time is 5.30pm but it’s still light, suggesting that the CCTV clock is ahead of the actual time. On the gym log, Walker signs out at 8.15pm.View image in fullscreenA photo on Brigitte Butcher’s phone of herself, aged six, left, and Kevin, aged four.Photograph: Joshua Bright/The GuardianNunn says he and Walker left the gym separately, soon after 8.15pm, and he drove to her house in his gym clothes to discuss their relationship, which seemed to be fizzling out. That’s when they decided to split up, and he says he left Walker’s home soon after 9pm. But the prosecution insisted that he had left the gym at 9.30pm.The CCTV had a disastrous impact. First, it put him in the frame for the row in the street (although the witness said the man was smartly dressed in a suit and coat and Nunn was seen leaving in gym clothes). Second, it undermined his credibility. The jury believed he was a liar. Not only was this a man who had made a copy of a key to his girlfriend’s house and kept it when they split up, but he was also lying about the time he left the gym.Yet he was telling the truth about the time. In the bundle of documents disclosed to the defence was a police statement saying that they didn’t know exactly what time Nunn left, but acknowledging that the CCTV was 70 minutes out of time. Although this point was made by the defence, the jury chose to believe the prosecution.Despite the lack of forensics, despite the unsupported witness evidence, despite his co-defendant’s case being thrown out, Nunn was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in prison.Butcher recalls the jury returning their unanimous verdict, on 20 November 2006, as if it were yesterday. “Dawn’s family were all whooping and shouting, and my dad looked at me and I remember going out and falling on my knees and screaming.” The emotion is still raw. “It’s very dramatic, isn’t it? But I was so shocked. I went to get my dad, then I thought: ‘Oh, where’s Kevin? But they’d taken him down by then.’”The trial judge, Mrs Justice Cox, described Walker as an “outgoing, conscientious and dependable” woman who enjoyed an independent and active lifestyle with many male and female friends. In her sentencing remarks, she said that Nunn had been ‘‘consumed by jealousy” when Walker had told him she wanted to rekindle the relationship with her former partner so “you decided if you couldn’t have her no other man could … Exactly what you did to her when you killed her I don’t know but I have no doubt that you intended to kill her.” Cox said the crime had had a ‘‘devastating effect’’ on Walker’s family, and that an aggravating feature of the case was the way the defence had sought to point the finger of blame for Walker’s death at one of her former boyfriends.Yet so many questions remained unanswered – the unidentifed semen, the apparently discrepant CCTV footage, the time and place of the murder. Cox said it was not known where Nunn had kept Walker’s body after killing her and who had been helping him when he was supposedly seen struggling to put her concealed body into a car.Nunn is due for his first parole hearing in 2028, but he knows he is unlikely to be released then. He has refused to do the rehabilitation courses that are the usual pathway to freedom because he has maintained his innocence. Parole relies on addressing offending behaviour. If he is ever released from prison, he believes it will be because his conviction is quashed rather than because he has served his time.This February, 12 years after I last spoke to Brigitte Butcher, she rang and told me Nunn was still in prison. I was shocked, because the case against him had seemed so full of holes and his conviction so unsafe. I also felt terrible, because I have rarely thought of Nunn in that time. As journalists, we move on to the next story. But there is no moving on for Nunn.There are prisoners I’ve met whom I will never forget. But Nunn isn’t one of them. He is not a charismatic man. Butcher told me as much years ago. Perhaps that’s why his case has not attracted much attention. She fills me in on everything that has happened in the intervening years. Butcher is now in her mid-60s, has retired from nursing and is still fighting for her brother. But Nunn seems no closer to clearing his name. His case has been with theCriminal Cases Review Commission(CCRC), the body that deals with alleged miscarriages of justice, for much of the past 10 years. It rejected his first submission for grounds to appeal in 2019, and has now spent almost two years looking at his second submission without deciding whether to refer the case back to the court of appeal. (Convictions can only be overturned by a panel of judges at the court of appeal.)The CCRC, which was set up in 1997 after a series of prominent miscarriages of justice in the 1970s and 1980s, is under fire. In its early days, able and driven commissioners were appointed on handsome salaries (£93,796 in 2013). Since then, the full-time staff job has been removed and commissioners are now contracted to work 52 days a year at £460 a day. While this may be an attractive shift rate, it amounts to less than £24,000 a year. Not surprisingly, the commission has been unable to find enough commissioners to do the job and has only 10, one short of the statutory minimum.Even with a full complement of commissioners, the CCRC is sloth-like and rarely uses its special investigative powers. Over its lifetime, it has referred an average of only 3% of cases, but that rate has now slipped to less than 2%. While it claims this is because it does its work so well and that only about one in 50 cases have a realistic chance of being quashed by the court of appeal, critics such as the miscarriage of justice charity Appeal say it is because the CCRC acts as a gatekeeper, turning down cases despite their merits because it thinks the court would eventually reject them.In April, the CCRC’s then chief executive,Karen Kneller, and the casework operations director Amanda Pearce appeared before the cross-party justice committee in the House of Commons. They revealed that they only went into work at their Birmingham HQ one or two days every couple of months, had failed to recruit commissioners for more than two years and were nowhere near appointing a new permanent chair to replaceHelen Pitcher, who was forced to resign in January after successive justice secretaries said they had lost confidence in her. Kneller, who has been nicknamed “Karen Invisible” by staff, admitted that she had been rewarded with “additional payments” in the past two years, despite the criticism her organisation has faced, and that she didn’t know what they were for, and hadn’t inquired. This month, Kneller resigned from the CCRC, and Pearce was appointed interim chief executive.Andy Slaughter, the Labour MP for Hammersmith and Chiswick, and chair of the justice committee, did not hide his disgust at the CCRC’s remote working policy. He told Kneller: “Given what’s happened with your chair, the [Andrew] Malkinson case and other matters that have come to light, if I was the chief executive here I’d be in every day. I’d be asking my staff to be there. I’d be working with those staff trying to rebuild the organisation … and that doesn’t seem to have happened at all.” He concluded: “There seems to be a hole at the heart of this organisation,” and questioned whether Kneller and Pearce were the right people to rebuild confidence in the CCRC. On 23 May, the justice committee published adamning reporton the CCRC, and said Kneller’s position was no longer tenable.The Andrew Malkinson case has done the greatest damage to the CCRC’s reputation. WhenMalkinson had his conviction for rape overturnedafter spending 17 years in prison, the finger pointed clearly at the commission. He had twice put in submissions to the CCRC and twice been rejected – the first time in 2006, 17 years before he was cleared – on forensics. It was the CCRC’s job to do the forensics test on his victim, but it refused to do so, citing cost as a primary factor. In the end, it was left to Appeal to carry out the DNA tests that linked the crime to another man. It was a shameful series of failings by the CCRC.By law, the CCRC can refer a case to the court of appeal only if it considers there is a “real possibility” that the conviction or sentence would not be upheld. “That’s a huge problem,” says Jon Robins, the editor of the Justice Gap, an online magazine that investigates unsafe convictions. “A quick fix to boost confidence in the commission is to scrap the ‘real possibility’ test. Its predictive nature means that the CCRC has been forced to second-guess the court of appeal. If you have an increasingly conservative court of appeal – which we do – then you’re left with an increasingly conservative CCRC. Our criminal appeals safety net mechanism becomes locked into a self-defeating spiral with fewer and fewer cases going back to the courts.“In a consultation paper published earlier in the year, the Law Commission proposed replacing the ‘real possibility’ test with one based on the commission’s own view of the case. Everyone who spoke to the Law Commission agreed it was a problem – with one exception: the Crown Prosecution Service [CPS].”Last month, Dame Vera Baird KC was appointed temporary chair of the CCRC, bringing the number of commissioners up to 10. Baird, a former Labour MP, justice minister, solicitor general, police and crime commissioner, and victims’ commissioner, is hugely experienced. Her interim appointment, until December 2026, suggests that the government is serious about addressing the crisis at the CCRC. The Ministry of Justice said: “The lord chancellor has requested that Dame Vera carry out a thorough review of the operation of the CCRC, to increase public confidence in the organisation and the important work it undertakes investigating potential miscarriages of justice.”After her appointment, Baird told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the commission operated in an “arrogant, dismissive way … almost looking for reasons not to refer to the court of appeal”.Which brings us back to Nunn. From the start, there was no DNA connecting him to the murder. But there was sperm that linked another, unidentified man to Walker. Even though the prosecution argued that the sperm was irrelevant, Hawarth for the CPS said that although DNA testing was not currently sophisticated enough to trace it to its owner, it could become so in the future and ordered the sample to be kept. The police named a number of suspects and “persons of interest” after Walker’s murder, most of them former boyfriends and two with a history of violence. The sperm has never been tested against the DNA of the other suspects or the police database.In 2012, the high court refused Nunn access to case materials held by Suffolk police that he believed could clear his name. Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, who went on to become lord chief justice of England and Wales, said he could rely on the CCRC to demand access to any relevant materials. In 2014, Nunn’s lawyer James Saunders took the case to the supreme court, arguing that the police and the CPS had a continuing duty of care to assist Nunn in gathering and examining evidence that could prove his innocence.In 2015, the actor Tom Conti joined Nunn’s campaign for further disclosure after learning about the case from the charity Inside Justice, which conducts casework investigations on behalf of people who claim they have been wrongly convicted. Conti believed Nunn might well be innocent and, in 2015, he wrote to the then home secretary Theresa May, saying: “The chief constable of Suffolk refuses to hand over the exhibits. What could possibly be his reason? Does he fear humiliation for his force if Nunn proves to be innocent?” The actor offered £1,000 to help pay for new laboratory tests.But the supreme court ruled that neither the police nor the CPS had a responsibility to further assist Nunn, saying that access to such material was only required where “there appears to be a real prospect that further inquiry will uncover something which may affect the safety of the conviction”. The court ruled this threshold had not been met and that the only channel for Nunn to go through was the CCRC. It regarded Nunn’s appeal for further post-conviction disclosure as a fishing expedition. Critics pointed out it’s only by going on fishing expeditions that you catch fish.After that ruling, one of Walker’s sisters said: “To hear the judgment today is very uplifting; to hear they still think he’s guilty. I’m very relieved with the news and very happy with the news and let’s keep fighting to keep him behind bars.”The supreme court decision not only had a potentially significant impact on Nunn’s case, it also had an impact on all potential wrongful convictions. It meant that victims of miscarriages of justice were now wholly reliant on a proactive CCRC using its statutory powers to demand disclosure and testing of evidence that could clear them. The CCRC, though, was anything but proactive. It was dormant, impoverished and underresourced. When Saunders sent a submission to the CCRC on behalf of Nunn in January 2015, he was told it had so much work on that it would not be able to look at it until September.The commission finally got back to him four years later, in 2019, rejecting his appeal. What shocked Nunn was the grounds on which it was rejected. The commission had sent off the semen sample, and even though, at the trial, it had been unambiguously cited as sperm, the new forensics lab now said it was yeast.When Nunn was jailed, Butcher’s belief in justice was dented. Then she began to experience first-hand the failings of the CCRC and the little remaining faith she had was shattered. She decided that if her brother was going to be cleared, and couldn’t rely on the commission doing the necessary investigations, she would have to do them herself.She started working with a private investigator, Carol Parish. They visited relatives and friends of the suspects, taking statements from whoever was willing to provide one. The former wife of one suspect told Parish that she had been waiting to be asked about his possible role in the murder, describing him as a “Jekyll and Hyde” character and recounting an occasion when he’d grabbed her by the neck and pinned her against the wall. Butcher didn’t know if this story was significant, but it made her more convinced than ever that Walker’s killer was still out there somewhere.Butcher is no longer working with Parish, who is in poor health, but is still doing her own detective work. She has not given up on tracking down the killer or killers. According to the prosecution, there were two people involved in the murder, but there appears to have been no attempt by Suffolk police to track down a second killer.Her most recent investigation has been into the Scottish police authority (SPA) lab that said the “sperm” found on Walker may well be yeast. She did a bit of digging, and discovered to her surprise that Hawarth, the lead forensic scientist for the prosecution in 2006, is now head of function at SPA Forensic Services and a colleague of Amanda Pirie, the forensics expert who now believes it is yeast. “Hawarth was adamant it was spermatozoa when she was acting for the prosecution. And now she’s working alongside someone who’s cast doubt on whether it is spermatozoa when it could potentially clear Kevin.” When invited by the Guardian to comment on its findings, the SPA declined to do so.Saunders wrote back to the CCRC in January 2019, expressing his bafflement. First, he stated that Pirie did not seem to have tested all the slides for sperm, and asked why the CCRC was so “incurious” that two such different conclusions had been reached. Saunders told the CCRC that he had written to the SPA asking whether Hawarth “was willing and able to review the case materials, and she reported that both she and her employer, the Scottish police authority, are willing for her to do so on their time and premises, with no cost to the CCRC, in view of the importance of matters”. All the CCRC had to do was ask and it would be done. Saunders said that it would be “simply irrational not to allow Mrs Hawarth to review the materials involved in the exhibits” and that “to dismiss her evidence without knowing her comment is unreasonable”. The CCRC failed to respond to Saunders on these points, and closed the case. In 2022, Saunders put in a new submission to the CCRC on behalf of Nunn.After Malkinson was failed so badly by the CCRC, a review was commissioned of its work from Chris Henley KC. One of its conclusions was that new forensic trawling exercises should be carried out for new DNA testing opportunities of certain historic cases. This February, Inside Justice, which now represents Nunn, received a letter from his CCRC case review manager stating: “Mr Nunn’s case has been identified as fulfilling the criteria for that trawl and a separate team has been considering the case in parallel to my review.”View image in fullscreenKevin Nunn as a boy.Composite: Guardian Design; Courtesy of Brigitte Butcher; Mimi Mollica; Getty ImagesIn March, Nunn writes to tell me I have been added to his approved phone list. He says in prison he has no friends and rarely speaks to people. Fellow prisoners will sometimes say a word or two to him if they are alone together in the yard, but if they are joined by anybody else they talk over him and pretend he’s not there. His crime is regarded as beyond the pale, and he is ostracised – other prisoners don’t want to be seen associating with him.He has made use of his time in prison. Having left school at 16, he studied through the Open University in prison, gaining a degree in business studies in 2018. He works in the prison gardens during the day, reads fiction and non-fiction (he recently finished the historical novelHuman Traces by Sebastian Faulksand 21 Lessons for the 21st Century by the philosopher and historianYuval Noah Harari), and examines and re-examines the evidence, looking for any chink that could clear him.Five weeks after Nunn writes to me, on a sunny April day, Butcher meets me at Melton station, near Ipswich. She likes driving and owns a top-of-the-range Mini. Last time she drove me, when I first wrote about Nunn, in 2013, it was to a narrow track in boggy, brambled woodland in the middle of nowhere. She had to stop the car a good walk from where Walker’s body was found. The point she was making was that Nunn would have needed superhuman strength to carry Walker that distance – not least because he is 5ft 8in (1.7m) and built like a bean sprout and she was 5ft 11in (1.8m) and Amazonian. “How was he supposed to have carried this great big strapping woman?”Today, she is driving us to a remote prison in East Anglia where Nunn has spent the past three years. We have only been back in touch for a few months, but Butcher is one of those people with whom you can pick up where you left off decades ago. I tell her that Nunn said in a recent letter she’s the only person he trusts in the world. “It’s just so sad, isn’t it? Sad that he can’t trust anybody else, and sad that when he does get out, how will he be?” Both Nunn and Butcher have got a habit of ending sentences with questions.She talks about how important it is to still be fighting for Kevin – for his and their parents’ sake. Their father, who spent his life savings trying to clear Nunn’s name, died in 2016; their mother in 2021. One of the things her mother found most distressing in her final years, Butcher says, was a TV film made about the murder. It is regularly shown on Sky TV, she says, and each time the “repercussions are terrible” for Nunn in prison because fellow inmates judge him for it.“I tried to get it taken down but I couldn’t. It tormented my mum. The last thing my mum said on her deathbed was, ‘You won’t give up fighting for Kev, will you?’”Nunn and I have spoken on the phone and exchanged letters, but this is the first time I have met him. He is sitting behind a table dressed in a black and white Adidas top and black trousers. He’s underweight, a little hunched, sombre-looking. In old photos of him, he’s smiling and boyish. I ask how life has changed since we were in touch 12 years ago. He looks at Butcher. “Well, you’ve aged since I’ve been inside, haven’t you?”She laughs. “Charming!” she says. “He deserves to be inside just for saying his sister looks like an old hag. Well, I told Simon, you’re boring!” He looks at her affectionately. Butcher is funny and emotional; Nunn introverted and understated. While she expresses herself in italics and exclamation marks, he does so in a dour monotone. But there is no escaping the passion of his words. In a letter he sent me, Nunn said: “Without my heroic sister I doubt if I could have survived. It’s a nightmare you don’t wake up from.”He looks different from the other men in the visiting room. They are younger, stronger, more robust. Nunn seems diminished. I ask how he feels after 20 years in prison. “Well, you don’t get used to it, do you? It’s an incomprehensible experience.” He says the shock never goes away; you simply get reshocked on a daily basis. “For the last 20 years, I’ve been looking to find evidence that would exonerate me. If you’re innocent, why would you give up? And because I am innocent the truth is still there to be found, so why would you give up? Why would you stop?” Nunn sounds quietly desperate. He takes a sip of his Diet Coke, and continues.“How d’you explain something that very few people have had experience of? That catastrophic thing is thrown at you.” He’s talking about the actual murder of Walker. “You try to make sense of everything and before you do you wake up to the fact that you’re a suspect and you think that can’t be possible, they’ll find the truth, and all you’ve got to do is wait, and then there’s a knock on the door and you’re arrested for it, and then after that you’re in prison and that’s just a completely awful alien environment because you don’t have the history and background of the vast majority of people in here. So it goes on, and it’s just continuous. It’s still here and to be dealt with. And the only thing that’s left is to keep looking for the truth.”He believes that the only way he will prove his innocence is by finding who did kill his former girlfriend. “That seems to be the threshold. I know that’s not the test and it shouldn’t be the legal threshold for an unsafe conviction, but that seems to be where we are. That’s why the whole focus has been on the forensics.”Nunn talks to me about the message he says Walker left on his phone at around 4.55am on Thursday 3 February 2005, the morning after they split up. He says she was upset, crying, and that she told him that she loved him. He says it left him confused – she’d never told him she loved him before. “I woke up on Thursday morning and found this message.”As he talks, you sense this is a man who is used to not being believed. “As I’ve said hundreds of times before, therewasa message, it was Dawn’s voice, and she was sobbing and upset. It goes on for a number of seconds. There’s a lot of sobbing and I stopped the message. It confused me because neither of us were that upset when we left the night before. And now I couldn’t understand why she sounded so upset. And I deleted it.”He asks himself the question he’s asked himself thousands of times: “But why would you keep it?” Nunn says he destroyed the evidence that undermined the prosecution case because there didn’t seem any point in keeping it. “I deleted it. But why would you keep it?” he asks himself again. “I was going to see her later and ask her why she was so upset. There was no need to keep the message. What was I going to do, say: ‘Listen to your message, you’re upset’? I was anticipating seeing her, that’s why the message was deleted.”Walker’s phone records revealed that she had called him at 4.42am and that he had not answered. The prosecution speculated that the call was made by Nunn using Walker’s phone to give himself an alibi. Again, the jury chose to believe the prosecution’s version that a message was never left. Walker’s records also reveal that Nunn sent her a text message at 10.13pm on 2 February, the time he was supposed to be arguing with her on the doorstep.I ask if he loved Walker. He says it’s hard to know now. He’s lost perspective on everything. “I couldn’t honestly say. I thought I did at the time. But if you’ve gone through what I’ve been through, it puts a whole different complex on life.”Does he think about her much? “Well, yes, primarily who murdered her and why? So that eclipses everything. That is what’s at stake here. The one thing we could do right for her is find out the truth, and we’re not getting there. Forensic science has the potential for a breakthrough. The CCRC has to look at every avenue, and there are other avenues left open. Certain tests were not done at the end of the SPA’s review. I’m hoping they will continue and give authorisation for further tests to be done by a different forensics provider.”As for the suggestion that the sperm found on her body is now being questioned, Nunn is bewildered. For 20 years, he has believed that that was the path to acquittal. “What’s that all about?” he asks. “They were pretty sure at the trial what it was.” Nunn seems at a total loss. “I don’t even know who I am any more,” he says. The words land like stones in a pond, leaving a heavy silence.Butcher and I are now on the other side of the barbed wire waiting to be released into the outside world. From where we’re standing, we can see the men being led back to their cells. “Look, he’s beginning to slump,” Butcher says. “I keep telling him he’s got to hold his head up straight.”A few days after we meet, Nunn rings. He ’s talking with even more intensity than when we spoke in prison. He’s had some good news, he says. He has received a letter from the CCRC saying it has commissioned the forensics company Eurofins to do further DNA testing after it was ordered to do the forensics trawl. He mentionsPeter Sullivan, who has just had his murder conviction quashed after 38 years in prison – thought to be the longest-running miscarriage of justice in British history. Again, it was forensics that resulted in Sullivan’s conviction being overturned. And again, it was forensics that the CCRC said it couldn’t do at the time because DNA testing was too crude.I call the CCRC to ask why it refused to let Hawarth retest the sperm, and why it is now testing DNA six years after telling Nunn it could take his case no further. The reply addressed neither point directly. A spokesperson said: “An application in relation to this individual was received in 2015. This application did not lead to a referral. A second application was received, and it is currently under review. It would be inappropriate to comment further while this review is under way.”Nunn is not counting his chickens. He remains a convicted murderer serving a life sentence, and he says he will never come to terms with that. He tells me that one of the things he finds hardest to live with is the type of man he is said to be – not simply a killer, but a killer of the most depraved kind. “You’re meant to be this monster and do you know how difficult that is to deal with when you’re factually innocent? I wouldn’t wish this on anybody.” He comes to an exhausted stop. “If you were in my position, you wouldn’t give up, would you?”"

However, it seems that none of the problems they mentioned are actually related to nomadism. These are universal issues. Everything they didn’t like existed long before the words “digital nomad” entered our vocabulary. Slow internet? Trouble finding an apartment to rent? Unfamiliar food? Heat? People feeling disconnected from each other? All these are symptoms of our crazy times, and our task is to come up with ways to fix this together, rather than running to the office, where supposedly some of these problems will be solved (spoiler: they won’t).A nomad doesn’t aim to recreate an exact replica of their life and everything they’re used to in a different place. The Roman lyric poet Horace, in his Odes, told us centuries ago: “They change their sky, not their soul, who rush across the sea.” No matter where people go, they carry their problems, personal histories and unhealthy habits with them. Our real job as human beings is to find meaningful new ways to cope with all this nomadic stuff in a psychologically healthy way.Ivan MedvedevTrento, ItalyI was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, and life for most locals there is far from the paradise it can seem for digital nomads. An americano at Starbucks costs around 11 Malaysian ringgit (£1.90), which is very affordable if you earn in British pounds, but not if you’re paid in the local currency. The same goes for renting an apartment with a rooftop swimming pool. I’m curious to hear about the expat experience of leaving London due to soaring rents only to inadvertently contribute to rising rents in the south-east Asian neighbourhoods they settle in.Abigail GomezLondonHaving lived as a digital nomad for almost 10 years, it’s always interesting to read other people’s experiences. However, the thing that always strikes me is that people take digital nomadism too much as dogma. It isn’t for everyone, it isn’t for ever. Like almost everything else in life, you should do something only if, and as long as, you enjoy it. The difficulties of daily life don’t disappear just because you’re in another country, which most people seem to forget or ignore. It takes work and effort to make a digital nomad lifestyle work, but it can be a hugely rewarding experience.Sara BaroniLondonHappiness is a state of mind, not a state of place.David HastingsBalbeggie,Perth and KinrossHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Here’s what happened when I tried to make new friends in my 30s, 1 July). I mostly work from home, and last year I hit a point where I was increasingly feeling disconnected, isolated and a little lost. My weekends felt long and quiet, sometimes painfully so. I was struggling.In September, I made the choice to start volunteering, thinking it might fill a bit of time. I signed up to Sense’s virtual buddying scheme, which pairs disabled people with volunteers for weekly catchups.I was a little nervous to meet my buddy, but I can now say that they’re one of the most fabulous humans I know. Every Saturday evening, we meet on a video call for an hour. We play games, tell stories, create wild and wonderful things, dance and do 90s pop karaoke (badly, in my case). We laugh a lot. That single hour has become the highlight of my week. It’s a little pocket of joy and connection that brings colour to my routine.I can’t recommend volunteering enough to anyone my age feeling lonely and looking to make new friends. Much more than just filling time on the weekend, my weekly calls have helped me reimagine what connection can look like and reminded me that small, consistent moments of joy add up and matter.Paula McInallyWolverhamptonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Haitian media reported that he had died, but Kenya’s police service says a search is continuing.“We’ve tried many times to get information from the government, but they’ve refused,” said Kuria’s wife, Miriam Watima. “We don’t know what to do any more.”Hundreds of Kenyan officers have been posted to Haiti as part ofa US and UN-backed missionto help police in the Caribbean country get to grips with rampant gang violence.More than a million peoplehave been forced from their homes in a relentless cycle of indiscriminate killings, kidnappings, gang rapes and arson.Kuria’s case has reignited public concern over Kenya’s involvement in the multinational security support mission (MSS), which started last year andwas the subjectof intense domestic public andlegal scrutinyfrom the outset.View image in fullscreenMiriam Watima, Kuria’s wife: ‘We don’t know what to do any more’.Photograph: Edwin Ndeke/The GuardianIn a search for answers, Kuria’s family filed a court petition in June that listed the attorney-general, the inspector general of police and various ministers as respondents. A Nairobi court has scheduled a preliminary court appearance for September but the family, who want the matter treated with urgency, have called for the session to be brought forward.“We entrusted our son with the government,” said Kuria’s mother, Jacinta Kabiru. “They should give us the information.”Kuria, a 33-year-old administration police officer, joined the MSS last July. On 26 March theMSS saidhe was “unaccounted for” after an ambush the day before on a team who had gone to assist the recovery of a Haitian police vehicle stuck in a ditch that it suspected had been dug by gangs.Later on 26 March,Kenyan police saida search and rescue mission was continuing, while local leaders and police chiefs went to Watima’s house in the town of Kikuyu, north-west of Nairobi in Kiambu county, to tell her that her husband was missing.But the following day, Haitian media outlets reported that Kuria had been killed, quoting Haiti’s presidential transitional councilas sayingthat he “fell … while carrying out his mission” and “gave his life for a better future for our country”.In the months since, his family’s desperate scramble for clarity has included visits to police – who have told them a search and rescue mission is continuing – and politicians’ offices. Through their lawyer, Mbuthi Gathenji, they have petitioned parliament and written letters to Kenya’s attorney-general and María Isabel Salvador, the special representative of the UN secretary-general in Haiti.Their court petition accuses government officials of “refusing and/or neglecting” to provide the family with information on Kuria’s whereabouts “to ease their agony”, and asks judgesto assist in “compelling the respondents to disclose information”.“You can imagine the pain that the parents and relatives are going through,” said Gathenji. “We are asking the government to come out with finality.”The Guardian has approached Kenya’s interior cabinet secretary as well as the MSS and the Kenyan police for comment.View image in fullscreen‘What we want is closure.’ Philip Kuria, Benedict’s brother, and their mother, Jacinta Kabiru.Photograph: Edwin Ndeke/The GuardianKenya’s leading role in the mission stemmed from a desire by the US and the UN to restructure international intervention in Haiti with a multinational mission headed by an African country, after a series of floundering UN missions during which UN troops caused a cholera outbreak and peacekeepers were accused of sexual assault.Kenya, which has participated in many peacekeeping missions internationally, volunteered to lead the Haiti intervention. For its president, William Ruto, the deployment was a chance to position his country as a reliable international partner and burnish the reputation of its police force, which regularly usesviolence against civilians.The arrival of the Kenyan officers in June 2024 brought some hope to Haiti, but the mission, beset by funding, equipment and personnel issues, has failed to repel the criminal advance.In April, Salvador said Haiti was approaching a “point of no return”. And on Wednesday, Ghada Waly, the executive director of the UN office on drugs and crime, told the UN security council that gangs now controlled an estimated 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince.Kuria’s mother had tried to dissuade him from joining the mission after learning about Haiti’s violent reputation, but he was determined to go, motivated in part by the extra pay the job came with, which he planned to use to improve his relatives’ lives. “This is an opportunity we have got as a family,” his brother, Philip Kuria, recalled him saying.Kuria was due to return this year at the end of his one-year contract. “It’s a struggle,” said Philip. “What we want is closure.”View image in fullscreenJacinta Kabiru shows a photograph her son Benedict on her phone.Photograph: Edwin Ndeke/The GuardianKuria’s uncle, Daniel Ndung’u, said the family was open to any news. “My prayer is that he’s going to come back to join us,” he said. “This suspense is actually torturing us.”Watima recalled her last call with Kuria as they discussed academic plans for their 17-year-old daughter. She tops up credit for her husband’s phone so it doesn’t get deactivated, hoping that one day he’ll call again. In the meantime, she waits for the government. “They should tell us whether he’s alive or not,” she said. “That’s all we want to know.”Explore more on these topicsHaitiKenyaUnited NationsAmericasAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time for Labor to show some courage | Zoe DanielRead moreThe reportsuggested those at higher risk of gambling harm were spending more money. The figures include tangible costs, like bankruptcy, but also indirect costs, including emotional and psychological harm, such as depression.The videos uploaded to Instagram show influencers inserting hundreds of dollars into poker machines and telling viewers they will continue to do so until a certain amount of people follow them.Other accounts collate videos of people winning on poker machines – including turning $5 into $164,000, without documenting their losses.Several posts seen by Guardian Australia can be accessed by children and teenagers, and do not contain responsible gambling messages. These messages are required when gambling companies promote their products through broadcast ads, social media and podcasts.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe new trend has worried public health campaigners who fear the content may be introducing a younger generation to poker machines and undermining messages designed to limit gambling-related harm.Dr Danielle McMullen, the president of the Australian Medical Association, said the videos were “shocking”.“They are clearly targeted at young people and seek to glamorise what is a dangerous habit and not one we would encourage people to take part in,” McMullen said.“These videos show that our regulations around gambling just aren’t keeping up with the 21st century. They are essentially ads for gambling and our governments need to take a long hard look about how we get on top of this content.”View image in fullscreenScreengrab of social media content sharing highlights of poker machine use.Photograph: InstagramInstagram’s owner, Meta, said it had strict rules for the promotion of gambling and that it would “remove any content that does not comply with our standards as soon as we become aware” of it.“Both the advertiser and creator must obtain written permission to promote real money gambling and must comply with all applicable Australian laws and regulations,” a Meta spokesperson said.But it is not clear whether these accounts are defined as advertising, despite allegedly promoting gambling, as they do not appear to have been published in partnership with any gambling company or venue. Many of the posts seen by Guardian Australia have been online for several weeks.Dr Mark Johnson, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, who has researched social media influencers and gambling, said the emergence of influencers focused on poker machines was an “incredibly new phenomenon”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This system can result in accounts being restricted or disabled if there is a history of violations.A spokesperson for the Australian Influencer Marketing Council said it was clear that influencers needed more education about their roles and legal responsibilities.They added: “Many creators engaging in affiliate marketing may not fully understand the regulatory frameworks in which they operate.”In Australia,Gambling Help Onlineis available on 1800 858 858.

She said the act of antisemitism had been “used for political gain, to smear the Palestine solidarity movement”.“These responses fuel division.

Those who would burn houses of prayer with families inside do not seek an end to war. There is a violent ideology at work in our country that operates on the fringes of politics and social movements, that taps into anger and prejudice,” he said in a statement.Opposition communications spokesperson Melissa McIntosh told the ABC Insiders program on Sunday “something needs to be done” to prevent ongoing attacks.McIntosh also described the incident as an attack on “all Australians” and pushed the Albanese government to better protect the Jewish community in Australia.“Why isn’t [Albanese] convening national cabinet and bringing the states together with urgency to address this issue? There’s a number of things that the government could be doing yet,” she said.“We’re sitting here today discussing another horrible attack where there are kids inside the synagogue.

Guests included the actor Naomi Watts and, fresh from 18 months of South Korean military service, Kim Taehyung, from the K-pop band BTS, who attempted to shelter from the rain under a giant silkfoulardthat had been erected above a courtyard.It was a full-circle moment for Rider, an American designer who previously worked under Phoebe Philo during her tenure at the brand from 2008 to 2017.View image in fullscreenCeline spring 2026 collection.Photograph: Photo: Fior/Dragone/Gorunway.comWhile fans of her work, known as “Philophiles”, had hoped Rider would reinstate that era of louche tailoring and minimalism, his opening looks quickly curtailed such expectations.Instead of oversized silhouettes, there was a series of skinny jeans and even skinner trousers, hugging calves so tightly they should have come with a circulation warning.These lean silhouettes were a nod to his predecessor, Slimane, who honed his signature sharp-edged style during his stints at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme before introducing it toCeline.Despite initial criticism, Slimane proved lucrative for Celine’s parent company LVMH. According to analysts, he was estimated to have doubled Celine’s annual sales to €2.5bn (£2.1bn), transforming it into LVMH’s third-largest brand, behind Louis Vuitton and Dior. However, in October, he resigned amid rumours of failed contract negotiations.It’s now up to Rider to pick up that moneyed baton.Rider’s appointment comes at a difficult time in the fashion industry, with a significant slowdown across luxury markets (for the first quarter of 2025, LVMH reported a 4% sales drop across fashion and leather goods).At the annual general meeting in April 2024, LVMH’s chief executive,Bernard Arnault, said: “Celine is chic, hip, sexy fashion for young people even if the prices are what they are, and it works.”Rather than wiping the slate clean during this period of uncertainty, it appears that Rider is set on evolving on the brand’s existing tried and tested formula.Speaking backstage after the show, Rider said he “did not want there to be a sense of erasure”, adding that “there was a foundation to build on. That to me felt modern, it felt ethical, it felt strong.”Rider balanced this homage to the past by intertwining it with his own fashion story. There were nods to his American roots and recent stint as design director of Polo Ralph Lauren, with punchy, coloured knitted V-neck jumpers, neat Oxford shirts and striped ties. Simple evening looks in black including an off-the-shoulder dress and satin-lapelled blazers seemed to subtly recall his previous time at Celine.Accessories, which are easier for luxury brands to shift than a £5k coat, were a focus. Models’ fingers came covered in multiple gold and primary coloured rings. Chunky bangles were stacked on forearms. Giant chain link necklaces were mishmashed. Keyrings jingled with everything from dice to miniature Eiffel Towers.Rider said he wanted to inject an element of fun. “I would never want to be perceived as cynical. Having a sense of humour in the luxury space is a beautiful thing,” he said.Bags ranging from colossal woven baskets and enormous leather totes to dainty pouches were emblazoned with logos ranging from a simple C to a “Triomphe” monogram, first created by the house’s founder Céline Vipiana in 1971.Rider said he was drawn to a logo’s fluid nature. “They can move from something really tasteful to quickly something that is very different from that. They can be many things.”Explore more on these topicsFashionCelineFranceHedi SlimaneBernard ArnaultEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The bathing spots are located near to the Eiffel Tower – which is focused on swimming for families with small children – the Notre Dame Cathedral and the National Library.Lifeguards are present, and changing and shower facilities are available. Water quality will be tested daily by health authorities and a flag system will indicate how safe it is to swim.

Despite a government promise to “smash” the gangs organising crossings, more than 20,000 people have crossed to the UK in the first six months of this year, up 48% on the equivalent period in 2024.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Businesses have paused investment and the dollar posted its worst performance in 50 years in the first half of the year.Trump threatens 17% tariffs on food and farm produce exports from EuropeRead moreWith the clock ticking down to Trump’s 9 July deadline, the European Commission remains uncertain how he will treat the bloc, threatening €1.6tn of transatlantic trade.“Among member states, the big question will be whether we should reach a deal at all costs to avoid a trade war, or show muscle if the deal is not good enough,” one EU diplomat said.The German chancellor, , has said he wants a quick UK-style deal to avert a full-scale trade war, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, favours holding out for a better deal if a rushed deal is “imbalanced”.Giving a flavour of the aggression shown towards the EU, which Trump once called “nastier than China”, Brussels’ trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, was threatened last weekwith 17% tariffs on food importsduring talks with senior members of the Trump administration including Bessent.After announcing punitive“liberation day” tariffson nearly all countries on 2 April, Trumppaused them for 90 daysa week later.The US is nowon the brink of launching a trade assaulton dozens of countries as the 90-day period expires on Wednesday with only two deals in the bag – the UK and Vietnam.This has raised questions about the EU’s ability to strike anything other than apolitical framework agreement to extend talkswhile a baseline 10% tariff and other levies on cars, steel and aluminium remain in place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They expect the cost of Trump’s presidency will be the minimum 10% on exports to the US, five times higher than the 2% average before he was elected last year.That is because after months of threats of retaliatory tariffs on everything from Bourbon to Boeing aircraft, the EU conceded last week that a comprehensive trade deal was unattainable.Instead they are aiming for an agreement in principle, or “framework deal” which will look more like the UK deal struck in May, whichcame into force at the end of last month.Many EU diplomats initially dismissed the UK deal as thin and legally dubious under World Trade Organization rules, and held out hope that the bloc’s greater economic clout with €1.6tn of transatlantic trade compared with the UK’s £314bn (€363bn) would help it secure a better deal. But now they realise a bare-bones deal may be the best they can get.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump administrationTrump tariffsTariffsUS economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is calling on club owners to contract private ambulance services.“It’s inconceivable that businesses with an income of millions of euros a year can’t provide this service which is saturating the emergency services at the expense of the local population,” the president of the local health services union, José Manuel Maroto, told elDiario.es.“The clubs are obliged to employ nurses and other health workers but not ambulances, the cost if which is borne by public services,” he said, adding that it was unjust that the island’s 161,000 residents should receive an inferior service because of the demands of 3.6 million annual visitors.According to Maroto, only one major club, DC-10, uses a private service.The island, part of the hippy trail in the 1970s, has been a mecca for clubbers since the early 1980s. The pioneering clubs were Amnesia and Pacha, but dozens have sprung up since, making the dance scene – and the drugs that fuel it – a major part of Ibiza’s tourism industry.The Hollywood star Will Smith was at the inauguration last month of UNVRS, the island’s biggest club, where the cheapest entry is €100 (£86) and a drink can cost €25.According to the regional government, tourists to the island spend €1.5 of every €10 on the dancefloor, but many clubbers complain the scene is now all about money and big-name DJs who command enormous appearance fees.A study by the local paper El Diario de Ibiza found that the island is the third most expensive destination in the Mediterranean after Saint-Tropez and Capri.Much of the money goes to a company founded by the former footballer and politician Abel Matutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even though we’ve heard so many times before about a possible truce, it always fails, and now we’re afraid to even feel hopeful,” said Abu Adham Abu Amro, 55.“There is no more trust left because of the ongoing disagreements between the Palestinian and Israeli sides – one side agrees, the other refuses, and so it goes.”The war in Gaza was triggered on 7 October 2023 when Hamas launched a surprise attack into southern Israel, killing about 1,200, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Hamas is still holding approximately 50 hostages but fewer than half are thought to be alive.In Israel, public pressure is mounting for a deal to free all the hostages still in Gaza.Vicky Cohen, the mother of a soldier being held by Hamas in Gaza, said Israelis could only recover from the trauma of the 2023 attack if all the hostages were returned.“Israelis care for each other … we will not leave anyone back there and we will bring them all back. These are the values that Israel is based on. I hope our prime minister is brave enough to do the right thing,” she said.Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, displaced almost all of the 2.3 million population and reduced much of the territory to rubble.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had no immediate comment on the individual strikes in Gaza reported on Sunday, but said 130 targets were struck across the territory in the previous 24 hours, including militants, Hamas command and control structures, storage facilities, weapons and launchers.View image in fullscreenPeople remove a metal scaffolding from a building hit by Israeli bombardment in the Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesThe IDF also said a strike on a cafe in Gaza City last Monday that killed or wounded about 100 people, including many women, children and elderly people, had targeted a meeting of senior Hamas commanders. Experts have said the strike, which involved a500lb bombdropped on to a terrace crowded with waiters, families and students, could constitute a war crime.IDF sources told the Times of Israel newspaper thatRamzi Ramadan Abd Ali Salah,who led Hamas’s naval force in northern Gaza, and several other Hamas commanders died in the attack.Hundreds of Palestinianshave been killed by Israeli soldiers in recent weeksas they have gathered in large crowds to get food from looted convoys, from distributions by the UN, or from sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial US- and Israel-backed private organisation that started operations last month.On Saturday, Israel’s security cabinet said it would allow aid organisations to resume convoys into northern Gaza, where the humanitarian crisis in the territory is most acute. The move was opposed by far-right members of Israel’s ruling coalition, who say any aid will be stolen by Hamas and that none should be allowed to enter Gaza.The head of a Palestinian armed group opposed to Hamas and accused of looting aid in Gaza confirmed in an interview with public radio on Sunday that it was coordinating with the Israeli military.“We keep them informed, but we carry out the military actions on our own,” Yasser Abu Shabab said in an interview with Makan, Israel’s Arabic-language public radio broadcaster.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHamasDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The payments were then ratcheted up in line with ever more dangerous demands.Judging by court documents, the surge in Iranian espionage efforts over the past year achieved little, falling short of Tehran’s aspirations of carrying out high-level assassinations of Israeli officials.However, so many Israelis were prepared to carry out modest missions that the spying campaign may have been successful as a way of crowdsourcing data on strategically important sites that would later become targets of Iranian ballistic missiles.Meanwhile, Israel spied on Iran to devastating effect, allowing the Mossad to locate and assassinate much of Iran’s high command and its nuclear scientists in a single instant in the early hours of Friday 13 June, among many other targets.Since the war began, the Iranian regime has arrested more than 700 people accused of spying for Israel, according to the Fars news agency. But the trials have been secret, and in at least six cases led to summary executions, making it impossible to judge how much of the alleged network is real and how much a figment of official hysteria.By contrast, in the case of the Israelis accused of spying for Iran, the prosecution has filed detailed indictments. Though there has only been one conviction so far from the recent wave of arrests, leaving individual guilt to be assessed, a clear picture has emerged from court documents of how Iran set about casting a wide net for potential agents.It typically began with a text message from an anonymous sender. One such message, from the sender “news agency”, asked: “Do you have any information about the war? We are ready to buy it.” Another, sent by “Tehran-Quds” (Tehran-Jerusalem) to a Palestinian Israeli citizen, was more overt, saying: “A free Jerusalem unites Muslims. Send us information about the war.”The message included a link to the Telegram app, where a new dialogue would begin, sometimes with someone using an Israeli name, with an offer of money for apparently simple errands. If the recipient expressed interest, they would be advised by their new mystery contacts to set up PayPal and an app for receiving funds in cryptocurrencies.In the case of one suspect arrested on 29 September, the first task was to go to a park and check if a black bag had been buried in a certain spot, for a payment of nearly US$1,000 (£730). There was no bag, and the recruit sent a video to prove it.He was later assigned other jobs that involved handing out leaflets, hanging up posters or spraying graffiti, most with slogans denigrating Benjamin Netanyahu, such as “We are all together against Bibi” (Netanyahu’s nickname) or “Bibi brought Hezbollah here” or “Bibi = Hitler”.The next stage entailed taking photos. An Israeli of Azeri heritage was hired to photograph sensitive facilities around the country and seems to have turned it into a family business, getting his relatives to take shots of the port facilities in Haifa (which later would be hit by Iranian missiles in this month’s 12-day war), the Nevatim airbase in the Negev (struck in a salvo in October), as well as Iron Dome missile defence batteries across the country, and the Glilot military intelligence headquarters north of Tel Aviv.View image in fullscreenIsrael’s Iron Dome system fires to intercept missiles over Tel Aviv.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APThe same recruit who went to look for the black bag was asked to photograph the home of a nuclear scientist working at the Weizmann Institute. Israel’s premier scientific centre was the object of keen Iranian interest. Over the 15 years leading up to the war this month, five Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, almost certainly by the Mossad. In a long struggle over whether Israel would maintain its monopoly over nuclear weapons in the Middle East, Tehran wanted to strike back.Iran struck the Weizmann Institutewith ballistic missilesin the 12-day war, and it seems likely that the photos taken by its agents helped with targeting. The attempt to kill its scientists was a failure, however. In fact, neither Iran’s ministry of intelligence and security nor its Revolutionary Guards appear to have succeeded in assassinating any of their targets in the long shadow war.While the Mossad relied on infiltrating a cadre of highly trained operatives into Iran, the approach taken by Iranian intelligence was to test how far their green recruits would be prepared to go. Yossi Melman, an Israeli intelligence expert,quoted a Shin Bet officialas describing it as a “spray-and-pray approach, which seeks to develop a handful of high-quality recruits by making low-stakes investments in many others”.Once they had carried out simple tasks such as putting up posters and taking pictures, the recruits were asked to do more for more money. Having photographed the home of a nuclear scientist from the Weizmann Institute, one recruit was offered $60,000 to kill the scientist and his family and burn down their house.According to the indictment, the agent accepted and went about hiring four local toughs, all Palestinian Israeli citizens. On the night of 15 September, this would-be hit squad turned up at the gates of the Weizmann Institute, but they did not get past the security guard and meekly drove away.View image in fullscreenWeizmann Institute buildings were left in ruins after the Iranian missile strike.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersThe day after that fiasco, the Iranian handlers told the recruit to go back to the Weizmann and take more photos. With the advantage of being an Israeli Jew arriving in daylight, he managed to talk his way past the security guards and filmed the scientist’s car. He was paid $709 and asked if he would attach a GPS device to the car. He refused.This would be a pattern that repeats again and again in the indictments. Though the Iranian recruiters proved effective at finding plenty of Israelis ready to take photographs and distribute leaflets for Iranian money, the handlers in Tehran seem to have been in too much of a hurry to cultivate long-term agents.Several were abruptly asked, only a few days after completing their first tasks, whether they would try to assassinate high officials. The Azeri group were asked to find a hitman but refused. The same recruit who refused to place a GPS tracker on a scientist’s car was asked days later if he might consider throwing a petrol bomb at Netanyahu’s vehicle.Only one of the suspects has so far been convicted and jailed, after confessing to the charges against him.Million-dollar demandWhen Mordechai “Moti” Maman, 72, was approached by Iranian intelligence in spring last year, he was recently married to a much younger Belarusian woman, and in need of funds after the failure of several business ventures.Maman had spent some years in Samandağ, in southern Turkey, and in April, he contacted two businessmen brothers he knew there to see if they had any money-making ideas. The brothers said they had a lucrative business partnership with an Iranian acquaintance named Eddie importing dried fruit and spices and suggested Maman should meet him.In April, Maman flew to Samandağ via Cyprus, but Eddie sent two colleagues in his place, claiming he was not able to leave Iran for bureaucratic reasons. The next month, the Israeli was invited back to Turkey, to the town of Yüksekova in the far south-east, where he stayed in a hotel room paid for by Eddie.Once more, Eddie said he was unable to cross into Turkey, but he told Maman there was a way to smuggle the Israeli into Iran. He agreed and on 5 May he made the crossing concealed in a truck.Eddie and a second Iranian official met Maman in a luxury hotel inside Iran and made him an offer of thousands of dollars for three tasks. He was to leave money or guns at designated locations in Israel; he was to take photos of crowded places; and he was to pass on threats to other agents, specifically Israeli Palestinians, who had “received funds from Iran for carrying out hostile missions, but had not actually carried out their missions”.Maman said he would think about it and was smuggled back into Turkey. Back in Yüksekova, he was handed $1,300 in cash as partial payment for making the trip.In August, Maman was back in Turkey and was once more smuggled over the border to meet Eddie and his associate. This time the tasks were more daunting. The Iranians offered $150,000 for killing any of Netanyahu, Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet, or Yoav Gallant, then the defence minister.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant last October.Photograph: Amir Cohen/ReutersAccording to the prosecution, Maman said he had underworld connections who might be able to get the job done, but he wanted $1m. That was too high for the Iranians who suggested a lesser target, the former prime minister Naftali Bennett, for $400,000. Maman allegedly stuck to his million-dollar demand and the talks adjourned without agreement.He was paid $5,000 and flew back to Cyprus and then, on 29 August, on to Tel Aviv, where Shin Bet officers were waiting for him.On 29 April, Maman wassentenced to 10 yearsin prison after pleading guilty to charges of contact with a foreign agent and unauthorised entry into an enemy state. His lawyer, Eyal Besserglick, described the sentence as excessive and has appealed.Besserglick said Maman believed until the last moment that Eddie was no more than an Iranian businessman dealing in raisins and spices, and he was unaware when he was being smuggled onboard a truck that he was being taken into Iran. He denies Maman asked for $1m, arguing that his client ultimately had to appear to go along with the Iranian plots, out of fear that a sudden refusal would get him killed.“What would have been better? If he had been kidnapped in a van or maybe been murdered?” Besserglick told the Guardian. He said Maman had been beaten up in prison and kept in a filthy cell with excrement smeared on the walls.“The mistake he made is serious,” the lawyer said. “But he should not die for that mistake, because in the end there will be no one to punish.”Bayan Rabee contributed reporting to this articleThis article was amended on 6 July 2025.

Four others were killed in the town of Bani Suheila, and three people were killed in three different strikes in the town of Khan Younis.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) made no immediate comment on the attacks.Separately, two US contractors with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured in the south of the territory after unknown assailants threw grenades at them at a food distribution site, the organisation said.The GHF, a US-supported private organisation that began handing out food parcels in Gaza last month, has been mired in controversy, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, saying it was “inherently unsafe” and that it was “killing people”. The GHF denies this, saying it has delivered tens of millions of meals in “safety and security”.On Saturday night the US state department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, blamed “Hamas terrorists” for the attack, adding in a post on X: “This act of violence against the people actually bringing relief to Gazans lays bare the depravity of Hamas.”Hundreds of Palestinianshave been killedin recent weeks in shooting or shelling by the IDF while travelling to GHF sites or gathering in large crowds to get aid from convoys brought into Gaza by the UN that are often stopped and looted.Aid workers in Gaza have called again for an immediate cessation of hostilities, saying that fuel stocks for NGOs are close to running out, which would lead to the “complete collapse” of humanitarian operations, much of the health system and communications across the territory. Power supplies in Gaza rely primarily on large quantities of diesel for generators.“We are pretty much down to about half a day’s worth. When that is gone, everything has to shut down,” said one humanitarian worker in Deir al-Balah.Israel imposed a tight 11-week blockade on Gaza after the most recent ceasefire collapsed in March, which has only been partly lifted to allow a small amount of food aid and medical supplies into the territory. No fuel has been permitted to enter, and supplies that still exist in Gaza are often in Israeli-controlled areas or combat zones and so inaccessible.Netanyahu is to fly to Washington on Sunday for talks with the US president, Donald Trump, who has said in a series of social media posts that he wants the Gaza war to stop.A ceasefire in Gaza appears to be close. Here’s why it could happen nowRead moreDrafts of the proposed deal seen by the Guardian include a provision specifying that Trump would personally announce any ceasefire – possibly in the coming days during Netanyahu’s visit.However, sources close to Hamas said the organisation wants greater clarity over guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a permanent end to the war and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.There is also disagreement over who would be allowed to deliver the “sufficient aid” described in the draft. Hamas want the GHF to be closed down. Israel wants to maintain a system of distribution independent from the UN or other countries.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One late on Friday, Trump said he was optimistic and suggested there “could be a Gaza deal” next week. But Israeli media have described a series of steps involving separate Israeli delegations flying to Qatar and Egypt to complete negotiations, and the current draft specifies that Steve Witkoff, Trump’s personal envoy, will travel to the Middle East to finalise the deal.Analysts said this could mean lengthy delays before an agreement is reached.The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise Hamas-led attack into Israel in October 2023, during which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Fifty remain in Gaza, less than half still alive.Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory’s ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The lion later returned to the owners’ farmhouse and was relocated to a wildlife park, police said.Keeping exotic animals such as lions is considered a status symbol by some wealthy Pakistanis, despite the legal requirements and high fees associated with ownership.InTurkey, a lion that escaped from a theme park near the resort of Antalya was shot dead on Sunday after attacking a man, the local governor and media reports said.The lion, reportedly named Zeus, escaped his enclosure at the Land of Lions animal theme park in Manavgat, about 40 miles (65km) east of Antalya, in the early hours of the morning, the governor said.According to the BirGün newspaper, the lion attacked an agricultural worker called Suleiman Kir who was asleep in a pistachio field with his wife. Kir tussled with the lion before it ran off. He was injured but not badly and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.“We were covered with blankets to protect ourselves from mosquitoes and when the prayer call sounded, I tried to stand up but I couldn’t,” he told the newspaper. “Suddenly I felt something touch my left foot and when I eventually managed to get up, I saw it was something huge – I thought it was a dog.”In a video posted online, he described the moments wrestling with the lion. “We called for help but there was no one around. As the lion was biting my calf and my neck, I grabbed him around the neck and began to squeeze and he backed off. At that moment, the security forces came,” he said. “If I had not been strong, I wouldn’t be here right now.”Antalya’s governor said the lion had been tracked down and shot dead. “It was not possible to catch the escaped lion alive because it posed a danger to people and the environment, so it was shot,” he said.He indicated that an investigation had been opened into the incident. BirGün said there were about 30 big cats at the Land of Lions.Explore more on these topicsPakistanAnimalsTurkeySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

She said it was “a hugely important step that acknowledges the often very significant impact of pre-24 week loss, not only for those experiencing the physical loss, but for their partners too”.The decision to extend the right to couples marks a victory for the Labour MP Sarah Owen, who has campaigned for the change. The women and equalities select committee, which Owen chairs,concluded in a report in Januarythat the case for it was overwhelming.A number of employers already offer the leave as an extra benefit, but the committee said it should become a universal right given the physical andemotional impacts of baby loss.About 250,000 expectant mothers in the UK suffer a miscarriage every year. Between 10% and 20% of pregnancies end in an early miscarriage within the first 12 weeks of gestation.Ministers have announced they will review the entire system of parental leave, declaring that it is “not working” for families. They plan to investigate support for new parents, including maternity leave, paternity leave and shared arrangements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are hoping there will be proper engagement around it, but we are worried about some of the signals we are picking up.”Another said: “People are really, really worried about this. It is one of the things that is going to make people feel very, very uncomfortable.”The letter published in the Guardian is evidence of growing public concern, despite reassurances from the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, that no decisions have yet been taken about the fate of EHCPs.Signatories to the letter include academics studying disability and neurodiversity such as Prof Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the University of Cambridge’s autism research centre, and campaigners including Rosa Monckton, as well as parent-led group Special Needs Jungle.“As new education reforms loom, every sign from the government suggests the right to an education, health and care plan (EHCP) is to be removed from children attending mainstream schools. Local authorities want EHCPs drastically reduced, or removed altogether, to relieve them of duties they often find costly and troublesome,” the letter states.“Without statutory support, underpinned by necessary extra resources for schools, it’s extremely unlikely that ministers will achieve their aim of more children with Send thriving, or even surviving, in mainstream education.“A reduction or complete snatching-away of EHCPs in mainstream education wouldn’t mean their needs magically vanish. It would, instead, increase applications for already overcrowded special schools or mean they would be forced out of school altogether.”The right to an education, health and care plan must be retainedRead moreAlthough ministers contend that policies are still being developed, discussions are said to include the phasing out of EHCPs over a number of years, or restricting them to the most profound level of need.Fears about the fate of EHCPs were raised in May when Dame Christine Lenehan, the government’s strategic adviser on special educational needs and disabilities, said EHCPs would “probably” change because there were questions if they were “the right vehicle”.One Labour backbencher said several MPs had requested meetings with Phillipson and Catherine McKinnell, the school standards minister, to question them on the plans. The MP added that the meetings so far had been unsatisfactory because ministers told them only that no decision over EHCPs had yet been made.Marie Tidball, the Labour MP who gave an emotional Commons speech against the welfare bill last week, said the Send reforms were now a major focus for many of her fellow backbenchers.Speaking on a live edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast at the Crossed Wires festival in Sheffield, Tidball said: “There’s going to be lots of work done over the summer on this, and I know that colleagues will be very keen to involve backbenchers who’ve got huge amounts of experience on that issue.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is totally inaccurate to suggest that children, families and schools might experience any loss of funding or support.“This government is actively working with parents and experts on the solutions, including more early intervention to prevent needs from escalating and £740m to encourage councils to create more specialist places in mainstream schools.”One supportive MP said Phillipson and her team had done a lot of outreach to MPs to try to prevent a repeat of last week’s dramatic Commons scenes.Councils face millions in extra Send costs as overhaul delayedRead more“The education team are doing a really, really good job of engaging with people,” the person said. “There will be a consultation and a proper process.”But they added that many Labour MPs were concerned because of the amount of mail that was being generated by anxious parents. “Parents of Send kids are climbing up the walls right now,” they said. “Our job is to get them down from those walls.”EHCPs were introduced in 2014, and give statutory force to plans agreed by parents and local authorities about the additional support for children and young people up to the age of 25 with assessed special needs or disabilities.But as the number of EHCPs has rocketed above 600,000, in part because of increasing assessments of autism, ADHD and speech and language difficulties, thestrain on local authority high needs budgets, as well as related transport costs, has pushed many councils in England towards insolvency.Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsBridget PhillipsonSchoolsDisabilityChildrenChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

But a lack of money threatens to delay changes and some smaller forces may oppose the changes.One source said any changes could start with smaller forces merging or being abolished. In the west, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire could merge. In the Midlands, Warwickshire could join with the West Mercia force or be absorbed by the much bigger West Midlands force.In the east, the Norfolk and Suffolk forces could merge. The West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire and the South Yorkshire forces could also merge.Gavin Stephens, the chair of the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council, told the Guardian: “Police reform is about restructuring policing so that it can keep up with modern criminality, retaining the bedrock of community policing whilst modernising our workforce to deal with national threats such as organised crime and violence against women and girls.“Our current model of 43 different police forces in England andWaleshas a wide range of geographical size, workforce size and operational capabilities. There is also real variation in financial resilience and the ability to invest, which means policing operates in subtly different ways with often incompatible technology, which leads to inefficiencies and inconsistency.“A smaller number of police forces, supported by a national policing organisation, would enable us to make decisions far quicker and maximise funding to invest in technology and our workforce. Making improvements to our service once and for all, instead of in 43 different ways, would help to end the postcode lottery victims face when reporting crime.”One senior source said: “Everyone is in agreement we need fewer forces. It would create efficiencies and greater effectiveness.”Another source with knowledge of discussions said: “Chiefs of smaller forces are nervous but accept this is where the tide is going. We hope for a phased reduction over the next decade.”No changes are expected to happen in this parliament, and any change of government after the next election could lead to the agreement to abolish police forces being scuppered.Politically, it was believed a reduction in the number of forces would have to happen under Labour. MPs representing Conservative areas, which tend to be less urban, feared police would move from more rural areas to areas where crime tended to be higher.One chief constable said that if their force absorbed a smaller force, people in more rural areas could be offered a guarantee about how many officers would be ringfenced to protect them.As yet, no detailed plans have been drawn up or presented to the government, but Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said he favoured a reduction to as few as 12 forces. It is understood that this is the number of forces senior police chiefs think should ultimately cover England and Wales.In a piece for the Sunday Times, Rowley said: “The 43-force model was designed in the 1960s and hasn’t been fit for purpose for at least two decades. It hinders the effective confrontation of today’s threats and stops us fully reaping the benefits of technology.“We need to reduce the number of forces by two-thirds, with the new, bigger and fully capable regional forces supported by the best of modern technology and making better use of the limited funding available.”In Scotland, forces have already merged into one organisation covering the entire country, which is the second largest in the UK behind the Met. Northern Ireland is also covered by a single force.Explore more on these topicsPoliceEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It forced carmakers to sell an increasing proportion of electric cars or face steep fines of up to £15,000 for every vehicle above their fossil fuel quota.UK electric car sales up by a third in first half of 2025, preliminary data suggestsRead moreHowever, in April the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, confirmed the Labour government would relax the rules after anintensive lobbying campaign by the UK car industryagainst the policy.TheVauxhall maker Stellantisblamed its decision to close its Luton van factory on the mandate, although earlier comments by executivesappeared to undermine that argument.Carmakers are aiming for a headline target of 28% electric sales to avoid fines this year, but “flexibilities” within the rules mean the effective target – as calculated by New AutoMotive – is much lower.That is because manufacturers are allowed to borrow electric sales from later years and to gain credit for cutting emissions by selling more hybrids. After the government climbdown manufacturers are to be given more freedom on how they meet their yearly targets and to face lower fines.Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive, said: “Carmakers are within touching distance of their targets for 2025 before taking into account the government’s decision to weaken the targets for this year.“This impressive progress should reassure ministers that ambitious targets spur the innovation and dynamism the UK needs to achieve net zero and get ahead in the global shift towards electric vehicles.”Weakening the rules could benefit individual carmakers in particular. New AutoMotive’s analysis suggests the Japanese carmaker Nissan is the farthest away from what it needs to achieve in 2025, as it waits for its factory in Sunderland in northern England to start production of its new Leaf electric car.Toyota and JLR, maker of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, are also well behind their effective targets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He then went on to claim that Musk was motivated by discontent over his plan to end subsidies to promote the purchase of electric vehicles.Trump also accused Musk of seeking improper influence by asking the president to nominate his friend, Jared Isaacman, to be Nasa administrator. After Musk left his role as a special government employee in theTrump administration, Isaacman’s nomination was withdrawn. “I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life,” Trump wrote.Elon Musk’s ‘America’ party could focus on a few pivotal congressional seatsRead moreEarlier on Sunday, Trump’s treasury secretary saidMuskshould focus on running his companies and keep himself out of politics, a day after the world’s richest person – and a former White House adviser – announced theformation of a new political party.“The principles of Doge were very popular – I think if you looked at the polling Elon was not,” Scott Bessent said on CNN’s State of the Union, referring to the so-called “department of government efficiency” that Musktemporarily headedafter Trump’s second presidency began in January.Opinion polls found Doge and Musk’s work implementing brutal spending and job cuts within the federal government to bedeeply unpopular. And Bessent alluded to how investors in Musk’s companies – including the electrical vehicle maker Tesla, whosesaleshave sufferedduring Doge’s existence – publicly pleaded for his time with the Trump administration to be short-lived.“So I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies,” Bessent remarked. “I imagine that those boards of directors did not like this announcement yesterday, and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.”Bessent’s reaction came after Musk delivered on his promise to form a new party, and accused his one-time ally Trump of “bankrupting” the country by signing his massive tax and spending bill into law.The tech billionaireannouncedthe creation of the America party in a series of posts late on Saturday and early Sunday to X, the social media platform he owns.“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,”he wrote.“Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”Musk, who was appointed to slash federal spending through the unofficial Doge from January through May, has been avocalcriticof Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said wouldincrease the national deficitby $3.3tn (£2.85tn) through 2034.It provides substantial tax cuts for the super wealthy whileslashing federal safety net welfareprograms, with up to 10.6 million people losing healthcare insurance.The pair have feuded over its cost and impacts since Muskleft the governmentin May, and on Friday, when Trumpsignedthe bill into law in a Fourth of July picnic at the White House, the Tesla and SpaceX chief opened apoll on X: “the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system”.Respondents voted two to one in the affirmative, Musk announced late on Saturday. He gave few details about the structure of his new venture or a timeline for its creation. But his earlier posts suggested it would focus on two or three Senate seats, and eight to 10 House districts.Both chambers of Congress are narrowly controlled by Republicans.“Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” Musksaid.Bessent was one Trump ally to quickly take a swipe at Musk’s move.Musk’s series of posts to X, which continued into the early hours of Sunday, also appeared to indicate that his on-again, off-again relationship with Trump was firmly back in negative territory.When the pair fell out earlier in the summer, Musk lashed out during anastonishing social media duelin which he stated Trump’s name was in the files relating to associates of the late pedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Musk later deleted the post andapologized to the presidentas they embarked on an uneasy truce. On Sunday, however, Musk returned to the subject, reposting a photo of the jailed Epstein facilitator Ghislaine Maxwell that questioned why she was the only person in prison while men who engaged in sex with underage girls – a crime colloquially known in the US as statutory rape – were not.In other posts he said it would be “not hard” to break the two-party stranglehold inUS politicsenjoyed by Democrats and Republicans. And he questioned “when & where should we hold the inaugural American Party congress? This will be super fun!”If the US president threatens to take away freedoms, are we no longer free?Read moreTrump has made clear his feelings about his former friend in recent days after criticism of the bill.In response to Musk’s posts calling the bill “insane”, Trump said he might“look into” deportingthe South African-born, naturalized US citizen billionaire. The president also mused about slashing subsidies to his companies, especially SpaceX, which holds billions of dollars ingovernment contracts.“Doge is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be terrible?” Trump asked reporters on Tuesday.There is no requirement for new political parties in the US to register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) initially, butreporting regulations kick inonce spending surpasses what the FEC calls “certain thresholds”.Musk is estimated to have spent more than $275m of his personal fortune helping to get Trump elected to a second term in the White House in last November’s presidential election.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsTeslaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Abbott said that officials were still searching for 41 known missing persons across the state.“We are seeing bodies recovered all over up and down,” Kerrville’s city manager, Dalton Rice, told reporters at an earlier briefing on Sunday.‘A river with a temper’ returns to calm after wreaking deadly devastation in TexasRead moreAuthorities said about 850 people had been rescued, with more than 400 people involved in the search and rescue operation.By Sunday morning, water levels had fallen to just a foot or two higher than before the flood. On Sunday afternoon, people in Kerrvillereceived an emergency alerton their phone, reading: “High confidence of river flooding at North Folks of river. Move to higher ground.”Further rain on Saturday and into Sunday morning hampered search efforts of crews using boats, helicopters and drones. Abbott promised responders would remain at the scene until every individual was recovered. He said he instructed responders to assume all missing persons were still alive.MapThe US homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, was in Texas as Donald Trumpannounced on social mediathat he had signed a federal emergency declaration that would free additional resources to support local efforts. Trump also posted a letter saying federal efforts would be coordinated by Benjamin Abbott of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). In May, that agency’s acting administratorwas firedafter he told Congress he did not believe it was “in the best interest of the American people to eliminate” Fema, which Trump and Noem have said they plan to do.Asked on Sunday if he is still planning to phase out Fema, Trump told a reporter: “Well, Fema is something we can talk about later, but right now they’re busy working.”Noem defended the federal response to the disaster at a press conference Saturday afternoon, promising that “relief will be coming”. Yet questions continued to swirl over the Trump administration’s actions that some believe could have contributed to the severity of the event.In particular, harsh budget cutbacks affecting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) have left numerous keyweather forecasting offices short of staff, including the Austin-San Antonio office of the National Weather Service (NWS).Officials defended the service on Sunday, insisting warnings of flash flooding wereissued in advance. But some residents said they hadn’t received them – which Texas’s lieutenant governor Dan Patrick acknowledged Sunday on Fox News. And an initial NWS forecast had called for only 3-6in of rain – not the intense downpour that triggered the deadly flooding.The Washington Postreportedthat 1.8tn gallons of rain fell over the Texas Hill Country – which includes Kerrville – and Edwards Plateau on Friday morning.Matthew Stone, 44, of Kerrville, said police came knocking on doors – but that he had received no warning on his phone.“We got no emergency alert. There was nothing” until suddenly there was “a pitch-black wall of death”, Stone said.Questions are being asked with increasing intensity about the timing and manner of warnings about the flood danger issued by Kerr county, with updates posted on Facebook in the middle of the night unlikely to have been seen by those in danger. A local officialtold the New York Timesthat emergency alert systems are expensive and the county’s taxpayers had not previously wanted to pay for one.Other nearby towns do have outdoor early warning sirens that are activated for life-threatening emergencies such as flooding. On Friday morning, emergency sirens reportedly blared in Comfort, less than 20 miles from Kerrville, warning residents to evacuate as the Guadalupe River rose. Abbott told reporters on Sunday that the lack of sirens near riverside camps is “something that will be looked at”.In thetense final momentsof a news conference on Sunday morning, Rice, the Kerrville city manager, refused to answer a reporter’s question about why information about the threat of flooding was not passed to camps along the river. “That is a great question,” he said, “but again, we want to make sure that we continue to focus, we still have 11 missing children that we want to get reunited with their families.”Rice and other local officials then ended the news conference and walked away as reporters pressed them for answers. “Sir, was any emergency alert given out on the fourth, that morning of? Did anyone get any alerts?” one reporter asked. “Sir, there are families that deserve better than that,” another said as Rice opened a door and walked out.The Republican Texas congressman Chip Roy, whose district includes Kerr county, said at the Sunday press conference that actions taken before and during the flooding would be scrutinized.“There’s going to be a lot of finger-pointing, a lot of second-guessing,” he said. “There’s a lot of people saying ‘why’ and ‘how,’ and I understand that.”Abbott said late Saturday that he had visited Camp Mystic, a popular Christian summer retreat for girls on the banks of the Guadalupe River in Hunt.The camp, which had more than 750 girls in attendance at the time of the flood, was overrun by a torrent of water, sweeping away 27 that were initially missing. The number of missing from there by Sunday had dropped to 12, as the death toll climbed, according to officials.Sarah Marsh, an eight-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was at the camp,was found dead Saturday, as was Dick Eastland, the camp’s longtime director who was reportedly found along with three girls he tried to rescue. Eastland’s sontold the Washington Posthis father had tried to rescue the girls in Bubble Inn cabin, situated about 150 yards from the river’s edge.“It, and the river running beside it, were horrendously ravaged in ways unlike I’ve seen in any natural disaster,” Abbott said in a post to X after touring the ruins of the Camp Mystic with rescue crews.“The height the rushing water reached to the top of cabins was shocking. We won’t stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins.”The camp, long a home for the daughters of the Texas political elite, imposed a ban on both cellphones and social media for campers, closing them off from distraction but also from two modes of receiving emergency warnings.Former president George W Bush and his wife, Laura, said in a statement that they “are heartbroken by the loss of life and the agony so many are feeling”. Laura Bush once worked as a counselor at the camp during her college years.Also confirmed dead was Jane Ragsdale, the director of the nearby Heart O’ the Hills camp, who was described by friends as a “pillar of the community”.Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas decision of emergency management, said Friday that early NWS forecasts “did not predict the amount of rain that we saw”. His comments prompted a defense of the service Sunday by the private weather service AccuWeather, which said in a statement that Friday’s pre-dawn warnings “should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety”.Meanwhile, Tom Fahy, legislative director for the NWS employees organization, told CNN that he believed the service’s Texas offices had “adequate staffing and resources”. Yet he said the Austin-San Antonio office was missing a warning coordination meteorologist, a crucial link between the NWS and emergency managers.A Noaa official told the network that the vacancy, along with several other key roles, were the result of the White House offering early retirement incentives after Trump’s second presidency began in January.Identities of more of those killed were becoming known on Sunday, as survivorsshared extraordinary storiesof how they were spared.Two children from Dallas, Blair Harber, 13, and her 11-year-old sister Brooke, were among those confirmed dead, by officials at the Catholic high school they attended. They were staying at a riverside cabin with their grandparents, who are missing.Their father, RJ Harber, who was staying with his wife in an adjacent cabin, told CNN that Blair “was a gifted student and had a generous kind heart” and that Brooke “was like a light in any room, people gravitated to her and she made them laugh and enjoy the moment”.High school soccer coach Reece Zunker and his wife, Tina, were among the Kerr county victims, theKerryville Daily Times reported– and their two children are missing.The newspaper also identifiedteacher Jeff Wilsonamong the victims, with his wife, Amber, and son Shiloh unaccounted for.Officials in Burnet countytold KHOU TVthat a local fire department chief was among three fatalities there.Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025Trump administrationUS weatherTexasFloodingExtreme weatherNatural disastersnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of people have already been pulled from floodwaters that have killed nearly 70 people so far, many of them children at a summer camp along the banks of the Guadalupe River.July is peak flash flood season in the US, and centralTexasis known as “flash flood alley” because the necessary ingredients of tropical moisture and slow-moving storms come together often over hilly terrain there. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters caution that more floods could come this weekend and into next week.The scale of this latest climate disaster became apparent on Saturday asdrone footagetaken on Saturday morning showed entire neighborhoods inundated and rushing waters streaming through small town streets.Tales of survival and heartbreakwere plentiful.LiveDrone footage shows extent of deadly Texas flooding – video‘A river with a temper’ returns to calm after wreaking deadly devastation in TexasRead moreAn initial analysis of the downpours and the decisions by forecasters that led up to them by the Guardian shows that rainfall of this magnitude was exceedingly rare and difficult to predict, even for this flood-prone region.Friday’s totals of more than 10in (25cm) of rain in three hours could be expectedjust once in a “typical” 500-year periodfor Kerrville, Texas – three months’ worth of rain in just a few hours.Radar datashow that more than 4in per hour fell during the peak of Friday’s rains. That rainfall intensity was in excess of asimilar flash flood in 1987that also ended in tragedy for campers along the Guadalupe.Saturday’s rainfall totals actually exceeded Friday’s rainfall for a region slightly north of Friday’s peak rains. Nearly 14in of rain fell in five hours just west of Austin, Texas – rains that would be expected just once innearly 1,000 yearsgiven a stable climate.Despitefunding cuts and widespread staffing shortagesimplemented by theTrump administration, NWS forecasters in both the local San Angelo office and at the NWS national specialty center responsible for excessive rainfall provided a series of watches and warnings in the days and hours leading up to Friday’s flooding disaster.The forecast office in San Angelo has two current vacancies – typical for the pre-Trump era and fewer than the current average staff shortage across the NWS – and has not been experiencing any lapses in weather balloon data collection that have plagued some other offices.map of texas showing flood regionIn fact,weather balloon datagathered on Thursday from Del Rio showed record amounts of moisture present in the upper atmosphere above central Texas and added to the confidence that severe flash flooding was possible. The Del Rio office then began issuing a series of flood watchesstarting on Thursday afternoonthat cautioned the region to prepare for “excessive runoff” from “5 to 7 inches of rain”.The NWS’s Weather Prediction Center, based in College Park, Maryland, also issued a series ofmesoscale precipitation discussionson Thursday – highly detailed advance notices to other weather forecasters that a particularly rare event might be underway. In one of the discussions, forecasters noted that moisture content in central Texas was “above the 99th climatological percentile” – far in excess of normal and a clue that historic flooding was possible.In a final escalation, the NWS office in San Angelo issued aflash flood emergencyabout an hour before the water started rapidly rising beyond flood stage at theclosest US Geological Survey river monitoring gauge. A flash flood emergency is the highest level of flood warning available to the NWS, and sufficient toset off the Wireless Emergency Alert system, which would have triggered cellphone alarms in the region.The National Weather Service issueddozens of additional flash flood warningsthroughout the day on Friday and Saturday after the second wave of extremely heavy rains compounded the flooding’s scope across central Texas during the early morning hours.Even though watches and warnings were issued on time throughout the disaster – contrasting what local officials have said in press conferences – rainfall totals specified in the first flash flood watch were about half of what ultimately fell.Texas continues grim flood recovery with at least 50 killed, including 15 childrenRead moreCurrent weather forecasting technology is capable of knowing that near-record rainfall may occur somewhere in a given region about a day in advance, but knowing exactly how much and in which part of a specific river’s drainage basin over hilly terrain makes flood forecasting much more difficult – analogous to prediction exactly which neighborhood a tornado might strike a day ahead of time. Donald Trump’s staffing cuts have particularly hit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’sEnvironmental Modeling Center, which aims to improve the skill of these types ofdifficult forecasts.Though it’s unclear to what extent staffing shortages across the NWS complicated the advance notice that local officials had of an impending flooding disaster, it’s clear that this was a complex, compound tragedy of a type that climate warming is making more frequent.Rainfall intensity in central Texas has been trending upward for decades, and this week’s rains were enhanced by the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which made landfall in northern Mexico last week. Barry’s circulation pulled record amounts of atmospheric moisture up to central Texas from the near-record warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.The mix of Barry’s circulation and climate warming helped create conditions ofrecord-high atmospheric moisture contentover central Texas – in line with the trend towardsincreasing atmospheric moisture contentglobally as the world warms and the air can hold more water vapor.Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025US weatherExtreme weatherClimate crisisFloodingTexasanalysisShareReuse this content"

They are 37-53, and the only other National League club with a worse record is the Colorado Rockies.“Our family is eternally grateful for their years of dedication to the organization, including their roles in bringing a World Series trophy to Washington,” owner Mark Lerner said in a statement. “While we are appreciative of their past successes, the on-field performance has not been where we or our fans expect it to be. This is a pivotal time for our club, and we believe a fresh approach and new energy is the best course of action for our team moving forward.”Rizzo’s time running the Nationals is over after more than a decade and a half. One of the Lerners’ first hires when they assumed control of the organization, Rizzo had been GM since 2009 and had president of baseball operations added to his title in 2013.Debacle in the desert: will the Athletics’ $1.75bn stadium on the Vegas Strip ever be built?Read more“He played an instrumental role in leading the transformation of our farm system and building a roster that reached an unprecedented level of organizational success,” Lerner said. “Mike helped make us who we are as an organization, and we’re so thankful to him for his hard work and dedication.”Senior VP and assistant GM Mike DeBartolo is taking over for Rizzo on an interim basis. Washington has the No 1 pick in the upcoming draft.“Mike DeBartolo is a smart and thoughtful executive, and we’re fortunate to have him as part of our organization,” Lerner said. “We are confident in his ability to lead the baseball operations staff through these next, important months.”Martinez became the fourth manager fired since the start of the season after Pittsburgh’s Derek Shelton, Colorado’s Bud Black and Baltimore’s Brandon Hyde.It was not immediately clear who would succeed Martinez, who last month bristled at a question about how to spread the blame among players and coaches.“It’s never on coaching,” Martinez said in June. “Never on coaching. Coaches work their (butts) off every single day. We’re not going to finger point here and say it’s coaches. It’s never on the coaches. They work hard. The message is clear. All the work is done prior. So, sometimes, they have to go out there and play the game. It’s always been about the players. Always.”Martinez had never been a manager at any level when Rizzo hired him to replace Dusty Baker before the 2018 season. The Nationals went 82-80 in Martinez’s first season and got off to a 19-31 start the following year, leading to some calls for him to be replaced.The myth of the Big Dumper: how Cal Raleigh became a Seattle folk heroRead moreBut Rizzo stuck with Martinez, and that decision paid off in a big way: Led by starting pitchers Stephen Strasburg, who earned World Series MVP honors, and Max Scherzer, rookie outfielder Juan Soto, young shortstop Trea Turner and a string of veterans — including Howie Kendrick, Ryan Zimmerman and Anthony Rendon — the Nationals won the franchise’s first title.They took a step back in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, and then Rizzo began tearing apart the roster, making a series of trades that sent Scherzer, Soto, Turner and others elsewhere.The reconstruction has continued, without much in the way of concrete progress in the standings to show for it, although the team does have some building blocks that show promise, including starter MacKenzie Gore, shortstop CJ Abrams and outfielders James Wood and Dylan Crews. Gore and Wood are NL All-Stars.“Nationals fans have a lot to be optimistic about, and we see these changes as a difficult, but necessary move in a positive direction,” Lerner said. “As has been the case since my late father took control of the team almost 20 years ago, our family remains committed to winning.”Washington finished fourth or fifth in the NL East every year from 2020 through 2024, never putting together a higher winning percentage than the .438 (71-91) each of the last two seasons. The team is again in last place.Martinez’s full record with the Nationals was 500-622.“I’ve always appreciated and admired Davey’s passion for the game of baseball and the love he has for his players,” Lerner said. “Davey’s ability to connect with our staff, our players, our fans and our community set him apart. While this chapter has come to an end, we know that it doesn’t close the book on what should continue to be a long and successful career in baseball.”Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

At 3-3 in the third set here on Sunday, after two and a half sets of outrageous hitting,Carlos Alcarazheld a break point to finally move ahead in the match for the first time. He then produced the kind of athleticism and shot-making that make him such an incredible champion, going side to side, sliding across the court and ripping an unstoppable forehand past the onrushing Andrey Rublev.Until that point, the Russian had played outstanding tennis, testing the Spaniard with big serving, huge ground strokes and staying calm, which has not always been the case. But Alcaraz, like all great champions, has an uncanny ability to turn it on when he needs to and from that point on, he pulled away for a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory that takes his winning streak to 22 matches and secures aclash with Britain’s Cameron Norrie.Cameron Norrie sinks Jarry in five-set epic to reach Wimbledon quarter-finalsRead moreAlcaraz hit 22 aces and even served and volleyed 15 times, winning 13 of those points, as he moved into the last eight for the ninth time in his past 10 slams. He has won 18 matches in a row here, too, and remains ­favourite to win the title for a third straight year.“Andrey is one of the most powerful players we have on tour,” Alcaraz said of Rublev. “You kind of feel he’s pushing you to the limit on every ball. I am just really happy with the way I moved today. I think I played intelligent, smart today, tactically, which I’m really proud about.”Taylor Fritz, meanwhile, may be beginning to believe that the tennis gods are on his side at Wimbledon this year. After a narrow escape against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard of Francein the first round, when he trailed by two sets to one and 5-1 in the fourth set tie-break, the American was given an easy passage through to the quarter-finals when his opponent, Jordan Thompson, pulled out due to a hamstring injury.View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz sealed his place in the quarter-finals when Jordan Thompson withdrew from their match due to a hamstring injury.Photograph: Joanna Chan/APThe fifth seed was leading 6-1, 3-0 when Thompson called it quits. The Australian had been battling a lower back problem throughout the tournament and pulled up early on clutching his right hamstring. Clearly hampered, especially in his sideways movement, he took a medical ­timeout at 2-0 down in the second set but after playing one more game, he decided to give up.The match lasted just 41 minutes in all, including the timeout, which Fritz will doubtless be grateful for as he prepares to face Russia’s Karen Khachanov, who beat Kamil ­Majchrzak of Poland 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Khachanov has won both his matches with Fritz, even if the most recent one was five years ago.“I think our games are quite ­similar overall,” Fritz said. “To be honest, we practise [together] all the time, so we’re pretty familiar with each other’s games. But I think I improved a ton and have become a much, much better player since the last time we played.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonCarlos AlcarazTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It includes a total of 13 players – the headline moves include Durant going to Houston from Phoenix, the Rockets sending Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks to the Suns, and the Rockets acquiring Clint Capela from the Hawks.Myles Turner to join Bucks, who waive Damian Lillard, in NBA free agency surpriseRead moreThe seven-team involvement in the Durant trade tops the previous record, a six-team transaction last summer that most notably sent Klay Thompson to the Dallas Mavericks. Golden State – Thompson’s former team – obviously was another part of that trade, as were Charlotte, Minnesota, Philadelphia and Denver on varying levels.“One of the greatest to ever play the game, we are grateful for the impact Kevin made on our organization and in our community,” Phoenix general manager Brian Gregory said of Durant. “As a member of the Suns, he climbed the scoring charts to become just the eighth player in NBA history to score 30,000 career points, and we wish him the best as he continues his career in Houston.”There will be at least five second-round draft picks in the deal before all terms are satisfied, the potential for another second-round pick swap and the Hawks and Timberwolves both had to receive some cash considerations to make all the math work. And some of those draft picks won’t actually be made until 2032, which raises the serious possibility that some players who will go down in history as being part of the trade haven’t reached high school yet.Durant averaged 26.6 points last season, his 17th in the NBA — not counting one year missed because of injury. For his career, the 6ft 11in forward is averaging 27.2 points and seven rebounds per game.Deandre Ayton set to join LeBron, Luka and the Lakers after Portland buyoutRead moreThe move brings Durant back to the state of Texas, where he played his only year of college basketball for the Longhorns and was the college player of the year before going as the No 2 pick in the 2007 draft by Seattle.Houston becomes his fifth franchise, joining the SuperSonics (who then became the Oklahoma City Thunder), Golden State, Brooklyn and Phoenix. Durant won his two titles with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018, and last summer in Paris he became the highest-scoring player in US Olympic basketball history and the first men’s player to be part of four gold-medal teams.Durant is a four-time scoring champion, a two-time Finals MVP and one of eight players in NBA history with more than 30,000 career points.“Having played against Kevin and coached him before, I know he’s the type of competitor who fits with what we’ve been building here in Houston,” Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. “His skill level, love of basketball, and dedication to his craft have made him one of the most respected players of his generation, and my staff and I are excited to work with him.”Houston sent Green and Brooks to Phoenix, along with the rights to Khaman Maluach from last month’s draft, a second-round pick in 2026 and another second-rounder in 2032. The Hawks got David Roddy, cash and a 2031 second-round pick swap from the Rockets. Brooklyn gets a 2026 second-round pick and another in 2030 from the Rockets, and the Warriors received the rights to Jahmai Mashack from last month’s draft.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now it will be remembered as a milestone and career high for Lando Norris, a maiden win at his home race and the victory he has long coveted.The British GP has thrown up swathes of superlative races in those 75 seasons and this year’s earned its place among them. Under gunmetal grey skies and lowering clouds an afternoon of incident and drama unfolded, of fortune and fury, and for one driver a moment of finally discharging a particularly unwanted monkey, as the old airfield once more proved a grand stage.Lando Norris savours ‘dream’ British GP win but Piastri left hurt and confusedRead moreFor Norris there was untrammelled joy. He has wanted this one since he began his F1 career in 2019. There were no tears as he took the flag, but just the sheer unbridled and enthusiastic joy that has endeared the 25-year-old to so many fans, not least the 10,000 who had packed out his dedicated Landostand at Stowe corner.His victory across a race that veered from wet to dry conditions and back again, at times with startling ferocity, was a consummate and controlled drive as the treacherous surface tested the very best of the drivers. Yet he admitted it was not his hardest fought win because at its heart lay controversy. He beat his McLaren teammateOscar Piastriinto second, after the Australian had led for much of the race but was hit with a 10-second penalty for “erratic braking” just after a safety-car restart.Where Norris could barely contain his glee, Piastri was furious in the car at the decision and afterwards exhibited a cold, focused indignation that all but seethed in the air around him, even as he declined to discuss his feelings on the decision in detail.His taciturn approach a reflected a major concern among drivers that they dare not speak critically of the stewards or the FIA for fear the governing body will punish them. It is an unhealthy and deeply unsatisfying scenario for everyone involved.View image in fullscreenCharles Leclerc (right) cuts through the wet conditions at Silverstone.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesPiastri had taken the lead from Red Bull’sMax Verstappen– who later spun struggling for grip and finished in fifth as his title hopes spiralled further out of reach – early in the race. Then, at the end of a safety-car period as the lights went out, the Australian braked hard, looking for temperature in the tyres and dropping from 135mph to 32mph. Verstappen, behind him, moved over to avoid him, held his hands in the air in anger and immediately told his team: “Whoa, mate, fuck, he just suddenly slows down again.”.The stewards investigated and concluded Piastri had braked “erratically”, forcing Verstappen to take “evasive action”. It was a conclusion with which the Australian disagreed, insisting afterwards the Dutchman did not have to evade him at all.The 10 seconds cost him a likely win when he took them during a pit stop, giving Norris the lead. Piastri threw hisMcLarenround the track with a righteous fury and even asked his team to order Norris to switch places, so outraged was he.McLaren, rightly, declined. Norris had earned his position and was at no point at fault. But it was an unedifying affair and, as Piastri observed, somewhat confusing given that at the recent Canadian Grand Prix the stewards had dismissed a protest byRed Bullthat George Russell had similarly braked erratically, albeit in differing conditions.For Norris, then, the plaudits and while he has had more impressive wins, he did not care. He had kept it clean and on the island while barrelling round with aplomb. Moreover, having won last weekend in Austria, these were his first back-to-back wins in F1 and has closed the gap to Piastri in the championship to just eight points. At the halfway point of the season it is clear the two McLaren drivers are now set to go blow for blow until the finale.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the tumult of the changing conditions as the track slipped between wet and dry and strategies were being concocted on the hoof,Sauberquietly pulled off a coup. After they called the perfect moment for Nico Hülkenberg to take fresh intermediate tyres, the German exploited it and found himself marching through the field with rapidity. By the final stages he was in third.Hülkenberg has been competing in F1 since 2010 and at Silverstone was in his 239th race, during which period he has never taken a podium. But as the sun finally began to shine, there he was seeing off a chasingLewis Hamiltonto earn his very first place on the steps.That his first and only trophy in F1 was made of Lego – as were they all, alongside the traditional RAC Trophy – will matter not a jot to the well-liked German, who celebrated with wild abandon alongside his team. Indeed so unexpected a place was it that Sauber had but two bottles of champagne laid on with which to celebrate. A shortfall corrected swiftly by the Mercedes and Aston Martin teams from their own readily stocked stash. It was a suitably noble gesture for another notable British GP.Quick GuideF1 British Grand Prix resultsShow1. Lando Norris (McLaren) 1hr 37min 15.735sec2. Oscar Piastri (McLaren) +6.8123.

It was an incredible atmosphere.”Initially though Iceland proved rather awkward guests, almost scoring inside the first minute when Ingibjörg Sigurdardóttir’s half-volley struck the crossbar following her connection with a long throw.After more than a week of glorious Swiss summer sun heavy rain lashed down on Berne, leaving players from both sides slipping and sliding on the pitch, and forcing the Iceland manager, Thorsteinn Halldórsson, to keep wiping raindrops from his glasses.Sundhage, sheltering deep in the dugout, watched her team whip in a corner and Svenja Fölmi head goalwards.View image in fullscreenAlayah Pilgrim celebrates after doubling Switzerland’s lead in the final minute.Photograph: Til Buergy/EPAWhen the ball hit Glódis Viggósdóttir it flew into the back of the net and, almost everyone bar the 2,000 Iceland fans present went wild. Or at least they did until VAR intervened to correctly disallow that effort for a foul in the preamble, namely Fölmi’s overly aggressive block on Viggosdóttir.For a while things turned ­thoroughly niggly and scrappy. There were far too many cheap concessions of possessions, snide fouls, substandard set pieces and disappointing final balls.Barcelona’s Sydney Schertenleib had the crowd on the edge of their seats whenever she ran at Iceland’s back line but sometimes wayward final decision making betrayed the exciting 18-year-old’s very real talent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When ­Schertenleib swivelled seamlessly and cued up a perfectly poised Reuteler to unleash a beautifully weighted low shot, ­Iceland looked condemned to an earlier than hoped flight back to Reykjavík.Indeed with Reuteler increasingly influential in midfield, a ­swashbuckling Swiss finale was crowned by Pilgrim’s fabulous, if deflected, 90th-minute finish from the edge of the penalty area.“We have a really young team,” said Wälti. “In some actions we can be a little but rushed and we wasted a lot of chances before, in the end, we took them.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballSwitzerland women's football teamIceland women's football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Caroline Graham Hansen’s late winner in Sion broke Helmarit hearts after Oona Sevenius had cancelled out Eva Nyström’s unfortunate early own goal. Switzerland’s 2-0 win over Iceland in the late game sealed their passage into the quarter-finals.It was Norway’s experience that eventually told when their decorated vice-captain struck in the 84th minute against the run of play.“Every player in this team is important,” their head coach, Gemma Grainger, said. “Caro today with the individual brains to get the goal and then [the rest of the team] for the work they put in. We’re a very together team. We understand where our strengths are.”“The most important thing is that you get the three points. At this level, at this tournament, the games are so competitive. You’re not going to have every moment of every game … we found a way to win and I am very happy to be sat here with the three points.”It had been a turbulent evening for Norway, who continue to frustrate. It proved a far from convincing outing once again as they struggled against hard-working opposition who dominated much of the encounter.Norway 2-1 Finland: Women’s Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreFinland have been one of the surprises of so far. The lowest-ranked team in Group A have looked good with their midfield press and their ability to break at pace, backed up by their energetic wingbacks, Katariina Kosola and Emma Koivisto.Marko Saloranta made one change. Sevenius is among several promising young players and the Rosengard forward came in for Sanni Franssi. Grainger also retained 10 players from Norway’s unconvincing win over Switzerland, with Mathilde Harviken replacing Maren Mjelde in central defence.Norway started brightly enough and found early joy. With the first attack of the game, the ever-dangerous Graham Hansen ghosted past Joanna Tynnilä before sending a low ball in to the danger area. Aware that Frida Maanum was lurking behind her, Nyström stuck out a leg to send it unwittingly into her own net.Saloranta’s side, however, were determined not to let that moment dictate the rest of the match. Their packed midfield, anchored by Eveliina Summanen and inspired by tireless Oona Siren, gave Norway little joy. They controlled 67% of possession in the first 25 minutes, an indication of their growing confidence. Cecilie Fiskerstrand was the first of the two goalkeepers to be truly tested, producing a fingertip stop to deny an instinctive half-volley from Linda Sällström.Norway had chances of their own. Ingrid Engen crashed a header off the bar before Anna Koivunen tipped a Vilde Bøe Risa corner on to a post. The Finland keeper then made a superb save from Ada Hegerberg.Finland were worthy of their equaliser when it did eventually come. Splitting open the Norway defence, Siren fed Sevenius, who sent her shot flying into the net. The celebrations from players and coach alike said it all as Saloranta danced down the touchline in delight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When they reflect on this one, they will surely rue their missed opportunities.With Finland’s energy levels dipping, Norway saw the opportunity to go for the jugular. The warning signs were there when Graham Hansen inexplicably skied a shot from inside the box. She was not going to make the same mistake twice and when she was afforded space with just six minutes remaining, she floated in what looked like a cross that clipped the far post and went in.View image in fullscreenThe Haut de Cry mountain and the Basilique de Valere loom over the game in Sion.Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Norway women's football teamFinland women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Negotiations are continuing over a fee for the 27-year-old, with Arsenal hoping to strike a deal for less than the£68m asking price.Gyökeres has made no secret of his desire for a new challenge, having scored 54 goals for Sporting last season, and is understood to have made clear hewants to join Arsenaldespite interest from elsewhere in the Premier League, including Manchester United.Transfer news has lost its sense of wonder and surprise in era of ‘my sources tell me …’ | Max RushdenRead moreArsenal had identified Gyökeres as one of their two main targets to add firepower, with strong interest also in RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. With Mikel Arteta keen to bring in reinforcements as soon as possible, Arsenal’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, is understood to have stepped up efforts to sign Gyökeres after the arrival of the midfielder Martín Zubimendi was confirmed on Sunday.Gyökeres, who joinedSportingfrom Coventry in 2023, is believed to have agreed a five-year deal at the Emirates. It is understood that his former club Brighton would be due money under a sell-on clause.Zubimendi, whoturned down Liverpoollast summer, has joined on a five-year deal. The Spain international was heavily linked with Real Madrid in recent weeks despite being understood in March to have a pre-agreement to join Arsenal.Arteta made the 26-year-old his primary midfield target as Arsenal attempt to bridge the gap after three successive runners-up finishes in the Premier League, and Zubimendi’s signing represents a major boost after the departures of Jorginho and Thomas Partey at the end of their contacts last week.Partey was chargedwith five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault – allegations he denies – three days after leaving.View image in fullscreenMartín Zubimendi, who has 18 Spain caps, says Arsenal’s ‘style of play is a good fit for me’.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArsenal are believed to have been searching for midfield replacements since last summer, with Zubimendi emerging as their preferred option thanks to his impressive displays for Real Sociedad and Spain. Their attempts to sign him last summeralongside Mikel Merino– who left Real Sociedad for about £32m – are understood to have been rejected because the Spanish side did not want to lose both players in the same transfer window.Arsenal were able to secure a pre-agreement in March after continuing talks. The fee is believed to be slightly more than his release clause of £51m after they fought off late interest from Madrid, whose new manager, Xabi Alonso, coached Zubimendi for Real Sociedad’s B side.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England will be out if they lose against the Netherlands and France get a point or more against Wales in the later kick-off.Lionesses will be going home if they do not shape up but history offers hope | Tom GarryRead more“A lot of the time, we thrive under pressure,” Hemp said. “Every game we go into we want to win. Based on how we acted in the last 10 minutes of the game, you can see we know what’s at stake. We obviously want to get as far as we can. We are reigning champions and that is important to remember and gain confidence from.“I love playing in football matches where we need to win – they’re the games you want to be involved in – so it’s important we take confidence from parts of yesterday.”England were unlucky that an almost invisible offside denied them the opening goal before France struck twice at the Stadion Letzigrund. Then a late rally was held off by a France defence without the dropped Wendie Renard and injured Griedge Mbock.“Obviously, we’re really disappointed with the result,” said Hemp. “It was back out on the grass for a lot of the girls today and I think you can see a lot of confidence too.”Hemp was talking pitchside after a community open training session at England’s base, at the home of Glattbrugg, who invited their women’s and girls’ teams to watch alongside other local clubs and schools and the local mayor. The forward said what had been missing against France was “quality in possession”.“We pride ourselves on that as a team,” she said. “Unfortunately, sometimes in games you fail to have that and make mistake after mistake, but it’s important that we reflect on that. We know that we can be better, but something that we can take from the game is the fight that we showed.

After it, off it, you’ve got to come together rather than push each other further apart.

Now diplomatic cables have emerged in Colombia shedding fresh light on the diplomatic frenzy caused bythe arrest of Bobby Moore, then captain of the reigning champions, England, days before the start of the 1970 tournament in Mexico.The previously unseen documents show how Moore’s trip to the Fuego Verdejewellery shop in Bogotá, the Colombian capital, sparked a desperate campaign from the British Foreign Office to free the West Ham centre-back. The enormous pressure exerted on Colombia by the Foreign Office may have swayed the judge’s decision in the case, a new podcast series El Capitán y el Brazalete de Esmeraldas (The Captain and the Emerald Bracelet) concluded.The podcast hears from the shop assistant, Clara Padilla, who accused Moore of swiping the £600 emerald bracelet while accompanied by Bobby Charlton and another teammate. Padilla broke her silence for the first time in more than 50 years, shortly before she died of cancer in February, to maintain that Moore had indeed taken the bracelet five decades ago.“I just wanted people to know that I was never lying, I never accused Bobby Moore falsely,” she told the podcast days before her death. “I know what I saw.”The allegations that Moore had casually stolen the jewellery on the eve of the World Cup threatened to prevent him from travelling to Mexico, potentially derailing England’s chances of defending the trophy and sending the English tabloids into a frenzy.Leading theories included the Brazilian Football Association conspiring to eliminate their toughest potential opponents or that Colombia’s murky emerald trade was trying to squeeze money out of Moore. At the time Moore said only: “I’m not too sure what it’s all about. As far as I can make out, there’s nothing in it. I can assure you of that.”But Moore’s biographer, Jeff Powell, wrote in a later edition of his book that “perhaps one of the younger lads with the squad did something foolish, a prank with unfortunate circumstances”, hinting that Moore had told a different version of events to him.The cables examined by the podcast add weight to the theory that the scandal was a team prank that blew out of control. They also suggest the investigation could have been swayed in Moore’s favour by intense diplomatic pressure, with Colombian officials doing whatever they could to bury the investigation.View image in fullscreenBobby Moore leaves the Fuego Verde jewellery shop in Bogotá, where it was claimed he had stolen a bracelet.Photograph: APIn one telegram at the height of the scandal, the British ambassador, Richard Rogers, told London that officials from Colombia’s national intelligence agency had assured him “no legal action would be taken without consultation with the embassy”, adding: “We also ensured that the magistrate concerned was privately made aware of the awkward implications of the case for Colombia because of the strong interest of British and world public opinion.”The document shows the UK was strongly reminding Colombia that it was set to host the 1986 World Cup and the scandal could tarnish its global image and burn its chances of hosting the tournament. Others suggest their diplomatic reach extended further. In a later telegram, Rogers said the director of Colombia’s national intelligence agency, Gen Luis Etilio Leyva, had paid a visit to the judge overseeing the case. With the green light from the president and foreign minister – both under pressure from the UK – Leyva warned Judge Pedro Dorado of the political consequences of jailing Moore.The idea that Padilla had framed Moore quickly became “the official story”, said Camilo Macías, one of the podcast’s producers. “Moore had the full backing of the British and Colombian governments, Colombian police and intelligence agencies, the British and Colombian media, and much of the public opinion on both sides. Against this overwhelming chorus, Clara’s voice was buried.”Moore was released three days before the tournament kicked off in the Azteca. Even Harold Wilson, the British prime minister, was abreast of the events, fearing if the government did not get Moore on a plane to Mexico City, Labour could lose the next election. Documents show Foreign Office officials became uncomfortable with the PM’s involvement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 24-year-old was vilified at home, too, where Colombians adored British footballers after several English players, including the Manchester United winger Charlie Mitten, played for the Bogotá side Independiente Santa Fe.Padilla says she was forced to leave for the US, where she had lived ever since, after receiving up to 15 phone calls a day as well as numerous death threats. “I was a victim for many, many years of being accused of all kinds of horrible things. The worst one was that I was lying, that I was trying to destroy Bobby Moore,” she told the podcast.Close to her death from cancer, Padilla maintained that she told no lie and revealed previously untold details of how Moore snatched the bracelet. “They came in and two of them sat down to flirt and distract me,” Padilla said, alleging that two of the England pranksters turned on their charm to compliment her English language skills and her good looks.“Bobby Moore was there in the door where the display cabinet was and I saw him open the cabinet, take the bracelet and put it in his pocket, looking at me the whole time. It was like he was teasing me.”Sir Keith Morris, chargé d’affaires at the time, has insisted the UK did not exert undue pressure on its Colombian counterparts but admitted the case wasgiven special attentiongiven the team were national heroes. “Would we have done quite as much for any British citizen? No. But there was a national interest involved,” Morris said. “He [Judge Pedro Dorado] was, I am sure, aware of Colombian public opinion on the subject. He found a solution to fit the case.”Explore more on these topicsFootballEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How do I know? You cannot prove it, because she’s local they can say whatever. You took the game away from me,” Pavlyuchenkova said after Kartal won the point and went on to break for a 5-4 lead. “They have stolen the game from me, they stole it.”A Wimbledon spokesperson said the club had apologised to the players after finding that the technology was “deactivated in error on part of the server’s side of the court for one game”.Pavlyuchenkova went on to overpower Kartal, who later said she was “devastated” that her fairytale run had ended with a 7-6 (3), 6-4 defeat on her Centre Court debut.Cameron Norrie became the last Briton standing after battling through to the Wimbledon quarter-finals in a five-set epic which also was not short of drama.The 29-year-old defeated his Chilean opponent Nicolás Jarry in four and a half hours and became the only British player to reach the second week of the tournament despite a promising start from several hopefuls.Norrie, the British No 3, fell to the floor after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (7), 6-7 (5), 6-3 win in front of a roaring No 1 Court crowd. Spectators appeared to boo Jarry when the South American confronted Norrie as the pair were shaking hands at the net.Jarry, the 29-year-old world No 143, had earlier complained to the umpire after appearing frustrated with how long Norrie was taking to serve.“It is not a nervous tic, it is something he can control,” Jarry said. He later denied there had been a spat, saying all he had told Norrie at the net was the Briton had deserved to win.In an on-court interview after the match, Norrie said of the five-set epic: “I just had to keep fighting.”The former top 10 player, who was knocked out of the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022 by Novak Djokovic, went on: “I think at the beginning of this year I was struggling a little bit with confidence and had some doubts – and just wanted to enjoy my tennis a little bit more.“I’m doing that and I enjoyed it today, so it was a bonus today, but I was more happy I was enjoying it and I was playing point for point, that’s what mattered.”When asked about the courtside drama, he added that Jarry had told him he was “a little bit vocal”.Kartal, ranked 298 in the world this time last year and 51 now, earlier said she was proud of her performance this week.“Probably for the rest of the day I’ll be a bit sad,” the 5ft 4in Brighton native told reporters.“But I think tomorrow I’ll probably wake up, and I can look back on this week and be super proud of it and step back and think, you know, fourth round of a slam, it’s the first experience, and for it being here, having beaten the players that I did to do that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her match was as dramatic as the weather after the embarrassing malfunction with the AI-enhanced Hawk-Eye technology.After an investigation which included speaking to the players, Helwerth, Hawk-Eye operators and a review official, a spokesperson for the All England Club said: “It is now clear that the live electronic line calling (ELC) system, which was working optimally, was deactivated in error on part of the server’s side of the court for one game by those operating the system.“In that time there were three calls not picked up by live ELC on the affected part of the court. Two of these were called by the chair umpire, who was not made aware that the system had been deactivated.Cameron Norrie sinks Jarry in five-set epic to reach Wimbledon quarter-finalsRead more“Following the third, the chair umpire stopped the match and consulted with the review official. It was determined that the point should be replayed.“We continue to have full confidence in the accuracy of the ball tracking technology. The live ELC system relies on the Hawk-Eye operators, the review official and the technology to work in harmony. This did not happen.“In this instance there was a human error and as a consequence we have fully reviewed our processes and made the appropriate changes.”Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper, the British No 1s, have both complained about the new technology and questioned some of its calls.Speaking after her win, Pavlyuchenkova said she believed the umpire should have called the ball out rather than making them replay the point.“He was probably scared to take such a big decision. I think they should … that’s why we have a chair umpire,” she told reporters.“Otherwise, I think soon let’s just play without them, right, and then we’re going to have everything automatic. I think we losing a little bit of the charm of actually having human beings … it just becomes a little bit weird and, like, robot sort of orientated.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025TennisWimbledonnewsShareReuse this content"

Everybody is bored of the eulogies for West Indies cricket: we’ve all been reading them for 25 years, and some of us have been writing them for what feels as long. But it doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen The Shawshank Redemption, you still feel a pang of sadness when Tommy Williams steps out to meet Warden Norton for a midnight chat.Australia shot down West Indies with as little remorse, all out for 143 in less than 35 overs on day four, the visitors winning by 133 runs at the Grenada National Stadium and going 2-0 up to win the series. It’s not that the scoreline is a surprise, given the resource disparity between the teams and administrations, but it still feels wrong to feel that a Test side has no chance of chasing once a target approaches 250.Ben Stokes’ waning influence with the bat on display in England’s soggy defeat | Andy BullRead moreWest Indies had bowled well when Australia resumed at 221-7 to begin day four, with the two Josephs, Alzarri and Shamar, collectively having Pat Cummins nick behind from his first ball of the day, trap Alex Carey for only four additional runs to his overnight score, then knock Josh Hazlewood’s stumps out. All up Australia had added 22. But the key part was that a few balls kept low while still offering lateral seam. With 277 to get, nobody had confidence in the West Indies’ batting, least of all the West Indies batters.John Campbell forgot that feet can move and was nailed in front by Josh Hazlewood before most people had resumed their seats. Kraigg Brathwaite in his hundredth Test went nowhere, poking around to add seven to his first-innings duck before nicking Beau Webster’s medium pace. Keacy Carty got a fierce working over, fingers turned into cevapcici by repeated blows to the gloves, before nicking Mitchell Starc. Brandon King got a Pat Cummins special, angled in, beating the outside edge to hit off stump. Hello, 4-33, goodbye contest.View image in fullscreenBrandon King gets the Pat Cummins treatment.Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesIt’s strange that a region where life revolves around the ocean should produce a team that is so far out of its depth. But it’s not for lack of trying. Caribbean long-form cricket is an afterthought domestically, and the cupboard is bare. The best first-class average in the squad is 34. Braithwate is surely at the terminus of a long decline, but has kept being picked on experience for want of a competitor. Campbell, Carty, and King are short-form players trying to adapt. Shai Hope had some Test triumphs in another life, but has returned from the white-ball Pet Sematary possessed by the accursed spirit of a desperate slogger.Roston Chase had a few moments in his 34, including a mango-sweet flick off the pads that took six runs from Starc, but the captain’s 38-run stand with Hope was as good as it got for his team, and if anything, Hope’s innings of 17 looked worse than some of the knocks worth fewer. After a few bits of galloping nonsense, he pulled Hazlewood straight up the chimney for the bowler to wait underneath. Starc swung his way past another Chase flick, and at 86-6 that was it. A No 8 slogging two sixes from his first two balls might spark excitement with 50 runs to get, but it only speaks of desperation when there’s 180 to go.The very next ball after Alzarri Joseph’s opening clouts against Lyon, Starc produced a shooter on the angle to get his third, Justin Greaves stranded as it smashed his front pad. The Josephs and Jayden Seales hit six sixes from Lyon, but he got them all out to end the game, and now is two wickets from passing Glenn McGrath’s Test tally of 563, with his average at a 13-year low of 30.14.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s easier when the opposition don’t have the tools to counter your own, and any move will work eventually. In a low-scoring series, Australia are still having their batting struggles, but West Indies would give anything for batting that only struggles that much. In a scheduled pink-ball Test in Jamaica, one more humiliation is on the cards. The only hope is that being this low eventually creates the drive, at home and in the international community, to decide on a path towards something better. It’s a long way off. West Indies may have to swim through a river of filth to come out clean.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The left-hander had held a match point on his serve at 6-5 in the third set tie-break before Jarry turned the match around with his enormous serve, eventually forcing a five-set shootout.Cameron Norrie sinks Jarry in five-set epic to reach Wimbledon quarter-finalsRead more“It feels a little bit better and more deserved coming back from the injury and kind of coming back and trying to push back into the top of the game,” said Norrie. “So all the hard work, it’s paid off. I’ve been a dedicated professional and have a good team around me. These moments are the icing on the cake.”Having climbed as high as No 8 in the world rankings in 2022, Norrie, 30 next month, suffered a significant biceps injury last year and he has generally struggled with his form. In May he fell to No 91 in the rankings. Against Jarry, a qualifier, he maintained his composure as the Chilean fired down 46 aces. Norrie held each of his 25 service games, saving all eight break points in the match.“I didn’t want to let his game style kind of get me frustrated,” said Norrie. “When he’s serving lots of aces and nothing is happening in the match, and then suddenly he’s playing some really good points. So I wanted to stay fired up and really enjoy all aspects of the match.“If it’s a cheap point, I was enjoying it. If it was a long rally, I was enjoying it. If I had a forehand winner, I was enjoying it. And I wanted to keep that energy high. He served 46 aces in the match, and I didn’t want to let that bother me.”Norrie will next face Alcaraz after the Spaniard defeated the 14th seed Andrey Rublev 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. “Now it only gets tougher,” said Norrie.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

However, his furious McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, who finished second, was convinced he had been unfairly denied by a controversial stewards’ decision.Norris, now in his sixth season in F1, took the victory after Piastri had been given a 10-second penalty while leading but the 25-year-old still produced an assured drive in treacherous wet conditions to become the 12th British driver to win their home race since it was first held in 1950.Lando Norris wins F1 British GP from angry Piastri in rain-soaked Silverstone thrillerRead moreIt is the one grand prix Norris wanted more than any other and he revelled in his success. “This victory is everything I dreamed of,” he said. “Being on top at your home race is very, very special.”He said that as he sealed the final laps he was enjoying taking in his accomplishment and, most important, ensuring he did not let it slip away from him. “Looking up at the fans and seeing them on their feet, your mind just goes pretty blank,” he said. “I was just trying to enjoy the moment.“These are moments that none of you guys get to witness. This is only something that I and very few Brits have achieved. It is a selfish moment, in a way, but so special and incredible because it is such a rare thing to feel and witness.“For me, it is my best win, maybe not the best way to win, but in terms of what it means to me, winning at home, it is very memorable. Apart from winning a championship, this is as good as it gets.”Norris grew up watching Lewis Hamilton win the British GP, with the seven-time champion holding a record nine victories here. With Hamilton finishing fourth for Ferrari it was an emotional moment for Norris to have achieved a feat to match those who had inspired him.“Silverstone is where it all started for me, watching Lewis, Jenson [Button], Fernando [Alonso] and it was thatwet race here in 2008when I began watching Formula One,” he said. “Lewis won and I got that picture of him going round and all the fans are standing up, creating an amazing atmosphere. I dreamed of that for many, many years and today I got to see that through my own eyes and live that moment.”Norris endured one minor hiccup after the race when a photographer fell off a fence in the pit lane on to the celebrating driver. He suffered a small cut to his face but shrugged it off amid the euphoria and has now closed to within eight points of Piastri in the championship battle.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri follows the safety car at Silverstone.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/ShutterstockPiastri was penalised for braking erratically during a safety-car restart and thereby forcing Max Verstappen to take evasive action, but while he declined to speak critically of the stewards he was adamant he thought he had been wronged by the decision.“I felt it was well within the rules, and I did it once already in that race. I don’t really get it,” he said. “I didn’t do anything differently to my first restart. I didn’t go slower. I don’t think Max had to evade me. So I am a bit confused to say the least. I know I deserved a lot more than I did today and when you don’t get the result you deserve, it hurts.”After serving his penalty, Piastri had asked the team if he might swap places with Norris, which they declined. The team principal, Andrea Stella, noted that he wants his drivers to voice their positions and was happy with Piastri doing so.“Lando didn’t do anything wrong so I don’t think it would have been fair to swap, but I thought I should ask,” Piastri said. “It doesn’t change much for the championship. I felt I did a good job and I will use the frustration to make sure I win some more races.”Explore more on these topicsBritish Grand PrixLando NorrisOscar PiastriFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The American businessman even warrants a mention in Craig Snyder’s book A Secret History of the Ollie as “one of the few who beat eight-time world champion Rodney Mullen in freestyle competitions during the turn of the 70s”, but a serious head injury put an end to his competitive career.Textor surprisingly turned his attention to football club ownership in 2021 when he bought a stake inCrystal Palaceafter making his fortune in digital technology and the next week could prove decisive for his latest venture.The New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, is poised to complete his purchase of Textor’s 43% share in the FA Cup winners if – as expected in the coming days – he passes the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test. However, Palace’s participation in the Europa League appears to rest on the outcome of Lyon’s appeal againsttheir relegation from Ligue 1.That is due to be heard this week by French football’s national directorate of management control (DNCG), withLyon– who are also owned by Textor’s company Eagle Football Holdings – having accepted in a meeting with Uefa that if they fail they would relinquish their Europa League place and clear the way for Palace.In an attempt to increase hopes of winning the appeal, given his rocky relationship with the DNCG since Textor bought out Jean-Michel Aulas in June 2022, he announced last Monday that he had resigned from his leadership roles at Lyon.Michael Gerlinger has been appointed as chief executive and Michele Kang – who also owns the Washington Spirit and London City Lionesses and bought Lyon’s extremely successful women’s team from Eagle Football Holdings last year – as chair and president. On Friday Lyon were fined €12.5m (£10.8m) by Uefa for a breach of financial sustainability requirements. Reports in France say Lyon must inject €70m to be allowed to play inLigue 1next season.Should the appeal fail, Textor is understood to be confident Lyon will be cleared, even if it it means ending up in court. But with the American fund Ares Management, that provided a €425m loan to complete the purchase of Lyon, breathing down his neck, time is of the essence. Eagle Football was listed for an initial public offering in the United States last month, with Textor understood to want to begin selling shares in September.View image in fullscreenLyon ultras protest against John Textor after the club were relegated to Ligue 2.Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty ImagesHe is believed to have spent the weekend in the Bahamas after stating he was “looking forward to the reduction of my day-to-day management responsibilities in Europe, so I can focus on markets where we have the full freedom to run our football clubs … to invest, innovate, grow and compete. OL [are] in great hands with Michele, and I will focus onBotafogo, Daring Brussels and our next club in England.”Sheffield Wednesday, who have been banned from spending money on transfers until January 2027 after the repeated failure to pay players’ wages, have been mooted as a potential target once the sale of his Palace shares to Johnson is ratified, althoughDejphon Chansiri is reported to want more than £150mfor the Championship club. Textor has held talks with Watford’s owner, Gino Pozzo, about investing at Vicarage Road in the past.Textor’s close relationship with Evangelos Marinakis – the Nottingham Forest owner whose side would stand to be promoted to the Europa League should Uefa rule against Palace – has led to several players moving from Botafogo and Lyon to the City Ground over the past 12 months. Igor Jesus’s signing was announced on Saturday and Jair Cunha could be to be latest after the Brazilian champions’ elimination from the Club World Cup that cost the coach, Renato Paiva, his job as Textor was unhappy with team selection and formation.“I’m shocked,” Paiva said of his dismissal, “and the staff and players are open-mouthed about the decision.” He was appointed in February after Artur Jorge led Botafogo to victory in the Copa Libertadores in 2024. Textor is said to be leading the search for the coach’s successor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite holding the biggest stake, Textor was unable to persuade Parish and his fellow American co-owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer that Palace should be fully integrated into Eagle Football’s multi-club network, and repeated efforts to take full control – like his attempt to buy Everton – failed.He has taken credit for last year’s appointment of Oliver Glasner, having spoken to him about the vacancy at Lyon a few months earlier. But it is understood Palace produced evidence of correspondence between the Austrian manager, Parish and the then sporting director, Dougie Freedman, to support their argument to Uefa that Textor played no part in their decision-making process. If a shareholder has a decisive influence over more than one club, those clubs are not allowed to play in the same Uefa tournament.Palace are expected to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) should the decision go against them, with Forest – the first visitors of the Premier League season to Selhurst Park on 23 August – likely to do the same if Palace are cleared to play in the Europa League. It will be intriguing to see whose side Textor is on if summoned to give evidence to Cas in Lausanne.He officially resigned as a director of Palace’s board on 18 June and Parish will be hoping that Johnson, who described a report that named him as the NFL’s worst owner this year as “bogus”, can provide some stability and finances as they anxiously await their fate in Europe.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceLyonNew York JetsUS sportsFinancesLigue 1BotafogofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even better, it seems two of the most gifted young forwards around already have a connection. They were on opposite sides in Philadelphia on Friday night but friends when it was over, sharing a warm embrace afterChelsea’s victory over Palmeirasin the Club World Cup, swapping shirts and perhaps thinking about how much fun they are going to have at the expense of opposition defences when they line up together next season.It was a heartwarming sight. Palmer offered a reminder that he remains the main man at Chelsea, performing with craft and intelligence during a first half in which he opened the scoring in smooth fashion, but Estêvão vied for centre stage on his final appearance for Palmeiras. It was an extraordinary performance given the context. Anticipation has been building ever since Chelsea agreed a£52m fee with Palmeirasfor Estêvão in May 2024. The 18-year-old has remained on an upward trajectory after staying with Palmeiras for one more season, but any hopes of keeping the hype machine from going into overdrive with a player regarded as the best Brazilian youth product of his generation had disappeared long before he found himself trying to knock his future employers out of the Club World Cup.Enzo Maresca excited by glimpse of Chelsea’s future with ‘huge talent’ EstêvãoRead moreThe pressure on Estêvão was extreme. He has delivered a string of wonderful goals and performances forPalmeirasover the past 12 months but he has been criticised by the Brazilian media during his time in the US. Abel Ferreira, the charismatic Palmeiras manager, has had to leap to the youngster’s defence. There have been some tense press conferences. Nonetheless it was only human nature to wonder if Estêvão was capable of performing against Chelsea. Would his heart really be in it? Would he hold back? Would he be too desperate to impress?Now, of course, the challenge will be keeping expectations at realistic levels when Estêvão arrives in England. He has been called Messinho (Little Messi) because of his dribbling ability but is determined to follow his own path. This kid is fearless. Questions about whether he will be able to adapt to the physicality of the Premier League are standard. AgainstChelsea, there could be no better taste of what defenders in England are like than by being marked by Marc Cucurella. The Spaniard is tenacious, niggly, and very good at his job. It was striking to watch him kick lumps out of Estêvão during the first half. It was as if Cucurella was trying to see if the kid was made of the right stuff.The response was resounding. Estêvão kept looking for the ball and kept trying to make things happen. At one point he darted in from the right, surging across the grass, Cucurella left desperately trying to cling on to his shirt. It was easy to imagine Cucurella going back into the dressing room after full time and telling his teammates that they won’t have to worry about whether that slight, spindly kid on the Palmeiras right will be able to do it on a wet, windy Tuesday night in Stoke. Only, the rest of Chelsea’s players had already seen it for themselves. It was Estêvão who dragged Palmeiras into the contest, spinning into space in the 53rd minute and catching Robert Sánchez out by shooting from the tightest of angles. The ball flew past a startled Sánchez, who could not even be blamed for being beaten at his near post, and when it went in there was no holding back from Estêvão as he celebrated.View image in fullscreenEstêvão (right) talks to Cole Palmer and his new Chelsea teammates after the Club World Cup quarter-final.Photograph: Derik Hamilton/APPalmeiras could not quite get the job done, though. Afterwards the mood was bittersweet. Named the player of the match, Estêvão was obliged to speak to the media. He sat next to Ferreira and thanked the man who treats him as a son. Ferreira was tender, whispering advice to Estêvão whenever he seemed unsure what to say. “I love this guy so much,” Estêvão said. “I thank God that Abel and Palmeiras are in my life.”Ferreira, ignoring the pain of losing to a late own goal, returned the praise. He spoke of Estêvão’s talent but also described him as an amazing person. The Portuguese admitted that he was unsure if Estêvão was big enough when he was promoted to the first team, only for those doubts to go away soon enough. “He looks slim, but he is strong,” Ferreira said. “I told Estêvão: ‘We are excited for you to join,’ but he didn’t understand a single word I said,” Palmer offered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThat nod towards the language barrier was a reminder that Estêvão must be given time to settle in England. “Take care of him,” Ferreira said, sounding a lot like Sven-Göran Eriksson urging the English media to protect Wayne Rooney in 2006. “It’s the first time he will leave his country. In England the sun appears two or three times a year and the night comes early but Chelsea have conditions to support him.”It is good that there is no pressure on Enzo Maresca to rush Estêvão. Chelsea have plenty of attacking options and know that leaving South America will not be easy. Even so, it is telling that there is no plan to send Estêvão out on loan. Chelsea know they have a special talent on their hands. No wonder they cannot wait to see Estêvão and Palmer together.Explore more on these topicsChelseaPalmeirasClub World Cup 2025Club World CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the UK, public support for development, once solid enough to encourage David Cameron to embrace the target of spending 0.7% of national income on aid, started tofall away from about 2012-13.More recently, the world has become a much more fragmented, multipolar place. Middle-income countries such as China and India have demanded more prominence on the global stage. Russia’s territorial aggression in Ukraine prompted its expulsion from the G8 – now the G7 – and killed off any lingering hopes that free trade and capitalism would ultimately usher in liberal democracy.Global solidarity was hard to summon, then, even before Donald Trump’s second term unleashed chaos in the global trading system.The budgets of many rich-country governments have taken a battering from repeated economic shocks, at the same time as pressure mounts for more defence spending to confront potential threats. Labour ministers are quite right when they say “the world has changed”.Yet despite the more fraught global backdrop, the campaigners who worked alongside Blair and Brown at Gleneagles and beyond have been profoundly shocked by the British government’s casual disregard of development.Three years ago, Keir Starmer waspromising to undo Boris Johnson’s “misguided” decisionto absorb the Department for International Development back into the Foreign Office.Labour’s manifesto dropped this idea. It suggested the UK had “lost influence” as a result of the Tories’ neglect of international development and promised to “turn the page to rebuild Britain’s reputation”, restoring aid to 0.7% “as soon as fiscal circumstances allow”.Instead, Labour slashed the aid budget, with little discussion, when Starmer wanted to promise Trump he would raise defence spending on his White House trip in February.Jenny Chapman, the development minister who replaced Anneliese Dodds when she resigned in protest at this deep budget cut, has insisted the UK still wants to lead on development. Yet it is hard to take the moral high ground while admitting that no area of policy, including projects to support women and girls’ health and education, will be safe from the cuts.Labour has said it wants to create respectful partnerships with developing countries; but Save the Children UK’s director, Moazzam Malik, told me recently that the cuts would be felt by many countries not as a new-found era of collaborationbut as a withdrawal.As the UK steps back at the same time as Trump is dismantling USAID, the challenges in some of the world’s poorest countries have only intensified.In particular, a blizzard of recent expert reports hascalled for action on the unsustainable debtssqueezing many governments’ budgets.The UN-backed Financing for Development conference in Seville last week ended with promises of reform, including the wider use of “pause clauses” to halt repayments during natural disasters, for example – something the UK has supported.More radical solutions that might have included debt write-offs did not make it through the negotiations, but South Africa hopes to use its chairmanship of the G20 to press for more progress in the coming months.Michael Jacobs, a former Brown adviser, now a visiting professor at the Overseas Development Institute, insists there was a sense of momentum on debt relief in Seville.“It was the single most significant topic of debate. There is rising pressure on the creditor countries – including China – to act. So, as in 2005, the moment for a new international debt relief package may be arriving,” he said.Other campaigners returned from Seville notably downbeat, however, pointing to the difficulties of assembling a global coalition of the willing on development in a time of tight budgets and fraying international bonds.Summoning the spirit of Gleneagles may be too much to hope for, two decades on. But after a string of economic shocks and as the climate emergency accelerates, the moral imperative to act remains – even if this Labour government can’t find it in a focus group or on a spreadsheet.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEconomics viewpointG8Debt reliefGlobal economyTrump administrationAidcommentShareReuse this content"

An early Februarypollfrom Emerson College showed Andrew Cuomo with a 23-point lead in a hypothetical Democratic primary matchup. None of the four leading progressives even approached double-digit support – including the then unknown assemblymanZohran Mamdani. He polled at 1%.In the days before ranked-choice voting, the Working Families party’s endorsement process might have looked quite different. Like-minded candidates would have drawn sharp distinctions between each other. Party officials might have looked to nudge candidates toward the exits, behind closed doors. Before any votes had been cast in the primary, the party would consolidate behind just one choice. It would have been bloody and left a bitter taste for everyone.Instead, the opposite happened. Working Families, knowing that majorities rule and that no one can spoil a ranked-choice race,endorsedfour candidates. Instead of a single endorsement that served as a kiss of death for other progressives, they backed a slate, allowing voters time to tune in and for candidates to make their pitches. Now Mamdaniis the Democratic nomineeand the overwhelming favorite to go from 1% all the way to Gracie Mansion.Here’s what the Democrats can learn from Zohran Mamdani | Judith LevineRead moreTherearemanyreasonswhythis 33-year-old pulled off a seemingly unthinkable upset and soared from obscurity to the most talked about Democrat in the nation overnight. He energizedyoung people, reached voters where they are onsocial mediaand built an unstoppable coalition. He and his volunteers talked toeveryone, everywhere.Ranked-choice voting (RCV) encouraged and incentivized that joyous, barnstorming approach. And while Mamdani ultimately would have won a plurality contest or a ranked-choice one, his super-long-shot candidacy might have been squelched at the very beginning under the old system with its different electoral incentives. His victory shows how much more real power voters have under ranked-choice voting.To be clear: RCV is a party-neutral and candidate-neutral tool. Its job is to produce a majority winner with the widest and deepest support from any field of more than two candidates. It puts an end to spoilers and to the impossible, wish-and-a-prayer calculation that voters otherwise have to make when faced with multiple candidates, some of whom they really like and some of whom they do not. Liberals, conservatives, independents and moderates have run and won under RCV, from coast to coast.But while RCV might be strictly non-partisan, it is decidedly pro-voter – and almost always produces amore positive, issue-focused campaignthat looks to drive up turnout and appeal to as many people as possible. A ranked-choice campaign rewards engagement and encourages coalitions; it’s a race where instead of tearing down opponents, candidates point out areas of agreement and ask to be a voter’s second choice.Voters love RCV and find it easy to use. According to a newSurveyUSA pollof New York voters, 96% said their ballot waseasy to fill out. More than three-quarters of voters want tokeep or expand RCV. And82% saidthey had taken advantage of RCV and ranked at least two candidates. (These numbers aresimilar across RCV elections, and a powerful rejoinder to critics who insist, despite evidence to the contrary, that it’s too confusing.)A remarkable number of New Yorkers saw first-hand how RCV makes our votes more powerful – they had the freedom to express themselves and rank a long-shot first, but still had their vote count for either Mamdani or Cuomo in the ranked choice tally.Perhaps the high marks are of little surprise: voters received a campaign unlike most any other. The tone remained positive and issue-based. Instead of cutting each other down, candidates lifted each other up: Mamdani and Brad Landercross-endorsedeach other, cutting joint ads,riding bicycles togetherto shared events, sharing the couch onStephen Colbert, and even sharing a stage at Mamdani’s victory party. Jessica Ramos and Whitney Tilson endorsed Cuomo and said that they would rank him second.

Trump is not | Samuel MoynRead moreVoters always say that they want more choice at the polls, candidates who engage with them, and a genuine, issue-based campaign. They got exactly that in New York City because of ranked choice. And the historic turnout levels – more than1 million New Yorkerscast ballots, thehighest number since the 1980s– shows that when voters get that kind of elevated, engaging campaign, they show up and get involved.When voters have the opportunity to consider new candidates campaigning in creative new ways, the frontrunner with the early name recognition and largest donors can be eclipsed by a newcomer who started at 1%. And instead of going scorched-earth on each other before the general election, even some of the “losers” seem to have had their status elevated: Lander finished third, and instead of being an asterisk, he has nowexpanded his base and likabilityfor a future campaign.The majority winner in this race was Zohran Mamdani. But it’s also easy to suggest the real winner might be ranked-choice voting. In a moment when so many of our elections are fraught and polarized, all of us looking for a more unified and hopeful path forward – the“politics of the future”, as Mamdani called it when he declared victory – should take a close look at what just happened in New York as proof that stronger elections are truly possible.What’s giving me hope nowOutside of Washington, cities and states are becoming laboratories of democracy once again. New York’s adoption of ranked-choice voting led to just the kind of campaign our politics so desperately needs: a giant field of candidates presenting their vision of the future, building coalitions, without any time squandered on “spoilers” or anyone pushed to drop out and consolidate early. In Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, voters modernized government and moved to proportional representation to elect the city council, broadening representation to groups and neighborhoods that have never before had a seat at the table. When voters make these changes, they like them, defend them, and expand them, as we have seen in New York, Maine and Alaska. And it won’t take long for people to ask why they can’t have ranked choice and proportionality in all their elections.David Daleyis the author of Antidemocratic: Inside the Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections as well as Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t CountExplore more on these topicsUS politicsFighting BackZohran MamdaniNew YorkUS voting rightscommentShareReuse this content"

Now an entrenched problem is becoming an acute crisis in the shadow of Donald Trump’s executioner’s axe. The US is the biggest contributor, at 22%, to the UN’s core budget. In February,the White House announceda six-month review of US membership of all international organisations, conventions and treaties, including the UN, with a view to reducing or ending funding – and possible withdrawal. The deadline for decapitation falls next month.Trump’s abolitionof the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and scrapping of most aid programmes, has already badly damaged UN-led and UN-backed humanitarian operations, which rely on discretionary funding. Yet Trump’s axe symbolises a more fundamental threat – to multilateralism and the much-battered international rules-based order. The basic concept of collective responsibility for maintaining global peace and security, and collaboration in tackling shared problems – embodied by the UN sinceits creation 80 years agolast week – is on the chopping block.The stakes are high – and Washington is not the only villain. Like the US, about 40 countries are behind in paying obligatory yearly dues. Discretionary donations are declining. The UN charter, a statement of founding principles, has been critically undermined by failure to halt Russia’s illegal war of aggression in Ukraine (and by last month’s US-Israeli attack on Iran).Chinaand others,including the UK, ignore international law when it suits. The number and longevity of conflictsworldwide is rising; UN envoys are sidelined; UN peacekeeping missions are disparaged. The security council is often paralysed by vetoes; the general assembly is largely powerless. By many measures, the UN isn’t working.A crunch looms. If the UN is allowed to fail or is so diminished that its agencies cannot fully function, there is nothing to take its place. Nothing, that is, except the law of the jungle, as seen in Gaza and other conflict zones whereUN agencies are excluded,aid workers murderedand legal norms flouted. The UN system has many failings, some self-inflicted. But a world without the UN would, for most people in most places, be more dangerous, hungrier, poorer, unhealthier and less sustainable.The US is not expected to withdraw from the UN altogether (although nothing is impossible with this isolationist, ultra-nationalist president). But Trump’s hostile intent is evident.His 2026 budget proposalseeks a 83.7% cut – from $58.7bn to $9.6bn – in all US international spending. That includes an 87% reduction in UN funding, both obligatory and discretionary. “In 2023,totalUS spending on the UN amounted to about $13bn. This is equivalent to only 1.6% of the Pentagon’s budget that year ($816bn) – orabout two-thirdsof what Americans spend on ice-cream annually,” Stewart Patrick of theCarnegie Endowment for International Peace noted. Economic development aid, disaster relief and family planning programmes would be gutted.The impact is potentially world-changing. Key UN agencies in the firing line include thechildren’s fund, Unicef– at a time when the risks facing infants and children are daunting; theWorld Food Programme(WFP), which could lose 30% of its staff; agencies handling refugees and migration, which are also shrinking; theInternational court of justice(the “world court”), which has shone a light on Israel’s illegal actions in Gaza; and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran’s and others’ nuclear activities.Trump is already boycotting the World Health Organization, the Palestinian relief agency (Unrwa) and the UN Human Rights Council, and hasrescinded $4bnallocated to the UN climate fund, claiming that all act contrary to US interests. If his budget is adopted this autumn, the UN’s 2030sustainable development goalsmay prove unattainable. US financial backing for international peacekeeping and observer missions in trouble spots such as Lebanon, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Kosovo, currently 26% of total spending, will plunge to zero.Israel is a rogue nation. It should be removed from the United Nations | Mehdi HasanRead moreThe withdrawal of USAID support is already proving lethal, everywhere from Somalia and Sudan to Bangladesh and Haiti. UN officials describe the situation in post-earthquake, conflict-riven, aid-deprivedMyanamar as a “humanitarian catastrophe”. Research published in the Lancet found that Trump’s cuts could causemore than 14m additional deathsby 2030, a third of them children.The WFP, the world’s largest food aid supplier, says its projected $8.1bn funding deficit this year comes asacute hungeraffects a record 343 million people in 74 countries. And other donor states are failing to fill the gap left by the US. So far in 2025, only 11% of the $46.2bn required for 44 UN-prioritised crises has been raised. The UK recentlyslashed its aid budgetby £6bn, to pay for nuclear bombs.UN chiefs acknowledge that many problems pre-date Trump. António Guterres, the secretary general, has initiatedthousands of job cutsas part of the “UN80” reform plan to consolidate operations and reduce the core budget by up to 20%. But, marking the anniversary, Guterres said the gravest challenge is the destructive attitude of member states that sabotage multilateral cooperation, break the rules, fail to pay their share and forget why the UN was founded in the first place. “The charter of the United Nations is not optional.It is not an à la carte menu. It is the bedrock of international relations,” he said.Guterres says the UN’s greatest achievement since 1945 is preventing a third world war. Yet respected analysts such as Fiona Hill believeit’s already begun. The UK and other democracies face some pressing questions. Will they meekly give in to Trump once again? Or will they fight to stop this renegade president and rogue states such as Russia and Israel dismantling the world’s best defence against global anarchy, forever wars and needless suffering?Will they fight to save the UN?Simon Tisdall is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUnited NationsOpinionTrump administrationUSAIDAidUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

She was a psychiatric nurse and worked at a public hospital in an inpatient unit. She sobbed during our first session, full of guilt at having had to take leave after collapsing in tears during a shift. She said she was letting down her patients and team by being away. The strength of Bec’s anguish at letting people down felt disproportionate to the circumstances, and I noticed that she wasn’t concerned about her tears and collapse, just about the impact of her time off on others.I probed deeper, trying to understand this.Bec said she’d been working very long hours, usually pulling double shifts a few times a week. She was proud of her work ethic and said that always being available to her team and patients was important to her. She seemed to derive most of her identity from her professional role. While she had a partner, she was often too tired to see her girlfriend, or to socialise with friends or exercise. She was often stressed because of her long hours but felt too guilty to make any changes and kept pushing through her tiredness and stress, until the day she broke down crying.It felt important to understand Bec’s relationship with work in the context of her underlying personality traits and the beliefs she had formed about herself. Often, when people are over-invested in work, they have a psychological makeup characterised by themes of self-sacrifice, abandonment of their own needs, perfectionism, enmeshment with others and the need to “earn” their place in the world.Alex felt demoralised by the suggestion he should ‘be more resilient’. He learned that it is an ongoing process | Bianca DennyRead moreWe spoke about Bec’s early life during our first few sessions. She was raised by a single mother who had a serious mental illness and difficulties with addiction, and was repeatedly admitted to hospital. Bec was her mother’s carer from the age of 13, managing appointments and medication, soothing her and remaining attuned to her moods, alert to the possibility of overdose, and helping with daily tasks. She developed great empathy for those who were unwell and said she had a strong desire to help others, leading to her decision to train as a psychiatric nurse. She’d been praised from a young age for being so “mature, kind and giving”, and she had learned that her value lay in these qualities.Bec had almost no emotion in her voice and body language when she told me about her childhood. She seemed nonchalant about her mother’s difficulties and dismissive when I reflected that becoming a carer at a young age would have come with struggles, such as missing out on important adolescent experiences or being able to live free of worry.“It is what it is,” she said, and this was a line she would repeat multiple times throughout our therapy, each time I touched on anything sensitive.Bec’s difficulties struck me as difficulties that had been decades in the making. While she was 45 when she saw me, her patterns of overwork had commenced as soon as she started working as a nurse. She over-identified with this role and told me she couldn’t sleep at night when clients were not doing well.The wounded healerBec’s pattern was typical of the archetype of the wounded healer. Many people drawn to helping professions such as nursing, psychology or paramedicine have experienced difficulties in life that have predisposed them to wanting to help others as a way of finding their own healing. They often re-enact early patterns, such as self-sacrifice. The wounded healer has been hurt but has not engaged in any healing work. They may try to resolve their own hurts by helping others.While people with this pattern can make excellent clinicians and healers with great empathy and sensitivity, this is usually facilitated by self-discovery, insight and good boundaries, and engagement in recovery work. When the wounded healer pattern is unrecognised, the outcomes can be disastrous with malignant behaviours, such as positioning oneself as a saviour, working to the point of collapse, or breaching boundaries with patients.Claire felt overwhelmed by life’s uncertainties. A self-imposed pause helped her find solid ground | Sara MussaRead moreAs therapy progressed, Bec and I started to explore the messages of self-sacrifice she had unknowingly absorbed. The day she spoke about her sadness at having missed her school formal because she was caring for her mother was a turning point. We could then start to speak about the role of children in a family and the impacts of beingparentified. We worked on emotional recognition and healthy lifestyle management, as well as boundaries.We needed to do a lot of work with the part of Bec that felt guilty for holding boundaries, as well as the guilt she felt when talking about her resentment toward her mother. We encouraged regular rest and worked on helping Bec understand and meet her own emotional and physical needs.Her progress in therapy was slow as the ground we covered was vast, but this work allowed Bec to have a more realistic appraisal of the importance of work, and to nurture an identity outside the self-sacrificial healer role.* Bec is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify many similar cases that I seeDr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

The result? Cruel cuts and a chronic fear of desperately needed public spendingSun 6 Jul 2025 08.35 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 13.25 EDTShareOn 6 September 2022, Liz Truss entered No 10 with a clear vision for the country; the country asked her to leaveless than 50 days later. But nearly three years on, even though all that remains of her premiership at Downing Street is a portrait she didn’t stick around long enough to see hung, it is she who really runs Britain.Not through her influence – which has since been reduced to poorly attended speechesat far-right conferencesin the US – but through the fear she left behind. Truss may be gone, but what remains is the shadow her failure cast, and the rigid fiscal caution that grew out of it.Last week’sbenefits bill fiascois a case in point. While all the talk from this government was about getting disabled people into work, they presented no real evidence that siphoning money away from this group will achieve this. The benefit cuts were driven by a rush to find government savings after GDP growth forecasts were lower than expected, threatening the chancellor’s ability to meet her own fiscal rules. If this strikes you as an odd way to make major policy decisions, then you’re not alone.We’ve ended up in a world where aone percentage point differencein a GDP forecast cascades down into a series of reforms that would have pushed hundreds of thousands into poverty. Why? Because the possibility of not meeting the fiscal rules was apparently spooking the markets.The chancellor has been consistent with these fiscal rules. She told theGlobal Borrowers and Bond Investment Forum(ie bond investors, the same people who turned on Liz Truss) that they were essential for underpinning financial stability.But fiscal rules have become a religion. In this self-imposed straitjacket, governments believe they can only spend if the economy is growing and borrow if the bond markets nod approvingly. These rules weren’t created by Truss, but their new totemic status in British politics was forged in the fire she left behind.The result? We’ve boxed ourselves into a corner. Our public sector needs money. Growth is flat and threatened by global instability. Interest rates are high. But under these arbitrary rules, we’re left with just two levers: raise taxes or cut spending.MPs and the public have shown that they are unwilling to tolerate further cuts, seemingly more alive than the government to the fact that they will create further costs in the long run. Who can blame them? The public isn’t irrational. They have seen the state decay after 14 years of cuts; they don’t believe it will be able to stand another round. They have also lived through years of stagnant wages and will be wary of tax rises on the back of already squeezed household budgets.Plans to means-test thewinter fuel paymentled to this government being accused of attacking elderly people. Last week, £5bn of rushed and flawed benefit cutswere rightly destroyedthrough a rebellion from the government’s own MPs.And while there is a growing consensus about the need to tax wealth fairly, this government so far appears unwilling to make these trade-offs. The closest we have come to anything resembling a bold wealth tax is a fairly meagre change tocapital gains tax rates.And so here we are, being informed that there is a “black hole” in the public finances that must be filled at all costs, yet with no politically acceptable route to make this happen. But there is a third lever that they should consider: rethink the fiscal rules themselves, and with them, our assumptions about debt and growth. Instead, Westminster treats these constraints as sacred.That’s the legacy of Truss.Her mini-budgetmay have collapsed in days, but the fear it left behind governs us still. The bond market is now our unofficial second chamber. Every policy is measured against its hypothetical response. It doesn’t matter that the markets themselves aren’t demanding cuts, only that politicians think they might.After the welfare vote debacle, this much is clear: Starmer must change. Labour MPs will demand it | Rafael BehrRead moreWe are approaching a fundamental choice: do we continue trying to appease the markets by clinging to a set of self-imposed constraints that block the kind of spending needed to improve living standards and revive growth? Or do we remove those constraints and make the decisions necessary to fix our economy? I know which I’d prefer, not least because public investment can boost growth, raise tax revenues and ease pressure on the national debt over time. The alternative of more austerity risks doing the opposite: choking off growth, weakening the economy and actually making our debt burden harder to manage as a result.The fear is that markets will punish us for daring to spend. But that fear has become self-defeating. In reality, the financial returns from well-targeted public spending – on infrastructure, childcare, health, skills – are often far higher than our anaemic assumptions allow. The economic returns are bigger, the benefits broader and the risks lower than we have conditioned ourselves to believe. A politics that always talks down the impact of spending ends up justifying stagnation.That fear is how you end up with a government paralysed by its own Truss trauma, an exhausted politics where every problem is diagnosed but none are treated, because every solution breaks a taboo. And the longer we stay in this holding pattern, the more brittle the state becomes – and the more we’re left asking why nothing ever seems to change.Until someone finds the courage to govern without flinching, we will remain stuck in this loop, where fear dictates policy, and decline is dressed up as stability. Until then, this is Liz Truss’s UK – we’re all just living in it.Max Mosley is a senior economist at the NewEconomicsFoundationExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionEconomic policyTax and spendingLabourRachel ReevesLiz TrussEconomic growth (GDP)commentShareReuse this content"

I remember my own journey down to Exeter in 2022, the first stage in what I hoped would be an experience to set me up for the rest of my life. Little did I know that this was the calm before the storm, before anyone had heard ofChatGPT, or imagined the chaos that generative AI was about to cause for new graduates.Fast forward to 2025, and some of the young people I began this journey with have realised that they’ve spent the last three years training for graduate jobs that don’t exist.Many firms are now slashing their number of new hires. Big accountancy firms havecut back on graduate recruitment; Deloitte reduced its scheme by 18%, while EY has cut the number of graduates it’s recruiting by 11%.According to datacollected by the job search site Adzuna, entry-level job opportunities in financehave dropped by 50.8%, and those for IT services have seen a decrease of 54.8%.The main cause of this is artificial intelligence, which is destroying many of the entry-level jobs open to recent graduates. Companies are now relying on AI to replicate junior-level tasks, removing the need for them to hire humans. It feels like a kick in the teeth to students and recent graduates, who were already entering a challenging labour market. Once, graduates who had toiled through multiple rounds of interviews, battled it out with other applicants at an assessment centre, and made it through to the final round, could hope to get a job in a sector such as consultancy or accountancy. These historically secure, solid and (some would say) boring options guaranteed you gainful and well-paid employment and a clear career path.It’s true that my fellow students are embracing AI – but this is what the critics aren’t seeing | Elsie McDowellRead moreNow, those secure opportunities feel as though they’re evaporating. Since applicants can’t see jobs that no longer exist, their experience of this intense competition for fewer jobs is often limited to a series of disappointments and rejections.Should a student or recent graduate apply for one of these elusive opportunities, their application will frequently be evaluated and often declined by an AI system before a human even reads it. Friends who have recently graduated tell me of the emotional toll of talking to their webcam during an AI-generated interview in the hope that the system judges in their favour, a process that can be repeated again and again.So far, creative fields, and those that involve real-life human contact, seem more impervious to this trend. It will probably be a period of time before doctors or nurses, or professions that rely on genuine creativity such as painters or performing artists, find themselves replaced with an AI model. Even so, if people become increasingly unable to spot AI, and businesses continue to embrace it, the risk is that professions such as art and illustration also get devalued over time, and replaced by a bleak, AI-generated cocktail of eerily familiar “creative” work.Conservative politicians and the rightwing press have often suggested that the most valuable degrees are those that have a clear job at the end of them (and that those in more creative fields, such as the humanities, are by implication less valuable). As one Times columnistwrote recently, students who do “less practical” degrees are more likely to be “living at home, working on their script/novel/music/art portfolio while earning pocket money”, without either a profession or a useful skill.But what use is a degree in accountancy if you can’t then get an accounting job at the end of it? Why is this course more valuable than studying something that teaches you critical thinking and transferrable skills – anthropology, say, or (in my case) Arabic and Islamic studies? Cuts to higher education mean that we’re already seeing the end of some of those degrees often labelled as “useless”, yet the supposedly “useful” subjects start to look less valuable when the jobs associated with them are replaced by AI models that didn’t take three years to learn these skills.The end of university is already a terrifying time. Three or four years of preparing a bulletproof LinkedIn profile and creating a plan for the future suddenly becomes real. The last thing a person needs aged 21 is for an AI model to take the job they were told their degree was essential for. Today the playing field that exists is different to that of a year ago, and it will undoubtedly be different again when I and many other students graduate in a year’s time. The adults who implore us to embrace AI to streamline everyday tasks and improve the efficiency of the working day often alreadyhaveworking days, a promise that feels as though it’s drifting further and further away.Connor Myers is a student at the University of Exeter and an intern on the Guardian’s positive action schemeExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionChatGPTGraduate careersStudentsComputingHigher educationWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

And we can pay for cooling measures like splash pads and trees by taxing the worst pollutersSun 6 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 10.25 EDTShareThere’s a lot to be anxious about as a new parent, let alone in a heatwave when the thermometer in your one-year-old daughter’s room is reading 26C. That’s six degrees higher than the upper limit of therecommended temperaturefor a child’s room. After scrolling my phone for advice on how to cool her room, I couldn’t help waking up every few hours to check she was OK on the baby monitor.In the UK, we are unprepared at every level for the extreme weather caused by climate breakdown. Whether it’s unbearably hot buildings in the summer, our damp and cold homes (some of the leakiest in Europe) filled with mould in the winter, our unprotected towns built on flood plains, or our unfit-for-purpose train tracks that get shut down at the slightest weather warning, the climate crisis is already wreaking havoc on public and private infrastructure – and it’s only getting worse.Despite heatwaves becoming more common in the UK, the dangers from extreme heat are not well known. Heatwaves are often described as “silent killers” – elderly and vulnerable people are at risk of dying alone and in their homes. At the moment, thegovernment’s own advisers saythat heat deaths could rise several times over to exceed 10,000 in an average year by 2050 without action. Vulnerable groups such as disabled people, elderly people and children are most at risk from extreme heat. But low-paid workers and those forced to work outside are at high risk as well. Take the example of theSpanish street sweeperwho died last week in Barcelona after working for hours in the heat of the day, or theconstruction worker David Azevedowho died in France in 2022.The main solution offered up to us is air conditioning – but it actively worsens climate effects and extreme heat for everyone else by pumping hot air into the streets while using huge amounts of power. Air conditioning can actuallyraise the temperatureof cities by more than 2C, and it was found that cooling measuresaccounted for an estimated 37%of the increase in US electricity demand during April-September 2024 compared with the same period the year before.Instead of jumping to this as the only solution, we need to embrace practical, low-carbon solutions such as increasing tree cover and greenery in our cities, and utilising theshade they provide to release water vapour into the airand improve air quality. The government could invest in water-cooling methods such assustainable fountains, splash pads and spray parks, protect bodies of water such as canals, and continue to implement measures to lessen car use – while prioritising air conditioning for the places that need it most such as hospitals, care homes, public transport and nurseries.View image in fullscreenA child stands on a splash pad in Cincinnati, Ohio on 20 June 2025.Photograph: Joshua A Bickel/APRedesigning our cities and towns this way could be transformative. For example, Barcelona has a burgeoning network of more than400 free sheltersthat offer refuge from sweltering summer heat and the winter cold. And in Singapore,open spaces around buildingshave been added in addition to extending green spaces and implementing other measures such as using lighter colours on roofs and walls.Homeowners should be supported, and landlords required to reduce internal heat in houses. Councils and governments should be upgrading social infrastructure, including hospitals and nursing homes, with insulation, reflective surfaces and good ventilation to avoid them from overheating. We could also begin exploring the use of green walls and roofs as well as external shading through trees, awnings, external blinds and shutters. Investing in these measures could be supported by a fairer taxation system, to ensure polluting corporations and those with extreme wealth pay up to help tackle these issues.It’s not just regulation and building rules that should be changed – we need to ensure workers’ rights are at the heart of adaptation planning too. While there are accepted lower temperature limits for workplaces, there is still no legal upper limit for how hot an office or factory can be. This must be changed to ensure workers are protected and employers invest in heatproofing. TheTUC, among other trade union bodies, wants to see a legal maximum temperature for indoor work of 30C (27C for those doing strenuous work). There should also be a legal duty for employers to protect those working outside by providing sun protection and water, and organising work so they are not outside during the hottest part of the day.Italy limits outdoor work as heatwave breaks records across EuropeRead moreLocal authorities could help the public make sensible decisions by giving timely information on heat warnings. And the NHS must do more to alert vulnerable people with heart and respiratory conditions to the dangers, as rates of death caused by heat start to climb at much lower temperatures than we expect.As we make the case for these necessary and fair adaptations to a warming world, we must not forget that there is still a moral case to reduce our emissions. Every degree of warming makes a difference to the overall impact on our planet and humanity at large – and to approach the adaptation debate with an either/or mindset is to lose on both fronts. It is challenging, but the truth is we must not just accept the trajectory we are on as if we have no power to change course. We must double down on our efforts to push our political leaders to drastically reduce our emissions in a way that is fair, as well as investing in the resilience of communities to ensure we are able to live well as temperatures continue to rise.

Then Lena Dunham came calling with the job of a lifetime. Is the actor ready to take centre stage?Sun 6 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 6 Jul 2025 05.10 EDTShareWhenLena Dunhammessaged, Megan Stalter lost it. “Like d’uhh,” Stalter is explaining – delighting, really. “Who wouldn’t? I was at home: this really bad apartment in Laurel Canyon [in the Hollywood Hills]. The area is haunted, and it was actually a really scary building, and nothing ever got fixed because apparently in the lease I signed they didn’t have to repair anything! I don’t actually live there now …” Stalter, 34, has a tendency to wander off on tangents. So Dunham?“OK yes, so we were just about to start filming Hacks again.” The wildly popular, 48-times-Emmy-nominated HBO comedy in which Stalter plays nepo-baby Kayla, a chaotic and kind-hearted talent agent, her total-commitment-to-the-bit characterisation making her a breakout star. “And there Lena was in my DMs.” Stalter opened the message, which said: “I have a project I want to talk to you about.” “That’s when I lost my mind,” she adds. “Panic set in.”“I’m not,” Stalter clarifies, “a celebrity person. I don’t fangirl over people – but with Lena I do. She’s a creative genius; I’m such a Girls nut, and always felt so connected to her.” In its six seasons, Dunham’s HBO hit transformed television through its unflinching portrayal of millennial women. Eight years since the final episode broadcast, the Dunham buzz hasn’t abated.Breathe, Stalter had to remind herself. “OK, calm down, diva – ‘project’ is vague. It might be a commercial, an event, a task, maybe.” Not that Stalter was fussy. “Anything she wanted me to do, I would obviously say yes.” Turns out, Dunham didn’t need errands running. “And thank God, honestly.”Dunham was in the early stages of developing Too Much, her semi-autobiographical Netflix 10-parter, which is released on 10 July. Following Jessica (Stalter), an American thirtysomething workaholic who relocates from New York to England in the deepest throes of heartbreak, the show plays out as an offbeat romcom, with Will Sharpe (The White Lotus, Flowers) playing the indie-musician love interest.Stalter’s attempts at regional British accents, and a cocaine-fuelled dance break from Richard E Grant, are some of the show’s unexpected highlights. Loosely, it’s based on Dunham’s own experiences: after splitting from music producer Jack Antonoff, she met her now husband, British musician Luis Felber, in London. They wrote Too Much together.“Jessica is going through a really horrible breakup,” Stalter says, “and this person she was with previously made her feel she’s ‘too much’, and not in a good way. She falls for someone new pretty quickly who does accept who she is and, when she’s surrounded by people who appreciate her, realises she’s yes, a little bit much, in a great way.”In the show, Dunham plays Jessica’s older sister. “When Lena and I got on Zoom we just clicked. She said right away that if Girls was about sex and discovering who you are, Too Much is a story of love and discovering acceptance. For Lena, like Jessica, finding someone who accepted her the way she is encourages her to embrace herself.”View image in fullscreen‘When Lena and I got on Zoom, we just clicked’ … Stalter with Dunham in a scene from the series.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixPre-Hacks, Dunham had been introduced to Stalter by Andrew Scott, who drops by for a cameo in this series. “From the moment I conceived the character,” Dunham says, “even before I began collaborating with Luis, it was always Meg. I had a feeling that she could be both intensely funny and do something darker and more vulnerable.”Pre-Hacks, Stalter built a cult social media following, regularly posting clips of kooky skits and characters (small-town butter shop during Pride month;Woman flirts at a bowling alley) that caught Dunham’s eye. “Meg is never looking down on the characters she plays,” she says, “no matter how delusional or silly they may seem. She truly falls in love with, and goes to bat for, whoever she’s playing – and it’s contagious.”Hacks season three review – finally! TV’s best comedy makes it to the UKRead moreIt’s late March when I first meet Stalter, in the lobby of a central London hotel. Shooting on Too Much has wrapped, but it’s early stages in the months-long slog of a press and promo schedule a Dunham x Netflix collab demands. She’s late, 15 minutes maybe, although she’s staying right upstairs. “I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry!” she gushes, all smiles, dropping her teddy bear phone case on the table. “We were working on the ponytail for the day and got carried away! Almond latte?”Both Stalter and Dunham found bringing Jessica to life an intimate undertaking. Long before shooting started, they spoke extensively about the material and Dunham’s own experiences. Script by script, they’d dissect. “Lena had a small writers’ room where they’d bounce ideas together,” says Stalter, “then after that, it would come to me, and I would have lots of questions: her previous bad relationship; her family; how she was feeling.”View image in fullscreenBed fellows … Will Sharpe and Megan Stalter in Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixDunham remembers these well. “Meg is a very intuitive performer,” she tells me, “not method, but she hashermethod. She asks specific questions that may seem random or left-of-centre and then it always finds its way into the work.”Stalter made lists of how she and Jessica were similar, then differed. “So, like, in common: we are both very anxious people. Not in common: she’s lost her dad, I haven’t. Jessica is straight and I’m a mostly lesbian bisexual. But I have dated men. And Jessica might not date women, but sexuality is a spectrum … Me and Lena both agreed that if she’d explored a little, maaaaaybe she would have dated women.”We are made to feel small or too big, sometimes both at the same time, unless we’re neatly in a perfect boxOn set, over four months in London, this proximity continued. “If it felt like an emotional scene,” says Stalter, “I’d want a moment just with her, so I felt more connected.” There’s a post-coital scene where Jessica’s sexual self-confidence falters. “Lena and I talked a lot about how, after a breakup, no matter how hot or beautiful you feel and are, you can be so beaten down that insecurity hits.”The pair spoke extensively, too, about the show’s title, with its heap of gendered connotations. Is “you’re too much” a phrase she’s had lobbed in her direction? Stalter furrows her brow. “Excuse me, sir, no; people see me as calm, cool and collected.” Three seconds of deadpan, before the laughter erupts. “I am definitely seen as too much. Any loud woman will be told she’s  too much at some point. We are made to feel small or too big, sometimes both at the same time, unless we’re neatly in a perfect box. A lot of women experience it: me and Lena were both told we were too much, but then decided we like that about ourselves. I think it’s so sexy to be loud and funny, weird and strange, silly and goofy. It was at school that I realised those traits are often welcomed in boys, but not girls.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m a loud woman from a loud family’ … Megan Stalter.Photograph: Nolwen Cifuentes/The GuardianAt the Stalter family home in Cleveland, Ohio, this just wasn’t the case. “I’m a loud woman from a loud family: 20 cousins, mostly women, a few males thrown in, I guess.” Dad’s a tattoo artist, and mum a nurse. “I have two sisters, a brother and lots of aunts. These are funny, opinionated, not-very-quiet women with big personalities – and that was totally normal. So it was, umm, interesting to then be in the real world where women are made to feel they can’t be those things.” She scrunches her face, lugging her voice up an octave: “We’re told to be polite and small and dainty.” Pitch back down. “But that’s not me, girl.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Not popular. Teachers made me feel small and not smart. I found myself shrinking into myself, getting quiet and nervous, except in drama and performance. I’d never get good parts; people thought I was bad, but I could be myself at least.”Through her late teens, Stalter tried all sorts at community college. Teaching wasn’t a good fit. Neither was nursing. “Listen, nurses are incredible,” she says, “but I’m not supposed to be a nurse. I pass out at blood. Emotionally I was into it, but practically, it was not working.” Nothing was sticking. “OK so I also love Jesus,” she continues, no change in pace. “I’m a real God-girlie. If I wasn’t going to do something I loved, I wanted to do something that helped God. I tried some mission work, and stuff with my church.” She attended a Pentecostal church from a young age, and aged 20 spent six months with a Christian youth organisation in South America. She gave Bible school a go, too. “I tried for several years, but I really missed performing. I thought: ‘If this is in me, maybe it’s my service. Maybe God wants me to do what I really want to do, and share it with the world.’”Stalter joined a local improv class. “I thought I was so good,” she says, “but everyone there for some reason kept telling me I wasn’t? Later on, a friend told me I was a bit likeMichael Scott in The Office: walking on and messing things up. But I always felt deluded in my talent and how special I was, which really kept me going until I actually got good.”View image in fullscreenDog days … Too Much.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/NetflixAged 24, she moved to Chicago to pursue standup. “And I performed for years there. It went OK, but not much was happening for me.” Everything changed when she started posting – an art for which Stalter has a knack – launching a spoofself-titled online talkshow. “I was on Instagram live every night with a new theme. I’d set up weird things: ‘Crazy trip to Paris night’; be a travel agent and pretend to book things. That is when it all took off.” In 2019, she moved to New York, and the gigs kept coming: Hacks, indie film Cora Bora, sell-out standup shows and now Too Much.In June, we speak again over Zoom, Stalter now back at home in Los Angeles in a thankfully ghost-free residence, with her girlfriend. “Oh, and our two kitties, and a terrier who is really attached to me. Too attached, really. The separation anxiety is a problem.”It’s intense, Los Angeles right now: anti-ICE protests and the general bad Trump vibes percolating. “It’s really upsetting,” Stalter says, “devastating and scary.” She’s been to some marches. “People have to keep coming together to protest and support one another. We’re fighting for each other.” Throwing herself into Too Much has been a much-welcomed escape.It’s no affront to Stalter’s range to see a through-line from her characters: from those early viral creations all the way to Jessica. Whether self-invented for standup and socials, or brought to life from scripts on screen, they tend to be big, bold, slightly berserk. “What,” she’s grinning, “am I not as crazy as you expected? I like to play people who are nervous-confident: women who have a level of self-love but are falling apart and pretend they’re not. I do a lot of standup with a persona I’ve built, too, where the character – me – pretends to be really talented but the show crumbles.”View image in fullscreenAgent of chaos … Stalter and Hannah Einbinder in Hacks.Photograph: HBOStalter sees some of herself in these characters. “I’m wild in that way,” she says, “although I’m not horrible, I’m actually very nice. But I feel so confident on stage acting this crazy bitch. Something inside of me is over the top. When I’m at my most relaxed and comfortable, like on stage, it also comes out of me.” Playing characters who often move through the world unconcerned by judgment has made Stalter reflect.“There’s something really freeing about playing someone like that,” she believes. “In real life, I’m such a people pleaser. I struggle with wanting everyone to be happy all the time, for them to be happy with me, scared of upsetting someone or having someone be mad at me. It’s my greatest fear: like I’m going to die if someone is mad at me. It’s something I’m working on in therapy.”Might that be a tricky trait in her industry? Dunham told New York magazine in 2024 she refrained from casting herself as the lead in part because she “was just not up for having my body dissected again”. Too Much is Stalter’s first leading TV role, and it’s a big-hitter: there will be reviews, comparisons to Girls, so much more exposure.Stalter feigns a look of panic at the prospect. “Wouldn’t it be so funny if I passed out?” She smacks her hand on the table, leaving her latte wobbling. Another smile. She shrugs off the pressure. “I’m a woman comedian who puts stuff on the internet, babe,” comes her reply, “and I’m not skinny. So I’ve already had the meanest stuff said about me. Any woman posting – yes, skinny women, too – will get it. So I’m not worried when someone says something unkind, or doesn’t like me in a show, honestly. I literally have a viral clip that’s me reading out the worst, craziest abuse: ‘Fat white comedian does crazy bomb set.’”She pauses for a moment. “It’s only in my personal life that I’m a massive people pleaser. If strangers say they hate Too Much, or me, whatever: I think I’m hot, I love how I look, and I love my comedy. I am who I am, and can’t be anything but my loud self.”Too Much is on Netflix from20 July.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionLena DunhamTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Powerful emotions – tears, terror, ecstasy, despair – caused not by real events, but by the brain’s activity between sleeping and waking.Dreams and nightmares have long been studied by psychologists. Now they are the subject of a new exhibition featuring several artists that were patients at the world’s oldest psychiatric hospital, Bethlem (sometimes known as Bedlam), and its sister institution, the Maudsley hospital.It includes paintings by Charlotte Johnson Wahl, the late mother of Boris Johnson, who spent eight months as a patient at the Maudsley after a breakdown when her four children were aged between two and nine. She created dozens of paintings while there, and held her first exhibition which sold out. “I couldn’t talk about my problems, but I could paint them,” she said later.View image in fullscreenBetween Sleeping and Waking: Hospital Dreams and Visions is at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in Beckenham, London, from 14 AugustPhotograph: Bethlem Museum of the MindRachel Johnson, her daughter, said inan interviewearlier this year that her mother’s stay at the Maudsley “gave her relief from domesticity, and time to paint. We always accepted that painting was like oxygen to her. But when she returned to us, we could see she was still very ill.”Two of Johnson Wahl’s paintings are included in the exhibition, Between Sleeping and Waking: Hospital Dreams and Visions, which opens at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in August.The centrepiece of the show is a huge installation, Night Tides, by contemporary artist Kate McDonnell. She uses swathes of bedding woven with disordered words to evoke the restlessness and clashing thoughts of insomnia.According to Caroline Horton, professor of sleep and cognition and director of DrEAMSLab at Bishop Grosseteste university in Lincoln, “dreaming occurs during sleep, and sleep is essential for all aspects of mental and physical health.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This exhibition captures the intrigue of our night-time experiences, both positive and negative, while showcasing their intricate relationship with our mental health.”Among other works featured in the exhibition is London’s Overthrow by Jonathan Martin, an arsonist held in the “criminal lunatic department” of Bethlem hospital from 1829 until his death in 1838. In 2012, theGuardian described itas a “mad pen-and-ink depiction of the capital’s destruction due to godlessness”.In 1828, Martin, who was driven to expose corruption within the church, had delivered warnings to clergy in York, urging them to repent of the “bottles of wine, and roast beef and plum pudding”. When they failed to respond, he set fire to York minster. At his trial, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.An illustrated poem, “Epitaph, of my poor Jack, Squirrel”, by James Hadfield, one of Bethlem’s most notorious patients, who spent 41 years in the hospital, will be on display for the first time. Experiencing delusions about the end of the world, Hadfield became convinced that he must sacrifice himself to save humankind. He decided to engineer a situation where his life would be taken by others – an attempt to kill King George III.He was arrested and his lawyer successfully argued at his trial that he was “incurably insane”, and he was sent to a cell in Bethlem rather than prison. At the hospital, he was allowed pets, including squirrels, and he sold pictures of them to visitors. His autopsy revealed severe brain injuries dating back to his years as a young soldier.The dream diaries of a Maudsley psychiatrist, Edward Hare, will also be on display for the first time. Over half a century, from the 1940s to the 1990s, Hare recorded his impressions on waking of his dreams from the mundane to the fantastical.Colin Gale, director of the Bethlem Museum of the Mind, said the artwork in its collections reflected “an entire spectrum of dreams identified by sleep researchers”.Between Sleeping and Waking: Hospital Dreams and Visionsis at the Bethlem Museum of the Mind in Beckenham,London, from 14 August.

Bomer is tall and striking, in her mid-50s. I met her last year at a reading in Williamsburg, Virginia, where she seemed like someone who cared almost manically about literature and also like someone who would be fun to hang out with, two qualities not always confluent. I had heard of these anxious dogs before, when she and I met for dinner a few months ago, and she disclosed that her life was now spent managing canine neuroses.“I got them when my dad died,” she says, in between offering me matcha, coffee, tequila or wine (it’s 2.30pm on a Sunday; Bomer doesn’t drink any more, save a glass of champagne on selling her book, but doesn’t mind if others do). “The dogs were a mistake,” she says, “But that’s OK, I’ll survive it.”Bomer was involved with the cohort of mid-2000s US writing broadly characterised as “alt lit”, an irreverent internet vernacular-driven movement personified byTao Lin. She published anonymously on the websiteHTML Giantand had her first novel, Nine Months, in a drawer for 10 years. Mark Doten of Soho Press picked it up in 2012. Since then she has been widely admired in the literary world for her transgressive, vivid work, which often examines women at points of great pressure from an uncanny perspective – her fans include Sam Lipsyte and Jonathan Franzen. This admiration has not yet fully broken through to a mainstream audience, but her new book looks set to do so.Bomer’s latest novel, The Stalker, is all about the nastiest, most parasitic kind of survival. Its antihero, Robert Doughten Savile or “Doughty”, is the bearer of an entitlement so groundless and infinite that it obliterates anyone he approaches. Born to a once-wealthy Connecticut family but now without material means, he uses his charisma and total confidence to live in New York as he believes he deserves. He lies effortlessly, inventing lavish real estate deals while in fact whiling away his afternoons watching George Carlin specials, smoking crack in the park, and allowing older men to perform oral sex on him in Grand Central for a little extra cash. In the evenings, meanwhile, he is primed to identify and zone in on women who may prove useful.This is Doughty’s great gift, knowing what a woman needs and what she will tolerate to get it, how his cruelty is best deployed or concealed. To nauseating effect, his skill escalates operatically as the book continues. It’s a knockout novel, one I’ve passed around to friends, scenes from which I still feel a thrill of horror to recall.“Originally I wanted him to be the devil,” she says. “The actual devil, evil incarnate. But then I found myself humanising him. And I kind of regret it.” By the simple relentlessness of his presence, his unwillingness to allow the women enough space or thought to disengage from his influence, he comes to represent male intrusion on female life.“On a daily basis, if you leave your building you are dealing with some shitty man spewing garbage,” she says. “It wears on us, and that’s why I have a problem with critics being weary of the survivor-victim thing: ‘Oh just get over it, it’s boring, you can be strong.’ It’s like, I did try that. I did that: ‘I’m strong. I’m going to shoot pool with the guys.’ Although, I really do like to shoot pool.” We derail here while she leads me to her office, pleasantly cluttered with paintings like the rest of the flat, so that she can show me her pool cue, which she has had since she was 19. I ask if she was good. “You rank ’em out of six, I was a solid three. But on a good day I could beat a six.”Many, many people are ciphers. They will add nothing to your life, and they will leave with so much of youWe return to the question of victim fatigue, something that has been on my own mind lately, having just read a brilliant memoir called Trauma Plot by Jamie Hood, which exists partly in conversation with the cultural malaise around making art about having survived violence and abuse. Both Hood’s book and Bomer refer to a New Yorker essay by Parul Sehgal titledThe Case Against the Trauma Plot, which argues that overuse of trauma as a narrative device has led to constricted, rote work. Sehgal subsequently panned Sarah Manguso’s autobiographical divorce novel, Liars, describing it as “thin and partial”, and asking: “What is this vision of womanhood, of sexually indiscriminate infants running households?” Bomer, on the other hand, was so moved by Manguso’s depiction of infidelity and the violence of being lied to that she wrote Manguso a fan letter (one of seven she has written in her life, Philip Roth and Franzen among recipients of the others).“Sehgal misses the entire point of the book, which is that Manguso is now free – not bitter, free. Whenever you describe yourself as a victim, you’re immediately dismissed … I feel like finding Doughty’s voice in my book was my way, hopefully, to be heard – in the way that no one wants to fucking hear another story about women. And yet he’s such an everyman. So it’s like, here’s your cliche then.”Bomer was raised in Indiana by a French professor father and an Austrian mother who was a translator and a painter: “She refused to become an American citizen, for political reasons. Which really makes sense now, right? She was ahead of her time in a million different ways.” Her childhood was marred by the worry and dread following her father’s suicide attempt when she was five; she went on to study psychology in what she describes as “an attempt to cure” her father.She was married for 20 years and raised two children, writing as much as possible. When pressed for her strategy there she replies, “I had no social life and my house was a mess.” In 2011, she published her first story collection, Baby; her second, Inside Madeleine, followed in 2014. All were warmly received, but her moment of success around the publication of Inside Madeleine could not take hold fully because, in her words, she “disappeared”. Her father had killed himself not long before, and her mother was in the last stages of a long illness. “My father’s death was horrific and violent. My mother’s was slow. There was no way to process. People don’t want to be around you when you’re suffering.”Bomer was divorced 10 years ago, and describes The Stalker as a sort of divorce book, “but not divorcing a particular man, it’s divorcingmen– a kind of man,” she says, before instantly discluding her two sons and her many friends. After our meeting, she emails me to clarify some of her comments and concludes: “We don’t believe people the first time they hurt us, or the second, or the third – until we do. Because we want to have compassion and believe that if we show love and kindness … we will reap it back. And that is where we are wrong. Many, many people are ciphers. They will add nothing to your life, and they will leave with so much of you.”It’s difficult to reconcile the blunt fatalism of a statement like that one, or indeed the exhilaratingly ghastly novel she has written, with the generous and joyful woman I met. But perhaps the exorcism she has performed with this marvel – a divorce book with no divorce; a book called The Stalker with not that much stalking in it; a book by a middle-aged woman that, following five others, looks set to become her breakthrough hit – has made her so. Not bitter, as she says, but free.The Stalker by Paula Bomer is published by Soho Press. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

And I really disagreed with that. I did not think for a moment that over 2 million people would see it.”It was only her second TikTok live stream on her handle HelenWilsonWales – her first, about her weight loss, had no viewers at all – and initially she had not realised how many people were watching because the sun was shining on her phone screen.“But I could see that when you’re doing a live stream, loads of messages pop up and people can talk to you. So the screen was going mental. People were just like ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.“And I was like: ‘Oh, my God, something’s happening here,’ and so I just knew I had to carry on. People were saying to me: ‘Please keep going, do what you can, please keep going.’ And then that was it,” said Wilson, who grew up in Somerset and was working at the festival.View image in fullscreenKneecap performing on the West Holts stage at Glastonbury. The group called Wilson a ‘legend’ after she livestreamed the gig.Photograph: Hugo Philpott/UPI/ShutterstockThe stream was spreading through word of mouth, as viewers sent it to their friends and family, and Wilson found out later that at one point it was playing on a big screen in a pub in the band’s home town.“I have had a lot of trolling. When you rang, I was just in the middle of deleting some obscene comments off my business Facebook page.“There was somebody on Instagram just saying he sent me a message saying: ‘You’re just a wrinkled old woman looking for attention.’“[In a tabloid newspaper] I’ve been referred to as a middle-aged woman. Like, what has that got to do with anything?” said the 44-year-old.“This is about the genocide in Palestine, and this is about the failure of our government to act, to do anything about it.”She added: “More people need to know what is going on in Palestine. And we shouldn’t be censoring bands under freedom of speech, full stop. We shouldn’t be censoring anybody who is trying to raise awareness of the atrocities that are taking place.”Afterwards, Kneecap called her a “legend” and offered her free tickets to any of their shows.On Saturday, while supporting Fontaines DC in Finsbury Park in London, the bandonce againled 45,000 people in chants of “fuck Keir Starmer”.The band were far from alone in their sentiments at Glastonbury – dozens of acts and figures at the festival spoke out in support of Palestine, including CMAT, the Libertines, Gary Lineker, Joy Crookes, TV on the Radio, Sorry and Paloma Faith.Kneecap were also backed by Emily and Michael Eavis, the festival’s organisers, with Emily telling the BBC that “everyone is welcome”, before their set.Explore more on these topicsKneecapGlastonbury 2025ProtestSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

On election day 2024, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin voted forDonald Trumpfor the second time in three elections. Barack Obama’s upstairs-downstairs coalition lies in ruins, as Democrats struggle to connect with working-class voters across racial and ethnic lines.Last November, Trump came within just three points of winning a majority of Latino voters. Such Americans walked away from their presumed political home – in droves. A Trump endorsement by Roberto Clemente Jr, son of the late Pittsburgh Pirates baseball star, was a harbinger. Likewise, Trump posted double-digit gains among Catholics and Jews, once core constituencies in the Democratic party of FDR.To quote Bob Dylan, “The times, they are a changin’.” Into the fray jumps Salena Zito with her latest book, Butler, and its dramatic subtitle, The Untold Story of the Near Assassination of Donald Trump and the Fight for America’s Heartland.Zito is definitely a Trump fan, living in western Pennsylvania, a place that’s become part of Trumplandia. No wonder: her analysis is sharp-eyed and her anecdotes revealing – she walks among Them. Beyond that, she possesses roots and an affinity for her “Yinzers”.These days, she writes for the Washington Examiner and is a contributor to the Washington Post. Last time out, withThe Great Revolt, co-authored with Brad Todd in 2018, she painted a portrait of Trump’s base that was not standard GOP-issue and a Democratic party overly reliant on coastal elites. That take remains valid. Other than in faculty meetings, you can’t win elections solely with the votes of JDs, MDs and PhDs. More voters lack four year-degrees than those who have them.Butler, turns to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the failed July 2024 assassination attempt on Trump, as a serendipitously fitting backdrop and fulcrum of the events that preceded and followed. She had access to the Trump, JD Vance and the senior staff of the campaign.Trump delivers bouquets of compliments. Zito is flattered, even enthusiastic. She enjoys the rapport, admires her subject. Trump is not a lab specimen or patient. She is not his psychologist. Rather, he talks to her, expresses concern about her grandchildren, and offers a lesson in politics 101: empathy goes far.On the page, Trump takes Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to task for waiting a year before appearing at the village of East Palestine, Ohio, the site of a major railcar disaster, 42 miles from Butler.“They never showed up to see them,” Trump tells Zito. “Never. It’s a shame. I did, I came, I told them I would not forget them and I won’t.”Ohio, Vance’s state, went Republican by better than 10 points. All of Ohio’s top elected officials are nowRepublicans. In polarized times, ticket-splitting grows rare.Elon Musk talked to Zito too. There’s nothing like the zeal of a 12-figure convert, the world’s richest person. Given the current fallout between Musk and Trump, it is memorable stuff, a bromance before it went off the rails.Butler unintentionally delivers a packet of receipts.“I asked Musk if I could interview him, and he said: sure,” Zito recalls.“‘Who are the ones that are trying to silence free speech? That’s the Democrats,’” Musk advises.“They’re the ones trying to silence free speech,” he continues. “You know who the bad guys are – the ones who want to stop you from speaking. Those are the bad guys. It’s a no-brainer.”To put it mildly, irony abounds. Never mind what Musk did to X, formerly Twitter, in terms of promoting one sort of view and quashing another. Since their relationship turned to dust, Trump has threatened to deport Musk and cancel his government contracts.In hindsight, that the Trump-Musk relationship would last long would have been a bad bet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But whatever you think of the legislation or Musk, Trump holds a decisive advantage.Beyond the obvious, regarding simple power, Trump is a far better showman. Startling to say it, he is way less weird. Musk is the nerd who always wanted to hang with the cool kids.Zitodevotes attentionto the dichotomy between the “placed” and the “placeless” – “people who are rooted in their places versus people who are essentially nomads” – and its relationship to politics and Trump. The placed are with him; the placeless, not so much.Such demographic faultlines are global. They played an outsized role in the fight over Brexit. Populism is not restricted to the US.In 2017, David Goodhartwrote Road to Somewhere, which examined the forces that drove Brexit. He placed a premium on describing how a sense of belonging has come to shape politics, in an uncertain world.His typology divided society between “anywheres” and “somewheres”, with the archetypal anywhere possessing a degree or two from Oxbridge or the Ivy League, a portable skill set, and a spouse who shares similar credentials. By contrast, somewheres lack those markers, and find the world a less welcoming place.GDP figures and personal income statistics alone do not convey the entire story. In 2016, “fuck your feelings” was a Trumpian battle cry – though those shouting it did not take kindly to being called deplorable by Hillary Clinton or, eight years later, being called “garbage” by Biden.As expected, Zito calls out Clinton and Biden for their missteps. Trump or his base, not so much. Yeah, there’s asymmetry. But if you’re a Democrat, punching down is seldom a winning strategy.Butleris publishedin the US by HachetteExplore more on these topicsBooksDonald TrumpRepublicansreviewsShareReuse this content"

When I got my chance, I’d put on I Wan’na Be like You from The Jungle Book.The song I do atkaraokeTale As Old As Time from the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack, even though it’s a duet. My daughter Emilie is 33, but when she’s home, we’ll watch a Disney film together. She turns into a five-year-old, I turn into a young dad and it’s just lovely.The first single I boughtI was 10 and went into this clothes shop in Ashton called Slaters that sold school uniforms, because my dad had given me money to buy a pair of jeans. They had a little record booth and said I could choose a free single. I was intimidated by the older kids, so said: “I’ll have whatever’s No 1,” which just happened to be an incredible record: I Feel Love by Donna Summer.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toCertainly not my own! Never Gonna Give You Up has become ingrained to the point it’s ridiculous. But there have been moments where I’ve stepped out of my own body.The best song to play at a partyAbsolutely everybody will dance to Dancing Queen by Abba if you play it at the right moment, from small kids, teenagers, people in their 20s right the way through to the grannies and granddads.The song that make me cryRidley Scott uses Vide Cor Meum by Patrick Cassidy, which is inspired by Dante’s La Vita Nuova, in Kingdom of Heaven. When the king dies, I have to hold it together not to cry.The song I can no longer listen toI Should Be So Lucky by Kylie Minogue, because apparently when you slow it down to 33rpm, it sounds like me. Even I nearly believed it was me when I first heard it. To clarify: I definitely didnotsing the Kylie version of I Should Be So Lucky.The song that changed my lifeI play drums in a midlife crisis rock band, the Luddites. We do everything from the Sex Pistols to the Clash and Blink 182. Times Like These by Foo Fighters is a favourite.

Unfortunately, scammers are trying to cash in on this summer’s must-see gigs, claiming they can get you into sold-out events. So be on your guard.TheOasisgigs, that kicked off on Friday, are among the big-ticket events being used by fraudsters to trick unsuspecting music fans. Earlier this year, Lloyds Bank said that more than 1,000 customers had fallen victim to scams that offered access to the eagerly anticipated concerts. Fans lost an average of £436 each, with the biggest loss more than £1,700.According to the UK government,in 2024 more than £1.6m was lost to gig ticket fraud, and 3,700 reports were made to Action Fraud. Almost half of the Action Fraud cases related to offers made on social media, and there have been many stories from people who have lost money after responding to posts onFacebook.Some have reported that theirFacebook pages have been hijackedand then used by criminals to trick their family and friends into thinking ticket sales were genuine.Scammers are bold enough to answer questions before running off with your cash. A reader told us he had been convinced that tickets were genuine before transferring £150 to pay for them – as soon as he had, the fraudster disappeared.What the scam looks likePosts on platforms, such as Facebook, claim that people have spare tickets to sell, and say that they can show you proof before you pay. Scroll through posts on fan pages, or on X, and there are hundreds of people claiming to be selling. Some will be genuine, but there is no way of telling from just looking at them.What the messages ask forYou will be asked for a payment – probably by a bank transfer – in exchange for the tickets.What to doIf a friend or family has posted that they are selling the tickets you want, contact them directly rather than dealing with them through social media.Find the website of the venue or band – it will provide links to take you to the legitimate sites to use for ticket sales and resales.Use a credit or debit card to pay online – these give you extra protections if the tickets do not turn up.If you get an email saying tickets are available, check the address – Ticketmaster emails, for example, should come fromnoreply@mailings.ticketmaster.co.uk. Rather than clicking on links sent in emails, go directly to the ticket seller’s page.Make sure any company you buy through is a member of the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star). It has a redress scheme if things go wrong.Ticketmaster also warns to beware of printed tickets, as scammers can distribute the same ticket multiple times.Explore more on these topicsMusicScam watchConsumer affairsOasisScamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But be warned, it is shockingLucy ManganSun 6 Jul 2025 16.00 EDTShareOK, I think it is incumbent upon me as an ethical reviewer to state something up top. I am conscious of our collective emotional fragility in difficult times, so need to say this: do not watch the first episode of Jimmy Doherty’s Big Bear Rescue without some kind of mental fortification to hand. I am no great animal lover. I prefer them to people, obviously, but given absolute freedom of choice I would be without any sentient being in the bunker with me. I’d like to draw the deadbolts across the blast-resistant doors, switch on the air-filtration system, open a tin and a book and wait out my time in silence without responsibility for any other living soul, thank you.However, it’s 72 hours since the closing credits of this programme and I haven’t stopped crying. If that’s an unwanted spoiler for some, so be it. I think I’ve saved you some pain overall.So. You remember Jimmy Doherty, yes? Childhood friend ofJamie Oliver, became a pig farmer, met his wife, Michaela Furney, who was a runner on Jamie’s Kitchen when it came to film on the Cumbrian farm where Doherty was working in 2002. He came to televisual prominence a year or two later with several series of the reality show Jimmy’s Farm, chronicling the ups and down of his sausage-making venture in Essex and other sustainable food/Oliver tie-ins thereafter.In recent years, it seems, the farm has grown in size and scope to become at least in part a rescue centre for animal waifs and strays. Apparently this is what happens if you’re careless enough to settle in the countryside. The Dohertys (the couple have four daughters) have taken in llamas, emus, camels, tapirs, crocodiles, camels and a giant anteater, I presume from zoos and overambitious exotic-pet owners far stupider than their poor abandoned charges.The family now must take on their biggest challenge yet: providing a suitable home for two polar bears, whose zoo in Sweden has been bought by developers. Now staff and animals alike are being turfed out.View image in fullscreenA lot to bear … Ewa in her enclosure.Photograph: Jimmy’s Farm, Red SkyThe ursine duo, mother Ewa and son Mikke, were born and raised in captivity and cannot be released into the wild. They need all the things polar bears need – acres and acres of space, a den, a bear house, woodland, and lakes – and the Dohertys set about providing it all, under the watchful eye of the polar bear expert Douglas Richardson and their vigilant bank manager. When the project is complete, it will be a 28-hectare (70 acre) haven and Europe’s biggest polar bear reserve.Foundations for the bear house are dug, ground is broken for the lakes and almost nine miles of extremely robust fencing – plus a shipment of telegraph poles for posts – is bought. It is repeatedly emphasised that Ewa and Mikke are not the cuddly creatures of children’s picture books but members of one of the biggest carnivore species on Earth and an apex predator. This is brought home to us when Michaela notes that half a dozen employees have been sent away to train as the firearms team that will be needed in the event of a bear-related emergency.In the meantime, Doherty, Richardson and the park director, Stevie Sheppard, visit the Orsa Predator Park in Sweden to learn all they can from its zoologist, Linn Larsson, and the keeper, Johanna Berglund, about their beloved bears (once they leave, says Larsson, “the heart and soul of this mountain will be gone”).Then they begin the mammoth task of transporting the bears more than 1,200 miles across Europe to their new home. Everything is minutely prepared and goes smoothly – we see Ewa and Mikke chomping delightedly on their food as they sail overnight on the ferry from France to Dover – right up until what suddenly becomes a very bitter end. “I want to scream,” says Jimmy, looking shattered. “I want to kick something very hard … It’s heartbreaking. But there was no alternative.”But the Big Bear Rescue remains, despite the shock, an uplifting story. It’s a tale of people who prize something above profit banding together to mitigate the damage others have done, to give animals who would otherwise have been put down a second chance at life. Next week, the new reserve will receive more polar bears and a dozen Arctic wolves. I hear talk of reindeer, too. Hopefully there will be a happier ending – and I will have stopped crying by then.Jimmy Doherty’s Big Bear Rescue is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAnimalsWildlifeZoosConservationDocumentaryreviewsShareReuse this content"

He had been invited to Mayfair for the launch of a book byPeter York, profiler of London’s most privileged bons vivants. But before he left the house, Geldof watched the BBC television news and areport by Michael Buerkabout a hellish famine in Ethiopia.Among the many startling, blackly comic archive clips inLive Aidat 40: When Rock ’n’ Roll Took on the World is footage of Geldof at that glitzy party, reeling from what he had seen on TV and remarking to a fellow guest that it was “gross” for them to be enjoying champagne and canapes. That tension between glamour and guilt is at the heart of this three-part retrospective that doesn’t ignore the flaws in Geldof’s grand plan to use music to feed the world. It’s a fascinating portrait of a complex man’s imperfect attempt to solve an impossible problem.The grand achievement commemorated in the title of the series isLive Aid, the Geldof-organised mega-concert that took place in London and Philadelphia in the summer of 1985. Episode one, however, is all about the smaller but still massive cultural moment that resulted from Geldof’s initial impulse to raise funds for Ethiopia:Do They Know It’s Christmas?, a single by the hastily assembled supergroup Band Aid.Having written the song with Midge Ure of Ultravox, Geldof sets about convincing every pop star in Britain to gather at a recording studio in west London on 25 November 1984. For the first time but not the last, something that shouldn’t be possible happens very quickly: Geldof has the balls to demand participation from A-list stars, who have all seen the Buerk report and are keen to help.View image in fullscreen‘All the rage, all the shame’ … Bob Geldof in Live Aid at 40.Photograph: BBC/Brook LappingPop is far too globalised, atomised and digitised now for such a project to take off: at best in the 21st century, the equivalent celebrity charity effort would be a co-authored viral video. Geldof and Ure both make the point that in 1984, pop gods were overwhelmingly from working-class backgrounds, which is also much less true today. But however it came about, everyone turns up, from Spandau Ballet to Duran Duran, Phil Collins to Sting, Status Quo to Bananarama.The footage of them there together is still intoxicating. George Michael sings a line, looks dissatisfied then fixes it, changing “but say a prayer” to “BUT say a prayer” on the next take.Bonomight be characteristically cringeworthy in his 2025 interview, with his talk of how he and fellow Irishman Geldof “have the folk memory of famine” and are thus particularly attuned to the cause, but he also knows exactly what he’s doing when a lyric sheet and a microphone are in front of him: having been given the song’s darkest, most difficult line, he shifts “Well tonight thank God it’s them, instead of you” up an octave to the top of his register, doubling its impact.Once the single has sold a zillion copies, we witness Geldof’s transformation from musician to activist. Before long he is meetingMother Teresa(“She played the old lady shtick but boy, this was showbusiness”) and telling world leaders what he thinks of them: the documentary has dug up a clip of him ambushing Margaret Thatcher over her initial insistence on collecting VAT on every record sold. In a situation where one could so easily think of the right thing to say afterwards when it’s too late, Geldof rather magnificently knocks down her glib defence of western inaction there and then. He is even more unapologetic with the president of Ethiopia, swearing at him to his face, although sadly there’s no footage of that and we have to rely on Geldof’s recall.The most stunning moment is another Geldof recollection, from when he was in a desert in Ethiopia and heard Do They Know it’s Christmas? on the radio: when he gets to the part about listening to that Bono line while looking directly at the horror it referred to, the present-day Geldof suddenly bursts into tears. “All the rage, all the shame” is his bluntly eloquent summary of emotions that are still with him, and he is frank here about becoming a white saviour figure who placed himself in the spotlight – but had to do that to keep the media interested.Whether Geldof ultimately struck that balance is explored in the two further episodes, as is the question of how the money was distributed and how much self-interest drove the artists who performed at Live Aid. But there’s no debating what an extraordinary phenomenon it was.Live Aid at 40: When Rock ’n’ Roll Took on the World aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionLive AidBob GeldofBonoFaminereviewsShareReuse this content"

Seen together, they are remarkably similar in structure. An anguished narrator – Judas in 33 AD; Che in the mid-20th century – provokes and rebukes a protagonist to whom sanctity is attributed – Jesus; Eva – and who threatens the political classes with a revolution. Paul Hart’s staging for his innovative riverside venue in Berkshire benefits – as does Jamie Lloyd’s London Palladium Evita – from the current rise of political and religious populism, giving shows either side of 50 years old a strikingly topical context.Hart uses seventeen actor-musicians, strumming or blowing between lines, with only the title character not playing an instrument, making Jesus look like a vocalist with a massive backing band. But the power of the production is how the cast devastatingly excavate the emotion in the lyrics. Clearly knowing from the outset that he must die – and that his human incarnation makes him sometimes dread and fear this – Michael Kholwadia’s Jesus, unlike the serene hippy-magician in some productions, embodies the “haunting, hunted” look described by Christian Edwards’ Pilate, whose “Pilate’s Dream” is also sung in a tone closer to nightmare.This emphasis on the horror that Christ’s mission and passion would have caused to those around him extends to Parisa Shahmir’s tinglingly sung Mary Magdalene. By unusually stressing the line “He scares me so” in I Don’t Know How To Love Him, she makes exceptional sense of the later reboot plea, Could We Start Again, Please?View image in fullscreenTingling … Parisa Shahmir as Mary Magdalene.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianConversely, the Judas of Max Alexander-Taylor, displaying an extraordinary harmonic range, is more complex than the simple Biblical baddie. He truly believes that he is doing the right and nation-saving thing, as zealots everywhere will.With stage managers watching the sky as beadily as cricket umpires, the second half starts, if weather allows, outside in the Watermill grounds. The advantage is that the Gethsemane sequence takes place in an actual garden, but the inevitable delay in getting the audience back to their seats for the trial and crucifixion means that a show of otherwise exemplary pace briefly stalls.Evita review – Rachel Zegler is phenomenal but Jamie Lloyd’s rock show drowns out the storyRead moreLloyd-Webber still attracts much snideness but recent revivals of his Sunset Boulevard (with Don Black and Christopher Hampton) and now this twice-Rice mini-festival with Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, leave me happy to say that he is a great musical drama composer, tackling unlikely dark material in scores that perfectly serve both the tragic and comic notes of his librettists.At theWatermill theatre, Newbury, until 21 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicalsTheatreAndrew Lloyd WebberWatermill theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

For almost two and a half hours, the soul-funk-pop legend rifles through his back catalogue with the glee of a small child deciding which toy to play with next. At various turns he’s peacemaker – encouraging world leaders to “lead us to a better place” – then 1960s soul man, balladeer, funkmeister and synthesiser soul explorer.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This rare UK visit finds the 75-year-old legend in ageless voice and playful mood. Blind since shortly after birth, he swaps sunglasses and jokes “I can’t see without my glasses”, then leads the crowd into an impromptu burst of You Are My Sunshine by way of intro to You Are the Sunshine of My Life. Given his age and the length of the show, it’s understandable that he takes a break. There is a slight lull as backing vocalists take the spotlight, and later his son Mandla Morris sings I Can Only Be Me.However, in the second half Wonder turns full-on human jukebox, delivering Golden Lady, Living for the City, Sir Duke, Isn’t She Lovely, a riotously joyful I Wish and many more with barely a pause between them. He perhaps mercifully shortens I Just Called to Say I Love You, which signalled his later career excursions into schmaltz. Still, Lately, his 1980 dissection of the pain of a lover’s infidelity, is simply stunning in both rawness and vocal range. With the curfew beckoning, he finally ends with a blistering 10-minute Superstition, yelling “I love you” at the crowd and then as if by magic turning the phrase into a new hook.This show is very much a celebration of roads travelled, but offers a timely reminder of the brilliance, endurance and uniqueness of one of pop’s true greats.AtUtilita Arena, Birmingham, 7 July.Then touringExplore more on these topicsStevie WonderPop and rockSoulreviewsShareReuse this content"

In others it’s walking along the prom. The fashionable ones push gastronomy, drink, street art, culture. Others stick to arcades, funfairs, kids’ stuff. Llandudno delivers all of these and a bit more besides – and it does so unpretentiously, warmly and ever so slightly Welshly.My introduction came in the 1980s, when we – my Lancashire family, or rather, families, as my divorced mum and dad took us separately to Wales – descended from our chalet or static above Abergele and hit Llandudno high street. There, I was bought my first serious football kit – Wales away, yellow with green and red upside down Js. The “shops were better” in Llandudno. They still are, with the main drag, Mostyn Street, boasting chains and independents, Victorian arcades and Clare’s department store – still going after almost a century.Llandudno was always busy, fun, a little bit upmarket. Perhaps an innate confidence has helped it fare better than other north Wales seaside towns. When I went last year, there were coach parties from Manchester and South Yorkshire. Locals – lots of them “expats” from England – were sunning themselves on benches. It was May, but sweltering, and the ice-cream vendors were scooping frantically, the chippies turning out endless trays of cod and chips. At the end of the pier there’s a pub – a great idea – and the alfresco benches were all taken.View image in fullscreenGreat Orme can be reached by a funicular tramway opened in 1902.Photograph: AlamyThe prom along the main beach, known as the North Shore, is a sweeping beauty of wedding-cake terraces, with a wide walking and cycling path running for almost two miles, shelters to use as shades or suntraps, a paddling pool and an Alice in Wonderlandart trail(the real Alice holidayed here).Dylan’s Restaurantis installed inside the former Washington hotel, a stunning corner building by prominent local architect Arthur Hewitt – also responsible for Llandudno’s Winter Gardens and Savoy and Palladium cinemas; the latter survives as a pub.Llandudno is framed by two limestone headlands – the Little Orme and Great Orme – at either end of town. The latter,mined in prehistoric timesfor copper and other ores, has acable-hauled tramwayand Kashmiri goats thatbecame famous in 2020during the pandemic, when they came down to the town centre looking for company, and hedges to eat.

But no one disputes its status as the queen of Welsh resortsWest Shore, below the Great Orme, is backed by dunes and feels a lot more natural. It has lovely sunsets and lively winds, drawing kite-flyers and kite-surfers.Walking around town, which has sloping streets and narrow nooks to get lost in, you often catch sight of the rocky summits of Eryri (Snowdonia). I don’t know any other major resort in the UK that’s so close to serious hillwalking territory.Over the years, Llandudno has been declared the daffodil capital, startup capital and fish and chip capital of north Wales. At the top end of the A470 – the Welsh Route 66, which starts in Cardiff – it is arguably the region’s main urban centre, though Wrexham might have a thing or two to say about that. No one, though, disputes Llandudno’s status as the queen of Welsh resorts.View image in fullscreenLlandudno’s sand dune-lined West Shore.Photograph: John Davidson Photos/AlamyOne evening, during my visit last year, a sea fret descended on Llandudno Bay. I was walking along the prom from the pier towards Craig-y-Don – a sometime suburb long ago subsumed by Llandudno – and the Little Orme. Joggers and scooter riders appeared like wraiths out of the dense murk. The Alice in Wonderland statues looked spooky and out of place. The terraces looked grey and ghostly in the dimness. Suddenly, as I progressed east, the mist beat a complete retreat, warm sunlight pervading like an epiphany. Llandudno looked utterly beautiful, as if reborn, or at least rediscovered.Part of this was no doubt childhood memories flooding back. But it was also a sense of being genuinely taken aback. Llandudno is a major town and a resort, a place to live as well as to holiday, a Welsh location that has always welcomed outsiders, and an urban centre with wild edges. It has endured by maintaining traditions and keeping up. I think it’s special, a little bit magical.Where to stay:St George’sis a well-preserved seafront hotel dating from the Victorian era, with a great restaurant.

I turn left on to the clifftop promenade, the Leas, and the view across the Channel is suddenly expansive. This mile-long stretch is lined with Edwardian and Georgian hotels and modern apartments, in a spectrum that runs from faded to grandeur. Works in progress include another apartment complex and a 1930s toilet block being repurposed into a cafe. I have a drone’s-eye view of the curve of new-build apartments on the beach, but prefer to look across the water, where the stubby silhouette of Dungeness power station appears and disappears with the visibility.To swim, I can head down to Mermaid Beach, with its easy incline into the water. The Zig Zag Path is the way to get there (at least until the funicular Leas Lift is restored in 2026). The convincing grottos of this 1920s path were hewn from Pulhamite: fake rock with genuine charm, which still fools casual visitors.At the Harbour Arm, quirky food and drinks vendors have repurposed train carriages, shipping containers and even the lighthouseWell-heeled Edwardians once paraded on the Leas, and it’s cited as evidence of Folkestone’s glory days that Edward VII frequented the Grand hotel. Our French neighbours once thought Folkestone a prestigious holiday destination, as did many English. Booming summer seasons may have departed with budget flights, but the past two decades have delivered newsworthy regeneration. The logic of theCreative Folkestonefoundation – one of the ways through which philanthropist Roger De Haan has pumped tens of millions of pounds into the local economy – has been to make Folkestone a great place to live and work, on the basis that visitors will follow.The Grand is now private residences, and was crowned in 2014 with a Yoko Ono morse code artwork. There are several subtle contemporary artworks on the Leas, and tens more throughout the town and on its beaches – from an Antony Gormley statue gazing out to sea, to Lubaina Himid’sJelly Mould Pavilionon the boardwalk. These are the legacy of theFolkestone Triennial, Creative Folkestone’s flagship project since 2008. The open-air exhibition, which returns for summer 2025 (19 July-19 October), has helped transform the town’s fortunes, assisted by a game-changing high-speed rail link to London. To live here is to encounter art, gently and often. The one time I lost my children for a significant length of time, they turned out to be investigating a Mark Wallinger piece.View image in fullscreenOne of Antony Gormley’s figures gazes out from Folkestone Pier.Photograph: Sopa Images/GettyIn recent years, visitor numbers have risen, as have (thornier subject) house prices. In part, that’s down to the buzz of theHarbour Arm, where quirky food and drinks vendors have repurposed train carriages, shipping containers and even the lighthouse. I favourSail Box, on the very tip of the arm, for the scale of its sea view and pancake stacks. In town, the subsidisedCreative Quartersees independent businesses spill down theOld High Street– where Steep Street coffee offers a Parisian-inspired books-and-cakes combo – to the artists’ studios on Tontine Street.Folkestone has so many things it didn’t have 10 years ago: the world’s first multistorey skatepark; a New York Highline-inspired garden walkway, leading to the revitalised Harbour Arm; an annualPride, and LGBTQ+ bookshop; mini golf on the beach. A Labour MP. And, as of spring 2025, a Reform-led council. So, we’ve still got range.One of my favourite things is not new, it’s simply to linger on the beach whenever seals or porpoises are in the water. One Sunday, a pod of dolphins splashed about for 30 minutes in view of where I sat with friends and kids, beach-bar drinks in hand. It’s really hard to beat Folkestone on a hot day, with dolphins.Where to stay:overlooking the harbour a short walk from town, theLondonand ParisHotelhas 11 pretty rooms, doubles from £175, room onlySophy GrimshawScarborough, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenScarborough is in line for £20m from the government to fund regeneration.Photograph: curved-light/AlamyScarborough residents refer to visitors as “comforts”, because they have usually “Come for t’ day”, rather than the week, as was once the seaside norm. The negative shift helps explain why Scarborough will receive £20m from the government’s Plan for Neighbourhoods, to fund significant regeneration over the next decade.The plan is designed for “left-behind” communities. If Scarborough is left behind, it is also majestic, what with the great sweep of the two bays, divided by the verdant castle headland. Most of its main attractions – which tend to be commensurately large-scale – are unaffected by the current regeneration, since the town has been quietly maintaining them for decades, even centuries.View image in fullscreenScarborough’s spa is among its oldest attractions.Photograph: Martin Williams/AlamyTake the place where it all began, not only Scarborough tourism but seaside holidays in general.Scarborough Spastands adjacent to a spring, whose salty waters oozing from the base of a cliff were promoted as therapeutic in the early 17th century. The gentry came to drink them, along with other things. “Health is the pretence, dissipation is the end,” wrote one 18th-century visitor, and the spa was the focus of the jollity. A storm destroyed the first spa in 1836. Its replacement burned down in 1876, the present baroque palace arising three years later. Whereas the spa was once associated with dinner-jacketed palm court orchestras, a more characteristic modern bill-topper would be Tony Skingle (who “IS” Elvis). But the vision is consistent: a night out is improved by the proximity of the sea.Similar doggedness is evident in the history of the nearby South Cliff Lift, opened in 1875. Back then, the power was hydraulic. Today, the system is fully automatic, but the cars are still made of wood, one descending as the other ascends, like floating garden sheds.If Scarborough is left behind, it is also majestic with the great sweep of the two baysThey carry passengers up through the near-verticalSouth Cliff Gardens, recently refurbished and underpinned. Subdivisions include the genteel Rose Garden, which was created in 1883 and has been carefully tended ever since (it’s not easy to grow roses by the sea), including a major restoration in 2015.On the North Bay,Peasholm Parkwas opened in 1912, with an oriental theme, which (this being Scarborough) meant an Oriental Garden surmounted by a pagoda and surrounded by a fairy-lit boating lake. Such playfulness did not suit the brash 1970s, and the park went to seed, but a programme of renewal brought a Grade II listing in 1999. The narrow-gaugeNorth Bay Railwayalso runs through gardens, and has done since 1931, skirting theOpen Air Theatre, which closed in 1986 but was triumphantly relaunched in 2010.View image in fullscreenPeasholm Park has an oriental theme.Photograph: Paul Heaton/AlamyNow, let us return to the South Bay and the harbour, where the white lighthouse has stood like a cake decoration since 1806. Well, more or less. The original was destroyed by the German bombardment of 1914, its replacement erected in 1931. The harbour is attractively gritty: at low water, the pleasure boats are slumped in the mud. The kids with their crab lines seem to be emulating the adult fishers, who operate around the Victorian buildings of the West Pier.The current regenerationdoesinclude the West Pier, where a hoarding announces plans for a multimillion-pound refurbishment, “improving amenities for local people and visitors”. But when you ask the local people about this, you encounter eye rolls and dark muttering. Their suspicion is that the pier will become too touristy at the expense of the fishing, and the plans are on hold for consultations. Scarborough has generally polished – rather than recut – the jewels in its crown, so I trust the harbour will not betoodrastically “improved”.Where to stay: WestonHotel on Esplanade, Scarborough’s poshest street, has doubles from £100,room onlyAndrew MartinTo theSea By Trainby Andrew Martinis published by Profile Books on31 July (£18.99).To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The coastal suburb of Edinburgh is only a 30-minute bus ride from the city centre, but “Porty” has its own identity, distinct from the capital.“I loved growing up here,” says Michael Pedersen, Edinburgh’s makar (poet laureate). “I loved the sea. I loved the arcade. I loved Arthur’s Seat looming in the background like a behemoth bull seal about to enter a brawl. But it didn’t feel like you were in a trendy, chic epicentre of a place. It felt like you were on the outskirts, trying to claw your way back in.”It is not nostalgia that draws people to ‘Porty’ today. It is the rebellious flair of the community and what they’ve createdThe neon storm ofNobles– a battlement-themed penny arcade on the promenade – offers a portal to Porty’s past. Portobello was incorporated into Edinburgh in 1896, when it was one of Scotland’s most popular seaside resorts. Cheap tram and train access brought the masses in from Edinburgh and Glasgow, and an open-air pool and pleasure pier awaited them. Both of those attractions are long gone – the rise of package holidays ending the boom – but the Victorian swimming baths (and Edinburgh’s only Turkish baths) remain, council-run. As I backstroke under bunting strung across the pool, the sun shines through the glass roof, illuminating the columns and gallery.It is not nostalgia that draws people to Porty today, though. It is – as well as veggie eateries such asGo Go Beetsand speciality coffee spotTanifiki– the rebellious flair of the community and what they’ve created. In 2017, for example, a Georgian church in town was due to be sold off. Luxury flats beckoned, but local campaign groupAction Portyintervened and led a rare urban community buyout. It’s nowBellfield– home to a community cafe, art classes and ceilidhs.“When we moved here in the 1990s, Portobello was very down-at-heel,” says Justin Kenrick, chair of Action Porty, as we stroll the promenade. “Newspapers called it dangerous. What we’re trying to fight off now is the place turning into one big holiday let. If there’s no community, there’s no point.”Thetown hallwas also saved by the community.

Pedersen packed out the bookshop in May to launch his debut novelMuckle Flugga, glimmers of which were inspired by his home town.Pedersen has seen the Portobello skyline demolished and rebuilt since his childhood. “It’s so important, as independent businesses get successful and the area becomes more affluent, to invest in community groups,” the poet says. “The fact that there are these buildings coming back into community leases and hands retains a lot of the integrity of the area.“I love Portobello in all its foibles and flaws; all its chintzy glamour; all its new-wave chicness.”Walk along the promenade, looking across the Firth of Forth to Fife, and it’s easy to see why.Where to stay:StravenGuesthouseis a traditional, family-run place close to the promenade, doubles from £107, B&B (minimum two nights)Stuart KennyExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysBeach holidaysFamily holidaysShort breaksDay tripsWales holidaysScotland holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how …Felicity CloakeSun 6 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTSharePublic service announcement: baba ganoush does not require smoked paprika, acidity regulators or indeed any kind of preservative beyond lemon juice. There are some dips I will happily buy – tzatziki, taramasalata, evenhummus,with due caution– but tubs of this smoky Middle Eastern aubergine dish always seem to be slimy and underpowered in comparison with the real freshly made deal.Prep15 minDrain30 minCook40 minServes2-42 large aubergines(about 650g)2 tbsp tahiniJuice of 1 lemon, plus a little extra to finish2 garlic cloves, peeled1 small bunch mint, or flat-leaf parsley, leaves pickedSalt, to taste1 tbsp pomegranate seeds(optional)2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 Griddle, barbecue, grill or roast?The key here is to blacken the aubergines over a high heat until the skin chars and the flesh roasts. The easiest and best way to do this is on a barbecue, but if you have a gas hob, you can also do it on there. Alternatively, use an overhead grill or hot oven, but doing so means you’ll miss out on some of that gorgeously smoky flavour.View image in fullscreen2 Prick and grill …Whichever approach you choose, prick the aubergines all over with a fork, so steam can escape while they’re charring. If using a barbecue, put them on a lightly greased grill over a high heat and keep an eye on them, turning until the skin is papery and burnt, and the flesh has collapsed. Do the same if using an overhead grill.3 … or cook on the hobIf you’re using a gas hob, put the aubergines directly on the flame, turning as required. If the aubergines are very wide, you can finish cooking them through in a hot oven – 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 – or bake them from scratch at the same temperature for about 40 minutes. If you have a blowtorch, it’s an idea to scorch them first.View image in fullscreen4 Remove the fleshSlit open the aubergines lengthways, then scoop out the long strands of soft flesh from the inside; discard the skins. Put the flesh in a sieve and, ideally, leave it to drain over the sink or a bowl for about 30 minutes, because that will give you a chunkier, more full-flavoured result. Alternatively, squeeze the flesh over the sieve to get rid of excess water.5 Now mix the flavouringsView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, put the tahini in a medium bowl (if it’s separated in the jar, which is absolutely normal, give it a good stir to reincorporate the oil first) and stir in the lemon juice; the mix will seize when you first add it, but keep stirring and it will soon loosen up.6 Add the garlic and herbsView image in fullscreenPuree the garlic (with a crusher, mortar or heavy knife) and add to the tahini mix. Strip the mint leaves from the stems (or trim the coarser stalks from flat-leaf parsley), then roughly chop until you have about three tablespoons’ worth. Stir two-thirds of the herbs into the tahini mixture, and save the rest as garnish.7 Mix in the aubergine fleshView image in fullscreenMash the drained aubergine strands gently with a fork, just to break up the long strands and make it easier to scoop up and eat without the need for a knife. Season with a little salt, then stir into the tahini mixture. Taste and adjust for salt or lemon juice, if it needs it.8 Plate and garnishView image in fullscreenTransfer to a serving bowl, if necessary, then top with the remaining herbs and a scattering of pomegranate seeds (though definitely not required, they do look very pretty. Alternatively, add a little grated lemon zest or some chilli flakes for a dash of extra colour – up to you).9 Dress with oil and servePour a moat of oil around the edge of the baba ganoush, then serve with warm flatbreads and other assorted meze, or with grilled meat. If you’re not eating it immediately, cover and keep at room temperature for a few hours, or in the fridge (minus the garnish, which should be added fresh) for up to three days. Bring back to room temperature before serving.Explore more on these topicsStarterFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodVegetablesSide dishesMiddle Eastern food and drinkBarbecuefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take thecave à mangerMarjorie’s in Soho, a brand new, Parisian-inspired wine bar serving small plates in London W1. “Oh God,” I said on learning that its proprietors are Michael Searle and Josh Anderson. “Never heard of ’em.” Sorry to quibble, especially seeing as this seems to be their first hospitality venture, and I am well aware that eating out for a living is a huge jolly, but eating in wine bars? Well, I amnota fan: too noisy, too boisterous, too give-me-my-bloody-dinner generally – not to mention too many drunken elbows in yourtoastie de fromagewhile a sommelier bores on about beaujolais nouveau. Also, Marjorie’s is alarmingly close to Carnaby Street, the natural habitat of the disappointed diner.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So I set off down Foubert’s Place, muttering to myself that at least I’m not heading for the nearbyKingly Court food hubthat brims with dining options, each of them more impersonal and oversubscribed than the next. Back in the noughties, Carnaby Street still gave a slight nod to its Swinging Sixties roots, with a few remaining independent shops selling goth gear, pantaloons and bongs. Today, however, it is a shiny row of sleek international flagship stores, with the wondrous, olde worldeLibertyat one end, clinging on for dear life, the poor love, before she is inevitably turned into aLululemon.View image in fullscreen‘Outstanding’: Marjorie’s brie de Meaux with beans and apricots.Anyway, it turns out that it is for all these reasons that we should actually be grateful for Marjorie’s, because, yet again and with no fear of this letting up any time soon, it also turns out that I am an absolute idiot. Marjorie’s may look like a wine bar, but Searle and Anderson have opened something tiny, brave, bespoke and appealingly odd. Oh, and delicious, too, because the duo have temptedGiacomo Peretti, formerly ofLe Gavroche, to cook for them. He has also worked at the crowdpleaserTemper, the wholly underratedFirebirdand the dependably brilliantthe Culpeper, and if you head down to the basement, where there are more tables, you’ll be able to watch him weave his magic.Snaring Peretti to do wine bar snacks and letting his imagination fly is a stroke of genius, because now you have a brilliant chef serving gooey chicken liver “rocher” – think rich, nutty, nibblable savoury Ferrero Rocher – pretty little yummy crab tartelettes made all the merrier by the addition of kumquat and a delicate and rather bizarre lamb tartare dotted with spring vegetables, goat’s cheese and a tiny fresh strawberry. Surprise! This is actually, and quite unexpectedly, a restaurant with serious food; in fact, it might well be the most earnest, accomplished, imaginative food being served in this square mile right now.View image in fullscreen‘Well worth the risk’: Marjorie’s bavette with an egg yolk emulsion is just one of several unexpected larger plates.Yes, you could play safe, grab a space at the long bar upstairs, order from the exclusively French wine list and feast only on a selection ofLa Fromageriecheese and rusticpainserved with a shedload of salted French butter, perhaps with some saucisson with cornichons on the side. But don’t do that: Peretti’s larger and admittedly stranger-sounding dishes are well worth the risk. There’s a bowl of escargots with seaweed in a silky pinewood cream and a soft, delicate salad of good, mixed green leaves with a sweet, citrussy, orange blossom vinaigrette. Original, perhaps offputting to some, but truly, madly good.Two other standouts were a stinky, slightly warm piece of runny brie de Meaux served with lush fresh apricot – outstanding – and some proper French soul food: poached chicken on white rice made decadent with brown butter. This was a rhapsody of classy, beige carbs, and I scraped at the bowl like a sad labrador released from her kibble diet. Slices of tempura courgette, almost like cigars to look at, came dotted with trout roe androuille, and were equally weird and wonderful.The dessert list offered amillefeuillewithcrème diplomateand strawberries, but my eyes had already been greedily drawn to a warm, frothy, olive oil-strewn bowl of fresh chocolate mousse topped with crunchy hazelnuts. Again, this was just heavenly.View image in fullscreen‘Just heavenly’: Marjorie’s hot chocolate mousse topped with hazelnuts and olive oil.As a non-drinker, I spend little time in wine bars these days – after all, as the old saying goes: “If you stay in the barber’s long enough, you’ll probably end up with a haircut” – but for Marjorie’s I’m making an exception. Service is prompt, the menu intriguing and there’s a sense that you’re in on a secret that no one else knows about. Go for the vin, the gossip, a bowl of nocellara olives and some great baguette; stay for a dinner that’s currently one of the best in London. It’s really worth going to Carnaby Street for.Courage,mes braves!Marjorie’s26 Foubert’s Place, London W1; marjorieslondon.co.uk/ (no phone). Open all week, noon-11.30pm (Fri & Sat midnight, Sun 10pm.
