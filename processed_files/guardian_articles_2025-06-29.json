Aged 19, already the author of an 18m selling debut album, but something of an unknown quantity in festival terms, she turned out to be rather more feral and off-message than you might have expected a former Disney Channel star turned teen-popper to be. At one juncture, she named each individual judge responsible for overturning Roe v Wade that weekend, shouting “We hate you! We hate you!” then performing Lily Allen’s Fuck You in duet with its author.Three years on, with another huge-selling album in the bag, and lifted to the status of headliner, nothing quite so likely to stir up controversy on Fox News happens. But the singer is still capable of springing surprises, when she announces the arrival of a special guest – “perhaps the best songwriter to come out of England … a Glastonbury legend and a personal hero of mine”, you somehow automatically expect Ed Sheeran to appear from the wings, acoustic guitar in hand. But this does Rodrigo something of a disservice. It turns out to be Robert Smith, who duets with her on versions of Friday I’m In Love and Just Like Heaven.View image in fullscreenSpringing surprises … Olivia Rodrigo.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianSecuring the presence of the Cure’s frontman is, as young people are wont to say, a massive flex. For one thing, as the sharp WTF? intake of breath that greets his appearance indicates, it’s the one “secret” appearance of the entire festival that genuinely seems to have been kept a secret. It’s also a smart way of drawing in a crowd substantially more varied than you suspect ordinarily attends Rodrigo’s gigs: she made her name with songs that sounded like teenage diary entries set to music that balanced piano balladry with zippy pop-punk.But in truth, Rodrigo doesn’t really need an alt-rock legend to win over the crowd – it’s already happened before Smith arrives. Clad in a pair of 18-hole Doc Martens, she’s a really engaging performer, cravenly playing up to the crowd by hymning Britain’s pubs – “where no one judges you for having a pint at lunchtime” – and M&S confectionery legend Colin the Caterpillar, changing into a pair of union jack hot pants midway through the set, and demanding her fans “think about something or someone that really fucking pisses you off” and scream mid-song.View image in fullscreenSurprisingly gnarly … Olivia Rodrigo and band.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianTheoretically her sound exists at two distinct polarities that shouldn’t really mesh together – the soft rock adjacent ballads and the pop-punk, the latter sounding noticeably heftier live than on record, the guitar solos surprisingly gnarly. But they’re united both by the fact that the songs are uniformly well-written – Get Him Back! has a timelessly snotty chorus that glam titans Chinn and Chapman would have been proud to give Suzi Quatro; All-American Bitch is sharp and funny; Vampire’s swell from downcast introspection to bile-spitting theatricality is brilliantly done – and that their tone is invariably lovelorn and accusatory. If the noisier tracks are more immediate live, giving her backing band more chance to demonstrate their potency, the set is perfectly balanced. Even if you don’t count yourself among the Rodrigo stans lined up against the front barrier – the big screens show them both passionately screaming along and looking faintly baffled when Robert Smith’s moment in the spotlight arrives – it never lags.It also feels like more of an event than any other big set this year: as it ends with fireworks, you get the distinct feeling that, at 22, a teen pop star might have unexpectedly, but deservedly, stolen the show.Explore more on these topicsOlivia RodrigoGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025Pop and rockFestivalsMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

On 20 June, two activists spray-painted two RAF Voyager aircraft at Brize Norton, where flights regularly leave for RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. No person inside the compound was harmed.At worst, these actions may amount to offences around criminal damage and trespass. The former justice secretary Lord Falconer has stated that the action at Brize Norton would not justify outlawing the group.But that is exactly what is happening. The home secretary’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action and to lay an order so swiftly in parliament on Monday will be viewed as a dangerous acceleration to authoritarianism. This means the full weight of the British anti-terrorism state apparatus, including its coercive elements, will be deployed against Palestine Action’s leaders and potentially thousands of young British supporters, with devastating consequences for their futures.The actions used by Palestine Action are not new. They follow a tradition of protest that has been instrumental to civil rights movements throughout history. Indeed, these actions have shaped modern Britain and enriched democratic participation globally.As a veteran anti-racist civil rights campaigner, for nearly five decades, I continue to support scores of families seeking justice. These have included the families of Blair Peach, Stephen Lawrence, Zahid Mubarek and Victoria Climbié, who were not only traumatised by the way their loved ones were killed but faced a litany of institutional failures.During every campaign, we faced politicians who ignored or played down our lived experiences blighted by violent and state racism. They also chose to ignore the more subdued and normalised forms of protest that we organised. We were compelled to find creative ways to get the urgency of their message across.We shouldn’t forget the real purpose of the action at Brize Norton – it was to draw attention to Britishmilitary collaborationwith the Israeli government, including itsspy flights over Gaza. This is during a war that has led to an unprecedented level of mass killings of Palestinian civilians, near-complete destruction of Gaza’s infrastructure, including hospitals, and adeliberate policy of starvation, all leading to official accusations of genocide and action on crimes against humanity. British complicity in Israel’s war is a matter of public interest that is too often either ignored or under-reported.Palestine Action is a network of activists that organises peaceful direct-action tactics to expose and target property and premises connected to Israel’s actions in Palestine. Since its inception, more than five years ago, it has primarily disrupted the operations of Elbit Systems. Elbit is Israel’s largest arms company. The group claims that its campaign has successfully secured theclosure of several Elbit factories.What Palestine Action understands – and this is borne out by my own experience – is that to bring about change in Britain there is an almost inexhaustible need to press the issue and raise attention.In the Stephen Lawrence case, the family campaigners had to devise extraordinary steps that included an unprecedented private criminal prosecution coupled with protests before the state acknowledged and the public realised the significance of failures in this case. Even then it did not guarantee justice for the family. The actions deployed were peaceful but all of us – the parents, their barrister and I – suffered the indignity of being spied upon by undercover officers who were tasked to sabotage the campaign I coordinated. The deployment of undercover officers in protest groups is now the subject of theundercover policing inquiry.The home secretary will be aware that protest actions have been organised for decades targeting military bases and aircraft. For instance, from 1981 to 2000, activists disrupted RAF Greenham Common – locking on to the gates, breaking into the grounds and climbing on top of missile silos.In 2003, five protesters known as the the Fairford Five were arrested and charged for disrupting military operations at RAF Fairford. One of the defendants, Josh Richards, wasrepresented by Keir Starmer. Starmer argued that while the actions broke the law, they were justified as the protesters were trying to stop the planes from committing war crimes. Richards was acquitted because the jury failed to reach a verdict.The smear campaign against Palestine Action has already begun. It is accused of beingfunded by Iranor the mouthpiece of Hamas. These accusations are meant to malign a group that is made of ordinary citizens – teachers, nurses, students and workers. I have met many of them.The drastic move to outlaw Palestine Action would set a dangerous precedent where all civil disobedience actions could be classified as terrorism. Its real crime is being fearless and audacious in exposing the British government’s complicity with the Israeli government at a time when it is being pursued by the international court of justice for genocide, and its leaders have had arrest warrants issued against them for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Above all, the move by the home secretary reflects the diminishing of a mature democracy. As a society, we cherish solidarity actions that make a real difference to defenceless people. Will parliament stand up to the home secretary and reject her proposal? History tells them to do so.Suresh Grover is founder of the Southall Monitoring Group and has led campaigns to help the families of Stephen Lawrence, Zahid Mubarek and Victoria ClimbiéDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But in reality, many of them have been spurred to activism in support of sexual progressivism.Illustration: Xiao Mei/The GuardianThe journalist perched on a stool in a corner of the bedroom, pen in hand, ready to jot down the most intimate details of our sex lives.Her name was Peggy Orenstein, and she was writing a book about girls and sex. As a 20-year-old college sophomore, I apparently still qualified as a girl, and I was having sex. So, one night in late 2013, I agreed to let Orenstein hang out at my sorority house.We swanned about the tiny bedroom, dodging piles of clothes and admiring one another’s earrings in the mirror, while Orenstein quizzed us on boys and parties and relationships. She listened attentively as we detailed the precise alchemy of a “going-out outfit”. (You could wear a tight skirt to show off your legs or a tight shirt to show off your boobs, but never both. The goal was to look available, not like a sure bet.) I could feel her eyes taking in all the pink in the room: the hot pink carpeting, the pale pink walls.As we continued to answer her questions, I could sense her slow deflation. We weren’t having sex often enough, with enough boys. Frankly, we weren’t slutty enough. (There’s no such thing as a slut, but I was years away from realizing that.) After Orenstein left, I couldn’t shake my suspicion that we had been drawn into playing a rigged game. While it was clear that Orenstein did not want to claim that young women were immoral for sleeping around, I felt like she had wanted to frame my sorority sisters and me as victims of “hookup culture”, the 2000s moral panic that posited that millennials were having sex so casual that it bordered on indifferent.Like practically every other adult we encountered, she wanted to prove that we were doing sex wrong.Many [gen Z] have understood that sex, its consequences, and control over both are political weaponsI came of age in the 2000s and early 2010s: a time when journalists, politicians and other miscellaneous moralists were consumed by the idea that by losing our virginities so unceremoniously, young people were losing themselves. Shows such as Gossip Girl and Skins showed teenagers having sex so gymnastic they threw each other into walls, and books with titles like The End of Sex: How Hookup Culture Is Leaving a Generation Unhappy, Sexually Unfulfilled, and Confused About Intimacy filled bookshelves. The New York Times ran numerous articles bemoaning how hookup culture was turning orgasms into an endangered species.A lot of the discourse about hookup culture, however, conveniently skirted statistics that revealed many young millennials weren’t having that much sex. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asked more than 15,000 high school students whether they had ever had sexual intercourse. More than half the millennial respondents had not. A sizable chunk of millennials did not have sex in college either. One 2012 study discovered that a fifth of female college seniors reported still being virgins, while even a New York magazine story that called campuses “great drunken bacchanals” found that, in its poll of more than 700 college students, almost 40% were virgins. A separate survey even found that only about a third of college students said they’d had intercourse during a so-called hookup.Millennials were in fact having sex later and less than past generations, including the generation behind the screeds about how hookup culture was killing intimacy.Now, us millennials wandering into our 30s and 40s are doing exactly what media outlets thought we would never do: getting married and having babies. Yet the American urge to tell a story about how young people have sex – and especially how they’re doing it wrong – hasn’t disappeared. It’s just been transplanted on to those mysterious creatures known as gen Z.Today, we tell a different story about gen Z and sex: rather than having too much impersonal sex, they are not having sex at all. It’s called the “sex recession”.I’ve spent the last several years traveling the country and interviewing more than 100 teenagers and twentysomethings about their sex lives. It is true that they are having even less sex less than millennials, but they are not uninterested in sex. Instead, many have understood, from an early age, something that eluded past generations: that sex, its consequences, and control over both are political weapons. They’ve experienced this firsthand, as sexual conservatives have pushed for policies that leave them scared of sex: thanks to the 2022 overturning ofRoe v Wade, for example, 16% of single gen Z adults are more afraid to date. Yet at the same time, gen Z is also actively resisting older definitions of sex and rejecting traditional gendered expectations.Even though many haven’t actually gotten laid, gen Z might be the most sexually progressive generation in history.View image in fullscreenThe so-called sex recessionWhen I started college, in 2012, I felt like a virginal freak. Rather than warn me off of sex, the pearl-clutching over hookup culture had left me desperate to have it.Yet had I come of age in the late 2010s and 2020s, I would have fit right in. In 2021, only 30% of gen Z respondents told the CDC they’d had sexual intercourse – a 17% drop from when I was in high school. In a 2022 survey conducted in part by the Kinsey Institute, one in four gen Z adults also said they had never experienced partnered sex. Stunningly, even masturbation is somehowon the declineamong adolescents.Young people are fighting over many of the same rights that progressives and conservatives warred over in the 1960s and 70s“Why Are Young People Having So Little Sex?” a headline in the Atlantic wailed in 2018. After the pandemic, a New York Times opinion essay linked young Americans’ poor mental health and stunning levels of loneliness to their lack of sex. “Have More Sex, Please!” the headline pleaded.It’s not just that gen Z is believed to be sexless – they are also allegedly opposed to sex. According to the internet, gen Z is full of “puriteens”, which Urban Dictionary defines as an “(almost always) young person on the internet who thinks that the internet has to conform to being entirely SFW”, or safe for work. These puriteens and their supposed concerns – age gaps between partners, displays of kink at Pride parades, irredeemably tilted power dynamics in relationships that might have been once perceived as equal – typically hail not from the political right, where reservations about sexual exploration may seem more naturally at home, but from the left. News story after news story has worried over gen Z’s apparent turn away from “sex-positive” feminism and toward “sex negativity”.Gen Z is so terminally online, so addicted to pathologizing normality through therapy-speak, and speeding so far to political extremes that they’ve lost their ability to navigate the nuances of human relationships. Further addled by the isolation of the pandemic, they’ve thrown their hands up and escaped back into their bedrooms-cum-bunkers alone, their faces aglow with blue light.Or so the lore goes, anyway.In reality, not only are young Americans still horny, but many gen Zers have been spurred to extraordinary activism in support of sexual progressivism.For much of the last quarter century, most Americans ignored the erosion of sexual and reproductive freedoms, thanks in no small part to a queasiness about the very existence of sex, especially among the young. Now, young people are fighting over many of the very same rights that progressives and conservatives warred over in the 1960s and 70s – and some new ones, too, as gen Z is the most diverse generation yet in terms of race, ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation.More than 60% of 18- to 29-year-olds lean left, and around a quarter of gen Z identify as LGBTQ+ (depending on whom you ask and how you ask the question). They are also increasingly secular. Gen Z women might just be the most progressive cohort ever documented in US history; since 2008, they have veered hard to the left on issues such as the environment, gun control and abortion. Meanwhile, 56% of young male voters backed accused sexual predator Donald Trump in the 2024 election. But while they may be voting Republican for reasons that have bothmystified and alarmed experts, since 2008 young men have become more liberal, not less, on almost every issue, including abortion and same-sex marriage.‘No man will touch me until I have my rights back’: why is the 4B movement going viral after Trump’s win?Read moreGen Z grew up watching and attending the kind of mass protests that break out only once in a lifetime, such as the Women’s March of 2017 and the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, and as citizens of the borderless community of the internet, with its endless depictions of sex. They have an unparalleled ability to infuse that sex with political meaning. Compared to other generations, gen Z adults are more likely to have attended a rally, volunteered or posted online about a social issue that mattered to them. When Trump defeated Harris, left-leaning young people immediately converted their political fury into personal action – namely, by proposing a sex strike in the vein of thefeminist South Korean 4B movement. “GIRLS IT’S TIME TO BOYCOTT ALL MEN!” one TikTok creator wrote in a video with 4m views. “YOU LOST YOUR RIGHTS, AND THEY LOST THE RIGHT TO HIT RAW!”For many members of gen Z, it’s not enough to expand access to things like sex education, birth control and sexual assault resources. They also seek to dismantle and reimagine traditional concepts of sex and desire so that they no longer feel so entrenched or suffocating.As gen Z revolutionizes sex, they are revolutionizing society’s longstanding expectations of gender, too. By the light of these expectations, women should be the gatekeepers of sex, forever pushing off men, who are unfailingly horny; any fallout from sex is the woman’s fault; she should bear the trauma, stigma, pregnancy, childrearing or any of the other countless consequences that sex has had through the millennia. (Forget about folks outside of the gender binary.) Casting off these expectations is, I’ve found, a key part of young people’s sexual progressivism.View image in fullscreenWhat is sex, anyway?Sexually progressive young people tend to take a more inclusive view of sex. Take, for example, losing your virginity, which is traditionally defined as having penis-in-vagina sex for the first time.Although my gen Z interviewees usually said they had once believed in that definition, many also said their views evolved as they got older. Frequently, their realization of their own queerness or their interactions with LGBTQ+ peers had led them to reassess how they saw sex.“Definitely having sex, like penetrative sex with a man – that was [the definition of] virginity [loss] to me. And so I graduated high school thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m a virgin in college. This is the worst thing ever,’” recalled Molly, a 21-year-old Texan. But as she surrounded herself with more people who identified as LGBTQ+, she stopped fixating on it so much and eventually came out as queer. She hasn’t had intercourse with a man – she’s no longer sure she’s even attracted to them – but she has had sex with a woman, “depending on the definition”.Molly also began to reframe her sexual experiences from high school. “I wasn’t having penetrative sex with my boyfriend in high school, but we were having oral sex,” she said. “That also was sex.”It was the LGBTQ+ interviewees who, rather than overly fixating on virginity, most often felt at peace with their sexual status, regardless of whether they had had it, were having it, or none of the above. “It’s a weird social concept that’s very tied to purity culture,” Clare, a queer 19-year-old from Montana, said of virginity. “I always felt a little weird in high school because I’d never been in a relationship. It felt like a thing I needed to do.”She still has not had sex. But now that Clare is in college, she’s realized, “no one actually cares that much. And if it’s something I want to do for me, then sure. But it’s not like a box you need to check off on the ‘normal teenager checklist’.”It is the right that benefits most from crafting a narrative that the young are all hapless virginsIn 2014, in one of the first studies to examine LGBTQ+ people’s thoughts on virginity loss, people were split: many thought penetration was key, but others believed virginity loss could be a multistep event. Maybe you lose your virginity through heterosexual sex, before losing it again through homosexual sex. Or maybe you lose it a little more each time you experiment with a new sex act.Generally, though, there was a sense that virginity didn’t matter all that much, that it was a heterosexual concept shoved down LGBTQ+ people’s throats. Having sex for the “first time”, knowing what to do with someone else’s body – that mattered. But, researchers noted, participants didn’t use the term “virginity” unless prompted. It was just not part of their vocabulary.I admire that focus on sexual exploration rather than achievement.All this raises a more fundamental question: whatissex? In my interviews, people agreed that you can’t masturbate your way out of being a virgin; there had to be another person (or persons) present. But they often struggled to come up with an answer when I asked them to define what sex looks like to them now. Even straight people, other forms of sex have begun to count more frequently. Most college students believe anal intercourse constitutes losing your virginity, despite a longstanding belief that anal can be a way to get laid while staying a virgin. A majority of young people say oral sex counts, too.“It’s like a vibe,” said Jessie, a queer, non-binary 19-year-old from New Jersey, their voice shivering with innuendo. “I’m using so many words to try to describe this, because as I’m saying it to you, I’m also trying to process it in my head. What does it actually mean? I don’t know!”My favorite definition of sex came from Clare. “What, to you, would count as sex?” I asked.Clare thought about it. “If there’s pants on the floor,” she said. She paused. “Intentionally.”The intention makes the difference. It’s sex because I say it is. Sex is always whatever we say it is. As individuals, having sex or not having sex doesn’t need to matter all that much if we say it doesn’t.However, politicians and pundits are deeply invested in crafting narratives around how young people have sex – and, in the case of gen Z, it is the right that benefits most from crafting a narrative that the young are all hapless virgins.View image in fullscreenThe conservatives in our bedroomsAs young Americans navigate unprecedented access to sex thanks to the internet, they are simultaneously and increasingly at the mercy of activists, politicians and institutions that have razed comprehensive sex ed, pornography, information about LGBTQ+ identities and tools to combat sexual assault. Sexual conservatism aims to make it difficult and dangerous to have any kind of sex that is not heterosexual, married and – as it seeks to limit access to abortion and birth control – potentially procreative. It also tries to enforce specific ideas about gender, about what makes a man and what makes a woman. It wants to turn the US back to a pre-internet age – to, say, the 1950s, before the sexual revolution and second-wave feminism of the 1960s and 70s: a time when a (white) man was expected to have a (white) wife, two and a half (white) kids, and a suburban home on a single salary.The triumphs of sexual conservatism will affect us all, regardless of ageAmid pronatalist fears over the falling US birth rate (especially among white women), the sex recession enables sexual conservatives to portray sexual progressivism as an existential threat, as they argue that it has led to a breakdown in gender roles, preventing men and women from pursuing relationships and, more importantly, families. “Our people aren’t having enough children to replace themselves. That should bother us,” JD Vance once told a conservative conference.Sexual conservatism is not anti-sex. (White evangelical churches that oppose premarital sex have, for example, long urged their married members to go crazy in the bedroom.) Instead, it uses sex as a cudgel to force Americans into a way of life where some types of people have more power – but everybody has fewer choices. And, over the past 25 years, this movement has steadily amassed power to the point that it has dramatically restricted young Americans’ sex lives. Roe v Wade provided a sneak peek into how this movement can reshape sex: 13% of gen Z and 11% of millennials have said its fall has led them to have less sex. It was just the beginning.This is not just a matter of being able to bang people without fear of consequences. Making young people afraid of sex, afraid of having the wrong kind of sex, afraid of even being perceived to be interested in one another – all of that robs them of their ability to pursue pleasure, self-knowledge and connection. It places relationships of every kind under a microscope and turns them into a potential avenue for persecution. It undermines their right to their own bodies, at a time when individuals are just discovering what their bodies can do. It denies them a full life.Sexual assault allegations seem to be a badge of honor in Trump’s America. Was #MeToo an epic failure?Read moreSince that night in my sorority house, almost everything about how young Americans have sex has changed. We are post-#MeToo, post-pandemic and post-Roe. Kink has gone mainstream. And I have come to understand that the battle between sexual conservatism and progressivism is the defining feature of young Americans’ sex lives. This battle is intragenerational – as straight and cisgender young men appear to be diverging sharply from their female and LGBTQ+ peers – and intergenerational. The triumphs of sexual conservatism will affect us all, regardless of age.In short, we’re living through nothing less than the second coming of the sexual revolution.

Despite the blazing heat, the crowd is packed to the highest point of the hill to catch Stewart roll through his hits – and perhaps elaborate on his comments to The Times earlier this weekend, that Britain should give Nigel Farage a chance. (Given reasoning: Stewart’s met his brother, and quite likes him!)Now 80 years old, Stewart is nonetheless instantly recognisable as Himself with his thatch of bottle-blond hair, deep tan and lounge-lizard styling. The fit today is a black brocade jacket with exaggerated lapels and gold threading, and flared jeans with naughty stars on his buttocks. The message is that Stewart’s still got it, and his diehard fans – readily identifiable and peppered within the vast crowd – are primed to lap it up.Perhaps naively, not being an active member of the Hot Rod community myself, I’m struck by their enthusiasm: I see several people wearing wigs in loving homage (again, despite the heat) and I’m told that some especially passionate fans have been queuing at the front barricades since the Libertines’ set earlier this afternoon.Stewart had earlier bemoaned the slot being known informally as the “tea-time slot”, saying it “sounds like pipe and slippers”. But his opening number, Tonight I’m Yours (Don’t Hurt Me), doesn’t grab the crowd in the same way as one of his hits – maybe he wants to ease into it.View image in fullscreenLulu performs with Rod Stewart on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty Images“Music brings us together, we need music, we’re having a party!” declares Stewart, before launching into Having a Party – again, hardly one of the hits. But he’s in good voice, especially given he cancelled gigs earlier this month. It helps that he’s never had a clear or stereotypically youthful voice to begin with; the years show, mostly, in his struggle to sustain long notes. But though a physical performer, writhing and launching around like one of the leggier Muppets, he entrusts responsibility for providing an on-stage spectacle to his bevvy of lovely ladies wearing short sequinned dresses, also supporting him with backing vocals, frequently fiddle and the occasional Riverdance action.Of course this broad-base, Benny Hill sex appeal is also what Stewart is known for, and what the Hot Rods love him for perhaps as much as his hits. Some Guys Have All the Luck is the first singalong – and also an opportune point for Stewart to observe that Some Wars Have All the Media Attention. “There’s been a lot about the Middle East, and rightly so,” he says. “But I wanted to draw your attention to Ukraine.” He then dedicates to those stricken peoples his cover of the O’Jays’ Love Train, which lyrically seeks to spread peace the world over.The First Cut Is the Deepest is the first to get the crowd swaying, but when Stewart tries to get a mood going with Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright) – always a bit seedy, with the invitation to “loosen up that pretty French gown” – it skews more queasy than sexy, despite the candles projected onscreen and steadily honking sax. Not today, Rod honey, it’s nearly 30 degrees out!Not to be dissuaded, Stewart switches to nostalgia with Forever Young, with Technicolour visuals of Polaroids reminding the crowd of the good old days. The show benefits from the energetic lift; Stewart even gets a little jog going across the stage before bringing down the pace, once again, for You Wear It Well and more fiddle.View image in fullscreenMick Hucknall joins Stewart on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty ImagesMaggie May naturally invites a singalong, but the crowd isn’t ready when Stewart invites them to start him off. The song rollicks along without either Rod or the crowd quite on top of the lyrics, but neither seem too fussed. Young Turks, with its Boys of Summer-style 80s panache, returns both parties to more stable footing; its propulsive energy and soaring chorus makes you wish that there were more like it in Stewart’s catalogue.It’s a Heartache, featuring more roaming fiddle, is a mid-tempo crowdpleaser; Stewart’s cover of I’d Rather Go Blind is less so, but he’s given a pass when he dedicates it to the late Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. Da Ya Think I’m Sexy? was perhaps never not going to be confronting, no matter where it appeared in the set; once swaggering, even leering, in this context Stewart sounds genuinely inquiring, though perhaps not prepared for an honest answer. “1978, those were the days!” exhales Stewart before disappearing for a costume change, leaving “the girls” to entertain us with Lady Marmalade.When Stewart returns, it’s with Michael Eavis, whom he embraces on stage and wishes happy birthday. I Don’t Want to Talk About It is another big singalong, and the best match so far for the crowd’s mood and energy. But then we descend, once again, into crooner territory with Stewart welcoming “Micky Boy” from Simply Red for If You Don’t Know Me By Now. Hucknall is just the first of Stewart’s long-trailed guests, the next being Ronnie Wood for Stay With Me. To see these old rockers united at the mic is a highlight of the set; Wood is still as slick as ever and the crowd, starting to flag in the high dry heat, responds to the energetic lift. Lulu joins Stewart for Hot Legs, which strikes the best note as the most straightforwardly silly of his “sexy” songs. Lulu isn’t afraid to draw attention to her own legs, which might very well be hot in white tassel trousers, but the staging keeps the focus on Stewart with photos of him in his prime, in short-shorts flaunting his pins (as the tabloids might have it). It’s an endearing twist, and supportive of Stewart’s icon status without pretending that he’s still a bare-chested sex symbol or rock god. The gentle strains of harp mark Sailing, and, naturally, the end of the set. Perhaps it’s the heat, but the singalong isn’t as lusty as you might expect – but nor has Stewart lost the crowd, which remains densely packed, just glad to be near him and then free.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalRod StewartFestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

She describes being overcome by a feeling of “numbness”.“I’d been left alone with a small child. The worst thing for her was the thought that her father had left her and would never come back. The worst time was when she blocked her father when he tried to call.“It took several months to get a connection again. I’m glad my husband didn’t give up.”Amid a multitude of strains on life inUkraineafter three long years of war, Yulia’s family have managed to survive the pressures, helped by a group that offers war-damaged families supportive counselling.Others have not been so lucky. While there are no official figures, anecdotal evidence points to a growing number of relationship stresses and families that have broken up under the pressures of war. From absence when wives and children have fled abroad, to the enforced separation when service at the front means men might only get home for a short period of leave once a year, there are a variety of factors driving relationship stress.View image in fullscreenYulia, who was overcome by a feeling of ‘numbness’ when her husband left her and their child to help defend UkraineResearch from other countries, includingby King’s College London, suggests that in families where one member deploys for 12 months in a three-year period – considerably less than is usual in the Ukrainian military since the Russian invasion –relationship issues are 8% more prevalentthan in families where soldiers deploy for shorter periods.How partners adapt and change to new circumstances, whether at home or on the frontline, can also test the closest of bonds.“It’s really a sensitive issue,” says Natalia Umerenkova, a psychologist at Ukraine’s Institute of Social and Political Psychology who is involved in running the counselling sessions that Yulia attended.“One of the main things is fatigue. The war in Ukraine has been going on for more than 10 years, including more than three years of all-out war.View image in fullscreenPsychologist Natalia Umerenkova with Marina and Yulia in Kyiv“People are exhausted. We have a hotline for families who have members in the military and we see requests connected to relationships increasing. It’s not only wives but also men in the military calling, asking for help because they need help with the feeling that their relationship might be ending,” she says.“Everything is different in each family. But there are three broad categories. If things were bad before, the war is a catalyst and things will be worse. Then there are the families who were close and know how to deal with the experience, how to communicate and have the same values.“Between those two are the families where there are differences in outlook, and some trust issues. The war can bring them together or break them up. But there’s a feeling that both of them have changed.“When you don’t have enough strength to deal with issues that appear, to talk about them, then it becomes a vicious circle.”It was really hard for me to understand why he wasn’t here … it was like losing a limbMarinaFor men, the immersion in a military culture can create emotional separation from home.“It’s like a closed male club, where certain initiations take place,” says one woman who recently separated from her partner. “They are surviving dangerous tasks. The men are physically together most of the time. They become emotionally closer to them than their partner because of the different shared experiences.“And it takes a lot of empathy from the soldier who’s dealing with life and death issues to empathise with the issues his partner is dealing with in civilian life.”The war, she says, has tilted the balance in Ukraine society’s gender politics. “There is more of a tendency to excuse men’s behaviour. It’s considered bad if people feel you are talking shit about your partner.”View image in fullscreenYulia, whose family have managed to survive the pressures of separation helped by supportive counsellingThe issue of trust can be one of uncertainty, and difficulty in communication, corroded by uncomfortable truths: including the awareness that some soldiers visit sex workers, a reality much in evidence in areas adjoining the immediate frontline.“It’s normal when in combat conditions,” says Umerenkova. “Your brain switches to survival mode to try to cut off emotions not connected to war.“You put all emotions into your survival and the survival of the group. Lots of wives say that communication with their husband changes because they are communicating the same way as in their military group. Short unemotional communications. And the wives are asking: ‘Are we OK?’ They see it as rejection.”Mutual misunderstanding compounding a sense of doubt is a common theme.“I came to this group,” says Yulia, “because I felt I had no choice. I could go crazy or learn to find help from other people. I was worried something was wrong with me.”For Marina, 41, the stress responses became physical over the separation from her husband of 22 years, a combat medic who was injured during the conflict.View image in fullscreenMarina, who after her therapy sessions, says: ‘One of the things I understand now is the right time to talk about certain things’“We have never been apart for more than a month. We worked to find ways to communicate but it was really hard for me to understand why he wasn’t here. It was like losing a limb and I had a physical reaction – rashes – when he left.Killing machines: how Russia and Ukraine’s race to perfect deadly pilotless drones could harm us allRead more“I couldn’t understand if my emotional reactions were correct. In the beginning I thought the war would last one year at most. Then life will be the same but it’s not.“2022 was a bad year for me,” she adds. “I started therapy and then I heard about the support group. I found it hard to stay in touch with people whose life didn’t change as much and didn’t have the huge stress of a husband in the military.“One of the things I understand now is the right time to talk about certain things. Because my husband is a medic it’s sometimes hard for him to talk about a lot of things, including the loss of colleagues. Now we have special words when he doesn’t want to say something. Now I understand.”Umerenkova says the necessary level of social support is lacking in Ukraine. “Everyone needs some support but its not easy to get with so many people in the army. As a society we need it, and it’s important to start to talk about this now while the men are still in the army – because after the war, our veterans will need to deal with it.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineUkraine in depthRussiaEuropeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was ruler again, at least in spirit, of this corner of the west ofIreland.Five centuries after Grace O’Malley defied convention, and the English, by leading a renegade fleet, her descendants and admirers gathered on Achill Island this weekend to re-enact and celebrate her feats.An all-female circus of performers and acrobats depicted her life – and famous encounter with Queen Elizabeth I – in an open-air show by the shoreline where she once sailed.Front row? Dublin orders tourists to leave statue’s cleavage aloneRead more“Grace is our anti-goddess. What makes her different from the other red-headed female figures of Irish history is that she wasn’t a goddess or a fairy. She was real – a powerful, real woman,” said Dea Birkett, the creative producer of theDay of Grace, which mixed circus, music and storytelling on the County Mayo island.Saturday’s theatrical premiere was the latest sign that Ireland has rediscovered a figure who was once written out of history to the point of being deemed mythical. Now her trailblazing life is the subject of tours, books, plays, documentaries and DNA investigation.Born around 1530, Graínne Mhaol, or Granuaile, as she is also known, was the daughter of a Gaelic chieftain who led her seafaring clan through tumultuous conflicts with rival clans and encroaching English forces. She reputedly had a fleet of 20 ships and took a shipwrecked Spanish sailor as a lover between her two marriages.Grace’s practice of intercepting and demanding tributes from vessels infuriated Ireland’s would-be Tudor overlords, leading to clashes and the capture of Grace’s son, who was held hostage. She sailed to London and gained an audience with Queen Elizabeth, who could have executed Grace but instead freed her son and allowed them both to return home, where Grace continued to intercept ships and died, in her 70s, in 1603.View image in fullscreenA page from Anthologia Hibernica depicting Grace O’Malley meeting Queen Elizabeth I.Photograph: Alamy“She’s swashbuckling and she’s cheeky – the brass neck, the resilience, no wonder her story gets an amazing response,” said Deborah Newbold, who performed a one-woman show,Dauntless, overlooking Achill’s Dugort beach.Despite a long, taboo-busting life, Irish chronicles made no mention of Grace, who became a figure of folklore, until a historian, Anne Chambers, found references in English state records and published abiographyin 1979.Now in its 11th edition, the biography has inspired artists, poets, musicians, sculptors and composers. “Grace will never let me go,” said Chambers. “She shines as an inspirational beacon to what women can achieve, like her, even in the most demanding and difficult environments.”Grace’s story featured in a Broadway musical and in folk and punk band renditions. Interest is surging anew in the run-up to Grace’s 500th birthday in 2030.The Mayo town of Newport unveiled a statue last year and hasrestored Rockfleet, a castle associated with the pirate queen. A luxury hotel named the Grace is to open in nearby Westport. Brands ofwhiskey and ginnamed after the clan chieftain are now on sale in about 30 countries. A stage play and TV documentary based on Chambers’ book are being planned and a feature film is in development.“There’s a zeitgeist about Grace at the moment,” said Birkett. “People used to think she didn’t exist but she used to sail right past here. Her power over the English was that she knew every bit of water, every harbour.”The circus performers defied a strong breeze – and interloping sheep – to turn the pirate queen’s story into an acrobatic show for several hundred people. “Just like a ship, a circus is at the mercy of forces you can’t control,” said Polina Shapkina, who played Grace. “This is our spin on the story – it’s about female power.” The show, partly sponsored by Mayo county council and performed by members of the production companyCircus 250, is expected to go on tour.View image in fullscreenPerformers in Circus 250’s aerial show Grace: The Story of a Pirate Queen.Photograph: Alison LaredoThe audience included two coachloads of O’Malleys from around the world – members of the O’Malley Clan Association, which held its 69th annual gathering this weekend.Randall O’Malley, 58, from Los Angeles, recently gave a DNA sample to the association’sFinding Grace project. It aims to identify her descendants through the Y-DNA signature – which is easier to track than the female chromosome – of Grace’s immediate male forebears. “It would be a hoot to able to tell the rest of my family that we’re related,” he said.Maurice Gleeson, the genealogist leading the project, said people named O’Flaherty and Burke may also have a genetic link via Grace’s two husbands. The clan’s current taoiseach – an elected post – is Grace O’Malley, a Dublin schoolteacher.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropeCircusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This isn’t just about warm words. This is about making sure we get policy right,” she said.Starmer is facing a challenging 48 hours as No 10 battles to persuadeLabourMPs to back the welfare bill now that the government has promised that current claimants of personal independence payment (Pip) will not be subject to proposed cuts. It also pledged that the health element of universal credit will rise at least in line with inflation.The Department for Work and Pensions will on Monday publish the terms of reference for a review of personal independence payment (Pip) to be undertaken by a minister, Stephen Timms, which the government says will be “co-produced” with disabled people.It will set out £300m of employment support to be brought forward over the next three years, and publish draft regulations on the “right to try” – allowing disabled people to try work without risking their financial support.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said: “This is about delivering a fairer, more compassionate system as part of our plan for change which supports people to thrive, whatever their circumstances.”However, critics of the welfare cuts will be looking carefully at the timetable for the Timms review, as many want to see it published before the reduction in Pip due in November this year. Alternatively, they want to see the cuts delayed until after the review of the system is published.Dozens of Labour MPs appear yet to be convinced, with estimates that 50 to 60 would like to see further changes, although one of the leading original critics, Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, said she was now likely to back the legislation. Meg Hillier, the Treasury committee chair, has also switched to say she will back the bill, but many others are waiting to see further details.In her first interview since quitting, Foxcroft said it was “good to hear that people won’t be losing their benefits who are currently on them” but said there were “areas where I still think there’s need for movement”.The MP said one of the biggest issues was the need for co-production with disabled people and disability groups, and that should have happened “absolutely from the start”.“This is the problem. And this is why a lot of people have said, ‘Can we delay this? Can we pause this until we ensure that we properly get it right?’ Right now, we’re kind of tinkering in terms of things to make it the least worst situation we can, and we need to learn lessons from that and make sure that we get these things right going forward,” she said.The former shadow minister for disabled people said she would also like to see the Pathways to Work review by Timms published before the implementation of the bill that would bring in cuts.

We will always believe in – and actively campaign for – hope, unity, peace and love.“With almost 4,000 performances atGlastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share, and a performer’s presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs.“However, we are appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan yesterday. Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”Kneecap lead anti-Starmer chant during politically charged Glastonbury setRead moreKeir Starmer, the UK prime minister, told the Telegraph: “There is no excuse for this kind of appalling hate speech.I said thatKneecap should not be given a platform and that goes for any other performers making threats or inciting violence. The BBC needs to explain how these scenes came to be broadcast.”Wes Streeting earlierdescribed the chantingas “appalling” and said the BBC and Glastonbury had questions to answer, but he also had strong words for Israel.Responding to a statement from the Israeli embassy condemning the performance, the health secretary said: “Firstly, I do think that if I take the equivalent of the war in Ukraine, I’m unequivocal about which side of that war I’m on. I want Ukraine to win. Would I be celebrating or chanting for the death of Russian soldiers? No, I want to see an end to the war, and I want to see an end to the conflict.“I’d also say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and the settlers in the West Bank. So, you know, I think there’s a serious point there by the Israeli embassy I take seriously. I wish they’d take the violence of their own citizens towards Palestinians more seriously.”View image in fullscreenNadine Shah read an open letter from Artists for Palestine UK in support of the activist group Palestine Action during her set.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianDuring the festival, artists from the full cross-section of the music scene showed their support for the Palestinian cause.CMATandthe Libertinesshouted “Free Palestine” during their sets – as did Gary Lineker at the end of his talk – whileJoy Crookes, TV on the Radio, Sorry and Paloma Faith all had Palestinian flags or keffiyeh scarves on stage.During her set early Sunday afternoon, the musicianNadine Shah performedin front of a backdrop showing the destruction in Gaza. She told the crowd, many of whom were waving Palestinian flags: “I just don’t like seeing people being killed.”Shah read an open letter from Artists for Palestine UK in support of theactivist group Palestine Action, whom the home secretary, Yvette Cooper,has planned to proscribeas a terror organisation, if a Commons vote goes her way next week.It read: “Palestine Action is intervening to stop a genocide. It is acting to save life. We deplore the government’s decision to proscribe it. Labelling non-violent direct action as terrorism is an abuse of language and an attack on democracy.“The real threat to the life of the nation comes not from Palestine Action, but from the home secretary’s efforts to ban it. We call on the government to withdraw its proscription of Palestine action and to stop arming Israel.”Shah added: “And if I read this out after 4 July, I can potentially be prosecuted for that.”The Israeli embassy said of the Bob Vylan performance that it was “deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric expressed on stage at the Glastonbury festival”.A statement on X said: “Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy. But when speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out – especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms.“Chants such as ‘Death to the IDF’ and ‘From the river to the sea’ are slogans that advocate for the dismantling of the state of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination. When such messages are delivered before tens of thousands of festivalgoers and met with applause, it raises serious concerns about the normalisation of extremist language and the glorification of violence.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025BBCSomersetEnglandGlastonbury festivalMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Concern has also been raised about rising rates of “Dickensian” illnesses, including scabies, rickets and scarlet fever.The disclosures are revealed as part of a months-long Guardian investigation into the effects of deepening poverty on a “broken” NHS.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, earlier this monthunveiled a £29bn real-terms increasein day-to-day NHS spending – up to £226bn by 2029 – rising to almost half of all non-capital public spending by the government in that time.Wes Streeting, the health secretary,has pledgedto direct billions of pounds of extra NHS funding into poor areas by banning hospitals from overspending and overhauling the formula used to decide the levels of funding GP surgeries receive.This Thursday he will unveil the government’s 10 year health plan, which will include radical plans to transform the NHS from a service primarily focused on treating illness to preventing it.However, NHS trust leaders are warning that cuts to other key areas – andlong-delayedplans to reform social care andtackle child poverty– will leave hospitals and GPs having to “deal with the fallout”.There is also unease about how Streeting’s ambition to shift the health service from treatment to prevention square with the deep cuts to regional independent care boards, which are under pressure to axeas many as 12,500 jobsby the end of this year.Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, called for a cross-governmental approach to tackle the impact of poverty on health.“Prevention is better than cure but after many years of underinvestment and cuts there is a lot more to do to achieve the government’s ambition of a clearer focus on preventing ill health,” she said.“Made worse by the cost of living crisis, poverty has played a part in driving record demand for stretched mental health services, particularly among children and young people.”Acomprehensive reportpublished by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) in 2016 estimated that £29bn of NHS spending was associated with poverty.One of the report’s authors, Prof Donald Hirsch of Loughborough University said that although the exact cost today cannot be known without repeating the study, it was likely to be much higher.“We spend a lot more on the NHS now than in 2014, and if the fraction attributable to poverty were the same, the cost would have risen to nearly £50bn,” he said.“In fact it could be much higher, since far more people are experiencing severe hardship, including hunger and destitution, which could have strengthened the links between poverty and ill health, and hence higher health spending.”Studies suggest about a quarter of all spending in acute hospital care and primary care can be attributed to greater use of these services by people in poverty. At £50bn a year, spending on health deprivation would be similar to thedefence budgetand account for about £1 in every £10 spent by the government onall public services.Areport bythe Royal College of Physicians, published last week, estimated that air pollution – which disproportionately affects deprived communities – was contributing to about 30,000 deaths a year and about £500m a week in NHS and economic costs.Katie Schmuecker, the principal policy adviser at the JRF, said: “Without an urgent commitment to tackling deep poverty, no plan to improve public services can succeed and the NHS and economy will continue to suffer as a result.“Hardship is causing avoidable harm to people’s health as well as holding back our economy, and failing to act on this costs us all dear.”Schmuecker said widespread deprivation was having a “devastating” effect on the NHS and the economy. Studieshave shownthat those living in poverty are getting sicker and access healthcare later, contributing to A&E admissions that are nearly twice as high in the poorest groups and emergency admissions that are 68% higher.Dr Andy Knox, the acting medical director of Lancashire and South Cumbria integrated care board, which spans some of the poorest areas of Britain, said only “full systemic change” in the approach to public health would curbwidening inequality.“There is an urgency to the situation we find ourselves in,” he said. “We have not created a healthy society, and particularly for our most disadvantaged communities, this is now having a profoundly negative effect and placing huge pressure on our health and care system.”Areportby the Health Foundation last year found that health inequalities are expected to continue over the next 20 years, with people in the poorest areas likely to be diagnosed with major illness a decade earlier than people in the wealthiest. The life expectancy gap between these areas has widened across Britain since 2013, according tothe Office for National Statistics.Hugh Alderwick, of theHealthFoundation, said the government’s mission to tackle poverty and its impact on health “appears to be missing in action”. He said pressure on the NHS would continue to grow without “meaningful policy action to improve people’s social and economic conditions”.A government spokesperson said ministers were “determined to change people’s lives for the better, helping them out of poverty and protecting those who need it most”.The spokesperson added: “As part of our plan for change we announced a new £1bn package to reform crisis support, as well as the expansion to free breakfast clubs, increasing the national minimum wage and supporting 700,000 of the poorest families by introducing a fair repayment rate on universal credit deductions.“We are also reforming the NHS so it is there for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live, and have hit the ground running, delivering an extra 3.6m appointments since July to cut waiting lists.”Explore more on these topicsNHSPovertyHealthChildrenHospitalsSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

They roughed up medical staff, smashed equipment and set fire to vehicles. Other armed men soon arrived and automatic gunfire reverberated around the sprawling hospital compound, already battered by successive Israeli strikes close by or onits buildings.There was worse to come. Soon, another force joined the shooting, dispatched by the interior ministry in Gaza, long a bastion of Hamas, to restore order. There was now a new gun battle, which ended only when the opposing gunmen from the two duelling gangs fled. Overhead, throughout the fighting, Israeli drones flew by.The incident, described to the Guardian by medical staff and local residents, was a microcosm of the new violence and anarchy inGazaafter almost 21 months of war.“You have [these] gangs fighting and the Israeli airstrikes or troops shooting people, andHamasstill there, while there are miles and miles of ruins where desperate people are cooking on fires and living in tents and very hungry,” one humanitarian official said. “It’s like some kind of post-apocalyptic sci-fi film.”The war in Gaza was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas militants into southern Israel in October 2023, which led to the killing of 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and the abducton of 251, 50 of whom remain in the territory. So far, the Israeli offensive has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians, mostly civilians, displaced most of the 2.3 million population and reduced much of Gaza to rubble.In recent months, more armed actors have joined the fighting, and a fierce struggle for power and influence has intensified even as the Israeli offensive continues. These now include various other militant factions, a dozen armed militias representing major local families or clans, new coalitions organised by independent community leaders, and criminal gangs empowered by the deepening anarchy.The result is that Gaza is fragmenting into individual fiefdoms. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) holds much of the territory, including a wide “buffer zone” cleared of buildings along the territory’s perimeter and a swath of the south along the border with Egypt, where it works closely withthe Popular Forces, a new militia run by a former convict and smuggler calledYasser Abu Shabab. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister,has confirmedthat Israel provides weapons to clans that oppose Hamas.Abu Shabab, who denies getting support from Israel or contacts with the Israeli army, also controls territory along Gaza’s eastern perimeter near the main entry point from Israel – though the militia’s influence there is contested by several armed local families.The Guardian view on annihilation in Gaza: the deaths mount, but the pressure has ebbed | EditorialRead moreThe chaos has encouraged other traditionally important families and clans to assert their control over much of the rest of south and central Gaza.In the north, Hamas remains a force in Gaza City and the shattered neighbourhoods of Jabaliya and Shujaiya. Though the Islamist militant organisation’s military capabilities are now much reduced andmost of its veteran leadershave been killed by Israel, many civilian technocrats remain in their posts in key ministries, and other officials, operating secretly, run neighbourhood administrations.“They’re hiding because they are being instantly hit by [Israeli] planes but they appear here and there, organising queues in front of bakeries, protecting aid trucks, or punishing criminals,” said a 57-year-old construction worker in Gaza City. “They’re not like before the war, but they exist.”Hamas and its paramilitary police forces have clashed with criminal gangs too – as shown by the firefight at Nasser hospital.“All the people in Khan Younis are blaming [the fighters] for spoiling the hospital and have asked them to apologise,” said a senior medical official at the hospital.The police have also been repeatedlytargeted by the IDF. Several members of the Sahm force, set up by Hamas to crack down on looters, profiteers and thieves, were killed last week in an Israeli airstrike on Deir al-Balah, a central town, which also killed about a dozen civilians. The IDF denied reports from witnesses that the police were distributing aid seized from looters when attacked.Stocks of aid built up during the two-month ceasefire early this year ran out during the subsequent 11 weeks when Israel allowed nothing into Gaza.“The shortage is completely artificial and it means [aid] is the most valuable commodity now, so basically if you’ve got guns and you can get aid, you can use it to get money and power, and so that’s causing a lot of the violence,” said one aid official, pointing out that a single 25kg sack of flour can sell for up to $500.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most carry flour for Gaza’s community kitchens but they are usually stopped by barricades made of concrete blocks and then stripped of their cargoes, sometimes by armed gangs but most often by desperate civilians who gather in massive numbers at points the convoys are expected to pass.“The scenes are appalling. You have 50 trucks, spread over two kilometres, and there are 50,000 on the road trying to get the flour,” said another aid official in Gaza.Many civilians have been killed as they tried to reach food distribution hubs opened last month by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a secretiveUS- and Israel-backedprivate organisation. The GHF said on Sunday that it had safely delivered more than 51m meals despite “a highly volatile environment”.Statistics from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirm ministry of health counts of more than 500 deaths fromlive fire on those seeking aidby Israeli forces in recent weeks, as well as a small number in clashes between looters.A report byHaaretz last weekquoted multiple Israeli soldiers describing orders to fire at civilians.

It is dictating the policy toward us.”But Iravani said Tehran is “ready for the negotiation, but after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation, and there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president”.The Iranian UN envoy also denied that there are any threats from his government to the safety of Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or against the agency’s inspectors, who are accused by some Iranian officials of helping Israel justify its attacks. IAEA inspectors are currently in Iran but do not have access to Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pressed by the CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan on whether he would condemn calls for the arrest and execution of the IAEA head, which Marco Rubio, the US secretary of statesaida newspaper close to Iran’s leader had made, Iravani said that he would.“There is no any threat,” Irvani said, but acknowledged that Iran’s parliament had suspended cooperation with IAEA. The inspectors, he said, “are in Iran, they are in safe conditions, but the activity has been suspended. They cannot have access to our site … our assessment is that they have not done their jobs.”Iravani also responded to questions on why Tehran has not accepted proposals for a diplomatic solution. Referring to Trump’s “unconditional surrender” demand, Irvani said that the US “is dictating the policy towards us. If they are ready for negotiation, they will find us ready for that. But if they want to dictate us, it is impossible for any negotiation with them.”Iravani said on Saturday that Iran could transfer its stocks of enriched uranium to another country in the event of an agreement with the United States on Tehran’s nuclear program,according to news site Al-Monitor.The transfer of 20% and 60% enriched uranium would not be a red line for Tehran, Iravani said, adding that the material could alternatively remain in Iran under IAEA supervision.But as he said again on Sunday, Iravani stressed that Iran would not renounce its right to domestic uranium production, a condition the US rejects.Irvani’s comments comes as western nations, including the US, are pushing for Iran to resume negotiations over its nuclear program a week after the US launched strikes on three facilities, setting off days of heated dispute over whether the facilities has been “totally obliterated”, asDonald Trumpinitially claimed, or if they had delayed but not destroyed the program.Grossitold CBSthat there is “agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage” but went on to say that Iran will likely will be able to begin to produce enriched uranium within months.“The capacities they have are there,” he said. “They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.”On Sunday, President Trump again dismissed reports that Iran had moved 400kg (880lb) on 60% enriched uranium ahead of the strikes on Fordow, regarded as the center of Iran’s enrichment program.“It’s very hard to do, dangerous to do, it’s very heavy, plus we didn’t give them much notice because they didn’t know they we were coming,” Trump told the Fox News host Maria Bartiromo.Trump speculated that vehicles seen near the entrances to Fordow before the strikes were likely masons brought in to seal up the facility. “There are thousands of tons of rock in that room right now,” Trump said. “They whole place was just destroyed.”However,the Washington Post reportedon Sunday that the US obtained intercepted Iranian communications in which senior Iran officials remarked that damage from the attack was not as destructive and extensive as they anticipated.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, scoffed at the Iranian claims in a comment to the Post in which she did not dispute that such communications had been intercepted.“The notion that unnamed Iranian officials know what happened under hundreds of feet of rubble is nonsense,” Leavitt said.Separately on Sunday, Abdolrahim Mousavi, Iran’s armed forces chief of staff,reportedlytold the Saudi defense minister during a call that Tehran is not convincedIsraelwill honour the ceasefire that ended their 12-day war announced by Trump.“Since we are completely doubtful about the enemy honoring its commitments, including the ceasefire, we are prepared to give it a tough response in case of recurrence of an act of aggression”, Mousavi said, according to Turkey’s state-run news agency Anadolu.Israel and the US, “have shown that they do not adhere to any international rules and norms” the Iranian general added. “We did not initiate war, but we responded with all our power to the aggressor.”Explore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

This government has a clear plan for change to get tens of thousands more children school ready each year so that every child, from any background, gets the opportunities they need to get on in life.”Phillipson first announced the plan just before theLabour party conference last year, saying 300 sites would be open within 12 months.The government said the 200 sites getting ready to open were exceeding the number of places they thought they could offer, with 4,000 projected.Phillipson said the schools were chosen in places currently underserved by the market. There will be an average of 20 places for each site and up to 6,000 new places when the programme is complete.The government believes that30 funded hours of childcarea week will save parents up to £7,500 on average, while £450 a year will be saved through freebreakfast clubs in schools.Last month, the government announced almost £370m of further funding to support the future of the programme. Some of the sites involve the conversion of empty classrooms into early years settings.Wayne Wathen-Howell, the headteacher of Minet infant and nursery school in Hayes, said: “We’re proud to be opening a new nursery right here in our school – it’s a big moment for our community.“Parents have told us how important it is to have affordable, high-quality childcare close to home, and this new nursery will make a real difference. Not only will it help families balance work and family life, it also gives our youngest children the best possible start in a familiar, supportive environment.”Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationChildcareChildrenSchoolsBridget PhillipsonnewsShareReuse this content"

Pay rises will be capped at 3.75%.The PCS president, Martin Cavanagh, said: “From removing staff from an office before the lease expires to spuriously challenging lawful notices of industrial action, the employer seems intent to avoid proper consultation, disregard fair process and alienate its staff.“Closing local offices while rigidly enforcing mandatory office attendance doesn’t make sense. The way out of this dispute is to negotiate, not frustrate.”The shadow chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Alex Burghart, criticised civil servants who wanted to work from home.Burghart said: “It speaks volumes that some civil servants are walking out not over pay, but because they’re being asked to show up to work and make better use of public buildings.“Most people can’t refuse to travel to their workplace, so why should Whitehall be any different?“Labour should be clear whether they stand with the unions defending empty desks or with taxpayers who expect a civil service that works for them.”A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “We have engaged with unions and staff about a number of proposals – including plans to expand four offices outside of London and close six offices over the next two years, as leases come to an end.“The department will continue to have offices in every English region as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and all staff affected will be able to continue in their roles.”Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceIndustrial actionTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The mistake has prompted the resignation of the company’s chief executive.The company receives prize amounts from Germany in euros, which are then converted to Norwegian kroner.“It is during this conversion that a manual error has been made in the code that is entered into our game engine,” the company said in a statement. “The amount has been multiplied by 100, instead of being divided by 100.”The inflated sums were displayed on the company’s website and mobile app on Friday but were later removed. Norsk Tipping confirmed no incorrect payouts were made.The error has triggered sharp criticism from customers, regulators and the Norwegian minister of culture. The company held an emergency meeting with the ministry of culture on Saturday to explain the incident.On Sunday, CEO Tonje Sagstuen announced she would step down from the role she had held since September 2023. “As a manager, it has been my responsibility to handle the mistakes that have occurred,” she said in a statement.“Therefore, it is also incredibly sad to leave Norsk Tipping and all the talented people who work in Hamar. I will miss everyone I have worked with, but I am confident that all the improvement processes we have initiated are in good hands.”Several Norwegians told NRK they had begun celebrating before discovering the mistake.One couple in Herøy believed they had won 1.2m kroner (£87,000) during a home renovation, while others said they planned to buy cars or take holidays before realising the messages were incorrect.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group are well known to staff, other services – and each other. Aged between 19 and 35, they have all led troubled lives. Some grew up in care, most need mental health support. All have fallen through society’s cracks and now gamble with their lives for a safe place to sleep.They know where to look to find the precise amount of medication to take for a non-lethal overdose, guaranteeing them an overnight stay in hospital. Some resort to swallowing household objects to secure a bed for the night.These 11 women accounted for a staggering 9% of the 45,228 A&E admissions at the Barrow-in-Furness hospital last year, at a cost to theNHSof at least £250,000. But they are far from unique. One NHS leader described a “chilling pattern” of self-harm among vulnerable people whose regular refuge is now their local hospital.It is not confined to the young. Older people, known on some wards as “revolving-door pensioners”, are deliberately self-neglecting so they can be looked after in hospital, particular in winter when energy bills are high.Downing St has a radical change in mind for the NHS: shifting its focus from treatment to preventionRead moreThe Guardian has spent months interviewing GPs, nurses, social workers, NHS leaders, academics and residents in some of the most deprived corners of Britain as they grapple with theworsening effectof deepening poverty on a health service in crisis.Through a series of pioneering schemes in north-westEngland, clinicians have uncovered what one NHS manager described as “medieval” levels of untreated illness. In poorer places where GPs and community nurses have all but vanished, A&E attendances have almost doubled since 2010, driving up ambulance call-outs by 61%.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, is due to unveil the biggest NHS transformation plan in a generation next month, aiming toshift healthcarefrom hospitals to communities and from treatment to prevention.The challenge is stark. Britain has the lowest life expectancy in western Europe and one of the highest tallies among rich countries for preventable deaths. NHS bodies in the regions have been ordered to slash their budgets in half, cuttingas many as 13,500 jobs, leaving senior figures alarmed about how this squares with Streeting’s focus on community care.In parts of Blackpool, Barrow, Burnley and Blackburn, areas with some of the worst deprivation in England, the Guardian learned of children suffering from both obesity and malnutrition as families increasingly rely on cheap processed food. Babies are being fed reheated formula milk, potentially causing serious bacterial infection. Other families risk food poisoning by turning off their refrigerator overnight to save money.“There’s a certain sense of despair among professionals,” said one NHS leader. “We’re trying our best but I’m not sure how much we can do. It’s deep-rooted, it’s extreme, but it’s a symptom of something broader and deeper happening across all society.”The return of door-to-door nursingView image in fullscreenNurses speak to residents in one of north-west England’s poorest estates as part of a new NHS scheme aimed at tackling health problems.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe NHS has become focused on treatment rather than prevention. But in parts ofLancashireand south Cumbria, health leaders have been taking a new approach aimed at tackling conditions before they become crises.On the Ryelands estate, a pebble-dashed maze in Lancaster, Lizzie Holmes, a community nurse, has spent two years persuading residents to have free health checks.The community, historically one of the poorest in Lancashire, is a desert for doctors and dentists. Residents are all but invisible to the NHS until they are blue-lighted to hospital or turn up at A&E. Many have not seen a doctor for years, pushed away by the 8am scramble to see a GP and the months-long waiting lists.Holmes, who was awarded the prestigious Queen’s nurse award last year, has become an unofficial social worker and even amateur plumber to win the trust of reluctant residents. Last year she unblocked a patient’s kitchen sink in return for his promise to get checked out. The man, in his late 50s, was a virtual recluse and was thought to be living with multiple chronic conditions but was refusing to get help.Her DIY plumbing turned out to be a life-saving intervention: he had been living for years with undiagnosed pneumonia, suspected bowel cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a collection of lung conditions that kill people at ahigher ratein the UK than anywhere in western Europe, and are much more prevalent in poorer areas.“There’s two outcomes if Lizzie hadn’t kept knocking on his door,” said Claire Niebieski, the head of population health in Lancashire and South Cumbria. “He would have been found dead at home or he would have been a 999 call away from spending months and months in hospital.”To date, Holmes’s team has reached 164 residents, almost all of whom were highly unlikely to seek help before presenting at A&E. For just five of these patients, this preventive approach saved the NHS more than £170,000, according to an internal analysis. Most of this saving is mainly because they would no longer need a hospital bed (£2,089per patient per day). The savings to the NHS would rise to millions of pounds across the Ryelands estate.The proactive approach has reduced A&E visits from the estate by 5% over two years, compared with a 5% increase in parts of the community without this focused approach, according to NHS modelling. A similar pilot in Poulton, in Lancaster, has led to an 11% fall in A&E attendances.View image in fullscreenClaire Niebieski, a nurse in north-west England who is working in her community to help tackle health issues among residents.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIt is a reversal of the trend across Britain since 2010. As more ofthe NHS budgetis spent on hospitals, community healthcare has gone into retreat.There are far fewer neighbourhood nurses and GPs per head than in other wealthy nations, driving up A&E visits. With nowhere else to turn, some people attend A&E as many as 300 times a year at a cost of £2.5bn to the NHS, according tothe British Red Cross. A fifth of these repeat A&E visits come from the poorest 10% of the country.The retreat from preventive care has harmed the NHS and the wider economy, experts say. Britain now spends more on health-related benefits – £75bn a year – than on defence. One in 10 people in England and Wales receive either disability or incapacity benefit, the number having grown from 2.8 million in 2019 to 4 million today. The cost to the economy of long-term sickness isestimated by the governmentat more than £300bn a year – one-and-a-half times the budget of Streeting’s Department of Health and Social Care.As povertydeepens, the NHS feels the pain. Acomprehensive studyfor the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2014 estimated that £29bn of spending by the health service was associated with poorer areas, where people are sicker and more likely to use A&E.One of the report’s authors, Prof Donald Hirsch of Loughborough University, said the cost of poverty on the NHS today would be closer to £50bn a year if those ratios were the same. “In fact, it could be much higher,” he said.The preventive approach in Lancaster is one of several quietly radical programmes under way in Lancashire and south Cumbria, a vast area spanning Blackpool, Barrow-in-Furness, Burnley and Blackburn, towns with some of the poorest and sickest communities in Britain.One senior regional manager said less affluent areas were bearing the brunt of the NHS’s retrenchment. “People are attending hospital with cancerous lumps bursting through their skin,” they said. “It’s almost like medieval times when healthcare wasn’t available.”Dr Andy Knox, the medical director of Lancaster and South Cumbria integrated care board, said Britain’s health and social care system was not sustainable without an “unrelenting focus on tackling health inequity”. He said: “The truth is that right now, in the UK, we value some people significantly more than we value others. And this is actually costing us in terms of economic and societal wellbeing.”The need for action was urgent, said Knox, who was awarded an MBE in 2013 for tackling health inequalities. “We have not created a healthy society and, particularly for our most disadvantaged communities, this is now having a profoundly negative effect and placing huge pressure on our health and care system.”Turning the tide on poverty in BlackpoolView image in fullscreenA Ready Steady School session for children and their parents at the North Family Hub in Blackpool.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe mortality rate among under-75s in Blackpool is by some distance theworst in Englandfor cancer, cardiovascular disease and for all causes, with the average man dying at 73 – six years younger than England’s average, and nowthe youngest in the UK.Blackpool hasfour timesthe average number of drug deaths, nearly double the rate of smoking deaths, the highest proportion of alcohol deaths and the highest rate of serious mental illnesses in England. Deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide are thehighest in Englandand more than twice the national average.In 2021the then health secretary, Sajid Javid, made a speech in Blackpool in which he described the huge differences in health access and outcomes related to race and socioeconomic status as the “disease of disparity”. Last week his successor Streeting also chose the town as the location forhis first speechon health inequalities. In ithe pledgedto ensure more NHS funding goes to poor areas to help tackle the fact that they have fewer GPs and longer waiting times for care. “The NHS doesn’t do enough to address the unjust, unequal way in which illness presents itself in our country,” he said.Preventing the continuation of deep multi-generational illness is the work of Blackpool Better Start, a national lottery-funded initiative bringing together the NHS, NSPCC, council, police and, crucially, a six-strong team of trusted local parents, known as community connectors, who are better at winning the confidence of families than official agencies.The work starts before children are born, with a community connector making regular visits to Blackpool Victoria hospital’s antenatal ward to enrol new parents and offer advice on drinking and smoking in pregnancy. Birth registrations have been moved out of the town hall and into three family hubs, formerly Sure Start centres, so every newborn must come through its doors to be given support.Every expectant parent in Blackpool is offered free perinatal classes, typically costing about £296 in other parts of England. Other universal courses are aimed at nurturing the bond between mothers, fathers and their babies – a key issue in a town with the country’s highest proportion of children in care, atnearly three times the national average.“If a baby doesn’t feel safe, even though they’re being fed, there’s a failure to thrive,” said Tracy Greenwood, a health visitor for more than 20 years, who has seen babies failing to gain weight due to attachment issues. More than one in seven new mothers contacted by Better Start reported having four or more adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse and neglect, which is associated withhigher levelsof health and behavioural difficulties in their own children.Since 2019, the multi-agency scheme says, it has seen a 19% increase in breastfeeding take-up and a 6% fall in babies being born pre-term. It reports an 11% drop in the number of five-year-olds suffering from tooth decay – an issue affecting one in three children of that age in Blackpool, compared with one in four nationally – in part thanks to “supervised brushing” programmes in schools.Blackpool’s use of community connectors, local parents employed by the NSPCC and often recruited on Facebook, is seen as crucial to its success. Families in the most deprived areas felt judged and feared being reported to social services, said Jenny Armer, the chair of the Ryelands estate residents’ group in Lancaster.View image in fullscreenJenny Armer from the Ryelands Community Association.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianProf Jennie Popay, a sociologist who leads Lancaster University’s Centre forHealthInequalities, said this mistrust was understandable. “The overwhelming message [from the NHS and other institutions] is that [poor health] is how people behave and that’s really stigmatising for people who live really difficult lives,” she said.Thousands of families in Blackpool are in the grip of the worst living standards on record. Emma Hobbs, a Better Start community worker, has heard new parents talk of reheating old bottles of baby formula instead of “throwing money down the sink”, increasing the risk of bacterial infections.“We’ve had parents telling us they were turning off their fridges at night because they couldn’t afford the electricity,” said Vicky Morgan, a development manager. She worries every winter when money-saving expertsencourage familiesto “heat the person, not the room”. “It’s dangerous [and] it doesn’t apply to under-fives,” she said.Across England, 40% of 11-year-olds areoverweight or obese, a trend that has grown steadily since 2010. Children in poorer areas are more than twice as likely to be obese at ages five and 11 than those in wealthier areas.Prof James Fleming, a GP in Padiham, near Burnley, has observed a troubling new phenomenon in children nationally: they are obese and malnourished.The cost of living crisis has normalised diets that rely on cheap and calorie-dense foods, he says, with disastrous lifelong consequences such as increased risk of disability, premature death, diabetes, osteoarthritis and some types of cancer.“We’re normalising poor nutrition and poor health,” Fleming said. Last year he organised a grant for a local school, expecting it to spend it on the playground. Instead, it spent it on food. “The teacher said: I want every child to have a full tummy. That was really upsetting,” he said.Back on the Ryelands estate in Lancaster, the school summer holidays are looming. Armer, the chair of the residents’ group, organised 42 food parcels for the estate at a cost of £2 each last year. In the final week of the summer holidays, only six families could afford to pay.View image in fullscreenVolunteers at the Big Food Project in Blackpool.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianChildren are missing school, she says, because the bus is too expensive. A four-mile round trip costs £4 a day – £80 a week, or £780 for a full school year. “That really concerns me and just shows how much families are struggling,” she said.In Fleetwood, eight miles north of Blackpool, NHS bosses spotted that a large number of children were failing to turn up to mental health appointments. They realised it was because families could not afford the two-hour round trip on public transport. Since moving the service to Fleetwood, the child and adolescent mental health services waiting list has fallen to almost zero. A&E attendances for children in mental health crisis have decreased by 59%.At Furness general hospital in Barrow, the 11 young women are no longer routinely found in A&E. They sat down with clinicians to explain why they self-harmed to secure a bed for the night. They described a complex range of mental health issues, dating back to childhood, that had never adequately been addressed, even though many, if not all, had been seen by NHS professionals. A more comprehensive support plan is now in place and the A&E attendances are starting to fall.“Health has to work in a different way,” Niebieski said. “It can’t continue to expect that these people will access care in the usual way. For some people the barriers they face are so great that it’s impossible.”Explore more on these topicsPovertyHealthNHSHospitalsSocial exclusionLancashirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And this week’s eventual cave-in to backbenchLabourpressure – formally announced by a Downing Street statement after midnight on Thursday – was very, very messy indeed.To return to the shadow minister’s gleeful query, how did it end up like this? The narrative will depend on who you ask. But a common thread, even among some in No 10, is the idea of a government worryingly disconnected from its own MPs.From the moment in March that Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, first set out consultativeproposals to overhaul welfare payments, it was evident that a large number of backbenchers had worries about elements of the plan.Notably, the green paper set out a significant tightening of the eligibility for personal independence payments (Pips), which help those with long-term illness or disability, causing concern not only among MPs but also numerous charities.But armed with a 150-plus Commons majority – and what felt to some MPs like an almost messianic insistence on turning around an increasingly unaffordable social security system – Downing Street ploughed on.“This has happened because of an arrogance from the top,” one veteran Labour MP said. “On the day of the green paper, the whips were saying they thought a maximum of 10 people would actually rebel. They were laughing at us.“They didn’t think anyone would have the guts from the new intake. But they [new Labour MPs] have been doing their own organising.”As it turned out, there was a lot of organising, from all sides of the parliamentary party. With Starmer largely preoccupied with other subjects – including the G7 summit in Canada anda change of course over a national inquiry into grooming gangs– MPs were taking action.The crunch point arrived on Monday with the publication ofan amendment intended to kill off the welfare billat its second reading in the Commons on 1 July. Initially signed by 108 Labour MPs, it soon had the backing of more than 120.These were not the perennial malcontents primarily from the Labour left – the “maximum of 10” so dismissively summed up by the party whip. Signatories included a string of senior backbenchers who chair select committees, and numerous 2024-intake MPs.How did dozens of hand-picked, newly arrived backbenchers, once thought so loyal they were dubbed “Starmtroopers”, find themselves within a year on the brink of a rebellion that could have defeated the government?For many, the problem dates back to the very early days of the parliament and a kind of vicious discipline that resulted inseven MPs being suspended from the Labour partyover a vote on the two-child benefit cap. Three of those MPs remain exiled today.Even loyal MPs were under orders never to submit amendments – or to make their views known publicly on any subject. “It was like student politics,” said one. “Keep your mouth shut and maybe we’ll let you on the entertainment committee.”“Arrogant” is the word MPs are using most of all. It was the blithe assumption by whips and No 10 that any rebellion would fold that sent many over the edge.“They tried to treat the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] like naughty children,” one MP said. “They all did what they were meant to do and raised the issue privately, and then got totally ignored.”Another repeated charge within the party is that even when its hierarchy did recognise the disquiet, the response tended to be either complacency or high-handed, bungling menaces.MPs described outreach to them as having been limited to presentations and charts showing the growing size of the welfare budget and increases in numbers going on Pip.“We asked to see the prime minister or the chancellor and we got a presentation from officials,” one said. “They were very, very dismissive.”MPs say they received a litany of threats, including the possibility of a general election. Those on the right of the party were warned their actions could bring about a leadership challenge that would be won by Angela Rayner. The same threat was made to those on the left, but with Wes Streeting as the looming spectre.Others say they have received veiled threats of deselection, or that their funding for the next general election would be decided on the basis of whether or not they toed the line. One party official allegedly rang a rebellious MP’s husband in order to get her to back down.“I don’t even think some of this is sanctioned by No 10,” one MP said. “Until Wednesday they had their fingers in their ears. But those who are responsible for party management have been absolutely losing it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

EvenRachel Reeves, the chancellor, made a rare appearance on the Commons terrace on Wednesday evening to try to persuade MPs over a glass of rosé. “She doesn’t want to be £5bn out of pocket,” one MP said.Yet the number of rebels continued to grow, and No 10 finally bowed to the inevitable. On Thursday morning, the prime minister used a Commons statement ostensibly about international affairs to promise a welfare rethink.Until that point, Starmer had seemed oddly detached from the issue, surfacing intermittently at summits to bat away questions about the revolt – or“noises off” as he termed it– as a distraction from the vital task of transforming welfare.Some MPs view this as indicative of a prime minister more than usually disconnected from the everyday grid of parliamentary business, as illustrated by the statistic that since winning the election he has voted in the Commons just seven times.A few have begun to openly speculate about what the situation means for Starmer’s leadership. “It is very bad for Keir. It is one in four of his MPs [that intended to rebel]. He is toast,” one MP said.A lot of the ire, however, has been directed at Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, and what one rebel called the “overexcitable boys” in the PM’s team.Inside No 10, there had been a determination to force through the plan in part because of internal polling and focus groups that suggest the public backs the changes when the context is explained – even wanting them to go further.One adviser, a close ally of the prime minister, said they had been so determined the vote had to go ahead – concessions or not – because the symbolism of being able to get the government’s agenda through the Commons was so important.“This is a fairly moderate reform,” the adviser said. “If the government cannot make this modest saving – in a change that will not affect nine out of 10 people already on the benefit – then how can we pursue the political programme we need, to make the tough decisions the country needs us to take? It’s impossible.”Other advisers are furious about the situation they have found themselves in. “It’s absolutely outrageous these people are prepared to throw away a historic majority because people were a bit mean to them on Twitter,” said one.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is over, then. Finito. Then we might as well hand the keys to Farage.”But other advisers in government say they can see how No 10 has played it wrong. One called it “a staggering failure of political management from the people who supposedly had an iron grip on the PLP”.For many Labour MPs, however, it is about nothing more complicated than a government machine that forgot how to listen.“Everything the government is now realising is something MPs have been saying for months,” one MP said. “The fact that you cannot defend these cuts on the basis they will get people into work. The fact that you cannot guarantee the most disabled people won’t be worse off.“MPs are not idiots. We deserve to be listened to. We anticipated this failure. They are in this mess now because they were too arrogant to listen.”Explore more on these topicsLabourWelfareBenefitsKeir StarmerDisabilityRachel ReevesLiz KendallfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You are sunburnt. The heat is still brutal. You are exhausted. The state of the toilets is unspeakable, and you crave a certain straightforward reliability. And, despite his attempts to reboot the Chic brand with a new album a few years back and a handful of fresh production gigs,Nile Rodgersseems largely content to see out his days in the business of straightforward reliability, simply touring the world playing his old songs. In fairness, if you’d written the catalogue of material he has, you might be inclined to ensure people don’t forget about it.The initial shock you may have felt at seeing a reconstituted version of the greatest disco band of all playing Glastonbury’s West Holts stage in 2013 has long disappeared – Chic have become a ubiquitous live presence in Britain in the ensuing years – but the meat of their set remains preserved in aspic, more or less the same as it was 12 years ago. That said, anyone who quibbles with the quality of said meat – Everybody Dance, I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, He’s the Greatest Dancer – is the kind of person who shouldn’t be allowed to express any opinions about music whatsoever: this is unequivocally some of the greatest pop ever made.There’s an argument that it’s too good to be rattled out at such speed, crammed into medleys and interspersed with faintly corny interludes in which Rodgers encourages his vocalists to hit ever higher notes and discusses “maximum funkosity” – stuff that’s all a bit at odds with Chic’s original ultra-sophisticated image, the self-styled Black Roxy Music – and his triple-tested patter about his career (“You may not know that I also produced records for other people including Diana Ross, Madonna and David Bowie”: you’re joking, why have you never mentioned this before etc etc). It also might be nice if they didn’t cut out the breakdown from Sister Sledge’s Thinking of You – arguably the most exquisite 30 seconds of music in Chic’s entire oeuvre – in favour of a section where the audience is encouraged to clap along. But given the sheer frequency with which Rodgers and Chic perform live, becoming a little cavalier with your material is probably inevitable, even when your material is as good as this.View image in fullscreenDelighting the Glastonbury crowd … Nile Rodgers and Chic.Photograph: Shane Anthony Sinclair/Getty ImagesBesides, you can’t argue with the efficacy of what they do, or indeed the sheer profusion of hits, so many that you barely notice that they don’t play Lost in Music or My Forbidden Lover: this is a set in which Daft Punk’s Lose Yourself to Dance counts as a deep cut on the grounds that it was only the second single from Random Access Memories and shifted a mere 1.3m copies as opposed to Get Lucky, which sold 8m in America alone. The huge crowd go nuts, and understandably so: in the face of such widespread delight, it seems a bit off to nitpick. It’s the second time Chic have been played the slot immediately after the Sunday afternoon legend. Their appearance in 2017 was simply a matter of extending the elated atmosphere created by former Bee Gee Barry Gibb; following Rod Stewart feels more like a salvage operation. Straightforward and reliable, Nile Rodgers and Chic are clearly up to either task.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalNile RodgersFestivalsMusic festivalsDiscoPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

What unfolded was a weekend of shock, confusion, throbbing testicles – and unbridled joyAdrian ChilesSun 29 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 12.12 EDTShareIthought I would never go to Glastonbury, and that was fine with me. Six years ago, I wrote about how it wasmy idea of hell, my event 101. Ever since then, for reasons known only to themselves, my Guardian handlers have been badgering me to come. They wore me down. They got me to Glastonbury.What was my problem? Well, while I knew I would love a lot of the music, there are some creature comforts I won’t be without. Nothing fancy – my personal hygiene bar is rather low; going without a shower for a few days holds no fear for me. All I insist upon is a clean bog and a bed on which to sleep, neither of which are easy to find at Worthy Farm.The odd thing with Glastonbury is that even those who love it will also tell you terrible things about it. Murder when it’s hot. Misery when it’s wet. Chaotic, confusing, can’t get near the stage. Flip-flops? You must be mad – your feet will be covered in filth! The toilets? God, they’re – retch – awful. But youmustgo, they would all conclude. Must I? Apparently so.As the weekend neared, my anxiety ratcheted up. In one stress dream, I was bundled, protesting, on stage to introduceSelf Esteem. Weird. In another, I was up there in a spelling competition trying to spell arboretum. Weirder still.View image in fullscreenCreature of habit … Self Esteem at this year’s festival.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOn the radio, I sought listeners’ advice for a Glastonbury virgin. The first text in read: “Baby wipes, baby wipes and baby wipes.” I bought some baby wipes. Someone else said: “Make sure you get your drugs tested at the back-of-house testing sites.” I’ll be sure to do that – and if my atorvastatin turns out to be knock-off, I’ll be speaking to my pharmacist in the strongest terms. Rob, 49, got in touch to say it would be his first time too, and he was more nervous than excited.My daughters, both of whom would be there, said things like: “Don’t do anything strange,” and: “Don’t do anything embarrassing.” They both asked, sweetly enough, if I had any friends going, because they didn’t want anyone saying: “We just saw your dad walking around on his own.” Parenting is about the journey from being the carer to being the cared for. This has been the weekend my children and I crossed that Rubicon. Are you OK? Have you eaten? Did you bring your sun cream? Toilet paper? Surely it should be me asking these questions, not struggling to answer them.To dodge the traffic, I decided to travel on my motorbike. That way, if it was really awful, I could attempt an exit à la Steve McQueen in The Great Escape. It turned out to be a good decision: I swept right up to the gate, trundled into the secure bike compound and parked alongside the incredibly few motorbikes in there. Bingo. It’s the way to go. So there I was, a Glastonbury first-timer not even into the festival proper, already offering dad advice on how to do it better.Fifty-eight is decidedly late to lose your virginity at anything. This weekend felt like going to a Doctor Who convention without having seen an episode of Doctor Who, or taking up skiing having never trodden on snow. Last summer, I went on a cruise for the first time and it was the same then – everyone apart from me seemed to know the ropes. All at sea, then and now.At first, I always seemed to be walking in the opposite direction to everyone else. On one occasion, a river of people marching in the same direction blocked my way. Ill-advisedly, I tried to dance across the general flow. There was an obvious lesson: chill out, Grandad, and go with that flow.View image in fullscreenIt takes all sorts … Adrian looks for a party outfit.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI’m not a grandfather, by the way, but I felt like one there. While it was not exactly a youthful crowd, 95% of them appeared to be younger than me. Anxiously, I scanned around for someone, anyone, to make me feel young again, or at least not so old. There were the odd one or two, but not many. “Shed Seven,” someone said to me. “You should have been at Shed Seven. Everyone there was ancient.” Damn, that would have been a good place to start.Instead, I broke my duck atAlanis Morissette. “What’s Alanis Morissette?” asked my younger daughter. Fair question, given she wasn’t even thought of when Jagged Little Pill came out. So how come I seemed to be the oldest one there, too? I certainly felt more than seven years the senior of Alanis, who looked no different on Friday than she did back then.View image in fullscreenGoing with the flow …Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI picked up a particular vibe about the Glastonbury crowd. It was in the look on everyone’s faces, the way they walked, the very set of their jaws. I would characterise it as a mix of pleasure and pain, excitement and exhaustion. By the time I turned up, everyone already looked a bit knackered. Happy, no doubt, but knackered. And this was only Friday afternoon. Blimey. What is this, a funfest or an endurance test? “Both!” said everyone to whom I posed this question. As one young woman said to me, with feeling: “The highs are high, but the lows are very low.” Right, I get it now: no pain, no gain. I can work with that, I thought. Once I understood what this Glastonbury caper was all about, I could engage.Pain was certainly something I experienced listening toBusta Rhymes. Without wishing to sound as old as I felt, his act seemed to involve a lot of shouting. Go with the flow, I reminded myself. I put my arms in the air when commanded by the great man to do so. I even endeavoured to move them backwards and forwards in time with everyone else. God loves a trier.View image in fullscreenTry before you buy …Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI got a text from a friend, Max, a Glastonbury old hand who turned out to be there busting some rhymes, too. My daughter, seeing a chance to get shot of me, led the way to him. Picking your way through a crowd is a skill this festival novice lacks. She yelled at me to keep up with her. This was easier for her to say than for me to do: she is quite small, with small feet, whereas I’m quite big, with correspondingly big feet. It is tricky to make brisk progress without knocking a drink – or the drinker – over, or causing lasting damage to fingers or toes. This must happen all the time, with all sorts of pushing, shoving and bad blood ensuing.View image in fullscreenBuckets of character …Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI asked Max how often fights broke out. “At Glastonbury? Never,” he said. And this, astonishingly, seems to be the case. All this chaos, intoxicants of all kinds and general exuberance, yet no trouble at all. Miraculous. OK, there have been political blows exchanged, but that is different. In terms of physical skirmishing, there will have been more nonsense on your high street this weekend than on the whole Glastonbury site.Max suggested we go to seeSelf Esteemon the Park stage. She had managed to start without me introducing her. And she was brilliant, really properly brilliant. With the help of nothing more than some warmish lager, my mate Max and this gifted woman from Rotherham, I felt a perfect high. I even, incredibly, bumped into Rob, who had texted in to my radio show that it was his first time. We agreed it was all very nice. Yes, this was great. But, as I had been warned, every high is followed by a low.View image in fullscreenSmall world … with Rob, who had texted Adrian’s radio show about visiting Glastonbury for the first time.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI had a look atLoyle Carner, who was just wrapping up on the Other stage, then called it a day. It was only then, back in my tent, that I realised I had got something very wrong. Two years ago,Lana Del Rey’s microphone was cutbecause she overran her headline slot. From this, I had drawn the conclusion that the organisers took their curfews and noise abatement responsibilities very seriously. Quite right, too. I assumed everyone else would be turning in now, too. I honestly thought my sleep would be disturbed by nothing louder than the sound of fellow campers snoring or, at worst, having sex.How very wrong I was. The snoring or sex would have needed to have been loud indeed to break the infernal racket that banged on for hours, all over the site. Why did they cut poor Lana’s mic if this aural pandemonium goes on all night anyway? Sleep came only as dawn approached, and fitfully. Truly, the God that is Glastonbury giveth and taketh away.Irose early to commence the search for some highs to make up for the night’s bottomless lows. For reasons of vanity, the previous evening I had dispensed with the compression sock I am always supposed to wear on my left leg. Now, I was paying a price for that, so, odd though it looks when I’m in shorts, back on it went. I was too tired to be anything other than my authentic self.View image in fullscreenMake some noise … Busta Rhymes(right)with Spliff Star on the Other stage.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianI chanced upon the Glade stage, where a modest but appreciative crowd were swaying in a relaxed fashion to the sound of – and I quote from the programme – Channel One’s Mikey Dread bringing roots, rock and reggae vibrations with MC’s vinyl and dubplates. Even though I’m familiar with more than half of those words, this didn’t mean a lot to me. Still, what’s not to like about a slow, heavy reggae beat? Among the swayers there were a good few blokes my age – at last! – shifting their weight from foot to foot. I stood there a while, enjoying it, and, almost despite myself, found my weight tentatively shifting from foot to foot.Then, two very odd things happened. First, the prodigious, dungeon-deep bass slightly changed pitch. I was astonished, not to say alarmed, to find that this – and I’m sorry not to spare you this detail – made my testicles throb in time with the music. I couldn’t work out if the other blokes were feeling the same thing. Perhaps Mikey Dread had just found my frequency. Look, I don’t mind a bit of something different late at night, but at lunchtime on a sunny Saturday, I wasn’t ready. Gingerly, I started to edge my way out, only for something even odder to happen.View image in fullscreenCheese! Adrian meets fans at the Glade.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI was stopped by a petite woman, around my age, who shouted something in my ear that sounded like “DVT”. I thought this was some reference to my cursed compression sock, but it turned out she had said “DMT”. Specifically: “You need to smoke some DMT,” which presumably is what was emanating from the thing she was waving under my nose. I thanked her very politely, but refused. It became clear that this was an extremely good decision. “The effects of DMT take hold almost immediately when smoked. Users may feel like they are instantly transported to another universe,” I read. Crikey. “Within five minutes … users may experience increased blood pressure, rapid heartbeat and dilated pupils.”Relieved but shaken, I went off to the Healing Fields. There, a nice chap from Dorset calmed me with instructions on how to carve a heart into a square of Maltese limestone. All this before lunch. There really is something for everyone at that place.View image in fullscreenSomething for everyone … Adrian gets whittling.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe sun got hotter, the crowds thickened and still, to my increasing admiration, not a temper frayed. The sheer good nature of everyone in attendance started to feel almost absurd. My daughter told me to meet her at the Other stage, where she saidI would enjoy Beabadoobee– no, me neither. But she was right, I did. It was all getting nicer and nicer.Word reached me of fire and brimstone elsewhere ahead ofthe Kneecap gig. It came across like news from a distant planet where they did things differently. I neither saw, heard nor felt anything along those lines anywhere I ventured all weekend.Kneecap at Glastonbury review – sunkissed good vibes are banished by rap trio’s feral, furious flowsRead moreBy the timePulp took to the Pyramid stage, the peace-and-love control knobs were turned up to 11. Sensing the softening of my heart, my colleagues took the opportunity to force me into silly hats and whatnot. Everyone sang along. Everyone danced. Even me, nearly. The Red Arrows flew over. What next? Santa? To my consternation, I got a bit tearful. I give in. Glastonbury is a good thing. Anything that makes the world feel this nice has to be a seriously good thing.To anyone who has been scathing about Glastonbury without having attended – as was the case with me – I humbly suggest your cynicism would not survive the reality of being there.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive photograph: courtesy of Harry and Izzy JuddBorn in Essex in 1985, Harry Judd is best known as the drummer inMcFly, one of the most successful 00s groups, with tracks such as Obviously and All About You. He has also performed with supergroup McBusted. Judd has three children with his wife, Izzy, a violinist. She hosts the podcast Let’s Talk Neurodivergent Kids, available now on all platforms.HarryThis was in St Lucia, moments after I proposed to Izzy. We had flown in that afternoon and were jetlagged, but I wanted to get down on one knee straight away. Our lovely waitress came with drinks and took that photo. My expression? Probably relief. I had been so anxious about getting it right. As soon as we got on the sunbeds the next morning, Izzy immediately got a notepad and pen out. She was like: “Right, so it’s you, me, Mum, Dad …”I first met Izzy in Bristol in 2005. McFly were doing a radio show in a church and Izzy was one of the string players. Being only 19, I remember pulling up in our tour bus and saying to the other guys: “I wonder what the girls in the orchestra will be like?” When we got inside, I shook her hand and instantly thought: “Ooh, I fancy her.” She had a really kind and pretty face, and that’s my thing.The orchestra were coming on tour with us, so I was looking forward to seeing Izzy every day. But shortly after our first meeting, she got the mumps and missed all the rehearsals and the first two weeks of shows. She did eventually join, but little did I know our management had told the musicians they weren’t allowed to speak to the band. They’d handled a couple of groups before, and knew to avoid any drama, they should prevent us all from mixing. I would sometimes knock on the girls’ dressing room door and ask if anyone wanted a cigarette, but Izzy would hide because she didn’t want to get in trouble.On the night of our penultimate show, I got our security guy to go and tell Izzy that I needed a word with her. She thought she had done something wrong! But I just wanted to see her on her own. It was then we had our first kiss – at the St David’s Hotel in Cardiff. The tour wrapped the next night and she came back on the bus with the band. After that, she never left.Everyone fancied Danny and Dougie, so it wasn’t as if I was bombarded by fans all the time, but thankfully Izzy trusted me instinctively. I remember a couple of people around her saying: “Be careful.” But I was never that showbiz. We are a band who like home comforts and to keep it real.Tom Daley looks back: ‘My parents celebrated whoever I was – an Olympian diver or a boy who liked to wear tea towels’Read moreIzzy was different from anyone I’d ever met – I didn’t have to try to be anyone I wasn’t. But at first there was a bit of an imbalance between us. Izzy is two years older, plus she’s a girl – girls generally have it together more than men. She didn’t drink, which caused a few issues when it came to partying, and she struggled with separation anxiety, which would put some pressure on our relationship. If I was out, she would call asking, “When are you coming home?” and I’d be saying, “You’re so boring!”I had all this responsibility at such a young age – I was working all the time, I owned a property, I had a serious girlfriend, and most of my mates were still at uni having fun and being carefree. I wasn’t ready to settle yet. So, when I was 23, we broke up for six months. I had been dealing with anxiety myself, and in that time apart, I realised it was time to stop drinking. Mostly it just hit home that I couldn’t let this person go.Izzy is really caring. She brings me a cup of tea every morning. We have an unspoken set of jobs around the house, which is pretty much 50-50. I do the garden and bins, I cook and do the dishwasher. But she does more in terms of parenting, because the kids generally want Mummy. I couldn’t do what she does as a mother. She is so selfless.Often it’s 8.30pm before Izzy and I have had a chance to speak to each other, usually while lying in bed. From my experience of more than 10 years of marriage and having three children, I can see that things go wrong when people don’t adjust to the mundane realities of everyday life – the bills, mortgages, tantrums, food shops and school drop-offs. It also helps if you can have a sense of humour about it – Izzy and I are always laughing about the endless lunacy of being a parent.We had a reading from Captain Corelli’s Mandolin at our wedding. I always think about the line “Those that truly love, have roots that grow towards each other underground” – a sentiment that, 20 years in, has never been more true.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

So even though I had loads of lovely dresses with me, I threw on a black vest instead, not thinking it would be a big moment. After the proposal, we ate steak and dauphinoise potatoes, and I had non-alcoholic champagne. It was an out-of-body experience, but my expression is one of contentment.I’d come out of a long relationship when we met, and I’d lost my grandmother a few months before, so I was not in the headspace to fall in love. But … I really fancied him. He was more tactile than anybody I had been with, and we could just talk and talk. He was great with my family, too. My oldest brother, Rupert, was in a car crash when he was 18, and has a serious brain injury. I took Harry to meet him early on in our relationship – it meant a lot that he was able to be relaxed around Rupert. Sometimes those micro moments are more important than any grand gesture of romance.The first morning I stayed over at the McFly house, I woke to the sound of his tour manager banging on the door. That was Harry’s alarm. Everything was done for him, either by a tour manager or their lovely PA, Wendy – from cashing cheques to booking Valentine’s Day dinners. In spite of that, McFly are the nicest boys. Which has made the strange, inconsistent experience of being in a band easier for Harry. Especially as we definitely don’t have a Wendy to help any more!Having children has shaped our relationship completely. When we decided to start trying for a baby, we had a miscarriage, which was so difficult; we really grieved. After that, we ended up doing IVF – which was successful in the end, but also an incredibly lonely experience. A lot of those feelings of isolation are really similar to raising a neurodivergent child. But it’s also given us both so much perspective: we are constantly advocating for them, and staying focused on our intuition about what’s right for our family. I couldn’t have gone through what I’ve been through without Harry’s loyalty and support.Whenever we get a chance, Harry and I go for brunch and then see a matinee musical – we’re too knackered to do evenings! Even after all these years, I still find him as interesting as I did when we first met.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyMcFlyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 29 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTShareMariana, 54Our sexual relationship is intertwined with our love for each other. It’s our love languageAfter my divorce, I had a lot of wild oats to sow. I was interested in exploring the sexual side of myself that had been boxed up and put away during my marriage, the side that had been deprived for such a long time. One of the reasons I was so unhappy is that sex is a basic need and I just wasn’t having it.Perhaps both Owen and I needed the experience of being in an unfulfilling relationship in order to treasure and value each other the way we do, and to appreciate what it means to be in love. In those early days together we were definitely making up for lost time.There was a lot of excitement, but there was also guilt because he was still married. We didn’t consummate the relationship until he had separated from his wife, but still, I don’t want to cause harm to people. Our connection grew deep and we quickly realised we are very compatible sexually, not just intellectually and emotionally. Our sexual relationship is intertwined with our love for each other. It’s our love language.We used to be very experimental, but these days we’re happy with doggy, missionary and spooningOwen is the first person I’ve wanted to have sex with every day. Even when I’m tired or stressed, I still want to do it, which I had never experienced before.Eleven years later, things have calmed down a little bit. We were pretty risky in the beginning – we had sex in public places, in car parks and places like that. But the intensity of our sex has never waned.We often have a quickie – that’s just the nature of our life – and I always have an orgasm. Neither of us are expecting a one-hour lovemaking session. We like to do it every day, but occasionally we miss a day if we’re not feeling well. As I’ve reached my 50s my sleep patterns have shifted, and if he’s awake as well we’ll have sex in the middle of the night.You have to adapt. I’m at the beginning of menopause, so although I haven’t felt major changes yet, we have adapted by using more lube – which we call foreplay in a bottle.We used to be very experimental, but as our aches and pains increase with age, we really can’t be that adventurous. These days we’re happy with doggy, missionary and spooning.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Three times isn’t unusual. We figured out the value of a quickie pretty early on, and most of our sex is quick at this point.We might be tired or stressed, or not have a lot of time, but we still have that need. It’s no different from when you’re hungry and you grab a sandwich; every meal can’t be a gourmet experience, but you’ve still got to eat. We carry that same philosophy over to our sex life. Not every time we get together is going to be a memorable one for the ages, but you still have that hunger. I want to feel her hands on me, and she wants to feel my hands on her, and know we’re loved.I have always been a serial monogamist, but Mariana and I began as an affairAt one point we were curious about how much we were doing it, so we had a diary and wrote down what happened in the bedroom: date, time, what the circumstances were, and pretty intimate details like positions. That particular year, our third together, we had sex about 800 times. We don’t do that now, but we still probably have sex 400-500 times a year.I have always been a serial monogamist, but Mariana and I began as an affair. I had been married for 15 years and I wasn’t entirely happy. Like every other relationship I’d had, it started off sexy and passionate, but cooled to the point where sex just wasn’t a big deal. Mariana and I struck up a friendship, and our conversations started getting increasingly intimate. Before long, it was an affair. I left my wife a month later.At first it was like I was walking out of the desert and into this lush oasis, so I drank as much water as I could, afraid it might dry up. Mariana had been in an unfulfilling marriage before, so we both decided to live by the mantra: if you love someone, don’t you want to have sex with them every day?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itRelationshipsSexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The academically gifted Perales, who was eight years old at the time, argued that the rule excluding under-18s from democracy, which isenshrinedin the US constitution, amounted to age discrimination.Her case was thrown out, but it wasn’t the first time the voting age was challenged and it won’t be the last. The issue of whether the limit should be removed entirely has been raised periodically since at least the 19th century, and the ageless voting movement has been gaining momentum since political philosopher John Wall wrote amanifestofor it in 2021. More recently, children’s author and education researcher Clémentine Beauvais published a shorttractin her native France making the case for it.Both Wall and Beauvais report that a common first reaction to the concept of ageless voting is laughter. Then people start to think, and often they end up saying that they can’t find any serious objections.Wall first confronted the question 20 years ago, when he took on a PhD student who had been researchingchildren’s parliamentsin India. He soon came round to the idea that it was unjust that up to a third of the population was excluded from the democratic process, since political decisions affected them, too. As he became better informed, he realised that excluding the young was bad for society as a whole.Beauvais agrees. In her tract she highlights evidence that larger electorates produce better decisions. Younger people’s gaze is fixed further in the future than that of older people, for obvious reasons, but older people have more experience, so they complement each other when it comes to prioritising societal issues. And children are observant and can ask questions that are troubling because they are so fundamental: questions about war, meat, money, love and death, for instance. When Greta Thunberg started campaigning for urgent climate action at the age of 15, Beauvais writes, many adults criticised her, but her position is now mainstream.Children can also be silly and naive, of course. But if silliness and naivety were reasons to deprive people of the vote, many adults would come a cropper. In fact, although the human brain takes years to mature, it hasn’tcompletedthat process by 16, 18, or even – for some parts of the brain – the early 30s. And however you define competence to vote, you’ll find that it doesn’t start or stop cleanly at any age.This line of thought led Wall to conclude that the only criterion for eligibility to vote should be wanting to vote. Again, Beauvais agrees. But they disagree on the practical implications of this. Wall assumes that wanting to vote is the default and proposes that someone else should vote for the young person by proxy until they are able to do so themselves – as already happens for certain categories of adult in many countries, including the cognitively impaired. Most often, the proxy voter in the case of a very young person would be a parent.Beauvais considers proxies risky – what if a five-year-old changed her mind and her parents refused? – and also difficult to implement, for example in the case of divorced parents. She would rather societies accepted that, though a person would have the right to vote from birth, it would be some time before they exercised it. In that time – the length of which would depend on the individual – the right would be purely symbolic. It would still mean something, just as it means something that everyone in the UK has the right to marry a person of the same sex even if many of them will never exercise it.Acommon objection to ageless voting is that individuals who can’t be trusted to drink, drive or have sex shouldn’t be trusted to vote. But Harry Pearse, research director at the Centre for Deliberation, part of the UK’s National Centre for Social Research in London, says that’s ared herring. We don’t allow the very young to indulge in those behaviours because we want to protect them from the potentially harmful consequences, but voting isn’t harmful to the voter. It’s not as if we’re asking babies to make policy. They may vote badly, whatever that means, but again, so do many adults.Some countries, including Scotland, already allow 16-year-olds to vote, so data exists on16-year-olds’ voting habits. Five-year-olds are an unknown quantity, on the other hand, and Pearse thinks that’s a good thing: “Some healthy chaos gets chucked into the system.” For him, the beauty of democracy – for all its flaws – is its simplicity. When the rule is one-person-one-vote, politicians feel pressure to serve all constituencies.In practice, Beauvais says, because we know so little about how the very young would vote, the voting age would probably have to be lowered incrementally. That way society could address any vulnerabilities the new regime exposed – the risk of a charismatic teacher capturing large numbers of young votes for a given political cause, say – before advancing to the next stage. The goal would still be to abolish the age threshold completely.Many people feel that modern democracies have become calcified. In the past, when that happened, societies sought to expand the franchise, and in time, Pearse says, the expansion reinvigorated democratic life. At this point in history, the only way we can expand, short of violating the species barrier, is downwards in age. Beauvais sees that as much more than a political project. It invites us to stop thinking about participation in terms of competence or productivity, she says, and to focus more on our lived experience and interdependence. It’s about what it means to be an individual in society. In her view, we should all want Alisa Perales to vote – and not just for her sake.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Will she win the fight to get Zammi back?Miranda Bryantin ThistedSun 29 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShare‘Now your two hours begin.” The countdown started when Keira Alexandra Kronvold had just given birth in the early hours of 7 November 2024. Keira, 38, was originally granted just one hour with her daughter, Zammi, before her baby was to be removed from her and taken to foster parents – but the midwife begged authorities to give them more time. Before Zammi’s arrival, the midwife asked if Keira had any wishes. “I said, ‘I want hand and footprints. I want to grab her, I don’t want you to catch her when she is born. I want to catch her myself.’”During labour – which lasted just an hour and a half – Keira kept checking whether her 20-year-old daughter, Zoe, who had never seen a birth before, was OK; and she was determined not to scream, to avoid waking up the other mothers and babies on the ward. But when Zammi arrived, everything else – the months of stress, worry and pressure – gave way to pure joy. “I just laid back,” she says, arms cradled and slowly reclining on her sofa, as she re-enacts the moment at home in the town of Thisted, northernDenmark, “because I had to keep her warm. She was so beautiful. That emotional feeling is indescribable. Right there: unconditional love, pure happiness, all that joy.” She wished Zammi a happy birthday and told her how much she loved her. She cried tears of joy, counted Zammi’s tiny fingers.And then the mood shifted. “It feels like you come into the darkness,” says Keira, her body frozen. “Now I have to count the minutes. That pure joy was gone. And that moment I felt I could show my emotions.” She started to breastfeed Zammi. Even letting go for the midwife to do her checks was torturous.View image in fullscreenA photograph of Zammi sits in the cradle that Keira had prepared for herAn hour passed. She was told she needed to start preparing to hand her daughter over. Keira talks about the contents of the bag she had prepared for Zammi. Seven months on, Keira can still see all the objects before her: bottle, dummy, warm clothes, blanket, shampoo, lotion. “I gave her a diaper, I put her clothes on,” says Keira, “and the woman came in.” She cries as she remembers. “I had to make sure my tears didn’t fall on my daughter’s face. Zoe held her for a couple of minutes. I remember every small detail about her.”Zammi had a tiny nose, says Keira with a laugh, and she remembers her facial expressions. She had black hair and blue eyes when she was born. Her hands, says Keira, were like Zoe’s, and her feet were definitely those of Zammi’s father. She had a heart-shaped birthmark where her chest meets her neck and another birthmark on the inside of her little finger. When she made noises, Keira was overcome by the beauty of her voice. “There was a huge connection,” she says. “When she looked at me while breastfeeding and she closed her eyes, she felt so safe.”A woman came to collect the baby from hospital. After handing over the bag, Keira kissed Zammi. “I made a promise that I was going to fight for her,” she says. “I promised her I would send her flowers every week. I promised her that she will come home soon.” After Zammi was taken away, Keira lay on the bed for a long time crying, her body shaking while the midwife gave her stitches. The midwife invited Keira to stay the night in hospital, but she couldn’t bear to. So she went home alone, with just a box containing her placenta, congratulations messages pouring in from well-wishers, who did not know Keira would be forced to part from her baby so quickly,while at the opposite end of town Zammi, still just hours old, met her foster parents for the first time.Keira is one of countless Greenlandic women in Denmark who have been separated from their children after undergoing highly controversial “parenting competency” tests (known asforældrekompetenceundersøgelseor FKU) used by social services to assess whether parents are suitable to care for their children. In common with many of these cases, Zammi was placed with Danish foster parents. Keira fears Zammi will lose her language and identity as a result. For years, parenting competency tests have been criticised by campaigners and human rights bodies that say they are culturally unsuitable for people from Inuit backgrounds, and therefore discriminatory.Generally, the tests are used if a child is believed to be struggling with challenges in behaviour, feelings or thoughts – and will form one part of a social worker’s investigations, says clinical psychologist Isak C Nellemann, who used to perform FKU for the Danish state, and now helps advise families and lawyers in cases like Keira’s. But, often, he says, simply being Greenlandic will be enough to get the attention of social workers.The tests cover attachment, personality traits, cognitive abilities and psychopathology, and take about 15-20 hours. It is almost impossible to pass them, says Nellemann; even he and his colleagues have failed to do so. Questions can include “What is glass made of?” and “What is the name of the big staircase in Rome?” Nellemann argues that the tests are culturally specific and a poor way to measure innate intelligence. “There is a lot of stigmatisation of people from Greenland,” he says. “We don’t know why we should use these tests for parenting.”When Keira was given the test, for Zammi, she says she was told it was to see if she was ‘civilised enough’He even goes so far as to compare the tests to a tool of fascism. “You take only one kind of people as the ‘real’ ones. We only choose the white, or ‘real’, Danish people.”Children with Greenlandic parents living in Denmark are significantly more likely to be placed into care than those with Danish parents. A2022 report found that 5.6% were removed compared with 1% of those with a Danish background. Louise Holck, the director of the Danish Institute for Human Rights, has said the FKU tests “fail to account for potential language barriers or cultural differences”.‘I was only a child’: Greenlandic women tell of trauma of forced contraceptionRead moreUntil 1953, Greenland was ruled by Denmark as a colony. Now the territory is part of the Danish kingdom, with Copenhagen controlling its foreign and security policy. In recent years, there have been multiple scandals about historic and more recent population-control practices that have been described by many in Greenland, including the former prime minister, as a genocide. These include theIUD scandal, in which 4,500 women and girls were fitted with contraception without their knowledge or consent between 1966 and 1970. Many of the details have only recently come to light.Keira, who has three children, all of whom have been removed from her, was subjected to an FKU test in 2014 that is understood to have contributed to the removal of Zoe, who was then nine, and Keira’s son, Nolan, who was just eight months old and breastfeeding; he is now 11. Nolan, whom Keira sees twice a week, now lives with his father. Keira was given another test last year that contributed to the removal of Zammi. When she was given the most recent test, she says she was told it was to see if she was “civilised enough”. The two assessments, 10 years apart, were made by the same Danish-speaking psychologist, who was also Keira’s therapist. Keira’s first language is Kalaallisut (West Greenlandic). She is not fluent in Danish.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Keira’s daughter, Zoe, who was taken from her mother aged nine, pictured with a drawing of one of her hallucinations.Keira’s lawyer, Jeanette Gjørret, who specialises in children’s rights, says there were “many errors in the case, including in the psychological tests”. She did not have a translator for either test, and the case for Zammi’s removal rested heavily on the cases of her first two children, in which there were also errors. “The decision was taken before Zammi was born, and Keira was not given the opportunity to live in supported accommodation in order to keep her baby, which she would have been prepared to do if necessary. In Keira’s case, the removal of all three of her children has been largely down to the viewpoint of one person,” Gjørret adds. She did not have legal representation or advice while the assessments were made.The 2024 FKU assessment, conducted just over a month before Zammi was born, concluded that although “Keira sincerely wants to bring her little daughter home” and “the child is growing and thriving [in the womb]”, Keira’s personality had “not developed sufficiently” and that “difficulties may arise regarding linguistic and cognitive stimulation of the young child”.It added: “Keira states that it is common in Greenlandic culture that even small facial features have communicative significance … but Zammi will grow up in Denmark and will be dependent on being able to read the social contexts she will be involved in – and therefore needs to learn this in order to be able to cope in social relationships with peers.” To have her baby returned to her, she would have to work on multiple areas and “show development” – including “expressing herself in Danish”, becoming “more nuanced in her approach to herself and her surroundings” and being “able to express herself with clearer facial expressions”.As soon as I see her bed I crumble. It’s like I’m living by my willView image in fullscreenZammi’s empty cot.Although Danish authorities consider Zammi’s removal to be legal because a court has issued a judgment in the case, Gjørret does not agree. “It is my assessment that Zammi should not have been placed with foster parents,” she says.Having unsuccessfully fought the case in Holstebro court of appeal in April, they have applied to take it to the high court, which, if successful, could have far-reaching consequences for Greenlandic victims of the tests. She has requested that the high court overturn the decision “in its entirety” on the basis of the Institute for Human Rights’ findings and a new law, which came into force in May, banning the use of FKU on Greenlandic people. She is still waiting for a decision.Despite the ban, parenting competency tests are still being used by municipalities as evidence against Greenlandic parents at the National Social Appeals Board, Gjørret says. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Housing denies this, saying that “Since May 1, 2025, the National Social Appeals Board has not used standardised psychological tests for decisions on placement of a child from a Greenlandic family in care outside the home.”Things could be about to change. Laila Bertelsen, the founder of Foreningen Mapi, an association that helps Inuit parents in Denmark, says she is aware of one mother whose separation from her children has been reversed since the change of law. Often, she says, cultural differences – language, family life and upbringing – are misinterpreted by Danish studies and professional assessments. “This means that the children are not only removed physically, but also cut free from their cultural roots and identity.” Forced removal at birth should only be done in “extremely urgent situations, where there is a documented danger”, she says. In all other cases, families should instead be given support, attachment and togetherness. “Not only for the child’s safety, but for the child’s self-understanding and identity formation.”You can feel the empty cot in Keira’s apartment before you see it. An absence radiates from the unoccupied bassinet, lovingly draped with sheer fabric. A bee and a dragonfly hang down from a mobile. Next to it, a little car seat and a baby bouncer lie in wait.Then you see the tiny nappies, lined up on the changing station alongside a fresh bottle of baby lotion and cotton wool. On the windowsill lies a worn copy of the Danish attachment parenting bookDenBedsteStart påLivet(The Best Start to Life). But perhaps it is the cupboard full of newborn clothes folded in neat piles that most bluntly reveals that no baby has ever lived there.For seven months, Keira’s home in Thisted, a market town on the Limfjorden strait in the north-west corner of Denmark, has waited for Zammi to come home. Keira is allowed to visit her youngest daughter once a week for exactly one hour on a Friday morning. Zoe and Nolan are only allowed to see their baby sister once a month. Keira, who works in a fish factory, spends the week counting down to Friday at 10.30am.She struggles to sleep and finds it difficult to eat. “I ask many people, ‘Please pray for my daughter or I can’t sleep.’ Nights can befor ever. I count days.” She pauses. “In the beginning, I counted hours.”When she first went back to work, 10 weeks after Zammi was born, she was still struggling to stand for long periods, and at times had to hide in the toilet to cry. She has spent the last decade fighting to be reunited with her older children, and now Zammi, and yet she finds the strength to keep going. “It’s like I’m living by my will,” she says. She tries to stay positive by working on strategies to get her baby back, and is recording her experiences for a book. “I am thinking, ‘What is the next step? What should I do?’ But as soon as I see her bed, I crumble.”View image in fullscreenKeira and Zoe at home in Thisted.Keira separated from Zammi’s father, who is Danish, when she was four months pregnant, but says he remains an active part of hers and Zammi’s lives. He has not spoken out publicly. “He loves his daughter,” she says. “But he is scared that the world will judge him.” She believes her former partner fears the shame, mental toll and pressure of becoming a public figure would be too much.Keira first spoke out on the night she came home from hospital. Unable to handle all the questions about what was going on, she decided to explain her situation on Facebook. She didn’t look at it for a couple of days, but when she did, her video had gone viral. She had hundreds of messages from people expressing sympathy and giving their condolences. “I was so touched by it,” she says. “I thought, ‘People are hearing my voice.’ That’s what gave me motivation to fight back.” While Keira’s case is one of many, the vast majority of people who have their children taken away do not have the strength to go public.Protests over Keira’s case took place in Copenhagen and Nuuk,and with Danish-Greenlandic relations under a global spotlight afterDonald Trump’s threats to take control of the territory, the campaign started to get political traction. Keira attended one of the demonstrations 32 days after giving birth, when she was still bleeding and struggling with milk production. In January, the FKU testing ban was announced by the Danish government. How did Keira find the courage to speak out? “I say to myself, if I don’t do it, nobody will. I don’t care if somebody judges me. I know if I change something now, I will change something for Zammi.”Keira grew up in Qeqertaq, a small village in western Greenland, with her mother, who has recently died, and father, who has retired after many years as the director of a fish factory. She is still close to him and most of her five siblings, who are “heartbroken” about her separation from Zammi. Keira has happy childhood memories of driving the dog sleigh and hunting with her father. Every year, the family would spend three months living in nature. She gave birth to Zoe in Greenland and later moved to Denmark with a plan to study massage therapy.For Zoe, who sits quietly in Keira’s living room as we talk, nothing can turn back the clock. After being removed from her mother at nine, she spent the rest of her childhood with a foster family and in children’s homes, and says she was the victim of emotional abuse. But she is determined to get justice for her sister, who she hopes will be reunited with their mother before her first birthday. During the court hearing in April, she stood outside in silent protest with banners she had made from fabric, reading: “Please bring my little sister back home” and “FKU is only for Danish citizens”.Speaking softly, she says that before she was forced to live with a foster family, she enjoyed school and was especially good at speaking English, maths and playing chess. She hated getting up early in the morning and fondly remembers her mother, who is a morning person, plaiting her hair while she was still asleep.Keira says social services suddenly began visiting after Zoe had started school, saying they wanted to check whether she was taking good enough care of her children. But what they really meant, she says, is “you have to do it inourway. Notyourway.” Among the problems they had with doing things Keira’s way was that they spoke Greenlandic at home rather than Danish.View image in fullscreenKeira on her way to visit Zammi. She is allowed to see her for one hour every FridayHaving grown up in a village where she says “everybody was a family member”, the state intervention she was subjected to in Denmark was alien and disconcerting. She was being regularly observed at home – including while making dinner, breastfeeding, taking a walk. If she spoke to her children in Greenlandic, she had to translate it to Danish for the social worker. What they deemed “mistakes” started to pile up, and they would bring them up months later. These, she says, could be anything from the way she spoke to Zoe at dinner to her not wanting her daughter to walk home alone from school when she was eight years old. “Nice and quiet, collecting your mistakes,” says Keira. “It was frightening, scary. I was always nervous. I always felt pressure.”Zoe, who was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, started experiencing hallucinations when she was with her foster family. At one point, Keira says softly, her daughter was suicidal. Zoe shows me some recent drawings of the faces that she sees. One of the figures represents a person who was responsible for looking after her when she was removed from her mother.When Keira became pregnant with Zammi, she decided to inform Thisted municipality in the hope of working together to ensure she could keep her once she was born. She was nervous going to the doctor, because she says she had previously been given the ultimatum either to have an abortion or face the baby being taken away after the birth. She agreed to undergo another parenting competency test in an attempt to cooperate. But in the session, the psychologist brought up her previous abortions and asked her to show her parenting skills by playing, singing and talking with a doll, checking whether she made eye contact. “The problem is, I didn’t grow up with a doll,” she says, adding that her real baby, Zammi, was busy kicking in her stomach. “They made me draw and they were criticising it, that I didn’t draw a face. I drew a mum and baby.”She first heard the municipality was planning to remove Zammi from her during her eight-month scan. One minute she was talking to her, laughing, watching her kick. The next, she says, the doctor or nurse told her: “Well, it looks like they chose to take the baby.” She was incredulous. “It felt like the whole world was crashing down. I thought, should I travel to another country? I don’t have any money.” When she called the municipality, she says they claimed ignorance, but it later turned out to be true.View image in fullscreenA photograph of Keira and Zammi taken during one of Keira’s weekly visitsAccording to observation notes of Zammi, shared with me by Keira, her daughter has shown signs of upset after her mother’s visits. “After the interaction was over, she became very distant,” says an observation from February. “She showed no interest in interacting with foster parents or toys.”Lars Sloth, director of Thisted’s child and family administration, declined to comment on Keira’s case directly, citing a duty of confidentiality. But he acknowleged that in general the change in the law meant that Greenlandic cases should be reprocessed without the use of FKU. Gjørret says there is no reason why Keira cannot take care of Zammi, describing her as “very strong and independent”. Despite all that she has been through with her children, she says she continues to fight for them, holds down a job, and does not drink or take drugs. “I cannot find any reason why she cannot be a mother.”A spokesperson for the Danish ministry of social affairs and housing said that the decision to place a child or young person in care outside the home is made by the municipal council, and that any placements made before the change in the law could be appealed.“Municipalities are no longer allowed to use standardised psychological tests as part of the child protection examination when making decisions about placing a child from a Greenlandic family in out-of-home-care. Instead, municipalities must use a special unit possessing expertise in Greenlandic language and culture affairs, unless the family does not consent to the use of the special unit.“The municipal council is also obligated to request that the specialised unit review all ongoing placements where standardised psychological tests have been used or must be assumed to have been used in connection with decisions about placing a child from a Greenlandic family.”On Friday morning, I walk through Keira’s open front door as rain falls in torrents outside, to find her sitting in her living room under soft fairy lights and the silently flickering television, arranging flowers. Every week she takes a different arrangement to Zammi so that she will associate them with her mother’s visits. This ceremonial act of devotion is part of how Keira survives.She ties up her long dark hair and prepares to leave. Carrying an umbrella, she walks, almost in procession, through the town to see Zammi. When she reaches the suburban street where Zammi’s foster parents live – low-rise houses, neatly trimmed hedges, flagpoles in the front gardens – we part ways; she is not allowed to take visitors.On her return, just over an hour later, Keira is upset that Zammi wasn’t wearing enough clothes and seemed cold, but she also appears to be nourished from spending time with her daughter. We sit in the car as she shows me pictures and videos. Zammi had done her special hello, where she put her hands on Keira’s cheeks, and she is at the stage where she loves looking at mirrors. In a video, Keira coos to Zammi in Greenlandic: “Hi little baby. Such a cute little baby. My little darling.” Time goes so fast when they are together. Sometimes she forgets to take pictures.While she is there, she thinks only of Zammi. Her own feelings can wait till she gets home. It is always hard. Before she gets out of the car, she puts into words the pressure she is under. “It feels like somebody holding your throat. And they decide how much you can breathe.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyDenmarkGreenlandEuropeIndigenous peoplesHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The only catch is you have to keep this on the quiet to maintain the illusion that performances are packed with paying punters.2Want to read the New Yorker article everyone’s talking about, but don’t have a subscription? You can do so for nothing with many library memberships andthe Libby app, which gives access to pretty much every magazine you can think of, with no loan limits. Libby and a similar app,BorrowBox, also lend thousands of ebooks and audiobooks; read or listen on your phone, iPad, Kindle or laptop.3An underutilised benefit of Amazon Prime is Prime Reading: hundreds of free Kindle books and audiobooks are included, as are magazines such as Grazia and Radio Times.4Bagging tickets for concerts and festivals has never been more competitive. Tools such asVisualpingalert you as soon as a webpage has changed – so you can be first in the queue when seats are released. It’s also handy for securing a table at hot restaurants, knowing when a sought-after pair of trainers is back in stock, or alerting yourself to events such as the Eurostar flash sale.5Don’t let theatres fool you into thinking restricted view seats are a false economy. For instance, the end-aisle seats for Hamilton in London’s West End are consistently rated five stars by users of the siteSeatPlan, who report that, as Hamilton is primarily performed at the centre of the stage, you won’t miss any key plot points or songs. SeatPlan collates hundreds of thousands of seat-view photos, so you can check the vantage point before you buy.View image in fullscreen6You should rarely be paying full price for the latest blockbuster either. Sky Cinema customers get free Vue tickets, Amazon Prime members get discounted Odeon tickets, Tesco Clubcard holders can spend their points at Cineworld, and Lidl Plus members get membership of the Cinema Society, with 40% off many screenings. Buy your insurance throughcomparethemarket.comand Meerkat Movies gives you two-for-one on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at a range of cinemas, including Picturehouse.7“JustWatchis a brilliant tool that shows the different places you can stream shows and films, and how much they might cost you,” says Francesca Steele, culture critic and writer of theTrash Culture newsletter. “For example, you might assume you can only watch the latest season of The Last of Us if you have a Sky subscription. But the JustWatch site shows that you could also sign up to a free seven-day trial on Now, or buy the series on Apple TV.”8TheDice applists cultural events in cities across the UK, which you can sort by price. It’s a quick way to discover free or affordable gigs, live comedy, podcast recordings or new art exhibitions.Eating out9Work out when the hardest-to-book restaurants open their reservations and set an alarm (or use an AI monitoring tool). For example, Gymkhana in London’s Mayfair releases tables at 6am two months in advance; for Tom Kerridge’s The Hand and Flowers in Marlow, it’s six months to the date you’d like to book. Sign up to restaurants’ email lists too: some offer early access to loyal fans. L’Enclume, Simon Rogan’s three-Michelin-star restaurant in Cartmel, Cumbria, sends priority booking invitations and cancellations via its newsletter.10Follow chefs, restaurants or front of house on social media to hear about last-minute tables. Oisín Rogers, landlord of the much-hyped and usually booked-solid Devonshire pub in Soho, London, has been known to announce cancellations on his Instagram Stories.11Sushi chains Itsu and Wasabi sell off whatever is left from the day at 50% off 30 minutes before closing.View image in fullscreen12Before you book a restaurant, check for money-off vouchers on the new breed of restaurant discount apps, says Amelia Murray, money expert atbecleverwithyourcash.com. “There are a few to choose from, includingTheFork, which is free and offers discounts of up to 50% off your meal, plus you can earn points every time you use it, which can be redeemed against future bookings.” Or tryEatClub, co-founded by Marco Pierre White, “as a way for restaurants to optimise spare capacity and generate predictable revenue”; it has just launched in London and offers discounts of up to 50% off your bill.13Get wise to “menu engineering”. This is a whole area of expertise that helps restaurateurs boost their profits, and it pays not to be taken in by the tricks. “The top-right corner of a menu is prime real estate,” says Ben Floyd, a chef and the managing director of Lumière Consultancy. “That’s where your eyes tend to land first, so you’ll often find the most profitable dish there. You’ll rarely see pound signs any more – they remind people they’re spending money. And often there’ll be a ‘decoy’ dish – something expensive to make the rest of the menu seem more reasonably priced.”Travel14Before booking any element of your holiday via a third-party site, have a look at what you could get by going direct. On flights, online travel agents often charge more for seats or bags than the airline itself. As for hotels, Zanna van Dijk, a travel and fitness content creator, always books direct: “You often get better rates, they might throw in breakfast and you’ll have a higher chance of an upgrade on arrival.”15Speaking of upgrades, if it’s a significant event – a milestone birthday, say, or a honeymoon, or if you just want to try your luck – email your hotel at the time of booking to say why you’re looking forward to your stay and ask for an upgrade. If you don’t ask, you probably won’t get.16The same hotel room may be significantly cheaper booked on a mobile phone rather than a laptop, but you’ll be none the wiser unless you check. Sites such asBooking.comoffer mobile-only deals; some hotels will give bigger discounts if you download their app or join their mailing list.View image in fullscreen17That’s not to say that boutique travel agents don’t earn their commission, especially if you’re travelling with kids. Francesca Collinson of Tiny Travelship, a family-focused travel agency and hotel directory, says, “We have the insider intel on when luxury hotels have sales running, when the best time of year to book flights is – 11 months in advance. We can unlock free transfers, free creche sessions, or complimentary upgrades to room and board.”18Hiring a car for a foreign trip? Go to the destination country’s website. Research from Which? found that, in the US for example, booking the same car throughHertz’s site thererather thanhertz.co.ukcut the cost by £347. In general, just replace the end of the url with the relevant country’s top-level domain.19A local bus can be a cheap way to see the tourist sites. Lonely Planet rates the 101 that runs along the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, Australia, towards the scenic rock stacks making up the Twelve Apostles. I rate the number 7, down the hill from the Tuscan hilltop city of Fiesole into Florence, Italy, which costs less than €2.20Before you travel overseas, open a Monzo or Starling bank account if you don’t already have one. You can do it with a quick selfie video and a picture of your passport, and you’ll get a card in the post within a week, which you can use for all holiday spending, free of currency conversion charges.21Luton airport lets you skip queues, without any cost, byprebooking security. But don’t automatically pay in advance for fast-track access at all other airports: for example, Manchester and Stansted will let you buy it on the day.Shopping22When buying any item online, try adding it to your basket then sleeping on it before you hit pay. Not only is this the best way to reel yourself back from a late-night emotional spending binge, but you will very likely wake up to a discount code in your email inbox from the retailer who wants you to complete the purchase.23Add the Honey tool (powered by PayPal) to your browser, such as Safari, and it will alert you when you visit a website where you can use a discount code or get cashback on your purchase.Coupert, an AI-powered shopping assistant available on Google Chrome, automatically tracks prices of products and tells users when discounts are available.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Are there any hidden benefits I can use here, such as double-points days, referral bonuses or rewards?” advises Harriet Meyer, consumer journalist and creator of AI for media. “I found I had £50 worth of Nectar points I didn’t know I was entitled to. Or try, ‘I’m buying XX. What’s the best combination of cashback sites and discount codes to maximise savings?’” You could also upload an image of your supermarket shop and ask how you can save money on your food bills.25Supermarkets have taken the obvious expiry dates off fruit and veg to reduce food waste. But if you’re buying food and you would like it to last for as long as possible, you can hack their codes.According to Which?, at Asda and Tesco, look for a letter followed by a number: “A” is January, “B” is February, “C” is March, while the number is the day of the month. For example, the best-before date of an item with the code “I27” is 27 September. Sainsbury’s codes begin with “J” and end with “S”, standing for J Sainsbury, and contain the date in the middle. So the best-before date of an item with the code “J0910S” is 9 October.26As former operations director with butchers The Ginger Pig, Lynsey Coughlan recommends buying meat on the bone, which is always cheaper, to save money when cooking at home. “If you buy chicken breasts, you’re more or less paying for the whole bird, and you can use the carcass for soup and the thighs for curry. The same goes for any kind of meat. Ask your butcher to bone it out, and keep the bones for stock.” Sausages can be a cheaper substitute for mince. “With Italian sausage, you’ve already got the perfect fat balance, you’ve got all the seasoning to make a proper ragu and it’s a time saver, too.”27The packaging for many household products seems designed to make it impossible to use every last drop. That’s why everyone needs a tube-squeezer key (for toothpaste, moisturiser, puree;try Lakeland) and a foam pump bottle, which reduces liquid soap use by turning it into foam (try Muji).View image in fullscreen28If you take at least five empties to be recycled at Boots – these have to be packaging you can’t recycle at home, such as mixed metal and plastics, or old mascara wands – then spend £10, you’ll receive 500 Advantage Card points (worth £5).29Price tags are not set in stone. The thought may make you shudder, but you can haggle at many high-street shops. Martin Lewis reports that a member of staff at a big DIY store told him that if anyone asked for a discount, they would automatically give them 10% off. Of those who dared to try, 57% of people got a discount at B&Q, 49% at Currys and 38% at Waitrose,according to a surveya few years ago by Money Saving Expert.30Monitor Vinted or eBay when there’s a popular beauty subscription box or Advent calendar on sale. You can pick up a bargain when people resell unopened makeup or perfume that doesn’t suit them. Last year that included dozens of Le Labo Rose rollerball perfumes, from Liberty’s Beauty Advent calendar, for £20 or so (they’re £78 new).31Shops discard skincare, hair care or makeup products when external packaging is damaged or opened, even if the product is untouched. Sites such asThis is BeautyandBoopbuy them up and sell them on, often at a 70% discount, to avoid landfill. The product is quality-checked and it’s made clear what is wrong.Household bills32It’s frustrating that with some bills – water and council tax, for example – it’s impossible to shop around. Martyn James, a consumer-rights expert, says there is one way to ease the pain of your council tax payments, “and it’s so simple, you’ll kick yourself. Almost all of the local authorities in the UK will bill you over 10 months, so you get February and March for free each year. But you can ask your council to spread the payments over 12 months instead. If you’re paying £1,800 a year, then over 10 months you pay £180 per month. But over 12, you pay £150.” When it comes to water, if you have the same number or more rooms than people living in your house, a meter will most probably save you money. This is because you’re being charged for the actual water used rather than an estimate based on the rateable value of your property. Look on your water company’s website for water-saving gadgets; some are free. A tap aerator can reduce water consumption by up to 50%.View image in fullscreen33Before paying for software – or signing up for trials you might forget to cancel – look for the open-source alternative.Gimpis the free rival to Adobe Photoshop;Audacitylets you record, edit and manipulate audio files; andKeePassis a free, open-source password manager.34The best deals on mobile contracts are available from smaller companies that use the same infrastructure as the big four, such as Lebara (on Vodafone), or 1p Mobile (EE). Both score higher inWhich? customer satisfaction ratings, too. You’ll feel extra smug on holiday: while three of the big four now have roaming charges in the EU on their standard packages, many of these small companies don’t.35University libraries are peaceful but vibrant co-working spaces, at a fraction of the cost of a WeWork. The University of Manchester, for instance,offers annual community membershipfor free, with access to its 2,000 study spaces and guest wifi, and it’s open into the evening. Members of the public can get reference access to UCL libraries from £7 a day, £30 a month or £200 a year – less than the cost of just one month at many private co-working offices – giving access to study space across all campuses in London, including Senate House, as well as the subsidised student canteen.36Buy discounted gift cards online, or through cashback websites such asTopCashback. You can then use them to pay for your normal shopping, services such as Spotify and Uber, food prep services like HelloFresh, and most supermarkets and chain coffee shops. It’s a faff, but will work out a little cheaper as long as you don’t forget to spend them.Can food co-ops really cut grocery bills by 40%? I set one up with neighbours to find outRead more37Comparison sites are constantly competing for business, so they offer generous freebies. “I got a £20 Sainsbury’s voucher and a monthly free coffee at Greggs when I bought car insurance viaconfused.com,” says Clare Seal, a financial coach and presenter of the podcastHelp Me, I’m Poor. She also ratesthe app Sprive, which lets you overpay your mortgage using cashback from everyday spending, “potentially knocking years off your term”.38Don’t pay for mobile data you don’t need. Switching on low data mode on your phone saves battery life, but also bills, if you have a low-data package, by reducing how much you’re using. Adjusting your app settings to lower the default video quality and turning off auto-play on social media helps, too.39Got a parking ticket? If a car park operator is not a member of the British Parking Association (BPA) or the International Parking Community (IPC) and they leave a ticket on your car, they can’t access your details from the DVLA. Citizens Advice says you can choose to do nothing, if it’s a private parking firm, as it’s a civil rather than a criminal matter.Personal finance40The best interest rates on savings often fall away after a year and providers bank on their customers not having time to shop around. By signing up to a platform such asRaisin UKyou can easily move your money between different accounts when rates fall or rise, without having to fill out new application forms each time.41If you open a bank account with a subscription fee jointly with a partner, you can both take advantage of add-ons, such as mobile phone and travel insurance, for no extra monthly cost.42Check if you can access financial advice through your employee benefit scheme for the whole family. One money coach says that she offers the opportunity for employees to bring a partner to one-on-one coaching sessions, free – though hardly anyone takes her up on it.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleSaving moneyShops and shoppingTelevisionRestaurantsHousehold billsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What will probably be absent at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, however, is any mention of tennis’s upstart cousin, padel.Unlike Roland Garros in Paris, which set aside a court for this cross between tennis and squash, there is no planned promotion of padel in SW19, something which may seem curious given that the racket sport is one of thefastest growingin the world.But then again, tennis has not exactly embraced the newcomer. Take the grumblings of seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic, for example, who has voiced fears thatclub tennis is “endangered”by venues converting tennis courts into smaller padel, or pickleball, courts, because it’s more economical.Easier than tennis, with no overarm serve required, and fans including Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the UK has seen a trebling of people playing over the last year, with 400,000 taking to about 893 courts across 300 venues. Eight million Britons expressed a desire to try it, according to a recent survey by theLTA (Lawn Tennis Association).View image in fullscreenSeven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic is not a fan of padel.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAPadel organisers are hoping Wimbledon will see an even greater boom, as those inspired by the tennis but too intimidated to try, pick up aperforated padel racketinstead. In anticipation, Plymouth city council has a pop-up court next to its big screen showing Wimbledon. Londoners can head to Tower Hill, where pop-up padel runs until October. At St Paul’s Cathedral, padel courts open from 4 August. So why can’t the two sports get along?Fears that padel’s popularity is to the detriment of tennis were highlighted with news this week that the indoor courts at the Olympic tennis centre are be replaced by padel. It had, the Times reported, prompted backlash from “extremely livid” users and wheelchair tennis players.The Lee Valley Hockey andTennisCentre in east London said the conversions were to “grow participation across all ages”, but within two days 650 people had signed a petition calling for a reversal of the decision, a decision that was labelled “disappointing” by the LTA, the national governing body for both sports in the UK.Padel, usually played in doubles, was invented in Mexico in the 1960s, and requires a walled court 25% smaller than tennis. Tennis, though, remains the bigger sport. About 9.5 million people in the UK played tennis at least once last year, with roughly 2.6 million adults and 1.6 million children playing it monthly. Compared to the 150,000 said to play it monthly, padel has a way to go.Both sports are seeing “significant growth”, said Olly Scadgell, the LTA’s managing director of tennis and padel development. “Padel is smaller, but growing quickly.”Despite Djokovic’s doom mongering, most tennis clubs are investing in padel where they have spare land, underutilised tennis courts or courts that require refurbishment, he said. “What we’re not seeing is padel cannibalising tennis participation.” The new audience was good for tennis clubs, said Scadgell.What the LTA is keen to avoid is the conversion of indoor tennis courts, of which there is a lack in the UK, five times fewer than in France. It is aware that the financial returns padel can drive means a number of facilities may be considering this, and “we’re having open dialogue about what the options might be for them”. It is working with local authorities to find the most appropriate spaces for padel.The LTA wants to “grow padel in a controlled way” to avoid a wild west scenario, and not to repeat Sweden’s example “where the growth of padel was exponential, with too many padel facilities built too closely together, and what you’re seeing now is a number of them closing,” said Scadgell.Mark Hewlett, chief executive atSoul Padel,which builds and operates padel centres and venues, believes “evolution, not revolution” is required. By integrating padel, tennis clubs can diversify revenue stream and widen their demographic, with no jeopardy to tennis.“I think tennis and padel can live as mutual bedfellows.”View image in fullscreenAndy Murray is one of several former tennis players who enjoys padel.Photograph: Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock“Padel is like the cool, surfy, skateboarding version of tennis. You haven’t got that elitism, exclusive feel to padel.” He added: “You don’t feel intimidated walking into a padel club, whereas you can in certain tennis clubs.”“In Italy and Spain, where padel is probably most popular, you’ve got the world’s two best tennis players, in [Jannick] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz. So there’s something going very right fortennis and padel in those two countries. I don’t think one needs to exist to the detriment of the other.”Neil Percival, director ofUK Padel,the largest provider of padel tournaments in the UK and which owns several clubs, believes organisations and venues will use Wimbledon “to showcase padel as a fun form of tennis”.“Most people still haven’t tried padel. Now they are at a point where they are thinking about trying it,” he said.“What padel will do for tennis, it will allow people who have never been interested in tennis to play padel, a form of tennis. That is already happening. If it attracts people to tennis clubs as well, that’s an enormously positive thing for the overall game of tennis.”Explore more on these topicsTennisFitnessWimbledonWimbledon 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

Thinking of my toddler and what might happen if I caught coronavirus and was treated under the then Nice guidelines “frailty” score was too much. I sobbed deeply. After 10 years of austerity, I knew then that disabled people would pay an enormous price for the pandemic thanks to the government’s handling of it. Disabled people did: almost 60% of Covid-related deaths involved disabled people in that first wave.I vowed then that I would do all I could to use my skills and experiences of 20 years working in disability law and policy to deliver a country that treats disabled people with dignity and respect. Five years later, I am one of the only visibly physically disabled members of parliament. I was proudto be elected last yearas the first person to have grown up in my constituency to go on to represent it in parliament for more than a century. I am proud, too, that Labour’s manifesto committed to championing the rights of disabled people, and to the principle of working with disabled people to ensure our views and voices are at the heart of all we do.Consequently, since April, I have been engaging relentlessly with government, at the very highest level, to change its proposals as set out in the universal credit and personal independence payment bill. I made it clear from the start I could not support the proposals on personal independence payments (Pip). Pip is an in-work benefit, designed to ensure disabled people can live independently.There are 4 million disabled people in poverty in the UK. As a matter of conscience, I could not support measures that would push250,000 disabled people, including 50,000 children, into poverty. Nor could I accept proposals that used a points system, under current descriptors, that would exclude eligibility for those who cannot put on their underwear, prosthetic limbs or shoes without support.The concessions now announced are significant, including that all recipients of Pip who currently receive it will continue to do so. I know this will be an enormous relief for many of my nearly 6,000 constituents in receipt of Pip and for disabled people across the country.However, I will continue working, as I have done from the beginning, to look at these concessions carefully against the evidence on the impact upon disabled people, including my constituents, and disabled people’s organisations.Fundamentally, I will be looking for further reassurances that the detail will fulfil Labour’s manifesto commitments to disabled people. The social model of disability must be central to this – removing barriers to our inclusion in society.Proposals must take a mission-led approach across all five missions to break down barriers to opportunity for disabled people. I hope to see three things from government, embedded in the text of the amendments, if the bill reaches the report stage.First, the review being led byStephen Timms, the minister for social security and disability, must not be performative. The government must not make the same mistake twice. I strongly recommend bringing in a disabled expert on equality and employment law, such asProf Anna Lawsonat the University of Leeds, to support this work.Second, the government must consult disabled people over the summer to understand the impact of the proposed changes from November 2026 on future claimants. These must mitigate risks of discrimination for those current recipients with similar disabilities and against pushing new disabled claimants into poverty after November 2026. In doing so, it must produce an impact assessment that also reflects the impact of unmet need for future recipients on health and social care services, and clarifies the application of new criteria on those receiving Pip if they get reassessed.Third, growth must mean inclusive growth. In implementing the £1bn employment, health and skills support programme, there needs to be a clear target for closing the disability employment gap. Importantly, there needs to be a commitment to a sector-by-sector strategy on closing this gap and a skills training strategy for the employment support workers enabling disabled people into work.Disabled Labour MP says welfare U-turn would create ‘unethical two-tier system’Read moreThese approaches outperform cuts or sanctions in getting disabled people into sustainable employment.This matters. The Conservatives left us with a pitiful 29% employment gap and 17% pay gap for disabled people. The Labour government has an opportunity to bring in a new era of policymaking for disabled people that takes a laser focus in closing this gap. The disability sector believes that this can be reduced by 14%; generating £17.2bn for the exchequer. We must seize this moment to do things differently and move beyond the damaging rhetoric and disagreements of recent weeks.In line with the prime minister’s statement that reform should be implemented with Labour values of fairness, a reset requires a shift of emphasis to enabling disabled people to fulfil their potential. I will continue to engage with government and disabled people’s organisations, to fight for a country that treats disabled people with dignity and respect.Marie Tidball is Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on autism and co-chair of the disability parliamentary Labour partyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Except it’s not, not by a long chalk. The verbally agreed Iran-Israel ceasefire could be ripped to shreds at any moment. An aggressive theocratic regime still holds power in Tehran. The same is true of Jerusalem. In Washington, a president whose stupidity is matched only by his vanity prattles about making peace, but theangry old menin charge have learned nothing. Meanwhile, hundreds of civilians lie dead, thousands are wounded and millions have been terrorised.The war is over! Except only the naive believe thatBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister and prime warmonger, is done fighting. Even if Donald Trump is right and Iran’s nuclear facilities have been “obliterated” (“severely damaged” appears more accurate), its nuclear knowhow and elusive stockpile of enriched uranium have not. At the first sign, real or imagined, of rebuilding, Netanyahu and his cronies will surely attack again. Trump called them off last week. But this is a man who can change his mind three times before he’s even had breakfast.Who seriously believes Netanyahu will readily relinquish the dominance over Iran’s airspace that his forces have established with unexpected ease? It’s unlikely he will be able to resist the temptation to target Iran again, if fresh attacks are politically advantageous. Netanyahu is now reportedlyweighing up the possibilityof a snap election. Perhaps he hopes his Iran exploits will obscure his 7 October 2023 failures and abandonment of hostages held by Hamas.There is a pattern here. Since March, when he unilaterally wrecked the Gaza ceasefire, Netanyahu has sought to subjugate the territory. Palestinian civilians have been gunned down in repeated Israeli army andsettler atrocitiesaround Gaza food centres and in towns in the West Bank. In places such as Rafah, Bloody Sunday takes place almost every day. In Lebanon and Syria, Israel has dropped bombs with impunity. Netanyahu’s military grinder never stops. Why imagine that he will be any different with Iran?Most people deplore “forever wars”, typified by dismal, multi-year western entanglements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Not Netanyahu. Peace is his enemy. Forever war keeps him in power, in the limelight and out of jail. Like Vladimir Putin, he sees continuing war as an opportunity to boost domestic support and outflank his opponents. Unending state violence is deadly for democracy, legality and good governance (and on this note, Americans should worry, too: Trump’s presidency is on a similar trajectory, except his forever war is against the “enemy within”).Despite Netanyahu’svideo appealto the Iranian public in which he encouraged them to “stand up” against an “evil and oppressive regime”, he cares little for their freedom. What he wants is what imperialist powers always want: a permanently weakened, divided, degraded country that poses no challenge to Israel’s strategic interests and can be punished at will. By controlling Iranian skiesand pursuing covert cyber-attacks, sabotage and assassinations, Israel could ensure an enfeebled Iran is held in check indefinitely – or so Netanyahu may calculate.The war is over … except it’s not in Tehran, either. Rattled by talk of regime change and Israel’s killing of prominent allies, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has emerged from his bunker to wage another war, on his own people. Hundredshave been arrestedin a security crackdown. Alleged spies have been executed. In order to survive, the mullahs may now do what they have never done before: secretly race to build a nuclear weapon, or buy one off the shelf from North Korea.In truth, Iran’s loathsome regime didn’t even come close to falling. If anything, Israel’s bombs rallied public support and patriotic sentiment. Iran was attacked on the basis of a lie (neither US intelligence nor the UNbacked Netanyahu’s claim that it was weaponising) and European governments failed to condemn the bombing. These facts will only deepen distrust of the west. Iran wants relief fromUS sanctions, and may agree to discuss this, but not its future nuclear activities. It issuspending cooperationwith International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Rejecting Israeli containment, Tehran may in time resume asymmetrical conflict and revive regional proxy wars.The war isn’t over for Trump either (though, beguiled by delusions of a Nobel peace prize, he may think it is). He has demonstrated, as in Ukraine and Gaza, that his impulsive, unthinking, uninformed interventions only make the world more dangerous. He’s made it harder for the US to walk away if war flares up again. His sneak attack onIran, reminiscent of Pearl Harbor, breached the UN charter and will help rogue states justify illegal aggression. By continuing to aid and abet Netanyahu, an alleged war criminal, Trump is opening himself up to prosecution by the international criminal court.Trump has trashed multilateral diplomacy, sidelined and insulted European allies, relied on rookie envoys and rejected expert advice. His manifest untrustworthiness and monstrous egotism are all additional reasons why the US cannot be counted on. War across the Middle East is barely on hold. Trump took a shot at instant glory – and missed.The utter futility and pointlessness of this war is breathtaking. It achieved almost nothing positive. It caused misery, destruction and insecurity. Only rarely does brute force advance peaceful ends. Typically it inflames existing problems – and that’s what happened here. When will these angry old men get it? Probably never, unless and until democrats summon the courage to defy them.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionIsraelTrump administrationBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

As the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey,put it last weekbefore the benefits climbdown, “having the financial markets marking fiscal policy to market on a daily basis is not a good state of affairs”.Starmer says he lost grip on Labour welfare revolt due to focus on foreign affairsRead moreThe chancellor promised to hold only one budget a year, at which tax changes would be announced: a decision aimed at demonstrating stability and strength.However, the Treasury began signalling during thebond market panic in Januarythat she was prepared to use her spring statement to make spending cuts, if higher interest costs set her on course to break her fiscal rules.Some wise heads argued at the time against the idea of hastily drawing up cuts tailored to close whatever gap the OBR identified in five years’ time – the period over which the rules are assessed.As theformer Bank deputy governor Charlie Bean put it: “I think we want to get away from this idea that we continually have to be neurotically changing taxes and spending to try to control this OBR forecast so that it’s hitting our target.” In his understated way, Bailey effectively agreed with that this week, arguing: “There is a danger in overinterpreting a five-year-ahead forecast.”They are right: one result is hasty policy changes driven by cost-cutting targets (although the Treasury lays part of the blame on the Department for Work and Pensions for, it claims, dragging its heels over the reform package).Another consequence is that the debate over economic policy ends up being reduced to a desiccated row over tax and spend.That is especially depressing, given that the contours of an economic strategy are starting to emerge more clearly, a year into Labour’s term.The focus last week was meant to be the“modern industrial strategy”– a hefty document that set out a new approach to nurturing eight strategic sectors, including clean tech, advanced manufacturing and the creative industries.There was much to praise – a senior figure at one business lobby group joked that they would struggle to know what to campaign on next, as so many of their long-running asks had been met.Unions were gratified at the focus on creating jobs and funding additional training – and the promise of workforce strategies for sectors experiencing skills shortages.The government’s pragmatic trade strategy, also published last week, was another victim of the overwhelming focus on the welfare row.All this was lost in the Westminster drama of defending the cobbled-together cuts and then negotiating the concessions that already looked inevitable when Reeves insisted on Monday that there would be “no U-turn”.Her team now have two unenviable tasks ahead of them. First, they will have to start work on a possible package of tax increases to announce in the autumn.As her aides are keen to point out, she could yet strike lucky: growth could bounce back; inflation could ease more rapidly than expected, freeing theBank of Englandto crack on with rate cuts; and gilt yields could slide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re just channelling the ghosts of governments pastSun 29 Jun 2025 08.40 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 14.04 EDTShareThis summer’s “rebuild, rebuild, rebuild” campaign by the government feels less like a policy programme than a seance. Promising renewal, Keir Starmer instead channels the ghosts of governments past. As Karl Marx put it, people make history but not in circumstances of their own choosing; they do so haunted by dead ideas, dressing the future in secondhand costume. Labour wears what was fashionable in 1997 and 2010: Gordon Brown’s technocratic reverence for central bank independence andGeorge Osborne’sdevotion to fiscal rectitude.But we are no longer living in the world those policies were designed for.The global order that sustained Britain’s post-1979 model is cracking. International tradepeaked in 2008. The promise of seamless globalisation – of frictionless finance and footloose production – has faded. Donald Trump’s rise marked the terminal contradiction of neoliberalism: the moment its hegemon turned against it. As the US embraces a form ofeconomic nationalism, Britain – which is dependent on capital inflows, asset bubbles and open markets – faces a historic reckoning. It needs a new economic settlement. It needs imagination. But Starmer and his chancellor Rachel Reeves remain stuck in a paradigm whose time has passed.Take Reeves’s fiscal stance. Despite promises of transformation,departmental budgetswill grow more slowly than under the last parliament. This isn’t mere prudence; it’s the codification of a false scarcity – engineered not by inflation or investor panic, but by a Treasury framework that treats self-imposed constraints as natural laws.The most telling example? The silent havoc wrought by quantitative tightening (QT). While other G7 central bankstread cautiously, the Bank of England has embarked on the most aggressive QT programme in the developed world. To understand what’s going on, you have to go back to the 2010s. When the economy crashed, the Bank of England created money out of thin air to buy government debt. This was called quantitative easing (QE) – and the idea was to pump money into the financial system to keep the City running. It worked but it also meant the Bank ended up owning a huge pile of government bonds.Now, the Bank is doing the reverse: QT. That means the Bank is selling those bonds or letting them mature without replacing them. The goal is to shrink its balance sheet to “undo” QE. The problem? It’s reversing course in a more dramatic way than any other major central bank.Why does that matter? Because when those bonds were first bought, they were expensive. Now they’re being sold for less – so the Bank is making a loss. The trouble is that the Treasury (ie the state) has promised to cover those losses. On top of that, because QE created a lot of bank reserves (money that commercial banks hold at the Bank of England), the Bank is now paying billions in interest to those same commercial banks – at today’s much higher rates.As Starmer unveils his 10-year plan, here’s my advice: don’t fall into the Joe Biden trap | Sam AlvisRead moreThis means QT sees the Treasury handing over public money to cover bond losses and top up the profits of commercial banks. It’s a quiet and alarming transfer of wealth to the financial sector. The cost to the Treasury? About£40bn per year– money that could have paid for social care reform or scrapping the two-child benefit cap.These aren’t marginal technicalities. They are central political choices. And Reeves has chosen to uphold the orthodoxy – locking in monetary contraction while binding herself to fiscal rules that treat these giveaways to the financial sector as sacrosanct, but deny cash to local councils and legal aid. The result: a paradoxical state that both invests and cuts – that spends on nuclear reactors and tram lines but won’t supply the cash required to run them in the future.This is not rebuilding. It is auto-cannibalism. Worse still, the justification isn’t even compelling. Asked by former financier and Liberal Democrat MPChris Coghlanwhy the Bank doesn’t just abandon QT, its governor, Andrew Bailey, replied that it keeps markets “efficient”. Efficient for whom? Certainly not for the disabled person reliant on benefits, the underfunded headteacher or the hospital trust closing down services. The British state is not broke; it is being deliberately starved, not by financial markets, but by its own managers.A rerouting of QT cash would go a long way to restoring the state’s capacity to genuinely improve services, undoing some of the pandemic setbacks and austerity-era neglect. It would mark a first step toward coherent fiscal policy and honest political economics. Nigel Farage masquerades as the voters’ friend byhijacking this policy– but that shouldn’t deter Labour from doing what’s right.Instead of intervening, Reeves prefers the script of necessary sacrifice, in which there is no money for transforming the public realm but seemingly unlimited room for interest transfers to the banking sector.The deeper irony is that this deference to the Bank – and the belief that QT is untouchable – is a New Labour inheritance. The original sin was granting the Bank of England operational independence in 1997. Brownsacrificed policy controlover interest rates to reassure the City that New Labour’s monetary policy would be governed by unaccountable experts rather than political whims.But before New Labour turned central bank independence into holy writ, Tory chancellorKen Clarke,hardly a socialist firebrand, regularly overruled the Bank of England on interest rates. Monetary discretion wasn’t always heresy; it was governance.Yet this insulation was always a fiction. The Treasury still indemnifies Bank losses. The government could pause QT, rework reserve interest payments or end the indemnity altogether.Other countries do.With a commanding Commons majority, ministers can easily force such a change. The Bank of England may be operationally independent, but ministers can take control of it in“extreme economic circumstances”. If£150bn of Treasury spendingto needlessly cover central bank losses doesn’t qualify, what does?But in Starmer’s Britain, policy remains trapped in the costume drama of the late 1990s – where credibility meant sounding like the bond market, and success meant keeping one’s hands off the steering wheel. And so we drift.Labourcannot fund the transformation it promises, because it refuses to rewrite the rules that make transformation impossible.This is austerity by amnesia. A government elected to change Britain instead parrots the scripts of decline. It is reported that Reeves is looking totax banks. That’s not a bad idea but it avoids the far larger prize: reforming the policies that funnel billions into their coffers in the first place. And in so doing, she repeats the fatalism ofPhilip Snowden, Labour’s first chancellor, who insisted in the 1930s that there was no alternative to cuts. That path led to economic stagnation and Labour’s near-destruction. It may do so again.Randeep Ramesh is chief leader writer for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionEconomic policyBank of EnglandRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

My generation has been stranded in a rapidly changing and, since Covid, badly mishandled education systemSun 29 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 05.09 EDTShareReading about the role of artificial intelligence in higher education, the landscape looks bleak. Students arecheating en massein our assessments or open-book, online exams using AI tools, all the whilemaking ourselves stupider. The next generation of graduates, apparently, are going to complete their degrees without ever having so much as approached a critical thought.Given that my course is examined entirely through closed-book exams, and I worry about the vast amounts of water and energy needed topower AI datacentres, I generally avoid using ChatGPT. But in my experience, students see it as a broadly acceptable tool in the learning process.Although debates about AI tend to focus on “cheating”, it is increasingly being used to assist with research, or to help structure essays.There are valid concerns about the abuse and overuse oflarge language models(LLMs) in education. But if you want to understand why so many students are turning to AI, you need to understand what brought us to this point – and the educational context against which this is playing out.In March 2020, I was about to turn 15. When the news broke that schools would be closing as part of the Covid lockdown, I remember cheers erupting in the corridors. As I celebrated what we all thought was just two weeks off school, I could not have envisioned the disruption that would mar the next three years of my education.That year, GCSEs and A-levels were cancelled and replaced with teacher-assessed grades, which notoriously privileged those at alreadywell-performing private schools. After further school closures, and a prolonged period of dithering, the then-education secretary, Gavin Williamson,cancelled them againin 2021. My A-level cohort in 2023 was the first to return to “normal” examinations – in England, at least – which resulted in a punitive crackdown on grade inflation that left many withfar lower gradesthan expected.At the same time, universities across the country were also grappling with how to assess students who were no longer physically on campus. The solution: open-book, online assessments for papers that were not already examined by coursework. When the students of the lockdown years graduated, the university system did not immediately return to its pre-Covid arrangements. Five years on,70% of universitiesstill use some form of online assessment.This is not because, as some will have you believe, university has become too easy. These changes are a response to the fact that the large majority of current home students did not have the typical experience of national exams. Given the extensive periods of time we spent away from school during our GCSE and A-level years, there were inevitably parts of the curriculum that we were never able to cover. But beyond missed content, the government’s repeated backtracking and U-turning on the format of our exams from 2020 onwards bred uncertainty that continued to shape how we were assessed – even as we progressed on to higher education.In my first year of university, half of my exams were online. This year, they all returned to handwritten, closed-book assessments. In both cases, I did not get confirmation about the format of my exams until well into the academic year. And, in one instance, third-year students sitting the exact same paper as me were examined online and in a longer timeframe, to recognise that they had not sat a handwritten exam at any point during their degree.And so whenChatGPTwas released in 2022, it landed in a university system in transition, characterised by yet more uncertainty. University exams had already become inconsistent and widely variable, between universities and within faculties themselves – only serving to increase the allure of AI for students who felt on the back foot, and make it harder to detect and monitor its use.There’s no simple solution to universities’ AI worries  | LettersRead moreEven if it were not for our botched exams, being a student is more expensive than ever: 68% of students have part-time jobs, thehighest rate in a decade. The student loan system, too, leaves those from the poorest backgrounds with the largest amounts of debt. I am already part of the first year to have to pay back our loans over 40, rather than 30, years. And that is before tuition fees rise again.Students have less time than ever to actually be students. AI is a time-saving tool; if students don’t have the time or resources to fully engage with their studies, it is because something has gone badly wrong with the university system itself.The use of AI is mushrooming because it’s convenient and fast, yes, but also because of the uncertainty that prevails around post-Covid exams, as well as the increasing financial precarity of students.Universitiesneed to pick an exam format and stick to it. If this involves coursework or open-book exams, there needs to be clarity about what “proportionate” usage of AI looks like. For better or for worse, AI is here to stay. Not because students are lazy, but because what it means to be a student is changing just as rapidly as technology.Elsie McDowell is a student.

And moving, movement is the essential key to dispelling despairSun 29 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 07.30 EDTShareIn this authoritarian and suffocating climate where being an American feels like a curse, where just breathing here feels like complicity with genocide, psychotic imperialism, misogyny and endless racism, it is hard to move, let alone imagine what one can do to transform this horror to good.Every day people are kidnapped by masked men in unmarked cars, taken to hidden sites and left in deplorable conditions; starving people in Gaza are slaughtered as they clamor for a bag of flour; public officials and leaders humiliated and murdered; the T erased from LGBT; brain-dead women forced to give birth; the glib language of hate and cruelty and easy thoughtless threats of world war, assassination, and dehumanization circling like invisible poison. What feels most perilous is the steady evaporation of the boundaries of what seemed impossible only a few weeks ago. Morality, compassion, care – slashed and burned.And yet I think of Beckett, “I can’t go on. I’ll go on”, “The world is essentially over. I will fight for another day”, “I have lost my faith in humans. I commit to love them more.”Trump is angry with a world that won’t give him easy deals | Rafael BehrRead moreTo live as Jung said – with two existing opposite thoughts at the same time. Survival right now depends on our ability to swim in this duality. To not linger in the pain, but to allow ourselves to be moved by it. To not whitewash reality, but also not to take up lodging in the house of despair. This is the dance of our times.We must become agile and flexible. To feel responsible but not so guilty we are immobilized. To feel rage but to learn how to direct it into action and passion and purpose. To lift ourselves to a more existential absurdist place where the fascists cannot touch us. Not disassociation or numbness, but finding the grace, energy and humor that come when we commit ourselves more deeply to one another.Before “No Kings” Day there was a part of me that frankly was tired of marching, wondering if these demonstrations really add up to anything. But then on 14 June, with anestimated 4 million to 6 millionpeople in the streets of America, I realized something profound. Marches and demonstrations are not merely acts of resistance and refusal, but they are community events in which we meet and strengthen our resolve and bonds with our own tribe of like-minded people.They are public moments to show the rest of the world that we are the majority and we do not want and will not accept a king, or genocide in Gaza or precious immigrants being dragged off and separated from their families. They are places to let off steam and make great art and music and network and ultimately they are what we have, the expression of our collective sorrow and outrage, thereby saving our own souls.So how do we resist and rise? We have to believe the impossible is possible.I think of my sisters at the City of Joy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo who give me inspiration and direction daily. The center is literally in the middle of a war zone. When the M23 militias invaded Bukavu in February, they made a radical decision to keep the center open despite the madness outside – gunfire, bombs and sometimes dead bodies on the road. They refused to stop building the world they dreamed. Instead, they developed strategies – coming to work on scooters, changing cars to avoid being noticed, keeping their hearts tuned to the work of healing survivors. It is now June and the 27th class of City of Joy is about to graduate and a new class is on the way.I think of one of my great inspirations, the former congresswoman Cori Bush who saw that in St Louis, after the recent tornado no local or national Fema had come or were coming. The majority of people had lost their homes or had huge holes in them. So she joined with local groups to provide tarps and food, cleaning products and formula. They formed hubs of care. They went to the senior homes who had lost electricity so there was no refrigeration for food or medicine and gave them both.She told me, “It’s my community. I believe that we take care of us. I learned through the Ferguson uprising that we can’t wait on politicians or leaders. We have to dive in and get to work. We have to talk to one another and know our communities. We need to organize in our living rooms, local businesses backyards – find out who amongst us are doctors, nurses, chefs, teachers. Knowing your community and what skills they can offer.” This is what we need to understand now more than ever.It is so clear something essential is dying. The illusion and seduction of the American dream is over. Neoliberalism is dead. There are huge cracks, openings in the old structures and narratives. These are opportunities to plant the seeds for the new world as we protect those suffering now.What the fascists want more than anything is our fear, exhaustion and despair. Or they want us angry, reactive, cruel and violent like them. In Cherien Dabis’s staggeringly brilliant saga about a family in Palestine, All That’s Left of You, (one of the best films I have ever seen), a married couple comes to a moral crisis and they turn to an iman for advice. This wise and very gentle iman tells them: “Your humanity is also your resistance. Don’t underestimate its power. It’s the only thing they can’t take away from you.” Every action matters now. Every effort small or large counts. And moving – movement is the essential key to dispelling despair. How we care now, how we love, how we come together, how we build and protect each other is in itself the building of the new world.V (formerly Eve Ensler) is a playwright and activist and the founder of V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women and girlsExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionProtestDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

A trip to clear out his student flat has brought back so many memoriesSat 28 Jun 2025 21.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 12.53 EDTShareThere’s an accurate, if snide, thing I’ve seen online that reads “No parent on Facebook can believe their child has turned any age”, and yes, OK, not the “on Facebook” bit, but there is a rote astonishment at time passing that I sometimes slip into, contemplating my adult sons. But, allow me, just this once, a Facebook parent moment. My elder son turned 23 last month and we’ve just been to London to collect his stuff at the end of his degree. On the way, I realised I was 23 when I moved there myself.You can’t often pre-emptively pinpointparenting “lasts”, but when you can, they’re strange and melancholy – even when they’re not, objectively, things a person would choose to do again. This trip involved (I hope) my last time standing, hips screaming from the drive, texting “We’re outside” as we waited for our son to wake up (my husband ended up throwing a ball at his bedroom window). It was definitely my last time removing my shoes amid the overflowing bins of that sticky-floored student house, and hovering over the Trainspotting-esque toilet then deciding against drying my hands on any of the towels. It ended with the last trip along the M1 squished between a salvaged chair, a duvet and an Ikea bag of pans threatening to decapitate me if we made an emergency stop. We were bringing his stuff “home” knowing that it won’t be home for him in the same way again: he’s moving to New York this summer. Maybe not for ever, but for years, not months.To compound the Big Feelings, and the sense of the dizzying slippage of time, my husband and I used the trip to wander round Fitzrovia, where we shared our first flat back when I was 23. It’s different but not unrecognisable: the hospital has been demolished but Tesco is thriving; the Phones 4U where we bought our first mobiles is gone; but the bank where we opened Isas when they were invented, proud of our new maturity, hangs on. Our block had acquired several Airbnb key safes but was otherwise unchanged. “It’ll be baking up there,” said my husband, staring up as the late afternoon sun struck the flat black roof. I made him repeat himself, because I have become slightly deaf this year, then we reminisced about the brutal summer heat (it’s probably even worse now). We walked around, pointing out survivors: the famously cheap pizza place, the tiny Italian sandwich shop, the DIY store where we panic bought a fan. Then we sat down for a sensible soft drink, because we were tired and I was struck by an ultra site-specific memory of walking through Percy Passage to meet him one evening, having just discovered I was pregnant with our now-23-year-old, enjoying the last seconds of incredulous solo joy before sharing the news. Then another: shuffling along Goodge Street at dawn in labour, stopping outside Spaghetti House (still there) to ride out a contraction. Both our sons were born in this neighbourhood – it changed my life like no other.The place still felt familiar; what 23 felt like is harder to access. I was a mess, I think: I had been ill and was extremely self-absorbed; I spent far too much time worrying about my weight. I spent little, if any, time worrying about the world, though. World-wise, things felt fine – “A new dawn has broken, has it not?”Tony Blair had just told us– and if they weren’t, it certainly didn’t feel like my problem.There aren’t many new dawn vibes for my son’s generation as they enter adulthood. I’m not sure we’ve given them much of a chance to spend a few self-absorbed years focusing on their own dramas, have we? We’ve gifted them more pressing matters: a collapsing climate, catastrophic economic inequality, a crappy jobs market and even the reemerging spectre of fascism and nuclear war (retro!). Plus, it’s all inescapably fed into their faces 24/7 – not a feature offered by a 1997 Phones 4U Motorola.But I hope, even so, that 23 can still be what it was for me: confusing but full of possibility. An adventure. The perfect age to find yourself in a new city.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionYoung peopleFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Rare earth elements, the mineral backbones of wind turbines and electric vehicles, are now the prize in a geopolitical arms race. The tradeagreementbetween Washington and Beijing restores rare earth shipments from China to the US, which had been suspended in retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariffs. Behind the bluster, there has been a realisation in Washington that these are critical inputs for the US. They are needed not just by American icons such asFordand Boeing but for itsfighter jets, missile guidance systems and satellite communications.This understanding suggests that Washington will scale back some of its countermeasures once Beijing resumes delivery of rare earths. The paradox is that to reduce its dependence on China, the US must depend on Beijing a little longer. This is not yet decoupling; it’sdeferment. That, however, may not last. Mr Trump has signed an executive order to boost production of critical minerals, which encourages the faster granting of permits for mining and processing projects. He eyesUkraineand Greenland’s subterranean riches to break dependence on China.The west became so reliant on a single geopolitical rival for such materials – materials it once extracted and refined domestically before shuttering operations – due to cost and environmental concerns. China, for its part, has come to dominate global rare earth processing. It has used that market power before – notably againstJapanin 2010. It’s hard not to think that it was strategic complacency that led to the west relying so heavily on China for key minerals.This month’s Nato summit has seen the west push to reindustrialise via rearming itself. This is also reawakening long-dormant extractive ambitions in the global north.Canada, flush with critical mineral deposits, says its planned mining resurgence will be a new foundation for alliance solidarity. This month the EUcalledfor strategic reserves of rare earths “to prevent supply chain disruptions and economic blackmail from China” – highlighting their importance not just for electric vehicles but for defence and aerospace industries. “Resilience” meansdigging deeperat home and controlling extraction abroad.The same minerals we need for net zero are being justified in terms of zero-sum rivalry. It is uncomfortable that “green growth” and militarism have merged into a single policy frame, collapsing the distinction between ecological transition and arms buildup. A magnet for anelectric caris also a magnet for ahypersonic missile. And meanwhile, the human and ecological toll continues to rise – largely out of sight and out of sync with the idea of environmental sustainability.A Guardian dispatch last week fromBaotou, China’s rare earth capital, found evidence of toxic ponds,poisoned soiland demolished “cancer villages” – the hidden cost of our digital and electric age. Framing this as an inconvenient necessity risks repeating past mistakes. For mineral-rich nations, the surge in global demand brings opportunity. But as aUN reportthis year noted, without strong institutions and safeguards, it risks a familiar fate: corruption, conflict and environmental ruin.Today’s scramble for critical minerals must not see the promises of responsible sourcing give way to a familiar logic – extract first, moralise later.Explore more on these topicsChinaOpinionAsia PacificDonald TrumpXi JinpingNatoeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But as Wimbledon opens its doors, three weeks after a French Open men’s singles final that some regard as the best tennis match ever (Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner over five and a half hours), other warnings besides heat are known to be troubling some of the players.Emma Raducanu has said she feels “comfortable” and “safe”, thanks to tighter security arrangements introduced after an unnamed man, who previouslysigned an agreementto stay away from her, was blocked from buying tickets. Earlier this year shebecame visibly distressedby his presence at a match in Dubai, after he approached her in person. But while this particular situation appears to have been dealt with, the wider picture regarding female players’ experiences remains troubling – as does the wider problem of online abuse in sports, including thataimed at referees.Earlier this month the British No 2, Katie Boulter, gave an interviewhighlighting the tollthis behaviour takes. Other players have also described the impact of stalkers and fixated male fans. Three years ago, a different man from the one in Dubaiwas sentencedto 200 hours community service after repeatedly turning up at Raducanu’s house.Stalkers are not a new problem for celebrities, including sportspeople. In 1993,Monica Seleswas stabbed in Hamburg by a man obsessed with her rival, Steffi Graf. But the darker side of fame has been magnified by digital media – which has changed the rules of social engagement for athletes as well as everyone else.Since sport, for most people, is an enjoyable leisure activity, its stars are widely regarded as lucky, talented people – not obvious objects of concern. But thedisproportionate harassment of female playersshould bother spectators and society at large, as well as those with a professional interest in their wellbeing.To some degree such attacks are in line with women’s negative experiences in other areas of public life, including politics, and part of a wider problem of escalating,technologically enabled sexism. But the role of online gambling in fomenting aggression is an element specific to sports that is rightly attracting attention. A newly released report from the Women’s Tennis Association and International Tennis Federation found that77% of abusedirected at players’ personal accounts came from “frustrated gamblers”, with a handful of top female players facing a disproportionate share of hostility.Unsurprisingly, given their well documentedopposition to stronger regulationin general, gambling companies have been slow to act. But players and those tasked with safeguarding them are pushing back. The two-times Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur – who plays her first-round match on Monday – is among those who have called for betting companies to ban abusers from their platforms for life. She deserves praise for speaking out.SirAndy Murray, and others who have voiced concern, recognise that regulating online speech is complex. That does not mean that the status quo is acceptable. Fatalistic attitudes to the growing problem of sexualised online abuse are part of the problem that policymakers need to grip.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He spent his time away from the court wisely, playing golf with Andy Murray, strolling through central London and seeking out good food and good vibes. Then, on Wednesday, he returned to work with his sights on a singular goal.A year that had started off for Alcaraz with such turbulent, challenging results now seemingly positions him at the height of his powers. After struggling initially with the elevated pressure and scrutiny during Jannik Sinner’s doping ban, along with the weight that comes with his immense achievements, Alcaraz will begin his title defence at Wimbledon against Fabio Fognini on Monday playing great tennis, enjoying himself and content with life on and off the court.Should he convert his ascendant form into another triumph atWimbledon, Alcaraz would elevate his status to even greater heights. At just 22, he is seeking to become only the fifth man in the open era to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles, which would mark the start of a true era at the All England Club. He would also become the fourth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back‑to-back on multiple occasions in the open era, after Rod Laver, Björn Borg and Rafael Nadal.Emma Raducanu relishes Wimbledon return despite no great expectationsRead moreWith a career win-loss record of 29-3, another seven wins would also underline that this is his era at Wimbledon. It is of utmost importance for Alcaraz not to think about any of this. “I’m coming here thinking that, yeah, I really want to win the title,” he said. “I really want to lift the trophy. Not thinking about how many players have done it, winning three Wimbledons in a row.”Right at the top of the draw, Sinner begins his tournament in a completely different position. Despite holding three consecutive match points to achieve this feat at Roland Garros three weeks ago, the 23-year-old world No 1 continues to seek out his first grand-slam title away from hard courts. Sinner remains far superior to all challengers bar Alcaraz right now, but he will have to offer a supreme demonstration of his resilience as he tries to bounce back from his French Open final defeat by Alcaraz and compete for his first title at SW19.ForJack Draper, handling the pressure of his first Wimbledon as a top player, and particularly the innumerable questions the British No 1 has fielded and will continue to field about said pressure, is challenging enough, but he was also handed an extremely difficult draw on Friday.View image in fullscreenJack Draper has been handed a difficult draw as he faces his first Wimbledon as one of the top seeds.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockIf he reaches round three, Draper could face the in-form 28th seed, Alexander Bublik, the recent Halle Open champion on grass and his vanquisher at Roland Garros. If the fourth seed manages to produce his best tennis and reach the quarter-finals,Novak Djokovic, who continues to perform at an extremely high level at the grand slam tournaments, could await. At 38, Djokovic is attempting to become the oldest winner of a slam title.Still, Draper is an extremely ambitious player who is determined to rise even higher than his ranking and those ambitions have been backed up by his recent success. This is an opportunity for the 23-year-old to demonstrate his ability in this challenging situation. Between his destructive, well-rounded game, the grass-court conditions that suit him, and the immense support he will receive on every point he plays, there are plenty of factors in his favour over the next two weeks.Quick GuideWimbledon 2025: day one order of playShowCentre Court(1.30pm BST start)F Fognini (It) v C Alcaraz (Sp, 2)P Badosa (Sp, 9) v K Boulter (GB)A Rinderknech (Fr) v A Zverev (Ger, 3)No.1 Court(1pm BST start)A Sabalenka (Blr, 1) v C Branstine (Can)J Fearnley (GB) v J Fonseca (Bra)E Raducanu (GB) v M Xu (GB)No.2 Court(11am BST start)B Bonzi (Fr) v D Medvedev (Rus, 9)E Ruse (Rom) v M Keys (US, 6)J Paolini (It, 4) v A Sevastova (Lat)T Fritz (US, 5) v G Mpetshi-Perricard (Fr)No.3 Court(11am BST start)S Kartal (GB) v J Ostapenko (Lat, 20)H Rune (Den, 8) v N Jarry (Chi)M Berrettini (It, 32) v K Majchrzak (Pol)K Siniakova (Cz) v Q Zheng (Chn, 5)Court 12(11am BST start)E Moller (Den) v F Tiafoe (US, 12)V Royer (Fr) v S Tsitsipas (Gr, 24)L Fernandez (Can, 29) v H Klugman (GB)M Vondrousova (Cz) v M Kessler (US, 32)Court 18A Bondar (Hun) v E Svitolina (Ukr, 14)C Norrie (GB) v R Bautista Agut (Sp)M McDonald (US) v K Khachanov (Rus, 17)N Osaka (Jpn) v T Gibson (Aus)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The 23 home players across the men’s and women’s singles draw are the most Britain has had since 1984. A year after taking his first steps into the world of regular professional tennis after college during the grass-court season last year, the British No 2, Jacob Fearnley, returns to Wimbledon having enjoyed an astounding rise, breaking the top 50 with his first ATP quarter-final at Queen’s Club. However, Fearnley wants more and he has a daunting challenge ahead as he tries to take a further step forward at Wimbledon: he will face the 18-year-old Brazilian João Fonseca, the most highly touted teenager in the game, in the opening round on Monday.A few weeks on from his resurgent run to the fourth round at Roland Garros, Cameron Norrie will also try to maintain his momentum. Alongside numerous British wildcards, the rise of the 21-year‑old British qualifier Oliver Tarvet is notable. At No 719, he is the lowest-ranked player in the draw as he spends most of his time playing tennis in college for the University of San Diego. He will take his place in the Wimbledon main draw alongside legends and future superstars in a tournament with history on the line.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonCarlos AlcarazTennisJack DraperJannik SinnerNovak DjokovicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Earps, however, has insisted it was a “very hard decision” that had been on her mind for a long time.Hannah Hampton aims to live up to Mary Earps’ legacy as England No 1Read more“It was difficult and it was painful,” said Earps, who earned 53 caps for her country. “Some people were amazing and the girls, the way they had my back … that meant the absolute world to me. These are girls that I grew up with and have so many amazing memories with. It was sad but I think it’s the right thing.“I think that I was villainised in a way, that probably was a bit hard to see things and read things, but it’s more what my friends and family see. I’m upset for them because I’m like: ‘You didn’t choose this. You’ve got to now deal with this.’ That’s hard. But in the end I feel like it was the right decision.”Speaking to the broadcaster Fearne Cotton on her Happy Place podcast, Earps was asked if she would find it hard to watch the Lionesses this summer. “I don’t want it to be painful watching them but I won’t know until it’s there because I felt almost a bit of relief because it had been so long coming,” the 32-year-old former Manchester United player said, referring to her retirement.“The girls are, first of all, a phenomenal team. I think they’re going to do really, really well, so I’m really looking forward to seeing that.“Mentally, physically, I was just like: ‘Right, I’ve given everything here.’ Maybe other people weren’t experiencing it the way I was experiencing it. I’m quite private, I keep everything in and I try to internalise it and rationalise it. Maybe it was shocking to some people but I think [that was because] we’ve been having those conversations behind closed doors.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The remarks were echoed by the team principal,Christian Horner, who conceded the title fight was now a two-horse race.McLaren’s Lando Norris and Oscar Piastriachieved a dominant one-two, but Verstappen played no part in proceedings after he was struck by the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli at turn three on the opening lap, knocking both cars out of the race.Norris holds off Piastri to win Austrian F1 GP after Verstappen crashes out earlyRead moreIt leaves Verstappen 61 points adrift of Piastri in the championship, a lead that appears all but impossible to bridge given the pace advantage theMcLarenenjoys over the rest of the field.“This is a black day,” Marko said. “The gap is almost impossible to make up. If nothing special happens, we have to assume that the championship is over.“The McLarens, incredible, this pace in this heat. A half-second advantage per lap on this track. That’s alarming. Especially in these high temperatures. That’s a fact. This was a demonstration. We’re not really sure how we’re going to catch up.”Thirteen meetings remain butRed Bulllook no closer to chasing down McLaren despite the upgrades they brought to Austria. Indeed, Horner acknowledged that the form Norris and Piastri demonstrated at the Red Bull Ring was indicative of their enormous advantage, particularly in how well the McLaren works its tyres.“It looks very much like a two‑horse race,” Horner said. “You could see how McLaren are racing each other. They’ve got a cushion to the rest. For us we just focus on one race at a time. We don’t even think about championships.“What’s truly impressive is when you look at how close Oscar is able to run behind Lando with a car fat on fuel at the beginning of the race. He’s basically making love to his exhaust pipe lap after lap and the tyres are not dying.“That is their advantage. I can’t see any other car that would be able to follow that closely and not grain the front tyres or the rear tyres.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneRed BullChristian HornerMax VerstappenMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The day after Botafogo fell to Palmerias, Flamengo departed too, cut down byHarry Kane.That sea of red and black will be missed and their team will too: the side who beat Chelsea showed that was not by chance, as they made a game of this one, scoring twice at the Hard Rock Stadium, their fans banging drums and their coach declaring his pride at how they had played. But it wasBayern Munichwho progressed.PSG sweep Inter Miami and Messi aside to reach Club World Cup quarter-finalRead more“It is about moments and we took our moments very well,” the England captain said. “We stayed calm, and scored our goals at the right time.” He scored two of them, finally securing a victory when he scored his second with quarter of an hour left, a goal which, in his own words, “eased the last 10 minutes” of an afternoon that had been far from easy. His brace, a Leon Goretzka strike and an Erick Pulgar own goal saw it finish 4-2, setting upa meeting with Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight.ForFlamengothere was a noisy farewell and as they wound their way down the ramps at the end, songs echoed off the stands. Filipe Luís, the coach, said that they they had in the end been beaten by a “superior team”, a “real colossus” but that they had played their way. Their way was good too, good enough that they may feel that justice was not entirely done and reflect on the part they played in their own downfall, even if Luís insisted that the errors that proved decisive in the end were forced by an opponent that is “absolutely elite”. They racked up more shots than Bayern, yet also slipped 2-0 and 3-1 down in the first half and, ultimately left too much to do. When Kane added the fourth, it was done.The first of Bayern’s four came after just six minutes and two more followed before the break, aided by an apparent nervousness about their opponents when pressure was applied and a willingness to take risks playing out. Agustín Rossi had already been forced to backpedal to reach an inswinging corner, seen a clearance hit Pulgar to set up a Joshua Kimmich shot, and gratefully watched a punch away hit a black balloon rather than setting up another dangerous delivery when they conceded an own goal opener. Jumping by Goretzka, the hint of a hand in his back, Gonzalo Plata succeeded only in deflecting the ball off the top of his head and into the net.Flamengo responded fast, Plata escaping up the right where they advanced often and delivering a cross from which Giorgian de Arrascaeta’s header flew just past the post. There was an aggressiveness and determination to Flamengo that went with the noise their supporters brought and underlined that this would be a proper game. It was, too, even if Bayern were soon two up when Kane took advantage of Dayot Upamecano’s steal, turned and hit a 25-yard shot that flew in off the post, a deflection taking it away from Rossi.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane scores Bayern Munich’s second goal.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersThere had been fortune in that and Flamengo certainly would have been entitled to feel unlucky to trail by two then and even more so a moment later when Manuel Neuer made an extraordinary save from Luiz Araújo, flashing out a strong right hand that had he and Kimmich celebrating. Next Leo Pereira struck wide. And not long after that, Araújo superbly controlled somewhere up near his neck, spun and volleyed wide. When Gerson belted a shot first time screeching right through Neuer’s hands to make it 2-1 on half an hour, Flamengo had deserved it.The problem for Luis’s side were those moments Kane mentioned. Within five minutes, Bayern had scored again, although another poor clearance set it up. It came to Goretzka, lurking outside the area. He controlled on his chest, took one touch and then, despite the distance, opened up his body to disguise the direction of the shot and calmly yet firmly side-footed into the corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A hop, a pause, and without a look Jorginho sent Neuer the wrong way, side-footing his penalty into the corner. Soon Bruno Henrique escaped behind the Bayern defence, but couldn’t guide his shot on target. The Brazilians behind the goal sensed an opportunity – “the fans are a big part of it,” Kane said after – and roared their team on but then came another of those moments, another error ruthlessly exposed.Dribbling out from deep, Araújo just about escaped the first challenge but couldn’t escape the second. Konrad Laimer won the ball, Kimmich gave it to Kane and that was only going to end one way, the finish so clean, the job done his way.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupBayern MunichFlamengoHarry KanenewsShareReuse this content"

Ella Toone stepped up, scoring twice, Lauren James returned to action and provided an assist within eight minutes, there was a cohesiveness to England’s play and the substitutes made an impact.“We know next week we have to take our game to the next level,” said Wiegman afterwards.The noise was deafening before kick-off; fans in the Midlands, and those travelling from further afield, had read loud and clear the message that this was a sendoff game.There had been some theorising over what sort of starting XI Wiegman would choose for the visit of Jamaica. Would this be the opportunity to give those on the fringes a final chance to impress, or would it be much closer to the likely starting XI for England’s Euro 2025 opener against France?It was, in reality, always going to be the latter. Given a tough group, with no easy games, this was England’s chance to warm up into competition mode.Jess Carter was given the nod over Niamh Charles at left-back, Beth Mead started ahead of Chloe Kelly and Toone beat Grace Clinton to fill the No 10 role. It would be remiss to not expect some tweaks for the game against France – James starting on the bench was down to her return from injury, for example – but they will be minimal.View image in fullscreenLauren James was pleased to be back with the Lionesses after recovering from injury.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“We’re still building her,” said Wiegman of James’s return. “ She worked so hard to be where she is right now … This is the first time she could get minutes, we hope we can keep building her and then go again into France.”Toone repaid the faith of the manager within 10 minutes, the midfielder collecting the loose ball after it was forced from the feet of Georgia Stanway and curling into a corner from the edge of the D. After opening the scoring the 25-year-old poignantly kissed her hands and pointed to the sky, a tribute to her father, who died in September.There was always going to be a big gulf between these two teams: the European champions ranked fifth in the world, and Jamaica ranked 35 places below them. Emblematic of that gap was the 20-year-old Liya Brooks, the goalkeeper being one of four members of the Jamaica squad who play for a university team in the US.England were stunned 10 minutes later, though, when Kayla McKenna swept in past Hannah Hampton from a corner, with a deflection ­off Alex Greenwood wrongfooting the keeper. However, with the video assistant referee system in use to get the Lionesses ready for tournament conditions, ­McKenna’s effort was ruled out, as Kalyssa van Zanten was in an offside position and interfering with ­Hampton’s line of sight.Their one-goal advantage still in place, England’s second was inevitable and Carter was the architect, her cross from the left finding Lucy Bronze in the middle and the 33-year-old heading in. Toone added the third, Bronze battling the ball to her before she curled it into a corner.England’s dominance continued into the second half and the fourth goal came just before the hour, when Stanway fired in after a string of shots were blocked by the visitors. Changes came soon after, with Esme Morgan, Kelly and James on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She came on in the No 10 position, something Wiegman said they had wanted to experiment with.“We know that we have some players that can play in different positions, we know that LJ has played a lot up front, on the sides, she can play there too,” she said. “That’s what I wanted to see today and see how that worked. I think it went really well.”This was the time to get any rustiness out of her system but it turned out she didn’t need long: her clipped effort to the far post was pinpoint and all Alessia Russo had to do was nod her head forward slightly to ­convert. From there on out, James was a livewire.Lauren James sparkles in cameo as Wiegman looks to answer questions over starting XI | Tom GarryRead moreCharles, Clinton and Aggie Beever-Jones were given a chance to show what they can do with 15 minutes remaining and the subs inspired the sixth. Williamson’s ball from deep was met by Charles, who sent it into the middle for Beever-Jones to turn in, and Kelly set up Mead in added time, the forward firing in shortly after she had been down with a ­worrying-looking knock to a knee.Jamaica are not of the level of the victors’ Group D opponents France or the Netherlands, or Wales for that matter, but the Lionesses did the job that was in front of them.

Photograph: Marcel van Dorst/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockA lack of goals while narrowly avoiding a qualifying playoff shows they are not at their best, but Vivianne Miedema will surely make an impactBySteven KooijmanSun 29 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 19.11 EDTShareThis article is part of theGuardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewThe Netherlands did not have a smooth journey to the Euros and qualified in the final group game, away against Norway in the coastal town of Bergen. They were 1-0 down until Vivianne Miedema avoided disaster for the coach, Andries Jonker, by scoring an equaliser. They would surely have reached Switzerland via the playoffs but nearly missing out on automatic qualification is a snapshot of where the team are.The main problem, as for some time, was a lack of punch: in the six group matches they never scored more than one goal. Injuries have played a big part since Jonker took over after a disappointing Euro 2022, and the past year has been no different.Miedema was coming back from a cruciate ligament injury and suffered a few niggles on the way while Jill Roord and Victoria Pelova also sustained ACL injuries. The Oranje goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar, meanwhile, was also forced to miss the important home game against the group winners Italy.That match began a new era for the side, being the first one after the retirement of Lieke Martens, who had announced she was hanging up her boots the previous month.Up until the last friendly before the Euros, Jonker had opted for a 5-3-2 (or 3-5-2). It had proved the most successful for him and the team. At the 2023 World Cup he played with wing-backs Esmee Brugtsand Pelova. However, against Finland towards the end of June – with Lineth Beerensteyn injured – he reverted to a more traditional Dutch 4-3-3 and may well start the tournament that way.There is healthy competition in central defence where Sherida Spitse looks set to lose her place to the teenage sensation Veerle Buurman.NetherlandsThe coachIn JanuaryAndries Jonkerwas told the Dutch FA (KNVB) did not want him to continue after the Euros. Jonker was furious, disappointed and offended, but he would not reveal the reason behind his departure. “That is something the technical director, Nigel de Jong, will have to do,” he said. Jonker has not been keen to make many changes and that has resulted in an ageing squad. The number of players over 30 is significant. However, with aquarter-final at the 2023 World Cup, reaching the semis of the 2024 Nations League and qualifying for Euro 2025, it cannot be said Jonker has failed. Other countries, however, have made more progress in that time.Star playerFor years Miedema was the undisputed Oranje star with Roord, Jackie Groenen and Daniëlle van de Donk just behind her.Lineth Beerensteynoften had to play a supporting role to those players but no longer. In the past two seasons the Netherlands have come to rely on the Wolfsburg player’s goals. She doesn’t score the flashiest goals but finishes with both feet – and her head. She is unpredictable and extremely fast. “I’m getting better at recognising which runs to make and knowing which angle to shoot from,” she said recently. “That is happening more and more.” Was carrying a knock coming into the tournament and may not be fully fit for the first game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe because she has never played abroad. A No 10 or a winger, Jansen has been named the Eredivisie MVP on several occasions during spells with Den Haag, Twente and PSV. She has good memories of playing group rivals England, having scored a beauty against the Lionessesin a 2-1 win in September 2023. “Lieke Martens played a beautiful through ball between two opponents. I thought I shouldn’t take a touch so just hit it. It went nicely into the top corner.”Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top flightMuch was expected of the women’s Eredivisie following the outstanding performances of the Orange Lionesses during the Wiegman era but the domestic top flight has been overtaken by the Spanish and Italian leagues. Other countries such as England, France and Germany, were already miles ahead. Most clubs are semi-pro and the minimum requirement for a licence is three players earning at least the minimum wage. The average age of the playing squads is getting lower and most of this squad play abroad. There is some stardust, though, including the USWNT player Lily Yohannes, who plays for Ajax. The average attendance is 1,100 and ESPN has the broadcast rights.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandThe knockout stages seem unlikely. The group is hard, including France and England, and the recent heavy defeat against Germany showed how far they have fallen. Too old, no form, and little belief in the manager.The Netherlands team guide was written by Steven Kooijman forDe Telegraaf.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballNetherlands women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We played at school and then next to the school there was a small astro pitch. I played there until training began at five o’clock and so it was every afternoon.”Euro 2025 is sure to showcase just how far women’s football has come | Emma HayesRead moreBühl is one of Europe’s best, a left-winger who is as two-footed as she is electric. The Bayern Munich player is in form, without any injury concerns and looking forward to the Euros. “You can see the sparkle in everyone’s eyes. We are ready,” she says.At 24, Bühl is reaching her peak years and believes her skills were honed during that formative period in Münstertal. “I learned everything I can there,” she says. “Shooting, with both my feet, dribbling because it was so small and also how to push through because I was always the youngest – and the only girl there.”At the start of the year the Germany coach, Christian Wück, spoke to Kicker about Bühl’s capabilities with both feet, which makes her incredibly difficult to defend against. “I don’t know anyone who is as two-footed as she is,” he said. “For her it makes no difference if she takes a free-kick with her left or her right. There are only a few players, in men’s or women’s football, who are capable of doing that.”View image in fullscreenKlara Bühl fires off a shot during the Nations League match against Austria.Photograph: Marvin Ibo Guengoer/Getty ImagesSo where did that come from? “My brother, who is a year and a half older than me, was left-footed and there aren’t that many left-footed players so I simply thought it was a bit cooler,” she says. “I was 10 or 12 so I thought about it and decided I would rather be left-footed. There were a few months when I went to training and just did everything with my left.”Bühl stood out at an early age, soon swapping SpVgg Untermünstertal for Freiburg, where she made her Bundesliga debut at the age of 15. She rose through the German under-age teams before being called up to the senior squad in 2019. She was mainly used as a substitute at the World Cup in France that year asGermany went out in the quarter-finals, meaning that Euro 2022 was her first major tournament as a key player.The showpiece in England, which had been delayed for a year because of the pandemic, had been going well for Bühl until, before the semi-final, disaster struck. She grimaces slightly as she describes what happened. “One evening I had a bit of a headache and then I could feel my throat as well so I went to bed early to sleep it off. Then in the middle of the night I woke up and thought ‘OK, this is not good’.

Even on the morning of the final I didn’t know whether I’d be able to be there so I just tried to use all the energy I had collected in that hotel room over a week and take it to the girls.”Does she look back and think what could have been? “I knew it was important to work through what had happened and to do that quite quickly. I also learned you should always enjoy being on the pitch because you never know what is going to happen.“The coronavirus was really something different but it could be an injury or something else. I learned to enjoy being able to play in a big tournament, so that was a lesson, and this time I hope to be able to play from start to finish.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They arrive in a confident mood having won five of their six games in 2025, scoring an impressive 26 goals along the way. Their final two warm-up matches were 4-0 and 6-0 victories against the Netherlands and Austria.“We are a bit more carefree and think less about how the goals are going to come and then they seem to come naturally,” says Bühl. “We are a bit more attack-minded now as well. Scoring a lot of goals gives you confidence that you will score.“Does that make us one of the favourites? I don’t think it is in our mentality to say that, but we have a lot of quality in the team and we have also built a good atmosphere. But the fact is that everyone has to be 100% on top of their game in every game, otherwise it won’t work.”View image in fullscreenKlara Bühl says Bayern Munich teammate and England midfielder Georgia Stanway is ‘a real playmaker’.Photograph: Tim Wegner/The GuardianBühl – who is alsoknown for her crocheting, having made the team’s mascots, a koala and an otter, for the past two tournaments – will come up against several Bayern teammates at the Euros. In the group phase there will be games against Pernille Harder’s Denmark and the Swedish trio of Magda Eriksson, Linda Sembrant and Julia Zigiotti Olme. Then, there may be a quarter-final against England and Georgia Stanway.“Georgia is super honest, very direct,” Bühl says. “That is really the English mentality that she has got, very funny On the pitch she is very good in the one-on-one duels and is a fighter. She is a real playmaker. She always wants the ball and she distributes it all the time. That includes the dangerous balls that can cut through two lines of a defence.”Stanway is also a budding tattooist. She has inked a few teammates, including Zigiotti Olme, so would Bühl let Stanway loose on her? Bühl laughs. “I have thought about maybe having one done. I would like a smiley here [she points to her left wrist]. But there hasn’t been the right moment yet. But I would say I can picture it happening. She does it really well.”On a more serious note, does she feel England have improved or gone backwards since beating Germany three years ago? “It will be hard to top the last Euros as that was at home and there was an incredible hype around the team that took the players along with it. If you know what it can be like, and it is not like that, it can be hard to get in the same flow.“Because of that I would say that they are not quite as good as with the 2022 Euros.” She pauses, then says, with a smile: “Without wishing to tread on any toes of course.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Euro 2025Germany women's football teamWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Sébastien Bozon/AFP/Getty ImagesLaurent Bonadei has boldly dropped some big names and in-form France will have their eyes on progress to the finalByAnna CarreauSun 29 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareThis article is part of theGuardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewFrance arrive in Switzerland in form. They won all six games in their Nations League group– the first team ever to do so – and were first to qualify for this tournament. Goals have been flowing and the defence has been solid. However, major tournaments and France do not normally go together; they are yet to win the Euros, World Cup or the Olympics. With this in mind the coach, Laurent Bonadei, who was Hervé Renard’s assistant until August 2024, describes France as outsiders.A few weeks before the tournament the coach made the radical decision to omit three highly experienced players: the captain, Wendie Renard, the vice-captain Eugénie Le Sommer, France’s most capped player, and Kenza Dali. They were key members of the dressing room. “I want different results for this team so I have gone with a different selection,” he said. Paris Saint-Germain’s Griedge Mbock is the new captain.France are in a tough group with England, Netherlands and Wales but aim to reach the final for the first time. The regeneration of the squad can be seen in every area: six players have no major tournament experience. Recent tournaments saw themlose a semi-final to Germanyat Euro 2022, aquarter-final on penalties against Australiaat the 2023 World Cup, before a quarter-final exit against Brazil at their home Olympics.Bonadei has returned to a 4-3-3 formation after experimenting with 3-4-3 when first appointed, a system he dumped after a 4-2 defeat by Spain in December. In attackLes Bleuescan count on the speed of Sandy Baltimore and Kadidiatou Diani and they seem to have re-established their defensive strength thanks to the emerging partnership of Mbock and Maëlle Lakrar at centre-back.The best performance of the Bonadei era came in a 4-0 dismantling of the tournament hosts Switzerland five weeks before the tournament. “It was a perfect evening because we didn’t concede a goal and we scored four,” Bonadei said. “We also hit the woodwork twice. We’re approaching 800 passes, with a 71% possession rate, which is what I asked of them.” This is not the time for them to get overconfident, though, because France have lost their shape in high-stakes games before.FranceThe coachLaurent Bonadei.Assistant to Renard for the 2023 World Cup and Paris Olympics, Bonadei was promoted to No 1 in August 2024, his first experience as a head coach of a senior side. The French football federation chose “continuity” despite less than ideal results at those two tournaments, and gave him a three-year contract. The former Toulon midfielder is a coach who develops players, after his experience with PSG’s youth teams and Nice’s B team. When he took charge, Bonadei talked about putting in place “a life project” rather than a “game project” and to form a tight-knit group with players who had previously experienced tensions in camp. The players have praised his human touch, and have appreciated that he travelled to see many of them at their clubs.Star playerIn a squad lacking stardustSakina Karchaouiis the best-known and most recognised individual. Indeed, the Paris Saint-Germain player recently became one of France’s vice-captains, showing her growing influence. Her position has also changed, with the left-back often deployed in midfield. “As a left-back I was so wide that I wasn’t happy with it and Bonadei wanted me to be more central to what we do,” she said. Today, one of Karchaoui’s main aims is to help the younger players and pass on her experience. As well as making sure France win that first major title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She used to be mainly a right winger but now plays as a false 9 and has started to rack up the goals. She scored 18 in the 2024-25 league campaign, adding seven assists, which made her the top scorer, and best player, in the Première Ligue. Quite a turnaround for a player who was not picked for the 2024 Olympics by Renard. She has two goals and an assist in her past five appearances for France and is now challenging Marie-Antoinette Katoto for a starting spot. “It’s a reflection of the season I have had,” she said. “I’ve been decisive with my club and that is down to the confidence I have in myself at the moment. I’m very happy that it’s working with the French team too.”Probable lineupView image in fullscreenStatus of domestic top flightThe Première Ligue turned professional at the start of the 2024-25 season, but two teams, Lyon and PSG, had completed that milestone long ago. The players do not yet have a collective agreement but are paid at least the minimum wage (£1,148 a month). The level is improving but Lyon are still dominating, and finished last season 10 points ahead of second-placed PSG. France collectively failed to capitalise on a home World Cup in 2019 and is still behind in its development of women’s football, whether in terms of attendances (average 1,610, behind England, Spain and Germany), broadcasting (two weekend matches on TV) and the investment in women’s football. As a result, many young players move abroad while some clubs such as Dijon, Le Havre, Reims and Montpellier are even looking to sell their women’s sections to cut costs.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandSemi-finals again.Les Bleuesmay be in the group of death with England and the Netherlands but have shown a new collective strength and should proceed to the knockouts. Once there they may face Germany, traditionally their bête noire at major tournaments.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballFrance women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here at last was the moment many had come for, one that didn’t matter as far as the match was concerned but that felt almost bigger than all that went before, a comment perhaps on this competition and the dimension of the man everyone was watching now as ever. Lionel Messi stood outside the area, a little to the right, the ball at his feet, a wall built before him.Paris Saint-Germainhad been 4-0 up for an hour and his team were long since defeated but maybe he could depart his way, leaving something else to remember him by.He took a step back, ran forward in that familiar way and curled the free‑kick into the bodies dressed in blue. This time it wasn’t to be; this time, reality was something else, implacably imposed by the European champions. The day before, Javier Mascherano admitted his Miami side had not really expected to get the chance to play this game and when it came to it PSG proved the coach right.Not until the second half of this match, by which time they had already conceded four, were Miami really given the chance to even participate here.Paris Saint-Germain 4-0 Inter Miami: Club World Cup, last 16 – as it happenedRead moreInstead, Luis Enrique’s team took them apart, asthey have many othersthis season – two from João Neves, one from Achraf Hakimi and an own goal from Tomás Avilés before half-time meant they eased into the quarter-finals.From the kick-off, Luis Enrique’s side booted long towards the corner and straight out of play, giving the ball to their opponents for the first and pretty much the last time. It was not just that PSG were a goal up on 5min 4sec or that they had all the ball. In fact, they didn’t, by their standards: 73% felt quite low, and PSG did respond a bit in the second half. It was not that they took 19 shots, that they scored four in the end, the score never giving their opponents the illusion of hope, it was something simpler – just an overwhelming and, in truth, unsurprising superiority.Football offers a “What if?” but this result was as expected, the game essentially an expression of what it actually is. No offence, just a reality: a club with a budget 15 times the size of the other; the best team in Europe against another that’s not the best in Major League Soccer and whose appearance in this competition was engineered by Gianni Infantino; the youngest, most dynamic, well-drilled side there is against some whowerethe best once but now watched these athletes fly around in front of them. In front, behind, to the side of them: PSG’s players were everywhere. Inter’s could hardly get in the game.By the break Messi had had just 14 touches, Luis Suárez 17. But a better measure was what was happening in the middle. Sergio Busquets had completed 10 passes, Fede Redondo 12. PSG were four up by then, all scored with a clinical simplicity; if there were not more it was because there didn’t need to be.View image in fullscreenJoão Neves gives PSG the lead.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockNeves had headed in the first, dashing on to a free-kick from behind an Inter defence that didn’t see him and didn’t look for him. A second, by Fabián Ruiz on 15 minutes, was ruled out for offside but had been almost as easy. Hakimi was blocked from close range, PSG finding little resistance, before Vitinha’s volley was stopped by Oscar Ustari and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia curled wide. When on 24 minutes Inter did advance a bit, it felt as much like a releasing of the pressure as an actual attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was half an hour in and it was the first time. The game also went back to normal, Nuno Mendes having one shot cleared off the line.Yet it was only one goal and the pace slowed, only for PSG to suddenly burst into life again at the end of the half, bringing three goals in six minutes. Busquets was robbed for the first, Ruiz rolling across for Neves to side-foot into an empty net to make it 2-0. Avilés then put a cross into his own net as PSG picked Inter apart again. Then Vitinha’s pass sent Bradley Barcola dashing in on another diagonal to find Hakimi. The first shot flew off the bar but the second was finished off.At half-time, Hakimi went off with Suárez and it was easy to imagine a conversation that said something like:that’ll do now. And it would.Miami played a bit in the second half, as much as they were allowed to. There were some shots, some moves, Messi had a header saved by Gigi Donnarumma, and then his moment, something for the montage, the moments, the mobiles held up, but this was done. It had been from the start.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Paris Saint-GermainInter MiamiClub World CupUS sportsLionel MessinewsShareReuse this content"

We have so much talent in England so it’s only right that we utilise it to its full potential. With the right head coach, with the right staff, with the right mindset, with the right people, you can accomplish anything.”Bundesliga clubs weigh up bids for Manchester City’s James McAteeRead moreIt is a message Thomas Tuchel will no doubt have taken note of as he joined the celebrations. With the World Cup less than 12 months away, the example set by Lee Carsley’s side in emulating the back‑to‑back triumphs under Dave Sexton in 1982 and 1984 should give England’s head coach plenty of reasons to feel optimistic about finally ending the wait for a title at senior level.The player of the tournament,Harvey Elliott, and the no‑nonsense Toulouse defender Charlie Cresswell were also part of the squad in Georgia under Carsley two years ago, while several others have shown they have the capability to make the step up sooner rather than later. They join the former Tottenham winger Danny Thomas, who played in those successful teams more than 40 years ago, as the only Englishmen to win this competition twice.In particular the outstanding Elliot Anderson – who played for the Wallsend Boys Club that produced Peter Beardsley and Michael Carrick – could provide an immediate answer to Tuchel’s issues at the base of his midfield after excelling in a deeper role than he plays for Nottingham Forest. Tino Livramento, the only squad member in Slovakia to have won a senior cap, looks ready to make one of the full‑back positions his own while the captain, James McAtee, also has the ability to make the step up if he can play more regularly at club level after opting not to join Manchester City for the Club World Cup. The 22-year-old, who is attracting interested from Eintracht Frankfurt, RB Leipzig and Stuttgart in the Bundesliga, placed his trust in Carsley instead.The softly spoken 51-year-old blooded several members of his last victorious squad at senior level during hissix months as England’s interim managerafter the departure of Gareth Southgate, including Noni Madueke, Curtis Jones and Morgan Gibbs-White. Add to that Jarrad Branthwaite, Adam Wharton, Liam Delap, Jobe Bellingham and Jamie Gittens, all of whom were unavailable for this tournament because of injury or Club World Cup commitments, and Tuchel could be sitting on a goldmine.View image in fullscreenLee Carsley talked about ‘thinking outside the box’ to lead England to victory.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersOnly a handful of Sexton’s players who defeated a Germany side containing Rudi Völler in 1982 and then Spain two years later went on tomake an impact for the seniors, with Mark Hateley – top scorer in 1984 – ending his career with the most senior caps (32). But Carsley stressed before the final the importance of trying to establish “a period of domination” at youth level and said it had taken a completely new approach to mould this group into winners. “The lazy thing as coaches would be to try and just reproduce what we did last time, but we’ve done it differently,” he said.“We thought outside the box with our training, with our tactics, with the way that we wanted to play with our squad selection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McAtee and Elliott face uncertain futures despite their exploits in Slovakia, while Rowe took a gamble by swapping Norwich for the south of France last year. He will be joined by the former Burnley defender CJ Egan‑Riley, who was brought on in the final for his first appearance of the tournament as a makeshift striker, while Jarell Quansah, called up by Tuchel in his first squad, looks certain to leave Liverpool for Bayer Leverkusen.“Ultimately I need game time and I believe in myself that I can possibly push for [a recall],” Quansah said. “The standard of England now is unbelievable. You have to be world-class to get in and around it. It will be a huge privilege if I could but it’s going to be hard.“There’s a lot of experience in the side with the seniors now to hopefully get one over the line.

While 475 of these were shot down or lost, the onslaught marked the “most massive airstrike” on the country since Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for Ukraine’s air force, told the Associated Press.The bombing appeared to target several regions far from the frontline, he said, including in western Ukraine. The Russian army said on Sunday its overnight attack hit Ukrainian military-industrial complex sites and oil refineries, and that it had intercepted three Ukrainian drones overnight.The scale of the attacks called into question comments made on Friday by Vladimir Putin, in which the Russian president said that Moscow was ready for a fresh round of direct peace talks in Istanbul.Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Sunday that the barrage of bombs in fact showed that Putin had decided to pursue war. “Moscow will not stop as long as it has the capability to launch massive strikes,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.In the past week alone, Russia had attacked Ukraine with more than 114 missiles, more than 1,270 drones and nearly 1,100 glide bombs, he said.“This war must be brought to an end – pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection,” he added. “Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defence – the thing that best protects lives.”He reiterated Ukraine’s willingness to buy US air defence systems, adding that his country counted on the “leadership, political will, and support of the United States,Europeand all our partners”.Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air force said an F-16 warplane supplied by its western partners had crashed after sustaining damage while shooting down air targets, killing the pilot. “The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude,” the air force said on Telegram.The pilot did not have time to eject, it added.Local officials in Ukraine said the strikes had killed two people and injured at least 12, including two children. As air raid sirens rang out across the country, residents in Kyiv took refuge in bomb shelters and metro stations, while in the city of Drohobych, in the western Lviv region, a large fire broke out at an industrial facility after a drone attack that cut electricity to parts of the city.Explosions were heard in Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and the Ivano-Frankivsk regions, witnesses and regional governors told Reuters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a Sunday eveningpost, the president urged Republicans concerned about adding to the debt not to “go too crazy”, and reminded them that elected officials who cross him tend not to stay in office long. “REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected”, the president wrote.Wavering Republicans probably understood Trump’s comment loud and clear, coming just hours after one of their number, Thom Tillis, a North Carolina senator, voted against advancing the bill on Saturday and was subjected to a torrent of threats and attacks from the president. Tillisannounced on Sundaythat he would not stand for re-election in the 2026 midterms.Even before the CBO’s estimate, Republicans were at odds over the contours of the legislation, with some resisting the cost-saving proposals toreduce spending on Medicaidand food aid programs, even as other Republicans say those proposals don’t go far enough. Republicans are slashing the programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8tn in Trump tax breaks put in place during his first term.The push-pull was on vivid display on Saturday night as a routine procedural vote to take up the legislation in the Senatewas held open for hoursas Vice-President JD Vance and Republican leaders met with several holdouts. The bill ultimately advanced in a 51-49 vote, but the path ahead is fraught, with voting on amendments still to come.Senate Republicans scrambling to pass tax-and-spend bill by Trump deadlineRead moreStill, many Republicans are disputing the CBO estimates and the reliability of the office’s work. To hoist the bill to passage, they are using a different budget baseline that assumes the Trump tax cuts expiring in December have already been extended, essentially making them cost-free in the budget.The CBO on Saturday released a separate analysis of the GOP’s preferred approach that found the Senate bill would reduce deficits by about $500bn.Democrats and economists decry the GOP’s approach as “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks.In addition, Democrats note that under the traditional scoring system, the Republican bill would violate the Senate’s Byrd Rule that forbids the legislation from increasing deficits after 10 years.In a Sunday letter to Jeff Merkley, an Oregon senator and the top Democrat on the Senate budget committee, CBO director Phillip Swagel said the office estimates that the finance committee’s portion of the bill, also known as Title VII, “increases the deficits in years after 2034” under traditional scoring.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Deposits are topped up by the government, up to a maximum £1,000 a year.However, the Treasury committee said that the dual-purpose design of the Lisa may be steering people away from more suitable savings products.Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the Treasury committee, said: “The committee is firmly behind the objectives of the lifetime Isa, which are to help those who need it on to the property ladder and to help people save for retirement from an early age. The question is whether the lifetime Isa is the best way to spend billions of pounds over several years to achieve those goals.“We know that the government is looking at Isa reform imminently, which means this is the perfect time to assess if this is the best way to help the people who need it.”Cash Lisas could suit those saving for a first home but may not achieve the best outcome for those using them as a retirement savings product, as they are unable to invest in higher-risk but potentially higher-return products such as bonds and equities, the report said.Raising another issue, the committee said that any savings held in a Lisa can affect eligibility for universal credit or housing benefit under the current system, even though this does not apply to other personal or workplace pension schemes.The committee said if this was not changed, the accounts should “include warnings that the lifetime Isa is an inferior product for anyone who might one day be in receipt of universal credit”.Another issue raised by the committee is the 25% charge for withdrawing funds because of unforeseen circumstances.The committee noted that in 2023-24, almost twice as many people made an unauthorised withdrawal from the products (99,650), incurring the withdrawal penalty, as used them to buy a home (56,900). This should be considered a possible indication that the product is not working as intended, the MPs warned.Savers can put up to £4,000 into a Lisa each year, until they reach 50, and must make their first payment before the age of 40. They can withdraw money without a charge if they are buying their first home, are aged 60 or over, or are terminally ill with less than 12 months to live.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts spending on bonuses paid to account holders will cost the Treasury about £3bn over the five years to 2029-30.The committee questioned whether this product was the best use of public money given the strain on the public finances. It also raised concerns that the product may not be well targeted towards those in need of financial support and could be subsidising the cost of a first home for wealthier people.There are restrictions on when Lisas can be used to buy a first home, including that the property must cost £450,000 or less.The consumer champion Martin Lewishas long campaignedfor a revamp of the scheme, including a reduction in the withdrawal charge to 20% and upping the £450,000 house price cap. He welcomed the findings, saying: “If a Lisa is used to buy a property above the threshold, there should be no fine, they should get back at least what they put in.”Explore more on these topicsIsasSavingsConsumer affairsInvestmentsInvestment IsasnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a challenge the government appears alive to, with agri-tech includedin its industrial strategyearlier this month.The company has invested £80,000 in the Agras T50 drones, made by the Chinese company DJI and designed for agricultural use.Distributing potash or phosphate by drone rather than by hand will be “two to three times faster than walking”, Amery says. This will mean it can be applied in a more targeted way, reducing the amount of fertiliser needed for the crop, which ends up in the 25m bags of salad it sells each year through the UK’s largest supermarkets.Despite the long-running discussion over whether machines will replace humans in agricultural jobs, Amery said the investment would boost morale. “It’s about staff retention, taking out an unfavourable part of the job,” he adds. “We will pay the operators more. With more pay, staff are more likely to stay.”While such drones are already in use on farms in North and South America, asdocumented in detailon social media, they remain a novelty in the UK. The Watercress Company’s drones are currently grounded, as the business awaits the permits required by the aviation watchdog, the Civil Aviation Authority.However, Amery hopes they will soon be fitted with hoppers and whizzing above the watercress beds across the grower’s 20 hectares of land, spread across 12 Hampshire and Dorset farms. The route for each field can be programmed in advance, while 20-year-old employee George Mathews has been trained up and has obtained a licence to pilot the drones.Even though The Watercress Company follows growing methods largely unchangedsince Victorian times– when the leaves first gained popularity in the UK as a source of nutrition, especially for the urban poor – it is no stranger to technology.Today’s crop is still grown in watercress beds fed by natural streams that have been in use since the 1880s, although the leaves are now cut every other day between May and October using a bespoke harvester.View image in fullscreenThe crop.Photograph: Joanna Partridge/The GuardianThe grower is also trialling multispectral cameras, which are able to capture images in various spectral bands – or ranges of wavelengths – far beyond what the human eye can see. The images can produce a “heatmap” of the fields, which are analysed by AI to assess the location of any crop problems.The Watercress Company is pursuing the kind of innovation the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) wants to see adopted by more UK farms, as food producers look to work in a more efficient and more sustainable way.However, at a time whenmany farmers are feeling the financial squeeze, the NFU believes that few will have the money, or confidence, to invest in new and potentially untested technology.This is also essential to improve productivity in the farming sector, the NFU says, warning that without it, the UK risks slipping further behind its international competitors.“Driving forward productivity to build domestic food production should be on every government’s list,” says Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU. “Among our European neighbours there is evidence that we are falling behind and are not as productive in some areas.”In the industrial strategy, agri-tech, along with precision breeding, has been included as areas of focus within the growth sector plan and the NFU believes this will help farming businesses to “become more productive, sustainable and resilient”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was able to secure £20,000 of funding, representing around a quarter of its drone investment, from the government’s shared prosperity fund, through its local council.However, Amery says the business is rarely able to access funding such as R&D tax credits, which are only available to companies which are required to pay corporation tax. Partnerships, like The Watercress Company and many others in the farming sector, as well as sole traders, do not pay corporation and are therefore ineligible.This has not put the grower off seeking out the latest gadgets to improve his crop. “Innovation is usually driven by a desire to overcome a problem,” says Amery. “I think we get one major innovation every five to 10 years, one that is a game-changer.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingDrones (non-military)AgricultureFood & drink industryRural affairsHampshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are miles of rolling lava fields, untouched forest and obsidian mountains. At night, the darkness and silence stretch on indefinitely.This is one of America’s newest national monuments. It’s also one of the most threatened.In January, the Pit River Tribe celebrated a victory decades in the making whenJoe Bidengranted federal protection to nearly 230,000 acres of forested lands with the creation of the Sáttítla Highlands national monument.“The awe-inspiring geological wonders collectively described here as the Sáttítla Highlands have framed the homelands of Indigenous communities and cultures for millennia,” the proclamation reads, recognizing the area as “profoundly sacred”.Biden designates two new national monuments after advocacy from tribesRead moreThe tribe, along with environmental groups, had fought for years to safeguard the land from industrial energy development. The area just north of Mount Shasta, popular for recreation and some of the darkest nighttime skies in the US, is the site of the tribe’s creation story and regularly used for ceremonies.“This is a healing place for our people. It’s really tied to our traditional health,” said Brandy McDaniels, a member of the Pit River Tribe. “We’ve spent a lifetime trying to defend this area.”The designation ensures no future energy development and mineral extraction can occur on the land while keeping it available for public recreation.But then in March, Donald Trump said he would undo Biden’s action and roll back protections for Sáttítla and Chuckwalla national monument, which he argued “lock up vast amounts of land from economic development and energy production”.Although legal experts say there is no clear mechanism for a president to rescind monument protections – only to shrink them – the justice department argued in a recent memo that it is in fact within Trump’s authority to “alter a prior declaration”, suggesting the administration will move forward with efforts to remove national monument designations for hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness.View image in fullscreenNight sky view from Mount Hoffman toward Mount Shasta with Little Glass Mountain Obsidian Flow in the middle ground.Photograph: Bob Wick/USDA Forest ServiceNow, as the tribe tries to move forward after years of pushing with limited resources, pro bono attorneys and “scraping up every cent” to get to court hearings and protests, another battle could be on the horizon.‘Almost like you’re in another world’Located five hours north-east of the California state capitol in a sparsely populated region, Sáttítla is far off the beaten path.“You’re not trying to get somewhere else if you’re going there. It’s very dark, it’s very quiet, there’s no cellphone reception,” said Nick Joslin, the policy and advocacy director with the Mount Shasta Bioregional Ecology Center, an area environmental advocacy group. “It’s very easy to get lost.”The monument’s 224,676 acres include portions of the Modoc, Shasta-Trinity and Klamath national forests, are home to endangered and rare flora and fauna, massive underground volcanic aquifers that supply water to millions of people and store as much water as 200 of California’s largest surface reservoirs combined. Due to heavy snow, it’s largely only accessible by car for a few months of the year.The landscape, with its islands of old-growth pine forests, snow covered mountainsides and scattered lakes, is stunning and otherworldly. It is filled with unique geological features such as ice caves, lava tubes and lava flows, Joslin said. Then there is the half-million-year-old dormant volcano, roughly 10 times the size of Mount St Helens, within the monument. Locals routinely camp, hike the hundreds of miles of trails or take boats out on Medicine Lake.“It’s a place that’s known for its high quality of silence that you can’t experience in any other place, and also its night skies,” McDaniels said. “Depending on where you’re at, people describe it as it’s almost like you’re in another world, like you’re on another planet.”There are markers of human disruption. Checkerboard swaths of forest where trees have been clear cut, and large stretches of land with second-growth trees that look like toothpicks from the air.View image in fullscreenMedicine Lake in the Sáttítla Highlands.Photograph: EcoFlightFor Indigenous people, this area is sacred as the place of the creation narrative of the Pit River Tribe. The tribe holds important ceremonies there and collects staple foods such as berries from manzanita and currant plants, sugar pine seeds, and plants used in medicinal capacities.“The landscape of the area literally tells the history of our people. In that way, it is part of the true history of the United States of America,” McDaniels said.An undeveloped landscape under threatThe tribe fought to protect the area for nearly three decades, she added, challenging geothermal development and large-scale logging.Because Sáttítla is a volcanic area, there was speculation that there might be enough heat to develop geothermal resources, and in the 1980s the federal government awarded leases on thousands of acres to private energy companies, said Deborah A Sivas, the director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford.The Environmental Law Clinic represented the tribe in a series of litigation challenging the extension of some leases and proposed projects, arguing the federal government had failed to consult the tribe, Sivas said. Industrial energy development would have required a dramatic transformation of the landscape to achieve and the tribe was opposed to such an intrusion on sacred land, and feared the hydraulic fracturing used to generate geothermal energy could pollute the aquifers.Ultimately there wasn’t the resource potential initially thought, Sivas said. The final settlement with Calpine, the last remaining company with control over the land, was signed just two days after the monument declaration.While there has been broad community support for a monument, Joslin noted, some elected officials in the conservative region have been more tepid.Doug LaMalfa, a congressperson whose district includes Sáttítla, described Biden’s action as “executive overreach” and argued it would “create unnecessary challenges for land management, particularly in wildfire prevention and maintaining usage for local residents”.But there has been no organized opposition against the monument.Presidents have the authority to give protected status to land with cultural, scientific or historic resources of national significance, and Biden and other presidents have typically used it for conservation and to support tribes.In the case of Sáttítla, the designation protects against industrial energy development, but does not prevent recreation, Sivas said, or bar the US Forest Service from doing wildfire management work.But Trump has taken a combative stance on national monuments as part of his pro-energy agenda, slashing the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase national monumentsduring his first term(a move that was later reversed by Biden). Earlier this month, the Department of Justiceissued a memorandum opinionarguing that Trump has the authority to not only shrink but entirely abolish national monuments created by his predecessor.View image in fullscreenBolam Creek in the Sáttítla Highlands.Photograph: EcoFlightBut the legal argument for that position appears tenuous. Sivas said the Antiquities Act, the statute under which national monuments are designated, does not give the president the authority to do so.“There’s no language in there that suggests that he could de-designate or roll back what prior presidents have done,” Sivas said. She added that the recent argument made by the administration was not particularly persuasive.Given the lack of opposition to Sáttítla, the move seems designed to instead test the limits of the president’s power, Sivas said. If the administration does proceed with a rollback, legal action will follow, she added, which she expects will make its way to the supreme court.“We will be filing litigation if that happens. This is a kind of a canary in the coal mine.”McDaniels described the efforts to rollback protections as “perplexing”. She pointed to the interior secretary Doug Burgum’s address to the National Congress of American Indians in which he indicated he didn’t believe the nation’s “most precious places”, such as parks and monuments, should be targeted for development.But the tribe is focused on celebrating the monument, informing the public about the significance of these lands and ensuring it continues to serve as a healing place for the Indigenous people who have endured a long history of genocidal acts and injustices, McDaniels said.“Truth and healing cannot begin if we’re constantly fighting to protect our sacred lands,” McDaniels said.“That’s what we don’t want for our kids, our grandkids and all future generations. Everybody deserves the right to experience the gifts that this land makes available for people.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaTrump administrationJoe BidenUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Poor countries are labouring under a mountain of debt, and the continuing cost of living crisis in many countries is fuelling populism and abacklash against green policy.Toni, a respected Brazilian economist, told the Guardian: “There’s no doubt that the wars that we’ve seen – military wars and trade wars … are very damaging – physically, economically, socially – and they divert the direction and the attention from climate.”Vulnerable countries fear their concerns will be lost amid the push for militarisation. “Spending more on defence means spending less on climate,” said Michai Robertson, adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis).But the questions for Belém cannot be ignored. Can the world cut greenhouse gas emissions far enough and fast enough to stabilise global temperatures? Is the lack of progress inevitable when hundreds of countries are trying to agree a way forward, or are more sinister forces at play, trying to throw up roadblocks? Has a recent meeting in Bonn done anything to bring more resolution and collaboration?Beyond 1.5C of heating, the impacts of climate chaos – heatwaves, sea level rises, species die-offs, droughts, floods and storms – will rapidly become catastrophic and irreversible. And we now know that the world could already be traversing vital “tipping points”, beyond which runaway climate change will be impossible to recover from within human timeframes.Anna Rasmussen, the chief negotiator for Aosis, said: “Around the world, the‘unprecedented’ has become our new norm. The economics of small island states are stymied by disasters we did not cause. Not even a year ago, the Caribbean was ravaged by Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic ever recorded.”Nationally determined contributionsSince the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. Temperatures are affected by the cumulative quantity of carbon in the atmosphere, so every additional tonne counts: scientists have now calculated that we can only carry on producing current levels of carbon dioxidefor two more years, ensuring the breach of the 1.5C limit becomes permanent.But while temperatures have soared, and weather records have tumbled, any sense of urgency inside the negotiating halls seems to have cooled. Two weeks of preliminary talks, intended to lay the groundwork for Cop30,have just finished in Bonn. They started two days late because countries could not agree an agenda, and ended without clear negotiating texts for the key points.Some of the frustrating lack of progress is inevitable, as countries grapple with geopolitics and the complexity of getting nearly 200 governments in line. But several negotiators told the Guardian they saw more sinister motives in play – deliberate attempts by some recalcitrant countries or their allies, usually fossil fuel producers, to throw up roadblocks.“These are not accidents we are seeing, they are attempts to slow things down, no question,” said one. At one point, according to an observer, a key discussion degenerated into speculation about the buttons on a putative website presenting data, rather than addressing the substantive points.At the core of the Cop30 summit will be the national plans on emissions. Known as“nationally determined contributions”(NDCs), these are the bedrock of the Paris agreement, setting out not just overall targets on how far governments intend to cut emissions over the next decade, but also indicating what measures might be taken in different sectors to meet those goals, such as boosting renewable energy or improving efficiency.The Brazilian hosts of theCop30summit are urging governments to finish their NDCs by September, so the UN can assess them ahead of the scheduled start of Cop30 in November.“We are really far from where we need to go, even in quantity of NDCs, let alone how ambitious [they are] and the quality of them,” Toni told the Guardian. “I don’t think there is any excuse [for countries not to come up with new NDCs]. We are expecting NDCs that are improved, both in terms of ambitions and on their quality.”Most closely watched will be China. The world’s second biggest economy and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases is also theglobal renewable energy powerhouse. China’s green economy has outstripped all expectations, with about a third of electricity now coming from clean sources, and renewable generation capacity on track to double by 2030, compared with 2022 levels.China is also the biggest exporter of renewable energy components and electric vehicles, so stands to benefit from other countries setting stiffer targets on emissions. Experts believe thatChinacould halve its emissions by 2035 without difficulty – yet the government is thought to be considering tabling reductions of only about 10%.Coal is the reason. While coal fell to its lowest share of electricity generation on record in May 2024, this year a surge ofapprovals of new coal-fired power plants, and investment in mining, has alarmed analysts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Approving a new wave of large-scale coal projects risks creating overcapacity, stranded assets, and higher transition costs. That will ultimately undermine progress toward a cleaner, more flexible power system.”The EU is locked in tense negotiations over its carbon target for 2040, which will be thrashed out next week. That target, which is expected to involve a cut in carbon of at least 90% compared with 1990 levels, would be the steepest yet presented, but arguments are raging over whether, and how much of, this could be met bytrading carbon creditswith other countries. When the 2040 figure is agreed, it must then also be translated into a commensurate 2035 goal – the end date for the current commitment period under the Paris agreement – and published along with further policy details as a fully fledged NDC in September.Other countries, including major emerging economies such as India, are still to submit their plans. “There is a lot of watching and waiting going on,” says Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a prominent thinktank in India and one of the Cop30 envoys chosen by Brazil to support the aims of the talks. “We should be judging countries on implementation – climate leaders are those who get things done, rather than those who say things.”A few countries have already presented their NDCs. The UK’s is judged to be fairly ambitious, with an 81% cut in emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2035. Canada’s effort and Japan’s have both been found “insufficient”, however, by the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors the levels of countries’ emissions reduction.A further problem is that none of the NDCs so far, which are pegged to 2035 or 2040, have contained revisions of countries’ existing near-term targets. Current NDCs, set at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021,are inadequate to stay within 1.5C. At Glasgow, countries agreed that the “ratchet” – the system for updating NDCs – should allow for the upward revision of targets more frequently than the five-yearly system laid out in the Paris agreement.Disappointingly, no countries have availed themselves of the opportunity, said Niklas Höhne, of the NewClimate Institute. “[To stay within the 1.5C limit] needs drastic reductions. None of the NDCs on the table have updated 2030 numbers. But if we do not do more by 2030, it will be very difficult to catch up later.”Last year’s conference of the parties (Cop) focused on finance, and that will also play a major role this year. Developing countries need assistance from the rich world, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. At Cop29,they were assured of $1.3tn a year by 2035, with $300bn of this coming in the form of public finance from developed countries.Those numbers will be harder to reach now that the US has pulled out of climate finance and other forms of overseas aid. Poor countries want to see concrete plans for how the financial flows will be reached, and Brazil is working with last year’s host, Azerbaijan, on a “Baku to Belém roadmap” due in October.Yalchin Rafiyev, the chief negotiator for Azerbaijan at Cop29 last year in Baku, warned that not enough was being done to meet the financial commitments made last year, particularly from the taxpayer-funded development banks. “We have seen very low-profile engagement of MDBs [multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank] in climate-related issues,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “We have opened the Baku to Belém roadmap to $1.3tn for wider stakeholders for their written submissions. So far, we have received 102 submissions, and only two of them are from MDBs. That’s quite surprising, because they have always expressed their interest to be part of the process.”Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, the chief negotiator for Panama, said being able to show substantial progress on finance was crucial. “We need to define what is the roadmap to close the finance gap towards developing nations, because if we don’t address that, if we don’t fill that gap, if we don’t provide these resources, then we cannot expect developing nations to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement,” he said. “It’s all about the money.”Brazil’s agenda for Cop30 also gives little room for what many activists still see as the key question: fossil fuels. At Cop28, in Dubai, countries made a landmark commitmentto “transition away from fossil fuels”. At Cop29, attempts to flesh that out with a timeframe and details of what it would mean were stymied by opposition from petrostates, including Saudi Arabia.Activists had hoped to bring the commitment back to Cop30, to be elaborated and formalised into a coherent plan that countries would sign up to. But Brazil appears wary of reopening the debate, and would prefer to regard such past resolutions as settled. The presidency has been resistant even to the idea of a “cover text”, the catch-all outcome document that in most Copscaptures the key resolutions.At Bonn, it was not clear where in the Cop30 agenda it would be possible to discuss the transition away from fossil fuels. “We tried to get to discuss it [in various forums] but we keep getting it moved away,” said Stela Herschmann, of the Observatório do Clima network of civil society groups in Brazil. “It’s like nobody wants us.”Despite the frustrations of the last two weeks of pre-talks in Bonn, the goodwill that Brazil enjoys as host nation was much in evidence. The presidency has drawn on expertise from around the world, creating a “circle” of the former Cop presidents since the Paris agreement was forged in 2015, a “circle” of finance ministers from around the world, and a group of economists. Indigenous people will play a key role, with a “global ethical stocktake” intended to reflect their concerns, involving Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, and well-known climate activists including Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland. Brazil has also set out an “action agenda” to track progress on initiatives from previous Cops and to foreground key issues related to the climate crisis, such as food and agriculture, forestry and nature, water, oceans, social justice and equity.The irony is that the most substantive issue of Cop30 – the NDCs – will be out of Brazil’s hands, decided in national capitals long before any leaders hop on planes for Belém. “We don’t negotiate NDCs at Cops – this is nationally determined, so what we will have at Cop30 is the report of those nationally determined decisions that have been taken,” said Toni. “And yes, that can be frustrating. There can be a good picture or very bad picture, we will see, but it will be a reflection of national politics more than anything. We are obviously the designated president of Cop30, but it is a collective responsibility.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisUnited NationsGreenhouse gas emissionsBrazilChinanewsShareReuse this content"

The condition, known asalpha-gal syndrome, has proliferated from just a few dozen known cases in 2009 to as many as 450,000 now.“We thought this thing was relatively rare 10 years ago but it’s become more and more common and it’s something I expect to continue to grow very rapidly,” said Brandon Hollingsworth, an expert at the University of South Carolina who hasresearched the tick’s expansion.“We’ve seen an explosive increase in these ticks, which is a concern. I imagine alpha-gal will soon include the entire range of the tick, which could become the entire eastern half of the US as there’s not much to stop them. It seems like an oddity now but we could end up with millions of people with an allergy to meat.”The exact number of alpha-gal cases is unclear due to patchy data collection but it’s likely to be a severe undercount as people may not link their allergic reaction to the tick bites. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has saidaround 110,000 cases have been documented since 2010 but acknowledges the true number could be as high as 450,000.Cases will rise further as the ticks spread, aided by their adaptability to local conditions, according to Laura Harrington, an entomologist and disease specialist at Cornell University. “With their adaptive nature and increasing temperatures, I don’t see many limits to these ticks over time,” she said.View image in fullscreenA female lone star tick, or Amblyomma americanum collected in Maryland on 21 Jun 2017.Photograph: BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesAlpha-gal is a confounding condition because it doesn’t cause an immediate allergic reaction, unlike a peanut allergy, with symptoms often appearing several hours after consuming meat. The syndrome is not caused by a pathogen but spurs an allergy to a sugar molecule found in mammals and an array of other things, from toothpaste to medical equipment. Researchers think the condition can wane over time but is also worsened by further tick bites.This leads to a confusing and fraught experience for the growing number of Americans with alpha-gal, who are now girding for another expected hot summer full of ticks. “The ticks are rampant this year, I’ve pulled 10 ticks off me this season alone, it feels like they are uncontrollable at the moment,” said Heather O’Bryan, a horticulturist in Roanoke, Virginia, who has alpha-gal. “They are so disgusting. I’m not afraid of a lot, but I’m afraid of ticks.”In 2019, O’Bryan suffered full body hives and struggled to breathe after eating a pork sausage. “It was terrifying experience, I didn’t know I had an allergy but it almost killed me,” she said. She now avoids products containing mammal-derived elements, such as certain toothpastes and even toilet paper, due to adverse reactions.Dairy, another mammalian product, is also off limits. “I’ve learned what I can eat now, but I was so sad when I realized I couldn’t have pizza again, I remember crying in front of a frozen pizza in the supermarket aisle,” she said.There is now an “almost constant” stream of new members to the Facebook alpha-gal support groups that O’Bryan is part of, she said, with her region of Virginia now seemingly saturated by the condition. “Everyone knows someone who has it, I talk a friend off a ledge once a month when they’ve been bitten because they are so afraid they have it and are freaking out,” she said.Lone star ticks are aggressive and can speedily follow a human target if they detect them. “They will hunt you, they are like a cross between a lentil and a velociraptor,” said Sharon Pitcairn Forsyth, a conservationist who lives in the Washington DC area.A particular horror is the prospect of brushing up against vegetation containing a massed ball of juvenile lone star ticks, know as a “tick bomb”, that can deliver thousands of tick bites. “They are so tiny you can’t see them but you have to take it seriously or you’ll never get them off you,” said Forsyth, who now carries around a lint roller to remove such clusters.After being diagnosed with alpha-gal, Forsyth set up onlineresourcesabout the condition to help spread awareness andadvocatefor better food labeling to include alpha-gal warnings. “I get calls from doctors asking questions about this because they justdon’t know about it,” she said. “I’m not a medical professional, so I just send them the research papers.”As the climate heats up, due to the burning of fossil fuels, ticks are able to shift to areas that are becoming agreeably warm for them. Growing numbers of deer, which host certain ticks, and sprawling housing development into natural habitats is also causing more interactions with ticks. “Places where houses push up against habitats and parks where nature has regrown are where we are seeing cases,” said Hollingsworth.But much is still unknown, such as why lone star ticks, which have long been native to the US, suddenly started causing these allergic reactions. Symptoms can also be alarmingly varied – Forsyth said she rarely eats out now because of concerns of contamination in the food and even that alpha-gal could be carried to her airborne, via the steam of cooked meat.“Some people are scared to leave the house, it’s hard to avoid,” she said. “Many people who get it are over 50, so the first symptom some of them have is a heart attack.”So how far can alpha-gal spread? Cases have been found inEuropeandAustralia, although in low numbers, while in the US it’s assumed lone star ticks won’t be able to shift west of the Rocky mountains. But other tick species might also be able to spread alpha-gal syndrome –a recent scientific paper foundthe western black legged tick and the black legged tick, also called the deer tick, could also cause the condition.Hanna Oltean, an epidemiologist at Washington state department of health,said it was “very surprising” to find a case of alpha-gal in Washington state from a person bitten by a tick locally, suggesting the western black legged tick could be a culprit.“The range is spreading and emerging in new areas so the risk is increasing over time,” Oltean said. “Washington state is very far from the range and the risk remains very low here. But we don’t know enough about the biology of how ticks spread the syndrome.”The spread of alpha-gal comes amid a barrage of disease threats from different ticks that are fanning out across a rapidly warming US. Powassan virus, which can kill people via an inflammation of the brain, is still rare but is growing, as is Babesia, a parasite that causes severe illnesses. Lyme disease, long a feature of the US north-east, is alsoburgeoning.“We are dealing with a lot of serious tick-borne illnesses and discovering new ones all the time,” said Harrington.“There’s a tremendous urgency to confront this with new therapies but the problem is we are going backwards in terms of funding and support in the US. There have beencuts to the CDCandNIH(National Institutes of Health)which means there is decreasing support. It’s a major concern.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsClimate crisisInsectsnewsShareReuse this content"

Police have arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of murder.Det Ch Insp Tom Phillips said a report was made to police at about 2.15pm on Saturday that a seriously injured, unconscious woman was inside a house in the Elmfield Walk area of Donaghadee.“Officers attended, alongside colleagues from the Northern Ireland ambulance service, who provided medical treatment at the scene,” he added.He said that Montgomery, who was also pregnant, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family had been made aware of the news and were being supported by specially trained officers, he said.“Inquiries are at an early stage into this deeply tragic case. Our thoughts are also with Sarah’s family during this incredibly difficult time as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened,” Phillips said.Ch Insp Yvonne McManus added: “We understand this news will cause shock and concern within the community. Local people will see our officers in and around the area, with cordons still in place today. Should anyone have any concerns or want to ask for help or advice, please speak to us. We want to help.”McManus added that the police recognised the “profound impact” that violence against women had on society, and addressing the issue remained a “key priority” for the police.She said: “We are committed to engaging directly with the local community to offer support, build trust, and help people feel safe. I am appealing to anyone who believes they may have information which could assist us with our investigation to contact us on 101.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

She has regularly been on display for the two centuries since. In that time, we have also changed as a museum and are thinking more about how we care for people.”The story of Asru’s body is one of several that show how the development of the UK museum sectorbenefited from colonialism and transatlantic slavery, at a time when the ethics of displaying human bodies and spoils from imperial expansion are being questioned.In March a report by MPs from theall-party parliamentary group for Afrikan reparationscalled for bans on selling ancestral remains and publicly displaying them without consent.Asru’s finely decorated wooden coffin reveals a few biographical details. An affluent woman who was about 60 when she died, her father was called Pa-Kush, which means “the Kushite”, a Black man from modern-day Sudan. Pa-Kush worked as a scribe, a high-status role, whenEgypt had Kushite pharaohs. Asru’s name means “her arm is against them”.In the 19th century, Asru’s sarcophagus was acquired by Robert and William Garnett, the sons of a former trader in enslaved African people, who had followed him into the cotton industry, research by one of the museum’s curators, Campbell Price, found. The Garnetts donated Asru’s body to the Manchester Natural History Society, the forerunner to Manchester Museum.Alongside the Asru consultation, the museum has launched its Decolonise! Trail , named after the initiative in arts and culture that is being used to challenge stereotypical perspectives linked to empire and colonialism.The trail links displays of items from Africa and Asia, subverting traditional “Eurocentric” narratives about them through artworks newly displayed alongside them.It is supported by a booklet that asks questions such as “Should a desire for knowledge override the wishes of ancient cultures?”, “Do you know where the minerals in your technology come from?” and “What is climate justice?”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It features a 1928 quote from the then UK home secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, who, speaking of India as a major export market for “Lancashire cotton goods”, said: “We did not conquer India for the benefit of the Indians … We conquered India as an outlet for the goods of Britain. We conquered India by the sword, and by the sword we shall hold it.”Chloe Cousins, Manchester Museum’s social justice manager, who created the trail, said: “The trail is new but the concept of decolonising isn’t new to Manchester Museum at all.

This would make it the hottest day of the year so far, and just short of the UK’s record temperature for June of 35.6C, recorded in Southampton in 1976.By Tuesday, temperatures are expected to peak at 35C or more, which would be hotter than Barbados.Wimbledon is set for its hottest opening day on record on Monday and could yet have the highest temperature ever recorded during the tournament.The hottest ever Wimbledon day was on 1 July 2015, when temperatures reached 35.7C. The hottest opening day on record was 2001 when temperatures hit 29.3C.The hottest day of the year so far was 33.2C, recorded last weekend in Charlwood, Surrey.The rising heat, including night-time temperatures of 20C or more, are due to a slight change in wind direction from a westerly to a southerly, forecasters have said. The switch in wind will draw hot air up from Spain and France, where temperatures have been above 40C.The heatwave is due to end by the middle of the week, when cooler air is expected to move in from the west.The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat alerts for five regions of England: London, the south-east, the east, the south-west and East Midlands. There are less severe yellow warning in force for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber and no alerts for the north-west or north-east.It will stay relatively cooler in the north-west of the UK, with cloud and heavy rain in parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland.A heatwave becomes official when areas reach a certain temperature for three consecutive days, with thresholds varying from 25C to 28C in different parts of the UK.London’s assistant fire commissioner, Thomas Goodall, said: “London is already facing its second heatwave of the year and we know that people will be looking forward to getting outside to enjoy the wonderful weather. But the high temperatures and low rainfall in recent months means the current risk of wildfires is severe.

Across the same period in 2024, there were 31,376 cases.The figures come a week aftera damning report by the Royal College of Physiciansrevealed that 99% of the UK population was now breathing in “toxic air”. Air pollution was killing 500 people a week and costing £27bn a year in ill health, NHS care and productivity losses, the research showed.New data from the RCGP research and surveillance centre shows the rate of asthma attacks in 2025 has consistently been above the five-year average.Exacerbations of asthma – attacks which cause breathlessness and chest tightness – were, alongside other environmental and lifestyle factors, closely linked to air pollution as patients’ airways could be irritated by exposure to harmful matter, the RCGP said.The college is calling on ministers and the mayors of major cities to expand existing clean air zones to combat the health consequences of air pollution.In an interview with the Guardian, Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the RCGP, said: “GPs have long been sounding the alarm on the detrimental effects of air pollution on patients’ health and these latest figures on asthma exacerbations are extremely concerning.“Air pollution is a major public health crisis which is often overlooked, but we know it can be responsible for a range of serious physical and mental conditions and will often exacerbate existing conditions in patients.“We have been very encouraged by the efforts of the mayors in major cities such as Birmingham and London to reduce air pollution exposure through schemes such as the Ulez initiative, which are reporting very positive results.“But these latest statistics show that we need to go further, expanding the focus on reducing air pollution in the worst affected communities.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care has said its 10-year health plan, due to be published next Thursday, will shift the NHS from treatment to prevention.Tackling air pollution must be a key part of the plan, Hawthorne said. “If we don’t take measures to address this, it is patients who will suffer the consequences – particularly those in more economically deprived areas with already limited access to healthcare services.“As well as the devastating human cost, this will ultimately also result in a greater burden on an already overstretched NHS.”Sarah Sleet, the chief executive ofAsthma+ Lung UK, said the “huge increase” in asthma attacks was “extremely worrying”.“While there may be multiple factors at play, we know that air pollution can be deadly for the millions of people in the UK living with lung conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,” she said.“It can trigger life-threatening attacks and exacerbate symptoms, leaving people fighting for breath. It stunts the growth of children’s lungs, and being exposed to high levels of air pollution over a long period of time can also cause lung conditions.“Yet still the government has shown no political will to tackle toxic levels of air pollution, which across the UK are much higher than the recommended safe levels set by the World Health Organization.”Prof Steve Turner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was “alarmed” by the rise in asthma attacks and urged ministers to “act quickly”.About one in 10 children in the UK have asthma.Previous studies show steep risesin visits to doctors by children with asthma after a week of raised air pollution levels.“These attacks are distressing, serious and life threatening, but they are also preventable,” Turner said. “Exposure to high concentrations of air pollution increases the risk of both developing asthma and triggering attacks.”Dr Harry Apperley, a clinical fellow at the RCPCH, said the impact of toxic air on children’s health was “particularly profound” because their lungs were smaller and they breathed faster than adults, so inhaled a larger volume of air in a shorter period.“In hospital, I’m increasingly seeing children and families living in or near environments that harm their health … Politicians and policymakers need to act. It shouldn’t take a clinician’s letter, or even a child’s death, to make change happen,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “Air pollution is a serious public health issue, and we are committed to tackling this issue across the country.“We have already provided £575m to support local authorities to improve air quality and are developing a series of interventions to reduce emissions so that everyone’s exposure to air pollution is reduced.”Explore more on these topicsAsthmaAir pollutionEnglandGPsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It reaches even the highest levels of government, with the president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, regularly describing LGBTQ+ people as “perverts” and a threat to the traditional family.The banning of Istanbul pride follows the failure of Hungary’s conservative leader, Viktor Orbán, to prevent his country’s main pride parade from going ahead.An estimated 200,000 people, a record,marched in the Budapest Pride parade Saturday, defying a ban by Orbán’s government.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyEuropePrideLGBTQ+ rightsRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsShareReuse this content"

The festival, in its second year, also attracted films from other parts of the world, including the UK, Canada and Serbia, withSofian Francis, a British actor, stunt performer and film-maker with Caribbean heritage, taking home five awards for his film Dante’s Inferno – The Ascension.The festival organiser, Ava Eagle Brown, a writer and entrepreneur, said she aimed to leverage Jamaica’s strong global brand and the government’s commitment to growing the film industry through financing initiatives such as the J$1bn ($6.2m or £4.52m)Jamaica screen development initiative(JSDI), to catalyse global collaborations.The initiative offers grants to Jamaican citizens and residents, and companies registered in Jamaica who meet theireligibility criteria.“Jamaica, theCaribbeanas a whole, has some amazing and compelling stories, and we are great storytellers,” said Brown. “But we don’t have enough of our stories being told outside of Jamaica by Jamaicans. That is why the festival is focused on co-production. So, you see people from Canada, America, France, Ghana and the UK. And we’re discussing how we can co-produce to create a unique sound and a unique flavour.”View image in fullscreenSherando Ferril (right) said collaborations would help address obstacles such as effective film distribution; Cornelius Grant (left) said the initiative was ‘the beginning of something great’.Photograph: VKVISION.TMThe goal, Brown added, was to create a Jamaican film brand on par with other Jamaican exported culture such as reggae and dancehall. The festival, she said, would help to achieve this by putting Jamaican actors and film-makers in direct contact with film industry leaders from around the world. “I mean, where in Jamaica can rural children run into a Netflix series producer or somebody from Canal+?” she said. “That is what is happening at the Black River festival.”The award-winning Jamaican actor and film-maker Sherando Ferril said collaborations would help address some of the obstacles to film production, such as effective distribution.Stephanie Hazle Lyle, the president of theJamaican chapter of Women in Film and Television, said the focus on films would reap economic benefits down the line.In 2023,the government announcedthat Jamaica’s creative sector had generated approximately US$2.2bn in the previous year, accounting for 5.2% of the country’s GDP.Wilford “Billy” Heaven, the CEO of Jamaica’sculture, health, arts, sports and education fund(Chase), a government fund which has contributed J$10m over two years to the Black River festival, described the Jamaican film industry as a “powerful catalyst for economic growth, cultural preservation, and global visibility”.The film commissioner Jackie Jacqueline Jackson spoke about the importance of the JSDI. This two-year initiative, which is in the final stages of processing its first set of applications, has six categories: development, production, completion, film festival and market attendance, and marketing and distribution.The aim, she said, was to transform Jamaica from being primarily a service industry for film, with more than 100 projects coming to the country every year to shoot, mainly from the US and the UK, to creating more of its own content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Each video typically has a title and AI-generated thumbnail that links a celebrity to Diddy via a false claim, such as that the celebrity just testified at the trial, that Diddy coerced that celebrity into a sexual act or that the celeb shared a shocking revelation about Diddy. The thumbnails often depict the celebrity on the stand juxtaposed with an image of Diddy. Some depict Diddy and the celebrity in a compromising situation. The vast majority of thumbnails use made-up quotes meant to shock people, such as “F*CKED ME FOR 16 HOURS”, “DIDDY F*CKED BIEBER LIFE” and “SHE SOLD HIM TO DIDDY”.John Oliver on AI slop: ‘Some of this stuff is potentially very dangerous’Read moreSome of the channels going all-in on Diddy “slop”, a term that refers to low-quality media generated by artificial intelligence, have a history of making false claims about celebrities and of using AI-generated thumbnails. But most of the 26 channels appear to be either newly created or older channels that were repurposed. At least 20 channels were eligible to earn revenue from ads.False and sensationalized Diddy AI slop is an easy way to make money on YouTube right now, according toWanner Aarts, who runs dozens of YouTube channels with AI-generated content and sells acourseabout how to make money on the platform. He said he’s not personally cashing in on the Diddy trend.“If you would say, ‘Hey, how can I make $50,000 as soon as possible?’ Number one would be like doing fucking drug [dealing], but number two would probably be to start a Diddy channel,” said Aarts, 25.Faked celebrity involvementIndicator reviewed hundreds of thumbnails and titles with false claims about Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Justin Bieber, Oprah Winfrey, Eddie Murphy, Leonardo DiCaprio, Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson, 50 Cent, Joe Rogan and others. Strangely, one channel,Fame Fuel, posted 20 consecutive videos with AI-generated thumbnails and titles that make false claims about the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and Diddy.One of the most successful channels isPeeper, which has over 74m views since being created in 2010, but has focused only on Diddy for at least eight months. Peeper has many of the most viral Diddy videos among the top misinformers, including a video with the false title “Justin Bieber Exposes Will Smith, Diddy, and Clive Davis for Grooming Him”. It received 2.3m views. Peeper has now been demonetized.A channel calledSecret Storyswitched to Diddy content after posting health and life advice in Vietnamese.Hero Storypivoted to Diddy after initially uploading videos about Ibrahim Traoré, the military ruler of Burkina Faso. A Brazilian channel that generated millions of views from embroidery videos switched to Diddy less than two weeks ago. And a channel calledCeleb Buzzgenerated more than 1m views from 11 Diddy videos in less than three weeks. It was created in early 2018 but appears to have removed any previously uploaded videos. Secret Story and Hero Story were terminated by YouTube after inquiries from Indicator; Celeb Buzz was demonetized.Pivot to DiddyIn another example, roughly three weeks ago, the channel Pak Gov Update started uploading videos about Diddy that use AI-generated thumbnails with false quotes attributed to celebrities such as Usher and Jay-Z. One video is titled “Jay-Z Breaks His Silence on Diddy Controversy” and features a thumbnail of Jay-Z crying and holding up a CD above the quote “I WILL BE DEAD SOON”.The nearly 30-minute video, which uses clips from TV news and other sources and AI-generated narration, has 113,000 views. It does not contain any new information from Jay-Z, and the rapper never said the quote that is attributed to him.Pak Gov Update previously posted short, amateurish videos with clickbait titles about public pensions in Pakistan. Its biggest hit was a video called Big information! Senior Citizen Pension Scheme || fedaral Cabnet Big Development, which received a relatively modest 18,000 views. (Typos theirs.)Cashing in on misinformationAarts said that the Diddy slop strategy is lucrative but risky. “Most of these channels aren’t going to survive,” he said, citing the likelihood of getting demonetized due toYouTubepolicy violations, or legal action from Diddy and other celebrities featured in thumbnails and videos.As with Pak Gov Update, most of the videos uploaded by the channels use AI-generated narration over real clips from news reports and other sources. Some also use AI images and, less frequently, synthetic video. The channels’ use of real footage often appears to test the boundaries of fair use.View image in fullscreenThe YouTube channel PakReviews-f2z, whose display name is Pak Gov Update, has uploaded myriad fake videos about the Diddy trial.Photograph: YouTubeAI slop is just one type of content that you can find about the Diddy trial on YouTube. But it appears to be a growing and lucrative niche. Similar Diddy AI content is also racking up engagementon TikTok.YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in an email: “We terminated several channels shared by Indicator for violating our terms of service and policies covering spam.” Malon said the company removed 16 channels, including Fame Fuel.

Just find a topic that people want to watch videos about, brainstorm ideas and hire overseas editors to pump out content at a nearly automated pace.Thanks to AI, it’s easier than ever to pursue the dream of faceless automation. Aarts said that anyone can create a script with ChatGPT or another large language model, generate images and thumbnails with Midjourney or similar models, use Google Veo 3 for video, and finish the process with a tool like ElevenLabs to create an AI voiceover. Then hire freelancers in the Philippines or elsewhere to edit the video, he said.“AI has opened up a lot more for people with lower budgets to enter YouTube automation,” Aarts said, noting that it’s possible to pay less than $10 per video. He said he earns more than $130,000 month from more than 45 channels.Muhammad Salman Abazai, who runsAS Venturer, a Pakistani company that provides video editing and YouTube channel management services, said that Diddy videos have become a “proper niche” on YouTube. Abazai showed off a few Diddy videos that his team created and uploaded to a luxury/wealth channel they run for a client.“It was a success for us because we got a lot of boost from that, we got subscribers from this,” he said.International Diddy slopThe pivot to Diddy doesn’t just work in English. A Spanish-language channel calledNV Historialaunched in January and had seen sporadic success with completely AI-generated videos about celebrities. Its first hit was a video with atitlethat translates to “A teacher laughs at a Black girl for saying her father is Chuck Norris – until he walks into the classroom”. It received just over 140,000 views.NV Historia pumped out Chuck Norris slop until views began to taper off about a month ago. That’s when the channel uploaded its first Diddy video. Its title translates to “1 MINUTE AGO: Nobody expected Dwayne Johnson to say THIS in court about Diddy … ” The thumbnail uses AI-generated images of the Rock and Diddy in court, as well as an image of the former wrestler being forced to eat what appears to be a brain. The thumbnail features the quote “He forced me to eat it.”Johnson has not testified and is not linked to any of Diddy’s alleged illegal activities. The video has received more than 200,000 views. NV Historia posted a video falsely linking Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities to Diddy the next day, earning 45,000 views. It went all in on Diddy content after that. YouTube has since demonetized NV Historia.A French-language channel,StarBuzzFR, launched in May and appears to only upload Diddy content. It uses AI-generated thumbnails and voiceovers to spin false stories, including that Brad Pitt testified against Diddy and said that he was sexually abused by the mogul. StarBuzzFR is particularly fond of using AI-generated, sexualized images of Diddy and celebs like Pitt. The channel is still monetized as of this writing.Aarts said the general attitude among the YouTube faceless/automation community is that anyone who can figure out a way to make money deserves respect.“I have nothing to say other than congratulations to those people that are able to pull something like it off,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Sean ‘Diddy‘ CombsYouTubeCelebrityDeepfakefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The key to an appropriate appreciation now of what happened and why, and what those directly affected were put through, is fine detail of a kind that was unavailable in the chaos of the moment. The first two parts of Sky’s documentary series 7/7: Homegrown Terror have many such revelations that bring you up short.There is a wide selection of interviewees, but they have been judiciously chosen, especially in the case of the survivors. All are individually perspicuous, and, collectively, their stories turn horror and monstrous bad luck into multi-faceted narratives, starting with the what-ifs, the if-onlys and the ironies. Michael Henning, who was an insurance broker on his way to work and who now has a wry lyricism as he communicates his experiences, remembers a row with his girlfriend that ended with her sarcastically imploring him not to die on his way to the office: “I like to think I followed her instructions to the letter.” Charity worker Mustafa Kurtuldu missed his tube train but was “lucky” that another, unusually, turned up immediately. Thelma Stober was so elated by having worked on London’s successful bid for the 2012 Olympics – it was announced on 6 July 2005 that the Games were coming to London – that she went into the office on her day off.View image in fullscreenMichael Henning, one of the survivors who contributes to 7/7: Homegrown Terror.Photograph: Blast Films/©Sky UK LtdThe greater irony was that the official UK terror threat level had recently been lowered: that nobody was expecting what was about to happen was true on a macro level, as well as for individuals going about their ordinary day. When the programme reaches the point where the bombs went off, those who were there give piercingly vivid descriptions of what they experienced. Henning remembers a slow-motion split-second during which he was enveloped in orange, then silver, then pitch black; Stober awoke on the train tracks, her foot twisted backwards, someone else’s hand on her forehead. She talks of the guilt she felt as a Christian as she struggled to escape, when she would have liked to have been able to help others.The sheer horror of the carnage is underlined by the anguished testimony of Inspector Steve Mingay, the police officer on duty at King’s Cross station that day, who was thus the first person to reach the tube train that had blown up on its way to Russell Square. “The floor is sticky,” he says in an urgent present tense, reliving the moment as he must have done thousands of times since that day, without the shock ever subsiding. “There’s body parts … there’s body parts.” The modern documentary-maker’s trick of lingering on the interviewee after they’ve stopped talking can feel contrived, but there is such emotional power in seeing Mingay say his piece, then reach for a water bottle which he can’t sip from because his hands are shaking too much. Then he puts his head in his hands and sobs.Alongside its stunningly stark re-creation of what happened – there are further macabre descriptions of the carnage provided by forensic investigators who were charged with sifting through the human remains and trying to work out which belonged to the bombers – Homegrown Terror also looks at the trickier question of why it happened. We see archive footage of Tony Blair and George W Bush, announcing that their response to the 11 September 2001 attack on the US was “fighting terrorism”, although their military responses were guaranteed to provoke more of it. Then we travel to Beeston, Leeds, where two of the bombers lived, to hear about a British-Asian community dogged by racism and poverty, its young men vulnerable to radicalisation. An associate of the bombers remembers how talk of jihad initially meant fighting to protect Muslims being oppressed overseas, in Chechnya or Kashmir, for example, before some of his acquaintances moved on to something much darker, aimed at revenge on their own home country.The associate’s words are spoken by an actor, as are those of a friend of 7/7 bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan, and recollections taken from a memoir written by Hasib Hussain’s late father, expressing his disbelief at what had happened to his beloved son. Such artifices are deployed without letting the programme tip into melodrama. The bigger problem is whether we receive any comprehensive answers to the question of how the attacks happened and what else could have been done, but we are given enough background information to take a view. In trying to help us make sense of something that is so hard to fully comprehend or process, Homegrown Terror does just about all it can.7/7: Homegrown Terror aired on Sky Documentaries and is on Now.Explore more on these topics7 July London attacksTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

I have heavy impostor syndrome’: Djo on viral fame, bad reviews, and life after Stranger ThingsHannah J DaviesActor and musician Joe Keery made his name on the Netflix hit as lovable jock Steve Harrington, but he never stopped making music. He discusses anxiety, his earnest new record and why he and his castmates are ‘bonded for life’Sun 29 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 05.35 EDTShare“It was a crazy situation – this song that I wrote was being linked to the head of the Catholic church!” Joe Keery sounds incredulous as he recalls his latest viral moment. The track in question wasEnd of Beginning, the wistful indie anthem from his 2022 album Decide. It first became an online hit last year, taking on a new life soundtracking TikTok users’ videos of their home towns. As it happens, the home town – or university town, in Keery’s case – that he sings about in the song is Chicago. Fast forward to this May, when Illinois native Robert Francis Prevost was elected as the new pope. The song began to do the rounds all over, with fans overlaying the lyrics (“And when I’m back in Chicago, I feel it!”) over videos of the new pontiff.It was just the latest surreal chapter in the 33-year-old’s career, which has seen him juggle musical success with acting megastardom, thanks to his breakout role as villainous jock, and later beloved fan favourite, Steve Harrington in Netflix’s retro sci-fi smashStranger Things. Performing under the name Djo, he has released two albums of hazy psychedelic rock and angular electro respectively, plus that aforementioned, absolutely inescapable viral hit, which peaked at No 4 in the UK charts. He’s now on tour in support of recent third album The Crux, aptly named as he reaches the end of a nine-year stint in Stranger Things, whose extremely long-awaited final season will be released on 26 November.“It’s about the journey to reconnect with your roots and your family and your friends, and to rediscover what your real priorities are,” Keery says. It could sound trite, but it does seem like this is exactly what he’s done – even bringing his pre-Stranger Things band Post Animal on tour with him (he rejoined the group earlier this year).We meet at a shabby-chic north London pub, with Keery two shows into a three-night run at the nearby O2 Forum. Looking very much “incognito musician”, he wears a paint-splattered grey shirt, striped white barrel jeans and snakeskin-effect black cowboy boots, with hair that toes the line between artfully lived-in and a little greasy, and slim, rectangular sunglasses. Although he is a New Yorker these days, he was born and raised in Massachusetts and sports a Boston Red Sox cap. Initially, he seems a little guarded (the glasses stay on for 10 minutes or so), but that slowly seeps away and a playful, thoughtful music nerd emerges – the same Keery who recently appeared on the YouTube “name that tune” seriesTrack Star*waxing lyrical about Bryan Ferry and the Cars. He instantly recognises the face on my T-shirt as a young Billy Joel, and you get the sense that he’d happily just talk about Joel for the next hour.There’s a temptation – and maybe rightly so – to see actors turned musicians as hedging their bets, but it’s clear that Keery really cares about music, and has a talent for it to boot. He hails from a “creative family” (teacher mum, architect dad) and grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, James Taylor, ELO, Sheryl Crow, Shania Twain, Alison Krauss – the list goes on. While his last album, Decide, bore many of the hallmarks of his favourite electronic artists (hi Justice!), The Crux leans more heavily on those earlier influences, for a sound that Keery describes as “far more organic”.View image in fullscreenThrowing down … Djo.Photograph: Pooneh GhanaKeery is the second oldest of five children, the rest all girls, and it was Caroline – two years older than him – who pushed him to pursue acting. The first person in his family to leave the state for university (not for any good reason, he says, but because he didn’t get good enough grades to go to UMass in Amherst), he landed at drama school in Chicago, and fell in love with the city (“Working-class town, great art scene, affordable … absolutely ungodly weather that will test you all year, but then the most glorious summer”). After studying there, he stayed in the city and played guitar and keys with Post Animal, whose style was (and remains) psychedelic, flecked with prog and classic rock. He recalls the band’s early days, playing at events such as Austin Psych Fest as “a cool bonding experience. You’re kind of cutting your teeth doing that stuff, you’re having your highs and lows together. Sometimes it sucks and you bomb. It’s fun to have those experiences, though, to look back on.”Stranger Things came a couple of years into Post Animal’s existence and was a huge coup for Kerry, who to that point had only had small roles in procedural dramas such as Chicago Fire. Still, he has often talked about the “big-time Fomo” he felt when he had to leave Chicago for Atlanta, where the Netflix series was filmed. “What an opportunity … I got plucked out of obscurity and put into this thing that thrust me into the public eye,” he says. “But then, immediately, I was met with a sense of … oh man! I miss my friends and my sense of community. It took me a few years, honestly, to grapple with that.”View image in fullscreenSome kind of monster … Keery and Maya Hawke in Stranger Things.Photograph: Tina Rowden/NetflixKeery had to stop touring with Post Animal, and ultimately leave the band altogether, due to his Stranger Things commitments, but he still made music during filming, in part to keep himself busy and away from potential vices. (“It’s like, four in the afternoon. I’m not gonna go to the bar! That can be dangerous.”) Now he’s enjoying bringing his acting friends into his music (his Stranger Things co-star Charlie Heaton features on the new record), while also linking up again with his old bandmates. Even so, he’s the first to admit that it’s quite an unusual situation, and one clearly bolstered by his own existing status: his first appearance with Post Animal, after rejoining them, was on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Finding their feet on such a high-profile platform has led to “a level of stress. But it’s also good, I think, to release that and be like, well, it’s not gonna be perfect. I’m figuring it out, too.”Although he is now – once again – part of a group, Keery is also very much a solo artist as Djo. Ina 2020 interview, he said that his stage name (for the uninitiated, it’s pronounced like his actual name) had come about because he “didn’t just want to be a dumb actor who releases an album”. How does he feel about that statement now? “I mean, that’s a little harsh,” he says, sounding reflective. “What I’ve learned is that a lot of people do something creative, and odds are they do something else that is also creative. It sounds a little dramatic in retrospect, [but] I think I just really wanted to be taken seriously. I was just trying to give myself the best shot at that.”It’s difficult not to be anxious about how your work is going to be received, right? He nods. “Not for maybe, like … Daniel Day-Lewis. But everybody [else] wants to be in the cool crowd.”View image in fullscreenDjo public … Keery in Kentish Town, London.Photograph: Pooneh GhanaFittingly for an album full of expert, pastiche-swerving callbacks to artists of decades gone by, The Crux was recorded at Electric Lady studios in New York, made famous by Jimi Hendrix, alongside Keery’s longtime producer Adam Thein. Despite its vintage vibes, it feels decidedly millennial in its malaise. A case in point: Basic Being Basic, which has a jagged 80s powerpop sound, while also rallying against Instagram culture, or as Keery sings, “looking hot and keeping monotone and understated”.“I was not trying to make some big, cultural statement,” he says. “But [social media] is flattening culture, and I do think that we are kind of at risk of homogenising everything and losing rare things in different corners of the world.” He’s a little more online than he has been in recent years, he says, “but, yeah, it’s horrible for us and ruining the planet. It makes everybody so self-conscious.”Elsewhere, Egg – named after the Wings album Back to the Egg – zooms in on the angst that Keery still feels, in spite of his successes (sample lyric: “Deep down inside / There’s always that fear / That I’m not enough”). “I suffer with fear and anxiety every day,” he says. “A great example: you come home to your hotel or whatever. You’re like: I could, like, go get a drink and meet some people. [Then you think] ummm, no, I’m gonna go upstairs. You’re constantly confronted with the anxiety of interacting versus the payoff of meeting a new friend or having a new experience. It’s always worth it to go and talk to somebody, but there’s always a little voice that’s like: well, we could just be safe right now, you know.”Is it because he worries about being recognised? “No, no, not because of that. It’s just the fear of rejection, normal human stuff. Everybody has this little monkey on their back. Everybody wants to desperately connect, but also is afraid of it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Keery’s sisters sing on the Springsteen-in-training bop Back on You (“Why not have a love song for your sisters or for your friends or for your parents?”). Charlie’s Garden – a jaunty paean to 70s pop – sees Keery and Heaton, who plays Steve’s victim turned pal Jonathan in Stranger Things, perform an ode to the latter’s home in Atlanta. What sort of things went on in Charlie’s back yard? “All sorts of bad stuff,” Keery says with a mischievous giggle. However, the place sounds incredibly wholesome. “There was a cold plunge, ping pong. You’re exercising, digging holes, pulling down trees, hanging lights. Guy does a lot of chores! He’s a very good homeowner.”Djo review – Joe Keery mixes genres in an endearing, if uneven, Brooklyn setRead moreThe song – “bouncy, fun, not serious” – is, Keery says, a tribute not just to Heaton and his partner Natalia Dyer (Stranger Things’ Nancy) but to all his mates down there. “It’s a little tip of the cap to everybody in Atlanta who had such a big effect on me,” he says. “My community down there ended up being so much more important to me than I ever thought that they would be. We’re all bonded for life.” Being part of a huge TV franchise (Netflix’s third most-watched series ever, at the time of writing) could sometimes feel uncanny, “numbing” even. But, he says, “we always had each other. It wasn’t like being Macaulay Culkin or something, where you’re like, the one person in that one thing. I always feel pretty lucky in that way, where it’s like, I got one eighth of that …”View image in fullscreenTouching bass … Keery in the studio.Photograph: Sofiah YatesKeery says he’s wary of following trends or trying to pre-empt what people might like. The album could be seen, he says, as “a real reinterpolation of the classics, or dad rock-y. It’s not sleek pop music or cool indie music, either. It kind of lives in this grey space of like … sort of happy, sort of cheesy. But I’m also sort of cheesy.” Being earnest can be synonymous with being uncool, but, says Keery, he thought: “Fuck that. I do not care. If it’s like: this sounds too much like this band to you, well, you know what? Listen to every other band that sounds like every other band. These are my influences.”Criticism is a tricky subject between artists and journalists at the best of times. For writers, it often feels like a question of free speech and integrity. For artists, though, harsh reviews can obviously sting. Has he read, for example, the 5.9-rated Pitchfork review of the record, which calls it “frictionless” and includes the line “music you could imagine in a faux Urban Outfitters at Starcourt Mall [from Stranger Things]”.“I read the headline enough to kind of get the idea,” says Keery. “And, I mean, I understand it. You kind of can’t really let it get you down, I guess, or affect what you’re doing too much, to be honest with you.” He raises the same publication’s review of Benson Boone’s Coachella performance, which described the Beautiful Things singer as “horrible, just godawful”. “I read that and thought: ‘My God, why would you do this to somebody?’ You can not like stuff, but what’s the real point? I guess you just can’t let it sway you too much. You have to just keep following your creative instincts and doing what you find interesting.”View image in fullscreenGig economy … Djo at his London concert.Photograph: Pooneh GhanaWith Stranger Things now out of his calendar for good, what do those creative instincts look like? “No idea,” says Keery drily. “I don’t have an acting job, if anyone’s hiring! But I am a little addicted now to being in the driver’s seat. [Being a musician] is different to being an actor, where you’re the violin player in an orchestra, and you’re doing your part for this bigger thing.”Equally, there’s a kind of freedom in being part of something larger than you, he says, and he would love to go back to his drama school roots and do some theatre. If he sounds a little undecided, he also acknowledges that it’s good to have options. “I’ve been incredibly lucky, so I do have a pretty heavy sense of impostor syndrome-slash-gratitude,” he says. “It would be scary if that gratitude faded.”Again, this could all sound a little saccharine, but with Keery it feels genuine – a humble response to just how wild the past few years have been. I mean, he basically soundtracked the pope’s inauguration! “That was,” he says, fighting back his laughter, “so ridiculous.”Djo plays Glastonburyfestival on29 June; The Crux is out now.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockStranger ThingsTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Two days later, he announced he’d changed his mind, although the wrangling over whether or not the BBC would be allowed to livestream his performance seems to have gone down to the wire: last week they issued a statement saying they wouldn’t, but in the event the live stream went ahead.A man who’s been conducting his career according to his own baffling internal logic for the best part of 60 years, Young clearly sees no reason to change his approach as he nears 80: not for nothing is his online blog called the Times Contrarian. It lends a certain frisson to his Glastonbury appearance: as longstanding fans will tell you, with a mixture of weariness and fond admiration, you never quite know what he’s going to do, although what the floating voters who invariably make up a significant percentage of a Glastonbury audience will think of it is anyone’s guess.View image in fullscreenNeil Young and his bandmates the Chrome Hearts.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianHe takes the stage clad in a tattered plaid shirt, jeans and a Casey Jones hat pulled down over his face: in old age, he increasingly looks less like a rock star than a mechanic from a small American town who distrusts anyone not born within a mile radius of its centre. He dispatches a version of Sugar Mountain on acoustic guitar, before the Chrome Hearts arrive. This is essentially his earlier outfit Promise of the Real augmented by 82-year-old keyboard player Spooner Oldham, a man whose career stretches back to Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett’s legendary late 60s albums. They may well be the best backing band Young has assembled since Crazy Horse, their sound simultaneously tumultuous and lumbering and heavily distorted.Cinnamon Girl, from 1969, and 1990’s Fuckin’ Up alike conclude with lengthy barrages of noise: during the latter, guitarist Micah Nelson creates feedback by throwing this guitar into the air. At their best, they’re impossibly thrilling. Young’s lengthy guitar solos have an impassioned, almost caustic quality, and the sense of the musicians huddled together at the centre of the stage sparring off each other is really striking.At one point, it seems as if Young is going to start rolling out one venerable classic after another, to general delight: a version of Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) is followed by an acoustic section featuring The Needle and the Damage Done and a lovely, lambent take on Harvest Moon provokes the audience into singing softly along.Charli xcx at Glastonbury review – a thrilling hostile takeover by a pop star at the peak of her powersRead moreBut simply playing a crowd-pleasing selection of what you might broadly describe as the hits wouldn’t be very Neil Young: instead, he throws in Sun Green, a painfully slow, musically unchanging track from his coolly received, ecologically themed early 00s concept album Greendale. It has 18 verses, and lasts so long that you’re occasionally gripped by the very real fear they’ll still be up on the Pyramid stage playing it long after the festival has ended. Some of the floating voters take this as a cue to see what’s happening elsewhere on site. But then he plays Like a Hurricane, accompanied by Nelson playing a keyboard that seems to be suspended from the roof of the stage.An acoustic version of Old Man is warmly received yet makes for a weirdly downbeat end to the set, but an encore of Rockin’ in the Free World offers what you might call the full festival experience. The screens keep flashing on to the audience: there are people on their friends’ shoulders singing along. A suitably inscrutable onstage presence for most of the night, Young is visibly enjoying himself. He leaves the stage having headlined Glastonbury in a manner entirely in keeping with his longstanding reputation.Explore more on these topicsNeil YoungGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025FestivalsMusic festivalsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Keyboard player Candida Doyle even gave an interview to a local Somerset newspaper insisting that while they wanted to play, Glastonbury “weren’t interested”. But clearly no one was convinced – the Pyramid stage is headlining-set heaving.There’s something charming about the fact that they open with Sorted For E’s & Wizz, a song that takes a pretty equivocal, even steely view of the kind of hedonism that prevails at Glastonbury: proof, should it be needed, that Pulp remain a band who seldom go about things the straightforward way. Listening to them play their 90s hits – Mis‐Shapes, Disco 2000, Babies – you’re struck by how little they had in common with their ostensible Britpop contemporaries. Their wonky collision of 70s glam, French pop, disco and analogue electronics didn’t sound like any of their peers, nor was the prevailing mood of their songs much in tune with the supposed mood of the era. They’re substantially darker and grubbier, consistently sticking up for oddballs and outsiders at a time when alternative music was making a lunge for a mainstream audience. It’s as if they became huge coincidentally, rather than as part of a movement.View image in fullscreenDarker and grubbier … Cocker with Pulp on the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockThis means that, for all the nostalgia their old songs evoke in anyone who can remember the 90s – and a quick scan around the audience reveals a number of people looking distinctly moist-eyed as they play – they aren’t welded to the era in which they were first recorded, so they haven’t really dated. Moreover, there isn’t really any diminution in quality when they drop in Spike Island and Got To Have Love, two songs from their comeback album More, a smart reapplication of their longstanding approach to a later stage of life. Cocker, meanwhile, remains a fantastic frontman, dispensing sage wisdom about the festival itself – “to enjoy Glastonbury, you have to submit to it” – and reflecting on how terrified the band were to find themselves filling in at short notice for an indisposed Stone Roses in 1995: “But I feel very relaxed today – how about you?”You’d probably feel quite relaxed too if you knew you had Common People as your closing number. Surely the most straightforwardly rousing anthem ever written about class rage, it causes delirium on a scale not so different from that you can see in old footage of their headlining appearance: a highlight then, it’s also one of the most joyous moments so far in this year’s festival. Presumably somewhat by coincidence, the Red Arrows stage a flypast midway through the song. And off Pulp go, Jarvis promising to see the audience in Arcadia later.This review was updated on 29 June with a correction: it was 30 years since their last appearance on the Pyramid stage, not the broader festival.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsPulpJarvis CockerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Before the hour is out, no one in the audience will be left in doubt as to the Grammy winner’s mastery of her craft, or how much work she has put in to achieve it. But at the same time as flaunting her natural ability, Doechii is also eager to show her working and the paths she used – and her debut UK festival appearance is all the more mesmerising for it. The 26-year-old performer’s schoolgirlish styling – giant lockers, rows of desks, Doechii’s long braids and exceedingly brief kilt – is immediately obvious as a feint: she may be a relative newcomer to the scene, but she is no rookie.The videos playing either side of the stage bring the set’s concept into focus: Doechii (real name Jaylah Ji’mya Hickmon) is leading us, step by step, through the steps necessary to become a hip-hop master – from how to distinguish between “good bars and GREAT bars”, to understanding “the aspect of flow” and the importance of genre.The overarching suggestion is that Doechii is the total package, and she makes it hard to argue with: she is pure power, head-to-toe sinew, as tightly coiled as a snake and just as hard to tear your eyes off. Doechii spits, she lunges, she sprints the length of the stage and seems to hardly pause for breath throughout the entire show.View image in fullscreenSpitting and lunging … Doechii.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianShould you catch yourself wondering where this force of nature sprung from, she’s eager to tell you, peppering her set between snippets of Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, Missy Elliott and even Daft Punk. It not only adds richness to the show but also places Doechii within a musical lineage, identifying her as an artist who swotted up on the greats, then found a spin uniquely her own.After Bullfrog, the screens switch from black-and-white to vivid colour, and Doechii launches into Boiled Peanuts, defined by its irresistible, cackling refrain – the crowing “ha ha ha” of a victor who knows herself to be head and shoulders above the competition. That triumphant glee extends into Nissan Altima: Doechii is held aloft by her posse of backing dancers, swinging her braids like the imperious head cheerleader.The show’s pace is so relentless, the choreography so precise and the Doechii’s flow so airtight that all the crowd can do is hold on and hope for dear life to be carried along. With her freestyle over America Has a Problem, from Beyoncé’s Renaissance, Doechii challenges anyone who dares fancy themselves her competition to step up: “I see a lotta bitches, I don’t see a lotta stars / I hear a lot of rappers, I don’t hear a lot of bars.”The follow-up nod, in that song, to the Barbz – Nicki Minaj’s famously fanatical fanbase – makes Doechii’s most obvious comparison explicit, but not only does she match Nicki’s impeccable flow, she also bests her stage presence. Nicki’s never been known as much of a performer, whereas Doechii runs the length of the stage in heels and throws her body around like it’s another special effect at her disposal. Through Alter Ego, she’s flirtatious, casting coy glances over her shoulder, then antagonistic, spitting fire from a low squat position. Doechii’s association with alligators, appearing on the cover of her album Alligator Bites Never Heal, is apt: they share the same implacable ferocity, bared teeth and glint to the eye.View image in fullscreenDoechii and her dancers.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianA dance break involving umbrellas adds to the spectacle, but slightly obscures the school of hip-hop through-line. The show restores equilibrium with Persuasive, Doechii’s track with SZA – obviously performed tonight without her, but with such force that you don’t feel the absence. Doechii’s back and forth with her DJ/hype woman Miss Milan adds to the party atmosphere; by the time she launches into Nosebleeds from atop of a giant pair of speakers with her dance troupe way below, the crowd is hanging on her every word.From that apparent peak, the highs only continue with an X-rated performance of Crazy and a rendition of her hit Anxiety that blasts the sample, Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know, with heavy distortion. For all her immense technical ability and precision, there’s actually something quite metal about Doechii in her commitment to spectacle. On top of all that, she has a strong, clear voice, capable of acrobatics but not inclined to launch into them just for show. On GTFO, she spars with her dancers, then the camera; for Catfish, she shows off her vocal timbre, descending into a guttural, bristling growl.It is brilliant, but unrelenting; a reprieve from all that intensity arrives with Denial is a River – Doechii’s Salt-N-Pepa-esque, gossipy hit about a cheating partner and the narrator’s own self-deception. It’s presented within the educational framework of tonight’s set as an exemplar of “the art of storytelling”, and more than delivers on that promise: Doechii is relaxed, self-deprecating and conversational with Miss Milan. You could happily watch her riff in this register for hours.As it is, Doechii concludes her “school of hip-hop” with a rousing rendition of Boom Bap, then skips off stage. It might seem anticlimactic – West Holts seems to be left slightly reverberating by her sudden absence – but it’s in fact one last lesson: a true master knows to always leave the crowd wanting more.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025DoechiiGlastonbury festivalRapPop and rockFestivalsMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now her sister Bella is writing her own version of their childhood. Does fact or fiction come closer to the truth, she asksEsther FreudSun 29 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareI’m four and I’m pretending to be dead. I’ve been lying here behind the sofa, and I’m hoping I’ll be missed, but more than that I’m hoping it will make a story. The story of the games I like to play, and how I profess to remember my past lives. It is 1967, a few months before we set off for Morocco – my mother, my sister Bella and I – travelling overland by van, taking the ferry from Algeciras to Tangier, breaking down on the road to Marrakech. From then on everything becomes a story. The camel festival we visit, the path into the hills so steep that Bella and I are packed into saddlebags while the donkeys’ hooves skitter and slip. I can’t remember later whether it is a camel that is sacrificed when we reach the top, or a chicken. But either way I keep the description of the chicken to myself, running in circles, blood spouting from its headless neck.For all the decades since, I’ve been the family chronicler, as much in my novels as in our lives. I’ve kept the few possessions from those years in Morocco. The kaftans we bought in the souk when we arrived, the corduroy patch that I unpicked from a pair of too small trousers, embroidered with a flower by a boyfriend of my mother. “Are you my Daddy?” I’d asked him, as I’d asked others, not because I thought he was, but because I’d read about another little girl asking the same question in a book. I can still see the look of consternation on the boyfriends’ faces, hear my mother’s embarrassed laugh.I had a treasure box in which I kept a choker, coins with Arabic stars, lengths of braid, and when, aged six, we returned to England and I started school, I saw the minutes set aside each day for “news” as an opportunity to expound. To tell my classmates how I saw a mirage in the desert, found amethyst in a seam of rock as we hitchhiked through the Atlas mountains, became lost on the beach at Agadir, until I was nicknamed “In Morocco …” and I learned to stay quiet. But the stories remained, coalescing, condensing, until in my mid-20s, on a break from the acting career I’d chosen for myself, I began to write them down. At first they were nothing more than anecdotes, but slowly, painstakingly, I forced myself inside them until I found the voice of the child I’d been, the scent of the alleyways, the heat of the baked earth, the fear and exhilaration, the freedom of our lives. “Hideous kinky,” my sister and I would murmur to each other when events became too strange or too confusing, and so, when it was finished,Hideous Kinky was what I named my first novel.As an actor I’d immersed myself in Stanislavsky, consoling myself that spells of heartbreak could be repurposed “for my art”. As a writer, I found that everything and anything was useful, and as I mined my life, digging deeper, unearthing half-forgotten truths, I wondered about the splinter of ice that Graham Greene so famously alluded to, and whether it really does lurk in every writer’s heart. Is having a writer in the family the death of the family?View image in fullscreenEsther Freud (left) with her mother, Bernardine, and sister, Bella.Photograph: PRI wrote my first novel in innocent naivety. The second was finished in a burst of exhilaration before the first was published, but for my third – nerves shattered, my mother reeling (who wants their five-year-old to remember every experiment in parenting and write it down?) – I turned to history. Berlin during the first world war had never been my subject, but I had the seeds of a story about my German Jewish grandmother gleaned from my father,Lucian Freud, during long hours of sitting for a painting, and much as I struggled, pre-internet, with the research, at least (if I ever managed to finish it) there was no one left alive to be furious or upset. Four exhausting years later I published Summer at Gaglow, and almost immediately, as a reward, I plunged back into my own life, to rake over the experience of living in a step-family, as I myself had done from the age of eight to 14. That’s when I discovered I’d become a different writer. I’d gained the confidence to invent, when often it had seemed no invention was needed – what, in actuality, could be more surprising than the truth? I had taught myself the art of camouflage, and by doing so had created a level of protection for everyone involved.In the books that followed I was free. That’s not to say I didn’t sometimes agonise, but I’d learned to pick and choose, research, obscure, allow my characters to spread their wings and fly. So it is with trepidation that I have returned to the central relationships at the heart of my first novel. My Sister and Other Lovers draws on the themes that shaped my writing – family, loyalty, division – the completion of which has coincided with the new storytelling career of my fashion designer sister, Bella, who has been publishing a weekly column on Instagram, Sunday Stories.How strange, over this last year, to read my sister’s interpretation of events. Free from the wiles of fiction, her voice rings out, clear and clean, and I am tempted to respond, as she must have been doing for years: “That’s not what it was like!”The Polish poet Czesław Miłosz is quoted as saying: “When a writer is born into a family, that family is finished.” So what happens when there are two writers in the family – I won’t even mention here my literary half-siblings – and is it fact, or fiction, that comes closer to the truth? Screenwriter and memoirist Nora Ephron once declared that all writers are cannibals, and her own mother, a writer herself, is known to have insisted that “everything is copy” – something Ephron proved with Heartburn, a blisteringly funny and painful account of the breakdown of her marriage. But even she must have wrangled with the dilemma: What exactly is allowed? What remains off limits? There’s no doubt I’ve been eyed by friends who’ve read my stories. “Gosh,” they’ve gulped. “You do have a good memory.” Then, of course, there are those friends with whom I’ve lost touch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionFor the last 15 years I’ve been running a creative writing group, and the experience has taught me that what makes it difficult for people to commit to the novels they long to write is the burning question: What will my mother say? It doesn’t matter whether this mother is alive or dead. Secrets, and the shame of them, have a way of stopping people in their tracks. However hard I encourage them to write – to edit, abandon, disguise the work later – fear acts like a bindweed. No wonder writers need that splinter of glass. Julian Barnes has said that while working on his first novel he had to pretend his entire family was dead. But what has surprised me more is the mistrust of anything considered to be true. If a piece of work is semi-autobiographical my students often tend to give it less value. That’s brilliant, I might respond, only to be met with a dismissive shrug: it’s virtually all true. This is a phrase I’ve been tempted to ban from the class. What matters, I try to impress upon them, is that the story is alive. And which story, once repeated, is ever actually all true? Is this because for years so many novels by women were branded as “domestic”, categorised as aga sagas, chick lit, while the angry young men of the 1950s and60s created kitchen sink drama unimpeded? More recently there’s been a wave of Autofiction which has risen above this prejudice, by Maggie Nelson, Annie Ernaux, and the ‘living autobiographies’ of Deborah Levy. Which brings me back to my sister’s Sunday Stories and whether it is fact or fiction that gets closer to the truth. Could I have told my own stories as memoir? Would I have had the courage?For me fiction is the frame I need to tell the stories I’ve been turning over all my life, the writing of which has freed and saved me. As I dig I can feel the splinter of glass pressing so hard it threatens to draw blood, but even as I worry for those I love, who inadvertently I may have hurt, I tell myself: it’s fiction. And I remind myself of my father’s liberating words after reading an early novel in which a character (just possibly) based on him appears. “For a moment I did think it was me, then I realised: I don’t wear a watch.”Explore more on these topicsBooksFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Polish-born film-maker, though, hasmaintained that it was not just a political critiquebut a universal portrait of lone, dispossessed motherhood.This stage adaptation, written by Natalia Fiedorczuk and directed by Anna Smolar, tests that thesis – and in some was proves it – by lifting the story out of its original sociopolitical context and transposing it to a modern-dayPolandof online abuses, zero hours contracts and today’s lone parenting culture.Irena (Anna Ilczuk) is failed by all around her, even those presuming to be on her side. She is desperately poor, and has to care for her nine-year-old son Boguś (Ryfa Ri) while they face eviction. Her world is filled with well-to-do parents who judge her at the school gates – one of whom is also her bullying landlady – and liberal leftie teachers who perform acts of charitable solidarity but condemn Irena’s parenting style and problematise her son’s behaviour. Boguś’s estranged father is part of the story for his refusal to pay child support, as is Irena’s abrasive mother, who grudgingly puts Irena up after she is evicted.Despite the potent subject matter, it all seems skimmed across, with a plethora of plotlines and an examination of motherhood that does not penetrate beyond familiar ideas of responsibility overload and the desire for escape. The expressive elements of the production create a languorousness at their best, but the tone flattens as it goes on, and emotion is subsumed by meta-theatrical tics that are better in idea than effect (such as one elaborate scene in which two mothers put on VR headsets to access an alternate reality that offers escape from the tyranny of parenting).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Karolina JozwiakWhere Holland’s film is arresting in its matter-of-fact horrors, the hardships here are spoken of, or rapped into mics, in laboured lyricism. Or perhaps something is lost in translation with the Polish-to-English surtitles?Originally staged at Teatr Powszechny in Warsaw, and co-produced by the Malta festival in Poznań, it is an example of post-dramatic theatre, which is intent on deconstructing theatrical convention. What seems refreshing at first spirals into artifice. An ensemble of actors initially gather in a semi-circle before emphatically constructing scenes. Irena narrates an endless shopping list of tasks, which is striking at first but begins to sound like a stylistic flourish. Irena’s disabled lover Jacek (Oskar Stoczyński), who sits at the heart of the film, is tangential here, both in action and emotion. Perhaps this is to give Irena an even greater sense of aloneness, but it means the story is filled with incident yet devoid of an emotional core.Some scenes jar, such as the one involving a series of phone calls between Irena and an actor who changes roles numerous times while they sit next to each other on a sofa. It seems little more than a game for the actors, and leaves you confused as to who is whom.View image in fullscreenHeavy symbolism … a Damoclean boulder in A Woman Alone.Photograph: Karolina JozwiakIt all becomes confounding as the narrative travels between Boguś’s absent father, figures from his school, and the rather purposeless presence of Jacek. All the while, Boguś expresses himself in a repetitive and mannered dance, occasionally rapping, although his interiority remains largely unknown.‘Making this film was forbidden’: how Agnieszka Holland’s migrant thriller inflamed the Polish rightRead moreThe drama seriously falters when Irena stages a Pulp Fiction-style hold-up, exploding into anger at figures from her son’s school. What follows does not re-enact the shock of the film’s ending but gives us a paler alternative.A stone boulder hangs over a corner of Anna Met’sset design – to represent the Damoclean weight dangling above Irena, perhaps? Again, this feels like laboured symbolism. It is a shame because the production begins with such freshness. Jan Duszyński’s sound design is exciting and there is power to the earlier scenes. But it spins in too many directions, ponderous and unwieldy in its portrait of a lone woman trapped in capitalist consumerism, which is no less blind to her suffering than Holland’s original communist state.Explore more on these topicsTheatrePolandPovertyreviewsShareReuse this content"

He lays out his argument in Through It All Together, which is at once a paean to his football club, a contention that fandom is a glue that binds with more ferocity than a Norman Hunter tackle, and an appeal for the deification of the manager who led Leedsback into the Premier Leaguein 2020.Where Liverpool had Bill Shankly – recently given his own moment in the stage spotlight in the moving and epicRed or Dead– the Whites had Marcelo Bielsa, or El Loco as O’Connor reminds us, the nickname with which the Argentinian arrived at Elland Road.

After years of ‘hustling’ and Snoop Dogg-endorsed stardom, the magician is paying it forwardSun 29 Jun 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 13.49 EDTShareBy day three of Glastonbury, it’s a welcome time for a pick-me-up, something jaw-dropping, perhaps even magical. At Guardian Live at the Astrolabe theatre, members of the audience were treated to an impromptu show from Steven Frayne, the magician formerly known as Dynamo. “I’m a bit like Prince,” the Bradford-born entertainer jokes, having laid his old name to rest recently. As interviewer Zoe Williams and the crowd looked on in wonderment, Frayne reminds everyone why he’s one of the UK’s most gifted performers, as he brings people up on to the stage for one of his famous card illusions. On the surface, this is literally one of the oldest tricks in the book. But Frayne brings a nimble – and yes, dynamic – edge, demonstrating his “Dynamo shuffle” where he moonwalks as he jumbles his deck.With kind-of-self-taught magic, does it feel limitless, Zoe asks. “The more experience I have in the world, the more I can keep pushing the boundaries,” says Frayne. “For me, it’s not actually about what I do, it’s about the way it connects with you guys.”The talk is interspersed with clips from Frayne’s TV documentaries, where he’s visited classrooms, hospitals and community football teams to uplift and inspire. “It’s important to inspire the next generation, they’re the future leaders,” he says. “You don’t have to be confined by your environment, or defined by it. It’s important to show them that you can be anything you want to be.” Magic, which he learned from his grandfather, he continues, was a gateway out of his difficult school years. “Two guys would pick me up and put me inside a wheelie bin and take me to the top of the hill and then push me down the hill. It was horrible.” He started doing tricks to distract the bullies and “it saved me, I didn’t get beaten up any more.”Though his parents weren’t around so much while he was growing up – “my dad was in jail”, he confides – he credits being “left to my own devices” for his vivid imagination and “hustler” mentality. He says that he “felt isolated,” as a child, “but through magic, I can bring people together.”View image in fullscreenDynamo performs in the Astrolabe theatre at Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Kate Hutchinson/The Guardian“I got to not have adults telling me what I could and couldn’t do,” he continues, “I had no direction in some respects, but I believed anything was possible. I would try anything and I didn’t care about failure. Somehow I’m still trying but I keep landing on my feet.”He speaks about auditioning as a young man for a King’s Trust grant, which he won and it helped him to buy his first camera equipment. The rest he spent on tickets to hip-hop shows, where he’d charm his way backstage. In response to a reader’s question about the best experience of his career so far, he also goes back to his early years, when he would blag it backstage at hip-hop shows and impress his favourite rappers. Including one Mr Snoop Dogg.“I ended up backstage with him in a green room that was verygreen, right? I’m doing my magic for Snoop.” Afterwards, he asked to film the rapper doing a shout out for his new website and the rapper “turned around, found the beat on his laptop, put it on full volume, and then, for my camera, did a five-minute freestyle rap about all the magic he’d just seen. As a hip-hop fan, to have Snoop Dogg do a rap about you …” He felt as if he had “made it”.In 2018, his Crohn’s Disease became so severe that “I was basically in a position where I couldn’t even hold a pack of cards any more,” he says. “It knocked me out of the game. It got to the point where I felt quite worthless. I didn’t see the point in my existence if I couldn’t share magic.” After pulling himself back from the brink – and undergoing some hefty keyhole surgery, which he shows the audience – he decided that he wanted to pay his gift forward. Asked where he finds his inspiration these days, he says, “from real life: reading a lot, watching movies. When I watch a film and see a special effect, I’m like, ‘I want to figure that out!’”Increasingly, though, he is inspired by the people he meets along the way. “More recently, I get inspiration from going travelling around, meeting young people, trying to find a way to give some magic back.”He’s hoping to do a lot more of that this year. Frayne has just finished a run of 50-odd shows in Soho, London, under his real name, for the first time – a return to his closeup roots, rather than the eye-popping stunts he later became known for on national television. Clearly buoyed up by the experience, he’s hoping to take it on tour later this year. Closing this heartfelt in-conversation event, he adds: “I spent so much of my life focused on the magic in me,” he says, “I was missing out on the magic of everybody else, and now it’s like a whole new lease of life in me. I just want to, I want to show people my magic, but show people their magic as well.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025FestivalsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

For her latest, she worked with a Mongolian couple displaced from their farmlandGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailAndy HazelSun 29 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 20.06 EDTShare“There are so many hang-ups in the documentary world about this idea of ultimate truth,” says Gabrielle Brady. “There’s only subjectivity in documentary. It’s all a construction.”Ever since Louis Lumière filmed workers leaving his factory in 1895, documentary film has struggled with the idea of authenticity. Lumière’s 17-metre film is regarded as the first ever made yet even this modest document is a lie: it was filmed not on a work day but a Sunday. The ethnographer Robert Flaherty staged scenes in his 1922 documentary Nanook of the North,and it was Michael Moore’s crafty editing that made Roger and Mean emotive box office hit.Brady’s 2018 breakthrough film Island of the Hungry Ghosts, and her latest, The Wolves Always Come at Night, invite audiences, festival programmers, critics, funding bodies and peers to contend with what is, for many, still a new format: the hybrid documentary.“I only use that word, hybrid, to signify an in-between space,” Brady says. “It doesn’t tell you how it was made. It just lets you know that it’s not entirely documentary, or that the film-maker may have used some fictional tools, which most documentaries have.”Island of the Hungry Ghosts review – grim view of Australia’s GuantánamoRead moreTo create her films, Brady works with the subjects to tell their story.Island of the Hungry Ghostswas shot on Christmas Island where Brady entwined spiritual ceremonies; the millennia-old migration cycle of the island’s famous crabs; and the daily life of Poh Lin Lee, a counsellor working with asylum seekers being held in indefinite detention. The film, which failed to get funding in Australia, won 14 prizes at festivals around the world, including the grand jury prize at Sundance.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe film’s release drew attention to the risks faced by its subject, who spoke publicly despite laws at the time prohibiting health workers in offshore detention from doing so. For Brady, this was just one of many ethical complexities the project demanded.View image in fullscreenGabrielle Brady spent a year in Mongolia as part of a volunteer program producing and co-hosting a children’s television program“Ordinarily, protagonists don’t get any creative input,” she says. “If they’re not being paid and if it’s just their story for the sake of everyone else, that doesn’t seem a fair exchange. I like to think of people you’re working with more as team members, creative collaborators. I’m really big on people getting paid. Not for their story or to say a certain thing but for their time.”Brady’s new film, The Wolves Always Come at Night, follows a young couple, Davaa and Zaya, and their four children, living in the steppes ofMongolia. We get to know them through their connection with their animals and knowledge of the land, lovingly rendered by Brady in bright, dynamic and warmly intimate scenes. After a devastating dust storm, the family are forced to give up their livelihoods and move to the outskirts of the city, a sprawling shantytown known as thegerdistrict.Many of the film’s biggest themes – climate change, displacement, economic precarity, the end of a millennia-deep connection to land and animals – haunt the most powerful scenes but go unspoken. Naturalistic conversations take place between the family, scenes that feel inseparable from the story around them. In one particularly intimate moment, Davaa and Zaya lie in bed and contemplate their future. Davaa begins to cry before Zaya quietly scolds him, “Don’t cry in bed.” As Brady explains, moments like this were created collaboratively with the cast and crew.View image in fullscreen‘I’m authoring the vision; they’re authoring my story’: Brady’s collaboration with her film’s subjects and stars“For that scene, Davaa and I discussed how the audience can understand the grief he is carrying. I had witnessed that a few times, the burden that he carried; the way he would discuss it was incredibly potent and just laden with this weight. I’d had this idea: what if you were to meet an older herder in thegerdistrict and have this conversation? He said, ‘That would never happen. It has to be with Zaya and the kids can’t be there. It has to be dark, and it has to be quiet. This is [the only way] I would go to those places,’” she says. “Then we created that environment with no expectation of what would unfold.”Brady’s connection to Mongolia began when she was a teenager. Growing up in the New South Wales Blue Mountains west of Sydney, she studied theatre media in Bathurst with aspirations of becoming an actor. After working as a producer on Sunrise and The Morning Show, Brady joined a volunteer program and spent a year in Mongolia where she produced and co-hosted a children’s television program, Voice Box, designed to help people learn English. Mentioning the show brings forth a burst of laughter. “Oh my God, it was so wonderfully cheesy. We’d travel around, interview kids – like the school chess champion – and live with nomadic families. A lot of what was shown on TV then was imported from Russia or China, so the idea was to make something that was English, learning about Mongolian kids. Everything was handmade. It really looked like a 70s Australian TV set.”Once back in Australia, Brady chased that feeling to Yuendumu, a remote community in the Northern Territory, where she helped other film-makers make their films. It was there she realised she wanted to become a director.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot of my favourite films were from Europe and South America, and I wanted to learn a different way of seeing the world, so I went and studied film in Cuba.”In Cuba, Brady studied at Escuela Internacional de Cine y Televisión, a regional film-making school with no internet connection, where students are banned from using a camera for the first year of their three-year course. There, in a state of culture shock, Brady began again. “I burned everything I knew to the ground,” she says, “and rebuilt a vision for how I wanted to make films.” To graduate, she had to travel around the country, interviewing locals and collecting their stories.“The study itself blurred the lines between documentary and fiction,” Brady says – a practice she took into her own films. “Both Ghosts and Wolvesasked for this way of storytelling – to not create suffering for people to be inside of what they’re going through but instead create a bit of distance. I’m authoring the vision; they’re authoring my story.”View image in fullscreen‘I see documentaries as much an art form as fiction, but I don’t think other people do’: Gabrielle BradyThe seed for the story of her latest film was planted five years ago. On her return visits to Mongolia to see friends, Brady found that some had been forced to leave the countryside and move to the city. When she mentioned this to her friend, the producer Ariunaa Tserenpil, Tserenpil said it was the sort of story local film-makers would never tell.“In Mongolia, we are so connected to nature and our animals but we are not looking into each other because we are shy,” Tserenpil says. “We feel more comfortable with nature and we don’t talk about our grief. Outside of the city, each family lives a very long distance from each other, and we do not have a sense of community because nomads are very independent people. But Gab put these people at the centre. This intimacy is very beautiful.”The Golden Spurtle review – a cosy celebration of porridge and its championsRead moreBrady was “tentative and hesitant” about telling the story. “There’s a long legacy of foreign film-makers coming in and making a certain type of film in Mongolia particularly. But the idea grew on me,” she says. “We’re seeing two polarities. In one extreme, there’s this really extractionist way of film-making that’s very exploitative. But on the other side you end up saying, ‘Can you only make a film from the town you’re in?’ ‘Can you only make a film about a woman if you’re a woman?’ So, no. Let’s make something in between. An insider-outsider film and see if we can find a new dialogue in that way of storytelling as well.”While Brady’s work has earned widespread acclaim, it remains an anomaly in the documentary world. When she began making films in the 2010s, the ecosystem was at its critical and commercial zenith, with lauded film-makers including Laura Poitras, Alex Gibney and Errol Morris. Around the end of the decade came the rise of the streaming services and an insatiable demand for cheaply made nonfiction storytelling: formulaic true-crime exposés, sports films and celebrity profiles made with the approval of their participants. Documentaries that reach cinemas and awards circuits often centre on urgent modern catastrophes – the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the war in Gaza. Both trends make Brady’s work even more unusual.“The documentary world is topical by nature, and those are the films that might get awards,” says Brady. “I see documentaries as much an art form as fiction, but I don’t think other people do.”The Wolves Always Come at Night is in Australian cinemas from 3 July.

He is the only child from his primarytransitioning toa selective grammar school.He has always struggled with friendships and I feelthis is due to his autism. He is high-achieving academically. I don’t want him to change who he is or feel as if he can’t be himself. At the same time I know he can be standoffish and overwhelming when he is so focused on his own interests.He has just been invited to one of his new classmates’ birthday parties. He was shocked andgrateful to be invited, and it was heartbreaking. I don’t want him to be isolated in his new school and I don’t know how to help him to be ready and open to a brand new social setting. I would really appreciate any help or advice you could give.It’s wonderful that you are so thoughtful, and I’m sure your son appreciates having a father who considers his feelings. Most parents, whether their children are neurotypical or not, worry about the big change from primary to secondary.I went to UKCP-registered child and adolescent psychotherapist Lucy Fuller and theNational Autistic Society(NAS) which provided some useful links (see below). Fuller thought the fact that your son was invited to this party shows “he is being held in mind even before he starts at his new school, which is something special. Whether he goes or not, he has already made a contact with someone he will be starting secondary school with.” That he seems pleased is a really good sign and I hope he goes to the party.Every autistic person is different, but what’s important is that your son feels he can be himself. That’s hard for everyone starting school because teenagers are primed to want to fit in. As for being standoffish when focused, that isn’t so unusual in young people. Children can feel isolated when it comes to their feelings, so it’s important your son realises that every child who is starting school – no matter how they present – will be nervous; every child (and new teacher) will get lost in the school; and everyone makes mistakes – it’s how we develop as people.You can ask the school about specific support for your son, which should include places and people that he can go to when he needs support or feels overwhelmedFuller recommends that your son visit the school, if he hasn’t already. And if he has, that you find a good time to chat “about what it was like for him, what did he see or hear that interested him? What made him anxious?” Children love the practical details, so a rundown can help. What will his new mornings look like? What will the timings be? How will he get to school? Where will he put his stuff? Some people I know with autistic children find showing pictures of new places can help.Fuller said: “As he’s a bright student, it’s also good to talk to him about how the classwork will be more interesting and challenging, and this will be a positive part of the transition.” She asked: “Are there any clubs or activities where he can comfortably build relationships with smaller groups?”TheNASsuggests contacting the school to find out if they operate a “peer buddy” system, someone who can be paired up with your son who is already at the school, at least for the first few weeks. They also recommend you read the Autism Education Trust’sSchool Transitions Parent Guide.“There will be other students with diagnosed (and undiagnosed) autism,” Fuller adds. “And you can ask the school about specific support for your son, which should include places and people he can go to when he needs support or feels overwhelmed.”Every child I’ve ever known has had a hiccup at school, but the important thing is your son has an engaged father who can help him over these bumps in a way that helps him grow. I would also ask how your own time at school was as this can be a particularly triggering – and I use the word advisedly – time for parents. Make sure you separate out your anxieties from your son’s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Husband-and-wife team Ben and Bo Humphreys have brought their joint skills to the Edinburgh Castle, an elegantly restored 19th-century pub with an upstairs restaurant that in recent years has made quite a name for itself; before the Humphreys’ arrival, this same space was the lair ofWinsome’s Shaun Moffat, where plaudits and gongs were in ready supply, but then Moffat got his hands on his own place and this upstairs room needed a pair of cool, capable hands to take over.Look no further than Ben and Bo, who have a pedigree in forward-thinking Thai cuisine. Bo was born and raised in Thailand’s north-easternIsaanregion, before moving to Bangkok in her teens, while Ben has cooked at Manchester’s Thai fusion restaurantDistrictand, before that, atTattu,Rabbit in the MoonandLucky Cat. After the closure of District in 2022, the couple spent three years eating their way across Thailand and the US, picking up inspiration for dishes in which authentic Thai flavours, and occasionally Bo’s family-favourite recipes, could merge with the Korean and Mexican barbecue flavours of Miami smokehouses. Here, heat, citrus, fresh turmeric, shrimp paste and all the complexities of Bangkok cuisine meet relatively sleepy, low-and-slow American barbecue.View image in fullscreen‘A highlight’: Bangkok Diners Club’s artichoke and golden beetroot massaman curry with ‘decadently good chicken-fat rice’.Yes, many chefs in Bangkok do indeed cook over live fire, but the flames there are generally a little more lively than those permitted in this tiny kitchen of a wooden-floored pub in north-west England. And when Bangkok meets Manchester via Miami, you get the likes of pork jowl taco with a rich, smoky, burnt-tomatojaew, and southern Thai muttongaeng khuathat’s hot with black pepper and dried red chilli, and served with pickled celeriac and fresh roti.Bangkok Diners Club claims to be new and innovative, as, let’s face it, every new restaurant does, but they actually have a valid point here. This small kitchen slinging out raw bass with silky calamansinam jimand rice bran to a tiny collection of tables is a very long way away from the traditional timeworn Thai scene in the UK, where pad thais and green curries are dished up on a table featuring a golden statuette of Buddha from Dunelm. That said, the place is also a long way from that purposefully edgy UK-Thai cooking I’ve suffered at many a hip British Bangkok-led establishment, always with an English chef and where the dishes turn up as and when, with each one hotter, grittier, twiggier and less moreish than the last.View image in fullscreen‘A long way from the traditional UK Thai scene’: raw bass, calamansinam jimand rice bran at Manchester’s Bangkok Diners Club.The Humphreys’ restaurant, on the other hand, is authentic, boundary-pushing, a little odd – and also makes perfect sense. Smoked mackerel with jet-black charred skin comes on a salad of fresh grapefruit and ginger, followed by anam toksalad that’s heavy with thick slices of salt-aged beef and comes with bone marrow aïoli. Bo serves us, taking delight in the fact that I’ve brought my brother for his birthday and he’s ready to eat. She’s keen we try the battered pickled onion rings with curry salt and the grilled chicken skewers made heavenly with milk caramel.Artichoke and golden beetroot massaman curry – heavy on the cardamom, cinnamon and star anise – is a highlight for me, and comes with decadently good chicken-fat rice, while the roast pork bellyphat phetwith rhubarb stir-fry is also a huge hit. We order steamed broccoli with funky, fermented yellow beans to hit our vitamin quota, and pick our way through a papaya salad made more meaningful by the addition of shrimp floss.View image in fullscreen‘Simple, fun’: Bangkok Diners Club’s lolly of rice ice-cream.This is a cracking little progressive, family-run place that has hit the ground running and will no doubt soon be one of Manchester’s hottest dining tickets. It has a small menu that has totted up many air miles in its making, and a big, generous heart. That evening’s menu was the first to feature a Bangkok Diners Club dessert in the shape of an ice lolly-shaped mass of rice ice-cream with a Jackson Pollock-esque topping of zinging fruit sauces. Simple, fun and just enough to send us off out into Saturday night Manchester with a spring in our step and deep intentions to come back.When so many far-afield cuisines collide, I don’t usually expect the middle ground to be some battered pickled onion rings, but this is Manchester, and that’s bizarrely, beautifully fitting.Bangkok Diners ClubThe Edinburgh Castle, Blossom Street, Manchester M4, 0161-414 0004.

It’s come through the Booking.com app, or in an email that looks legitimate, so you get out your credit card in panic and pay.As the summer holidays get into full swing many of us are primed to hear from travel providers – making it open season for scammers.One of many holiday-related frauds preys on customers who have booked somewhere to stay via the platform Booking.com, either via its website or app.In the UK,Action Fraud received 532 reportsof the scam between June 2023 and September 2024, with victims losing a total of £370,000.It says that it is likely hackers are using phishing attacks against accommodation providers and then using the details to contact customers – sometimes via WhatsApp but often through the real Booking.com platform. This means the usual things to look out for – odd email addresses, or texts, may not apply.Cases seen by Guardian Money have typically involved the theft of several hundred pounds.The global nature of the platform means it can happen to you wherever in the world you live, or plan to holiday. Regulators in countries includingAustraliahave warned of the issue.Booking.com said: “Unfortunately, there is an increasing number of online scams targeting many businesses operating in the e-commerce space. With the rise of AI, cybercriminals are able to create increasingly sophisticated scams.”It said continually invested in cybersecurity technology, and incidents on the platform were rare.What the scam looks likeThe message may say that your payment details need to be verified, or that there has been a problem with your card. It will try to make you panic by telling you your accommodation will be cancelled if you don’t respond – it will probably give you a deadline to act by – usually a few hours away.There will be a link in the message for you to click on to give your card details.View image in fullscreenA scam message apparently sent via Booking.com.View image in fullscreenA scam message apparently sent via Booking.com.A separate scam also preying on would-be holidaymakers involves fake Booking.com web pages which are used to trick people into downloading a malicious file that gives criminals full control of your device.The technology firm HP Wolf Security says scammers are emailing links to the pages and visitors are asked to accept cookies before they can see the full site – it is when they press “accept” that the file downloads.View image in fullscreenScreengrab sent by HP Wolf Security.Photograph: HP Wolf SecurityWhat the messages ask forA payment, or credit card details which the scammers say will just be used to pre-authorise or verify the card before your stay. They then charge it.What to doTry not to panic about your holiday and don’t respond until you’ve checked the message is genuine.Booking.com advises: “Always double-check the property’s payment policies listed on the booking page or in your confirmation email. If there is no pre-payment policy or deposit requirement outlined, but you’re asked to pay in advance to secure your booking, it is likely a scam.”If you are in doubt, contact Booking.com’s customer service team and/or the accommodation provider directly.Be suspicious of any links you are sent. Genuine payments will be made on the Booking.com app or website – you won’t be sent to another site.Look out for common fraud tactics and giveaways. “Scam messages often include urgent language and may contain spelling or grammar errors,” Booking.com says.If you have put your card details into a site, call your card provider. You may need to block or cancel your card.Booking.com also advises enabling two-factor authorisation on your accountExplore more on these topicsConsumer affairsScam watchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You rarely here ofpeople thumbing a liftany more. Is the world more dangerous or just meaner?Ann Langdon, EssexSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyI hitchhiked regularly between 2010 and 2016, in the UK, northern Europe, all over Australia and New Zealand and about 3,000 miles in the US. With the exception of New Zealand, most people who picked me up told me that it was very difficult. It rarely was, even as a solo male. They also said it was dangerous. If that’s true, I’m lucky. The worst experience I had was getting sunburned at a Memphis service station. The only country where nobody stopped for me was Sweden, but their rural bus service got me through.Harvey Bruce Milligan, Taipei, TaiwanI do. I am a 56-year-old woman fromAotearoa (New Zealand)and it is my long-distance travel mode of choice. In the late 80s and early 90s, all us unemployed, activist, artistic or studying folks did, as few could afford cars and many places here have limited public transport options. I was often on the road three or more days a week, usually alone, as my work involved organising performance art all over the country with no budget. No internet and expensive long-distance phone calls meant that communication options were mail or just turning up.Some people said it wasn’t safe, but there are simple precautions you can take: don’t sit between men; don’t get into cars driven erratically or by people who smell of alcohol; develop a connection. I have always knitted, meaning I am holding a harmless-looking weapon if needed. Anyway, almost everyone isn’t a baddie – and you are just as likely to encounter villains in your street, home or workplace. I am always surprised by those who hitched in the past but now wouldn’t want their children to.Nowadays, I do it because I’m still poor, I’m still doing political performance and I really enjoy it. It’s a form of mutual aid. The art of hitchhiking involves giving people what they want in a passenger, whether it is the satisfaction of helping someone out, sharing great conversation, or validating or challenging their ideas. I dress colourfully and interesting-but-not-weird – tartan is always good – and smile broadly. I am usually picked up within 10 minutes.I am often the only hitchhiker on the road, when once I would need to walk past a line of others. When I am driving a car, I will pick up all others. If I have a choice, I’ll take the big, scruffy, tattooed man with the dog over the perfectly matching blond backpackers, whom someone else will pick up. I find a small percentage are annoying – stinky, drunk or dishonest, but most are fine – but they’re just people who need to get somewhere.Katie JulianConfessions of an 82-year-old hitchhikerRead moreAs a young man – I’m 81 now – I moved to London from Sunderland. To visit home, I often depended on hitchhiking. It usually worked well. When I got my first car, I returned the service and always picked up people. In those days, it was easy – roundabouts everywhere ensured an easy possibility for stopping briefly at the side of the road. Motorways have killed that option.Also, attitudes have changed. I continue offering ride sharing through dedicated websites. Here in France, where I live, it works remarkably well, but it wouldn’t work at all in the UK; comments from friends and family when I visit can be summarised as: “You won’t get me in a car with someone I don’t know.” It’s sad, as I have had mainly positive experiences in continental Europe: the occasional disagreeable passenger, but never any real problems.David HeskethEasy answer. Too many violent US movies about drivers picking up serial killers or meeting them in the Australian outback put everyone off trusting our fellow human beings. Much like the movie Jaws put lots of people off swimming in the sea for years. These movies make millions, but have nasty, long-running unintended consequences.MikeI blameRutger Hauer. In 1986,The Hitchermarked the beginning of the end for hitchhiking!JohnI hitchhiked around Britain and continental Europe for years in the 1970s and there was always a queue of fellow hitchers at the beginning of every motorway. Then everyone got terrified of strangers. Tabloids printed stories about crazed hitchhikers who would attack you.The Yorkshire Ripperhappened. Companies (especially in haulage) made it policy not to pick up travellers. So, no more lifts from lorry drivers or sales reps. In reality, the dangerous ones were often the ones offering the lifts, but I somehow got out of every dodgy situation. Most drivers were decent folk, often ex-squaddies who had hitched in their youth (and very rarely fellow hippies!). It is sad there is so little trust now, when there are so many single-occupant cars and so many people who cannot afford trains. I had some great adventures.The last time I tried hitching (about 20 years ago, when my car broke down), rain was bucketing down and it was the middle of the night. An old lady stopped and wound down the window. Before I could thank her, she said: “Oh, I thought you were my son,” and drove off. I yelled at her car: “I amsomebody’sson!” Ah well …Bernard TowersI was a solo female hitchhiker around the UK and continental Europe for 10 years, although I was happy to travel with a partner, too. The familiar spots between Edinburgh and London are still recognisable to me. I was seventeen in ’69, so the hippy spirit burned brightly around me and many people in the following decade understood and appreciated the main arguments in favour of hitchhiking. That made it a safe and, at times, enlightening experience. Lorry drivers and long-distance drivers with just the cab or car radio benefited from having company with someone who felt beholden – to be entertaining, or a good listener. The get-out clause was that we could easily be expelled at a service station along the way. The ever-increasing number of services were also places to catch some sleep or find a new lift, so they created a relaxed feeling of no obligation between hitchhikers and drivers.I vividly – and fondly – remember being kissed and embraced by a Dutch driver in northern France about two in the morning when we’d arrived safely. Although we couldn’t understand each other in the slightest, we had chatted for hours, so he managed to drive and stay awake (and we both stayed alive).Hitchhiking was mostly a byproduct of low pay and poverty. The young were poor and many more young people than today were poor across the classes. The standard of living was very low in the 1970s, witnessed by low car ownership, especially among young people, and middle-class students neither received early inheritances nor handouts from mum or dad. The upper middle classes liked to keep their offspring “short” of cash, as they were expected to make their own way.Many older drivers understood that the young, like their own children, were hard-up. Many chose personally to share their own newfound freedoms of the road with them in vehicles they loved to drive. And it made them feel a bit superior to the new funky generation. During that decade, given the low car ownership figures and new motorways across Europe, driving around was just so liberating and fun. I had experiences in Germany of those middle-aged men driving their BMWs, Audis or Mercedes on the autobahns with no speed limit, one finger on the wheel. At the time, that was the stereotype to end all stereotypes.Car transport was liberating all over Europe as it opened up freedoms beyond rail – very expensive, even then – and long-haul bus journeys. I did try buses twice across Europe and both experiences verged on manic: the first time to Paris, with an aggressive driver who tried to fight with a passenger; and then from the former Yugoslavia in dense fog, the driver speeding recklessly for hours and hours.TabsI’ve been hitchhiking in Britain for three years,writing a Substackand a book, Britain By Thumb, on the subject. It’s a great shame so few of my generation practise the dying art. I’ve heard various theories as to why, ranging from the damage done by horror movies to our outsourcing of trust to apps.I’d say the issue is more about hitchhiking’s unpredictability. We’re so used to knowing the exact minute at which we’ll arrive that the prospect of standing in a layby for a potentially limitless amount of time, being given the middle finger by passing cars and then possibly getting murdered has put most off.Of course, apart from the middle fingers, hitchhiking is not like that at all. I’ve caught hundreds of rides and I rarely wait more than half an hour. I’ve never once felt in danger (except for bad driving) and I’ve had many uplifting experiences that have made me more confident in who I am and more trusting of my fellow humans.Having said all that, I met my first fellow hitchhiker in the wild the other day, at an A1 service station. She told me not to get my hopes up. She’d been waiting for a lift for three days …Nico LethbridgeIn the UK, hitching is way more difficult than it was when I did it a lot in the 70s. The hard shoulders on motorway slip roads and other main routes have been removed, so there is no safe place for drivers to pull over. Besides that, modern cars are just too fast and drivers do not have time to assess whether they want to stop for you. It is still possible on country roads, but again it is too dangerous, for the same reasons. I have more recently hitchhiked, but that was in the Pyrenees, where there is a custom of stopping for people due to the lack of local buses. A further reason for the paucity of hitchhikers is that long-distance buses (if not trains) are relatively cheap – in my day, we were all too poor. Also, look at university car parks; they are full. When I went to university in the 70s, only a handful of students out of 3,000 had cars.camwrthgamExplore more on these topicsLife and styleNotes and queriesTransportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’d been helping a friend do some work at a property in the Colo valley, north-west of Sydney, and was heading home about 11pm. As I was driving across the Colo River Bridge, there was a sudden, loud bang. I’d hit a pothole and my front driver’s side tyre had blown, just about swallowing my hatchback with it.It was 1988 and, in those days, the area around Colo was pretty rough. It was full of bikies – proper bikies, not the drug-running kind that don’t even have bikes nowadays. The back roads around there are mainly deserted and can be eerie at the best of times.The kindness of strangers: a gentle flight attendant made me feel I wasn’t aloneRead morePulled over on the side of the bridge, I saw a pack of bikies approaching through the rain, which was now pouring down. Just like in a movie, they pulled up around me, engines bubbling along ominously, all leather and gang colours. I thought: “This is it – they’re gonna kill me. They’ll take everything I have, beat me up and chuck me over the bridge.”In those days, you didn’t look at those guys twice.But just as I was contemplating how I could persuade them to spare my life, the head guy yelled out: “Need a hand?”I said, “Err, yes,” telling him it would be great if they could leave their lights on – I already had the jack out with the new tyre beside me but it was too dark to see what I was doing. With the speed of a Formula One crew, three of the bikies took over, swapped the tyre, let down the jack and then tore off over the hill.I’ve never thought badly about bikies since – those guys were so friendly and nice. I now try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Their appearance was perfect timing. If they hadn’t shown up I would have been stuck there until morning.I’m not sure if they were Hells Angels but, to this day, I believe they were heaven sent.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

In April last year, shortly before the election of a Labour party that was known to be promising a public inquiry, Northumbria police destroyed “two boxes containing documents/records in relation to the miners’ strike and Orgreave” (Northumbria police destroy Battle of Orgreave and other miners’ strike files, 24 June). The force claims to have done so because the records “were outside of the retention period” and that the destruction was “in line with force policy and the Data Protection Act 2018”. It is not presently known if any of the other forces deployed at Orgreave have also destroyed documents.The “authorised professional practice” issued by the College of Policing in 2023 in relation to review, retention and disposal of material that has “historical value and enduring public interest” or which may be required “for academic ... or statistical purposes” is that such material “should be archived”, irrespective of the fact that the retention period has expired. Moreover, the Data Protection Act and its regulations expressly allow for the retention of such material.The egregious examples of police misconduct on the day arenow well-known. At trial it was finally conceded that a South Yorkshire detective had literally dictated the script to officers sitting at desks in what became known as “the schoolroom”. An inquiry may further reveal the role of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office. But not if police forces are simply allowed to unilaterally destroy the evidence in advance. The government should immediately act to prevent it.Edward Rees KCLondonGovernment papers stored at the National Archives are sometimes withheld or weeded, but are an essential tool for research historians. It is disturbing to read that Northumbria police have destroyed files relating to Orgreave. This may have conformed with a document retention process, but Sherlock Holmes will not be required to work out why it happened just before the election of a government committed to an inquiry into the events that took place at Orgreave.Perhaps the home secretary could ensure that no further police files are destroyed before the inquiry takes place, if necessary by requiring copies to be lodged with the civil servants responsible for setting it up. A democratic society needs an accurate record of its history, even if it may be an uncomfortable one for some.Dr Keith FlettLondon Socialist Historians GroupHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Discontented MPs and disabled people alike will welcome the assurance that people currently receiving personal independence payments (Pip) or the health element of universal credit will be protected from changes. But the episode is damaging, has caused thousands of disabled people needless worry, and may come to be seen as pivotal in Keir Starmer’s tenure.There is something deeply invidious about having two classes of benefit recipients – the protected current recipients, and those making future claims. At the same time, it is clear that the benefits system does need reform and, in particular, needs to support people into work rather than taking a punitive and brutal approach to cost saving.How Starmer has ended up in this position is fascinating, if it were not extraordinary for a government with such a majority and the potential to make radical and equitable change to be repeatedly wrongfooted. U-turns look weak and messy, and presenting them as a response to active listening is unlikely to convince anyone. Starmer claimsnot to be ideological, and there is the issue; policy is being shaped not by a coherent strategic vision and principle-driven aspirations for better lives, opportunities and genuine equality, but by economic necessity and caution.It’s a flawed model, certain to intensify divisions between ministries,Labourmembers, taxpayers, benefit recipients and the wider electorate. There is major learning and reflection needed by the government; the optics have gone badly wrong, but the welfare reform chaos is a symptom of a much deeper political malaise.Dr Melanie HenwoodHartwell, NorthamptonshireI am a social worker and I support cutting Pips. I have encountered a number of young adults trapped in a cycle of welfare dependency, unemployment and chaotic lifestyles. They share a belief that the state must fund every aspect of life, and a lack of understanding that benefits come not “from the government” but are redistributed from taxation of the population.Pip is often claimed on the basis of anxiety or depression, but the idea of working to support oneself, or seeking training or education to make work more attainable, is absent from their thinking. The answer? Probably a combination of education, early interventions and nudges towards culture change, including reducing the availability of Pip. In the long term the status quo won’t help the young people I work with.Name and address suppliedWhat is not being made clear in government statements and coverage of the cuts to disability benefits is the personal independence payment’s relationship to work. Pip is paid to help with the additional costs arising from disability. It is paid to people in work and out of work. It is crucial in enabling people to stay in work, paying for technical and personal support, health needs, travel and other costs. It also enables people who cannot work full-time to work. What will happen to these working people when they can no longer afford the additional costs? It’s clear the government does not understand the role of Pip in enabling work.Jean BetteridgeManchesterAs we approach the parliamentary vote on the new welfare bill, spare a thought for the many Pip recipients who received the benefit when it was known as disability living allowance. I suspect, for many, the scars still linger from that government change to the system.What that revealed was that disability allowance was not directed to those most in need of it due to their disability. Rather, receiving the new benefit depended upon one’s ability to fill out a 40-page form. Next, it depended on having the physical and mental resilience to challenge the result and take it to a tribunal. This was a protracted and stressful period of time. For many, who made it that far, the tribunal reversed the DWP scoring and people found that they had their old level of benefit reinstated. Just a shame that stress makes many medical conditions far worse for the individual.Many years ago, I believed that the DWP wanted to help those with serious disabilities. These days, I have as much faith in them as they appear to have in disabled people (DWP letters now seem to be written with a subtext of “you’re a fraud and we’ll catch you”).Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

At least noncompliance with inspections, or even strike action, should be considered. How on earth is the judgment of schools on a new five-point scale going to improve thelife chancesof children, as the education secretary apparently believes, let alone solve the problems caused by Ofsted inspections, such as the extreme anxiety they provoke, and the damaging effects they have on teacher recruitment and retention?With up to 11 areas of each school’s performance and five grades, the danger still exists that some heads of schools will start allocating one to five points, with five for “exemplary”, one for “causing concern”, and multiply them by 11, so that schools with 50-55 points will be seen as “outstanding”, and those below in need of improvement.What is needed is not a simple shifting of the goalposts like this, but wholesale reform, where inspectors are regarded as allies and advisers rather than aggressive, fault-finding assessors, and where reports do not grade and criticise, but praise, advise and recommend. And can we assume that under our Labour government, intent on breaking down barriers to opportunity, that the new system of inspection will extend to all independent schools as well?Bernie EvansLiverpoolHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It resonated with my experience of diagnosis and frustration at the complete lack of support. I was first tested in my teens and told my blood test was normal. I was retested at 34 when I went to my GP about weight gain and struggling with exhaustion. When I was confirmed to have PCOS I was warned about the health issues, and told the best thing I could do was lose weight, even though this would be very difficult, and to come back when I was struggling to conceive.Charlie is right: the amount of time and energy I had to put in to try to understand how to be healthy has been a huge drain. Especially sifting through the masses of misinformation. It took me two years and a lot of hard work to understand a diet and exercise plan that worked for me. It’s been difficult and lonely trying to navigate this on my own.Despite the warnings, I was lucky and got pregnant easily. Unfortunately, my maternity care is being coloured by a lack of understanding of PCOS. I know I am at greater risk of miscarriage, gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, but my midwife dismissed my concerns about all but the diabetes. I had an extra test for diabetes early in my pregnancy, thankfully negative and another booked for 28 weeks. But I have been struggling with anxiety, as I am at greater risk with no support or advice. Being dismissed as worrying about nothing did not help.TheNHSneeds to provide better understanding and support for people with PCOS. I hope it improves quickly. I would hate, if I have a daughter, for her to have the same experience I have had.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsPolycystic ovary syndromeWomen's healthHealthWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)NHSPregnancylettersShareReuse this content"

He uses a walking a stick and wears foot braces as he recovers from injuries he says he sustained in Tanzania.Photograph: Carlos Mureithi/The Guardian“We’re not going to let them get away with this,” said Mwangi, a well-known Kenyan photojournalist and activist. Atuhaire, a lawyer, journalist and critic of the government of the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, said: “We need to hold these guys accountable to know that they cannot violate people unprovoked like that.”Mwangi and Atuhaire, who had travelled to Tanzania to attend a court hearing for a treason case against the opposition politician Tundu Lissu on 19 May, say they were taken from their hotel by people they described as security officials, illegally detained and verbally and physically abused.Mwangi said his beating started at an immigration office that afternoon when a security official slapped and punched him repeatedly in the presence of Atuhaire and three lawyers. He said he was assaulted again at a police station, where security personnel accused the activists of having travelled to Tanzania to disrupt peace and ruin the country.“The real torture,” Mwangi said, happened that evening when a group of about seven men – whom he described as having bloodshot eyes and smelling of alcohol – and a woman handcuffed and blindfolded him and Atuhaire and drove them to a compound.Both activists said that at the compound they were ordered to strip and were suspended upside down then hit with wooden planks on their soles. They said their attackers stifled their screams by stuffing Mwangi’s underwear into his mouth and putting some cloth in Atuhaire’s mouth.The activists said their attackers inserted what seemed to be their hands or other objects into their rectums and smeared excrement on Atuhaire’s body, then photographed them and told them not to reveal what had happened. Two days later they were dumped at their countries’ borders.View image in fullscreenAgather Atuhaire shows some of her bruises and scars to colleagues at a hospital in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, on 23 May.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images“I didn’t see us coming out of there alive,” said Atuhaire. “It was really, really painful.”Mwangi said: “Nothing in my mind or in my life prepared me for this. I’ve been injured before, I’ve been beaten before, I’ve been shot before. My house has been bombed. I’ve seen all kind of extremities and cruelties, but I’ve never felt such kind of pain.”The Guardian has approached a Tanzanian police spokesperson for comment. Last week Tanzania’s representative to the UN, Abdallah Possi,tolda meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva: “Although these claims against the government are highly doubtful, we take the allegations of torture, sexual abuse and malpractices very seriously. That is why the government is currently investigating and, if established, those concerned will be held accountable.”A series of killings, kidnappings,arrestsand tortures over the past year have prompted widespread condemnation locally and internationally. Among those killed was Mohamed Ali Kibao, a member of the secretariat of the main opposition party Chadema, who was found beaten and with his face doused with acid in September.In April, Father Charles Kitima, a Catholic priest who is vocal on democratic reforms and rights issues, was brutally attacked near his residence. Earlier this month, the government deregistered a church belonging to Josephat Gwajima, a politician from the ruling party, after he called out illegal detentions and enforced disappearances and announced a prayer campaign to seek divine intervention for Hassan and other national leaders. And last week two men who posted talkshows about democracy and governance on YouTube were arrested for “improper use of social media”.There is no evidence of Hassan’s personal involvement in the incidents, many of which the government has condemned. Nevertheless, opposition politicians and rights campaigners say her administration is overseeing a return to the fear-based tactics of her predecessor,John Magufuli. Earlier this month she warned activists from neighbouring countries against “trying to destabilise” Tanzania.Maria Sarungi Tsehai, a Tanzanian rights activist, described the targeting of non-Tanzanians as unprecedented and a “sign of huge panic” on the part of the Hassan administration in the run-up to her first presidential electoral test.“What we’re seeing is a very insecure presidential candidate,” said Tsehai, who lives in self-exile in Nairobi. “She has to lean more heavily on that security apparatus. And she has decided that she doesn’t want to have any free or fair election. She just wants to get her second term. And that decision comes at a very heavy price.”Last year, Tsehai wasabducted from the streetsof the Kenyan capital by armed men and feared she would become the latest victim of a spate of enforced deportations from Kenya. However, she was released a short time later without crossing the border after news of her kidnapping spread quickly on social media.View image in fullscreenSamia Suluhu Hassan will face her first presidential election in October after taking over from John Magufuli.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyIn the months after Hassan took office following Magufuli’s death in 2021, the president gained domestic and international approval for reconciling with the opposition and reversing some of Magufuli’s repressive policies. But since then awave of repressionhas wiped out hopes of lasting reform.Hassan’s CCM party has ruled the country since independence. The opposition and civil society have long called for reform of the constitution, which critics say grants the president and the ruling party excessive powers.Earlier this year, Lissu was arrested and charged with treason and cybercrime offences, and his Chadema party – which had called for a boycott of this year’s elections unless electoral reforms were enacted – was disqualified from participating.Mwangi said CCM was acting for self-preservation. “What Suluhu is trying to do is win an election by any means necessary,” he said. “She’s reading from a dictator’s manual [that says] ‘brutalise and beat people into submission’.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They said they had decided to speak about their alleged abuse to shine a light on the plight of Tanzanians who had gone through similar experiences.“There’s no level of shame or stigma that is more important than pursuing justice,” Atuhaire said. “Justice is the driving factor – these people must be held accountable for what they did to us, for what they have done to Tanzanians.”Explore more on these topicsTanzaniaKenyaUgandaAfricaHuman rightsProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The festival, in its second year, also attracted films from other parts of the world, including the UK, Canada and Serbia, withSofian Francis, a British actor, stunt performer and film-maker with Caribbean heritage, taking home five awards for his film Dante’s Inferno – The Ascension.The festival organiser, Ava Eagle Brown, a writer and entrepreneur, said she aimed to leverage Jamaica’s strong global brand and the government’s commitment to growing the film industry through financing initiatives such as the J$1bn ($6.2m or £4.52m)Jamaica screen development initiative(JSDI), to catalyse global collaborations.The initiative offers grants to Jamaican citizens and residents, and companies registered in Jamaica who meet theireligibility criteria.“Jamaica, theCaribbeanas a whole, has some amazing and compelling stories, and we are great storytellers,” said Brown. “But we don’t have enough of our stories being told outside of Jamaica by Jamaicans. That is why the festival is focused on co-production. So, you see people from Canada, America, France, Ghana and the UK. And we’re discussing how we can co-produce to create a unique sound and a unique flavour.”View image in fullscreenSherando Ferril (right) said collaborations would help address obstacles such as effective film distribution; Cornelius Grant (left) said the initiative was ‘the beginning of something great’.Photograph: VKVISION.TMThe goal, Brown added, was to create a Jamaican film brand on par with other Jamaican exported culture such as reggae and dancehall. The festival, she said, would help to achieve this by putting Jamaican actors and film-makers in direct contact with film industry leaders from around the world. “I mean, where in Jamaica can rural children run into a Netflix series producer or somebody from Canal+?” she said. “That is what is happening at the Black River festival.”The award-winning Jamaican actor and film-maker Sherando Ferril said collaborations would help address some of the obstacles to film production, such as effective distribution.Stephanie Hazle Lyle, the president of theJamaican chapter of Women in Film and Television, said the focus on films would reap economic benefits down the line.In 2023,the government announcedthat Jamaica’s creative sector had generated approximately US$2.2bn in the previous year, accounting for 5.2% of the country’s GDP.Wilford “Billy” Heaven, the CEO of Jamaica’sculture, health, arts, sports and education fund(Chase), a government fund which has contributed J$10m over two years to the Black River festival, described the Jamaican film industry as a “powerful catalyst for economic growth, cultural preservation, and global visibility”.The film commissioner Jackie Jacqueline Jackson spoke about the importance of the JSDI. This two-year initiative, which is in the final stages of processing its first set of applications, has six categories: development, production, completion, film festival and market attendance, and marketing and distribution.The aim, she said, was to transform Jamaica from being primarily a service industry for film, with more than 100 projects coming to the country every year to shoot, mainly from the US and the UK, to creating more of its own content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eventually, when it was reopened on appeal, 10 low-ranking officers were implicated in his torture. Two were convicted, but neither ever served jail time.Michael Woodward’s final moments have been pieced together from eyewitness accounts and testimonies, but those of many others have not – and activists fear that time is running out.“The easy cases are all done,” said Dr Collins, “Some of the people who might have been going to talk have died.”In Chile, the armed forces have long tried to obstruct progress, either by remaining silent or handing over partial or misleading information.Progress has been achingly slow.“The state never did enough to find any of the disappeared, but now the resources are there,” said Rodríguez.“Maybe the [search] plan came late, but it represents the state coming to settle its debts.”Searches are being carried out at 20 sites up and down the country, but as yet, no finds have been made – and some fear that progress could soon be checked.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Legal Medical Service (SML) prepares the forensic excavations to find the remains of Woodward in Valparaiso, Chile.Photograph: Adriana Thomasa/The Guardian“Of course there is going to be disappointment that there haven’t been any big discoveries yet, but if the plan survives the next administration, that’s almost an achievement in itself,” said Dr Collins.In November , Chileans will vote in a presidential election in which three of the four current leading candidates offer rightwing agendas to replace leftist president Gabriel Boric, who ratified the national search plan.Woodward’s last home, painted bright blue, still stands on a Valparaíso street corner; neighbours still use “Miguel’s house” as a reference when giving directions.And despite its dark history, the Esmeralda is still in service in the Chilean navy. It is frequently picketed by protestors at ports around the world, returning periodically to haunt its victims from Valparaíso’s wide bay.Chile’s forensic medical service says that further searches for Woodward’s body will be carried out in the cemetery in Playa Ancha imminently.“If we find Miguel, the fight doesn’t end there,” said Rodríguez. “He lived with us and we have a history with him, but he’s just one of those we are missing – there will still be hundreds more to find.”“We’ll keep fighting until we have justice, whatever that may look like.”Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

An ADB sign was visible in the background.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAustralia’s minister for the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said the “branding” of multilateral development projects had been a consistent frustration for the government.“It’s not Chinese assistance. A Chinese state-owned enterprise won a contract under the Asian Development Bank … that project is funded by the ADB.“The largest donors to the ADB are countries like Japan and Australia, which is part of my frustration … because people driving past would assume it’s funded by China because you see Chinese state-owned enterprise branding everywhere, but it’s funded by the taxpayers of countries like Japan and Australia.”Conroy said he hadlobbied the ADBto improve its procurement processes – “to make sure they go for quality rather than the cheapest bid” – and to limit nationalised “branding” of projects, reforms to which it has agreed.The ADB is a major development backer across the Pacific. Australia is the fund’s second-highest contributor after Japan.Asked if he felt China was seeking to bolster its influence through multilateral organisations like the ADB, Conroy told the Guardian: “I think that’s a reasonable conclusion.“I’m sure they seek to make money out of these projects as well, but if they’re able to brand them with a [state-owned enterprise]’s name, then there’s a secondary benefit, obviously.”Conroy said the contest for influence extended beyond Bougainville, which is seeking independence from Papua New Guinea by 1 September 2027.“We’ve been very clear that there’s a permanent state of contest in the Pacific, that Australia is seeking to be the partner of choice for every Pacific nation and that China is seeking a role there as well.”Emma Veve, director general of the ADB’s Pacific Department, said the bank was expanding across the region, with strong support from countries like Australia.“ADB is proud of its work and committed to ensuring that project information is visible to the public during the execution of construction works and that there is a precise acknowledgment of project funding sources.”A dreadlocked rebel soldier kept me alive in Bougainville 28 years ago. Reuniting with him was an emotional experience | Mike BowersRead moreIn the context of broader contestation in the Pacific, there are concerns from traditional allies over a deepening Chinese influence, particularly around security: three Pacific countries have “flipped” their formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing since 2019 and China now has police training programs in Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu.In the US, the conservative Heritage Foundation – whose Project 2025 document has guided much of Donald Trump’s agenda – argues the possibility of an independent Bougainville is ageostrategic opportunityfor America.“The US must take advantage of this opportunity, or risk ceding to Beijing a first-mover advantage in a vital corner of the Indo-Pacific, where the balance of power and influence could easily tip in China’s favour.”But Bougainville’s deputy president, Patrick Nisira, said concerns over Chinese influence were fuelled by sceptical “western media sources”.“Thedearth of options from traditional development partnersover the last 20 years, a rapidly shortening timeframe for self-governance … and now Chinese companies’ approaches for partnerships in these very areas, make such opportunities worth considering for the benefit of the people,” he said.Oliver Nobetau, project director of the Australia-Papua New Guinea Network at the Lowy Institute, said he believes Bougainville will declare independence on 1 September 2027.“Is it going to be successful?

Yes, absolutely.”Bougainville is less than 1,500km from the Australian coast, but the pair share a complex history: first as coloniser and colonised when Bougainville was part of the Australian-controlled Territory of Papua and New Guinea.Bougainville fought a war to shut down Panguna mine. Now it wants to reopen itRead moreBeginning in the 1970s, Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto ran Panguna mine, which sparked Bougainville’s brutal civil war. The Australian government was also directly implicated in the conflict when helicopters provided to PNG were fitted with weapons and turned on the Bougainvillean people.But the Australian government was also a key agent in brokering the peace deal that ended the conflict.Q&AWhat caused the Bougainville civil war?ShowBougainville, a group of islands off Papua New Guinea to the north of Australia, has been variously controlled by Britain, Germany, Japan, Australia and PNG.It declared independence in 1975 as the Republic of North Solomons, but was absorbed into the newly independent PNG weeks later.Its close ethnic ties and proximity to the Solomons archipelago means it has always sat uneasily with Port Moresby’s rule.That discontent came to a violent head in 1988 after a long-running dispute over the lucrative Panguna copper and gold mine.The mine, carved from a mountain in central Bougainville, was critically important to PNG, at one point generating more than 45% of the country's national export revenue.Multinational Rio Tinto and other international investors earned nearly US$2bn from the mine over 17 years of operation. But less than 1% of the mine’s profits went to Bougainvilleans, whose homes and lands had been destroyed by it.Under the leadership of a former mine worker, Francis Ona, disaffected Bougainvilleans ran a sabotage campaign which forced the mine’s closure in 1989.The PNG Government responded by sending in police, then soldiers, to restore law and order. Bougainville was blockaded and the island descended into a brutal civil war that ran for a decade, and saw as many as 20,000 people die.PNG later hired international mercenaries to end the conflict (the notorious Sandline affair), before a peace agreement was signed in 2001.In a 2019 referendum, 97.7% of Bougainvilleans voted in favour of independence. Many argue that reopening Panguna mine will be key to the island’s economic future as an independent nation.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Australia has, since theBougainville Peace Accords, been the island’s largest external development funder: $51m of Australia’s $631m in development assistance to PNG goes to the autonomous region, the most of any single province: money is dedicated towards roads, bridges and solar electricity projects.Since a 2019 referendum on independence returned a 97.7% yes vote, the Australian government has sought to maintain a resolute neutrality on Bougainville’s independence – although its position has not always been seen as impartial on the island.In 2022, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said “our role is to support the prime minister, and the government of Papua New Guinea, in the decisions that it makes in respect of the future of Bougainville”, a statement seen as siding with the PNG government, which is resistant to secession.Bougainville’s president, Ishmael Toroama, accused Marles of “veiled threats” and said Australia had made only “piecemeal contributions” to Bougainville’s development through “boomerang aid”.“My people do not take kindly to threats and we will never kowtow to neo-colonists that seek to usurp the sovereignty of Pacific island nations with their bullying tactics and intimidation.”Conroy said this month the question of Bougainville’s political independence was “a matter for the people of Bougainville, and Papua New Guinea more broadly, to decide”.This project was supported by a grant from the Melbourne Press Club’s Michael Gordon FellowshipsExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyChinaBougainvillePapua New GuineaPacific islandsAsia PacificLabor partynewsShareReuse this content"

Victims may be told their identities are being used to commit financial crimes. In some cases, scammers say Australian authorities are planning to arrest and deport them for beaching their visa conditions.These scams have worried law enforcement for several years but the National Anti-Scam Centre has warned they are becoming more threatening. The centre is managed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“We have been seeing more cases of these scams mentioning 24-hour surveillance,” an anti-scam centre spokesperson said. “Since March, there have been 16 cases, with eight reported in May alone.“Don’t be pressured by a threatening caller asking you to prove you have not been involved in a crime.‘Blessings’ scam: con artists allegedly swindle elderly Melbourne victims by claiming to rid them of evil spiritsRead more“Hang up and don’t respond. Don’t engage with the caller and do not follow their instructions. If you do, they may escalate their intimidation tactics and attempt to get your money.”Almost 680 Chinese authority scams were reported to the anti-scam centre in the first five months of 2025. During this period, $5.1m was lost to the scammers, who had a 5.5% success rate. The average loss for those implicated was $138,018.The victims, according to the Australian government, are predominantly aged between 18 and 24. This cohort – including 21 students – lost $3.3m to the Chinese authority scams. Ten older students were among the 37 people scammed.The ACCC has previously warned of Chinese students being targeted with “virtual kidnapping” scams. Inone case, an 18-year-old student was conned by scammers claiming to be Chinese police, who insisted she hide in her apartment and stage her kidnapping.The woman sent a series of photos and videos of herself “kidnapped” to her family via the Chinese social media app WeChat. The messages were followed up by others purporting to be from Chinese authorities and telling the relatives to transfer money to secure her release.“Never leave your camera on because someone has instructed you to,” an ACCC spokesperson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They then falsely claim money is needed to prove their targets’ innocence.The scams are being closely monitored by state police forces, including inVictoria, where officers allege they are part of a “worldwide extortion” strategy.“They target the Mandarin-speaking community, particularly students of Chinese background,”a police spokesperson said. “The scammers lie to victims about who they are and blackmail them to extort their money.”The National Anti-Scam Centre has urged people not to provide money or personal information to anyone if there is any doubt as to their credentials.They have warned scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent people from carefully assessing their options.Explore more on these topicsScamsAustralian universitiesChinaAustralian educationPersonal financeVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

There is an expectation that government will adopt all recommendations of these reviews.”He pointed to the government’s health technology assessment review, which included 50 recommendations for reform alone, many with significant implementation costs. Other major reviews included the Medicare review, the private hospitals financial health check and the review of the national disability insurance scheme.Similar incoming ministerial briefs are prepared by department and agency bosses across the public service after an election.The Albanese government appointed Comley to lead the health department in 2023. Tony Abbottsacked him as the climate change department bossa decade earlier.A highly respected policy mind, he has also worked as a consultant and led the New South Wales premier’s department. Comley was regarded as a possible candidate to head Anthony Albanese’s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, following the departure of Glyn Davis after the 3 May election. That job went to the former Treasury boss Steven Kennedy.In his advice to Butler, Comley said delivering on findings of more government reviews might have to be drawn from spending on Labor’s election commitments, including Medicare reform, cheaper medicine prices, addressing workforce challenges and improvement in mental health care and Indigenous health.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Comley said the department was delivering fiscal discipline and cost minimisation, and was preparing for a 6% to 10% decrease in internal resourcing from the government from 1 July, with further decreases expected in 2026-27.Significant productivity growth is being achieved through efficient service delivery, according to the advice, including in the treatment of cancers. But fewer gains have been achieved in improving the quality of life for patients.“The work of the first term gives a strong foundation of robust information, a strong mandate for reform, and the time has come to deliver on priority commitments,” Comley said.“There will be reviews that make sense where there is a compelling case due to one or more of the three motivations, but the bar should be set high.”The department’s incoming government brief was handed to Butler on 13 May.

As a result of the planet’s warming, extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, floods and heatwaves, have become more frequent and intense, scientists warn.Last year was the hottest in recorded history so far and led to worldwide disasters, costing more than $300bn (£219bn).

Today, heat-related deaths in Europe stand at 44,000.But the yearly death toll from cold and heat in Europe may rise from 407,000 people today to 450,000 in 2100, even if world leaders meet their global heating target of 1.5C, the study found.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisEurope weatherExtreme heatGreeceSpainPortugalEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A park, a beach, a school – these are places to play, learn, and breathe. Not for smoking,” health and family minister Catherine Vautrin said.This is another step “towards a tobacco-free generation”, she added, which France is targeting from 2032.View image in fullscreenA man smokes next to a French flag in Lyon.Photograph: Laurent Cipriani/APYves Martinet, president of the National Committee AgainstSmoking(CNCT), said the ban was “a step in the right direction, but remains insufficient”, criticising the continued permission to smoke on cafe terraces.“The minister points to the protection of children,” but children “also go to the terraces”, said Martinet, who is a pulmonologist.He lamented the absence of e-cigarettes from the text, saying flavours are used to “hook young people”.But Frank Delvau, president of the Union of Hotel Trades and Industries (UMIH) for the Paris region, said a ban on smoking on cafe terraces “would only shift the problem because people on terraces would go smoke next to these establishments”.Franck Trouet, of the hospitality association Hotels and Restaurants of France (GHR), said “smokers and non-smokers can coexist” on terraces, the “last places of conviviality and freedom”.In France, passive exposure to tobacco smoke causes 3,000 to 5,000 deaths per year, according to official figures.Smoking is steadily declining in France with “the lowest prevalence ever recorded since 2000”, according to France addiction agency the OFDT.Less than a quarter of adults aged 18 to 75 reported smoking daily in 2023, according to the agency. Smoking causes 75,000 deaths per year in France and, again according to the OFDT, costs society 156bn euros annually, counting factors including lost lives, quality of life, productivity, prevention, law enforcement and healthcare.According to a recent opinion survey, 62% of French people favour a smoking ban in public places.Explore more on these topicsFranceSmokingHealth policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is dictating the policy toward us.”But Iravani said Tehran is “ready for the negotiation, but after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation, and there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president”.The Iranian UN envoy also denied that there are any threats from his government to the safety of Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or against the agency’s inspectors, who are accused by some Iranian officials of helping Israel justify its attacks. IAEA inspectors are currently in Iran but do not have access to Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pressed by the CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan on whether he would condemn calls for the arrest and execution of the IAEA head, which Marco Rubio, the US secretary of statesaida newspaper close to Iran’s leader had made, Iravani said that he would.“There is no any threat,” Irvani said, but acknowledged that Iran’s parliament had suspended cooperation with IAEA. The inspectors, he said, “are in Iran, they are in safe conditions, but the activity has been suspended. They cannot have access to our site … our assessment is that they have not done their jobs.”Iravani also responded to questions on why Tehran has not accepted proposals for a diplomatic solution. Referring to Trump’s “unconditional surrender” demand, Irvani said that the US “is dictating the policy towards us. If they are ready for negotiation, they will find us ready for that. But if they want to dictate us, it is impossible for any negotiation with them.”Iravani said on Saturday that Iran could transfer its stocks of enriched uranium to another country in the event of an agreement with the United States on Tehran’s nuclear program,according to news site Al-Monitor.The transfer of 20% and 60% enriched uranium would not be a red line for Tehran, Iravani said, adding that the material could alternatively remain in Iran under IAEA supervision.But as he said again on Sunday, Iravani stressed that Iran would not renounce its right to domestic uranium production, a condition the US rejects.Irvani’s comments comes as western nations, including the US, are pushing for Iran to resume negotiations over its nuclear program a week after the US launched strikes on three facilities, setting off days of heated dispute over whether the facilities has been “totally obliterated”, asDonald Trumpinitially claimed, or if they had delayed but not destroyed the program.Grossitold CBSthat there is “agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage” but went on to say that Iran will likely will be able to begin to produce enriched uranium within months.“The capacities they have are there,” he said. “They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.”On Sunday, President Trump again dismissed reports that Iran had moved 400kg (880lb) on 60% enriched uranium ahead of the strikes on Fordow, regarded as the center of Iran’s enrichment program.“It’s very hard to do, dangerous to do, it’s very heavy, plus we didn’t give them much notice because they didn’t know they we were coming,” Trump told the Fox News host Maria Bartiromo.Trump speculated that vehicles seen near the entrances to Fordow before the strikes were likely masons brought in to seal up the facility. “There are thousands of tons of rock in that room right now,” Trump said. “They whole place was just destroyed.”However,the Washington Post reportedon Sunday that the US obtained intercepted Iranian communications in which senior Iran officials remarked that damage from the attack was not as destructive and extensive as they anticipated.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, scoffed at the Iranian claims in a comment to the Post in which she did not dispute that such communications had been intercepted.“The notion that unnamed Iranian officials know what happened under hundreds of feet of rubble is nonsense,” Leavitt said.Separately on Sunday, Abdolrahim Mousavi, Iran’s armed forces chief of staff,reportedlytold the Saudi defense minister during a call that Tehran is not convincedIsraelwill honour the ceasefire that ended their 12-day war announced by Trump.“Since we are completely doubtful about the enemy honoring its commitments, including the ceasefire, we are prepared to give it a tough response in case of recurrence of an act of aggression”, Mousavi said, according to Turkey’s state-run news agency Anadolu.Israel and the US, “have shown that they do not adhere to any international rules and norms” the Iranian general added. “We did not initiate war, but we responded with all our power to the aggressor.”Explore more on these topicsIranTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

First of all, to rescue the hostages,” Netanyahu said. “Of course, we will also have to solve the Gaza issue, to defeat Hamas, but I estimate that we will achieve both goals.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many analysts say only direct pressure from Trump or Netanyahu will bring about a new ceasefire as neither Israel nor Hamas currently look likely to make the necessary concessions.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelDonald TrumpHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He insisted the attacks destroyed key enriched uranium stockpiles, despite Iranian assertions that the material had been relocated before the strikes.Trump dismissed the leaked intelligence assessment in question – which suggested the strikes only temporarily disrupted Iran’s nuclear development – as incomplete and biased. The report, circulated among US lawmakers and intelligence officials, concluded that thedamage inflictedwas significantly less than what Trump’s administration had publicly claimed.The president has attacked both Democratic lawmakers and members of the media for sharing portions of the classified analysis. He then threatened legal consequences for those responsible.During the interview, Bartiromo referenced a post Trump had shared on social media days earlier, in whichhe wrote: “The Democrats are the ones who leaked the information on the PERFECT FLIGHT to the Nuclear Sites in Iran. They should be prosecuted!”Trump then reiterated on-air that “they should be prosecuted”.“Who specifically?” Bartiromo asked.Trump replied: “You can find out – if they wanted, they could find out easily.”In recent days, Trump has targeted CNN and The New York Times for their reporting on the strikes. He has condemned the coverage as “unpatriotic” and even floated the possibility of legal action.The two outlets, along with several others, reported that preliminary findings from the US’s Defense Intelligence Agency indicated the strikes had only limited success. The bombings delayed Iran’s nuclear ambitions byseveral monthsbut stopped short of destroying the program outright, according to the assessment.On Sunday,a social media accountbelonging to the Iranian leader, AyatollahAli Khamenei, accused Trump of needing to “exaggerate to cover up the truth and keep it secret” after the recent US military strikes “could not do anything”.Trump, in contrast, has repeatedly insisted that three nuclear facilities were “obliterated”.He elaborated on how his administration might pursue the sources of the leak.“You go up and tell the reporter, ‘national security – who gave it?’” Trump said. “You have to do that. And I suspect we’ll be doing things like that.”In the US, the constitution generally protects journalists from being compelled to reveal their sources – but there are limits to that reporter’s privilege, as it is colloquially known.The president had threatened to sue CNN and the New York Times for publishing articles about the preliminary intelligence report ahead of his comments to Bartiromo.In a letter tothe Times, a lawyer for Trump said the article had damaged the president’s reputation and demanded that the outlet “retract and apologize for” the piece, which the letter described as “false,” “defamatory” and “unpatriotic”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

This isn’t just about warm words. This is about making sure we get policy right,” she said.Starmer is facing a challenging 48 hours as No 10 battles to persuadeLabourMPs to back the welfare bill now that the government has promised that current claimants of personal independence payment (Pip) will not be subject to proposed cuts. It also pledged that the health element of universal credit will rise at least in line with inflation.The Department for Work and Pensions will on Monday publish the terms of reference for a review of personal independence payment (Pip) to be undertaken by a minister, Stephen Timms, which the government says will be “co-produced” with disabled people.It will set out £300m of employment support to be brought forward over the next three years, and publish draft regulations on the “right to try” – allowing disabled people to try work without risking their financial support.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said: “This is about delivering a fairer, more compassionate system as part of our plan for change which supports people to thrive, whatever their circumstances.”However, critics of the welfare cuts will be looking carefully at the timetable for the Timms review, as many want to see it published before the reduction in Pip due in November this year. Alternatively, they want to see the cuts delayed until after the review of the system is published.Dozens of Labour MPs appear yet to be convinced, with estimates that 50 to 60 would like to see further changes, although one of the leading original critics, Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, said she was now likely to back the legislation. Meg Hillier, the Treasury committee chair, has also switched to say she will back the bill, but many others are waiting to see further details.In her first interview since quitting, Foxcroft said it was “good to hear that people won’t be losing their benefits who are currently on them” but said there were “areas where I still think there’s need for movement”.The MP said one of the biggest issues was the need for co-production with disabled people and disability groups, and that should have happened “absolutely from the start”.“This is the problem. And this is why a lot of people have said, ‘Can we delay this? Can we pause this until we ensure that we properly get it right?’ Right now, we’re kind of tinkering in terms of things to make it the least worst situation we can, and we need to learn lessons from that and make sure that we get these things right going forward,” she said.The former shadow minister for disabled people said she would also like to see the Pathways to Work review by Timms published before the implementation of the bill that would bring in cuts. The 12-week consultation period began on 7 April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Deposits are topped up by the government, up to a maximum £1,000 a year.However, the Treasury committee said that the dual-purpose design of the Lisa may be steering people away from more suitable savings products.Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the Treasury committee, said: “The committee is firmly behind the objectives of the lifetime Isa, which are to help those who need it on to the property ladder and to help people save for retirement from an early age. The question is whether the lifetime Isa is the best way to spend billions of pounds over several years to achieve those goals.“We know that the government is looking at Isa reform imminently, which means this is the perfect time to assess if this is the best way to help the people who need it.”Cash Lisas could suit those saving for a first home but may not achieve the best outcome for those using them as a retirement savings product, as they are unable to invest in higher-risk but potentially higher-return products such as bonds and equities, the report said.Raising another issue, the committee said that any savings held in a Lisa can affect eligibility for universal credit or housing benefit under the current system, even though this does not apply to other personal or workplace pension schemes.The committee said if this was not changed, the accounts should “include warnings that the lifetime Isa is an inferior product for anyone who might one day be in receipt of universal credit”.Another issue raised by the committee is the 25% charge for withdrawing funds because of unforeseen circumstances.The committee noted that in 2023-24, almost twice as many people made an unauthorised withdrawal from the products (99,650), incurring the withdrawal penalty, as used them to buy a home (56,900). This should be considered a possible indication that the product is not working as intended, the MPs warned.Savers can put up to £4,000 into a Lisa each year, until they reach 50, and must make their first payment before the age of 40. They can withdraw money without a charge if they are buying their first home, are aged 60 or over, or are terminally ill with less than 12 months to live.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts spending on bonuses paid to account holders will cost the Treasury about £3bn over the five years to 2029-30.The committee questioned whether this product was the best use of public money given the strain on the public finances. It also raised concerns that the product may not be well targeted towards those in need of financial support and could be subsidising the cost of a first home for wealthier people.There are restrictions on when Lisas can be used to buy a first home, including that the property must cost £450,000 or less.The consumer champion Martin Lewishas long campaignedfor a revamp of the scheme, including a reduction in the withdrawal charge to 20% and upping the £450,000 house price cap. He welcomed the findings, saying: “If a Lisa is used to buy a property above the threshold, there should be no fine, they should get back at least what they put in.”Explore more on these topicsIsasSavingsConsumer affairsInvestmentsInvestment IsasnewsShareReuse this content"

The scheme is part of the 10-year plan for the NHS that is due to be published by Wes Streeting this week.The government acknowledged the concern surrounding standards of patient care after “a spate of scandals including in mental health and maternity services”.Last week a national investigation into NHS maternity and neonatal serviceswas announced by Streeting. It said the aim was to provide “truth and accountability” and it would look into issues over the past 15 years. It will report back in December.A “signal system” will be launched across NHS trusts from November, using near real-time data to scrutinise higher than average rates of stillbirth, neonatal death and brain injury as part of the focus on maternity care.Streeting said: “While most treatments in the NHS are safe, even a single lapse that puts a patient at risk is one too many. Behind every safety breach is a person – a life altered, a family devastated, sometimes by heartbreaking loss.“Patient safety and power are at the heart of our 10-year health plan. By embracing AI and introducing world-first early warning systems, we’ll spot dangerous signs sooner and launch rapid inspections before harm occurs.“This technology will save lives: catching unsafe care before it becomes a tragedy. It’s a vital part of our commitment to move the NHS from analogue to digital, delivering better, safer care for everyone.”In February, Nottingham university hospitals NHS trust (NUH)was fined £1.6mafter admitting it failed to provide safe care and treatment to three babies who died within months of one another.The Ockenden review,published in 2022, investigated 1,862 maternity cases at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust and found that hundreds of babies died or were seriously disabled because of its mistakes.The new system is the latest deployment of AI in the NHS, as Labour tries to improve productivity in the health service as it provides extra funding.The technology is already being used to detect cancers. In January, Keir Starmer also recalled in a speech how a stroke patient had been diagnosed quicker because of AI.It is hoped the technology can reduce waiting times, one of the government’s focuses since winning last year’s election. The government has also pledged to improve IT systems and move the NHS from “analogue to digital”.There have also been indications that anonymised health data couldbe used to train AI, as Starmer said there wasa “huge opportunity”to improve healthcare.Prof Meghana Pandit, a co-national medical director of NHS secondary care, said: “The NHS in England will be the first country in the world to trial an AI-enabled warning system to flag patient safety issues which will rapidly analyse routine hospital data and reports submitted by healthcare staff from community settings.“The move will turbo-charge the speed and efficiency with which we identify patient safety concerns and enable us to respond rapidly to improve patient care.”However, Prof Nicola Ranger, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said that the use of AI to maintain patient safety should not come instead of increased staffing.Ranger said: “Technology will always have a role to play, but having the right number of staff on the frontline of care is the place to start the investment to make patients safe.”The government has also announced a partnership with supermarkets to help cut calorie consumption.It could mean that stores are rearranged or products are reformulated to promote healthier options. The government said if everyone who is overweight in the UK cut their calorie intake by 200 calories a day, obesity could be halved. In practice this would mean 340,000 children and 2 million adults would no longer be obese.The UK has the third-highest rate of adult obesity in Europe. The Department of Health and Social Care said it costs the NHS £11.4bn a year.Streeting said: “Through our new healthy food standard, we will make the healthy choice the easy choice, because prevention is better than cure.”However, the Conservatives said it was a “nanny state” approach from ministers.Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told Sky News: “They had 14 years in opposition to think about what they wanted to do about the NHS, they’ve had a year in government, and the number one thing in it seems to be hide the crisps.”She added: “Telling people what to buy, I think, is not up to government. I believe in personal responsibility.”Explore more on these topicsNHSArtificial intelligence (AI)Mental healthChildbirthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

This government has a clear plan for change to get tens of thousands more children school ready each year so that every child, from any background, gets the opportunities they need to get on in life.”Phillipson first announced the plan just before theLabour party conference last year, saying 300 sites would be open within 12 months.The government said the 200 sites getting ready to open were exceeding the number of places they thought they could offer, with 4,000 projected.Phillipson said the schools were chosen in places currently underserved by the market. There will be an average of 20 places for each site and up to 6,000 new places when the programme is complete.The government believes that30 funded hours of childcarea week will save parents up to £7,500 on average, while £450 a year will be saved through freebreakfast clubs in schools.Last month, the government announced almost £370m of further funding to support the future of the programme. Some of the sites involve the conversion of empty classrooms into early years settings.Wayne Wathen-Howell, the headteacher of Minet infant and nursery school in Hayes, said: “We’re proud to be opening a new nursery right here in our school – it’s a big moment for our community.“Parents have told us how important it is to have affordable, high-quality childcare close to home, and this new nursery will make a real difference. Not only will it help families balance work and family life, it also gives our youngest children the best possible start in a familiar, supportive environment.”Explore more on these topicsEarly years educationChildcareChildrenSchoolsBridget PhillipsonnewsShareReuse this content"

Itsannual disability price tag reportestimates that the extra cost facing disabled people currently stands at £1,095 per month, up from last year’s price tag of £1,010.Based on the Family Resources Survey and forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the report estimates this monthly cost will climb to £1,224 by the financial year 2029-30. It means disabled people will be facing an effective annual surcharge of almost £15,000 by the end of the decade to live at the same standard as non-disabled people.The figures factor in the extra cost disabled people face, including higher electricity bills to power medical equipment or extra heating bills associated with health conditions affected by the cold.Scope points out that benefits cover less than half of these extra costs. With benefits the monthly shortfall is currently £630 and is set to rise to £704 in five years, the report estimates.James Taylor, the executive director of strategy at Scope, said the figures showed that government concessions on Pip must go further. He said: “Life costs an enormous amount more when you’re disabled. Our latest analysis finds the price tag of disability is now £1,095 a month. A figure only set to increase in the coming years unless action is taken.“The concessions put forward by government will just create a two-tier system, where huge numbers of disabled people face the disability price tag with little or no support from Pip. The government must change course on these catastrophic cuts now, and properly co-produce with disabled people on how to reform our welfare system.”The government’s original package, first presented in March, included restrictions on eligibility for Pip payments, as well as cutting the health-related element of universal credit (UC). While all of the universal credit and personal independence payment bill applies to England and Wales, only the UC changes apply to Scotland. The bill includes equivalent provisions to legislate forNorthern Ireland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a Sunday eveningpost, the president urged Republicans concerned about adding to the debt not to “go too crazy”, and reminded them that elected officials who cross him tend not to stay in office long. “REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected”, the president wrote.Wavering Republicans probably understood Trump’s comment loud and clear, coming just hours after one of their number, Thom Tillis, a North Carolina senator, voted against advancing the bill on Saturday and was subjected to a torrent of threats and attacks from the president. Tillisannounced on Sundaythat he would not stand for re-election in the 2026 midterms.Even before the CBO’s estimate, Republicans were at odds over the contours of the legislation, with some resisting the cost-saving proposals toreduce spending on Medicaidand food aid programs, even as other Republicans say those proposals don’t go far enough. Republicans are slashing the programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8tn in Trump tax breaks put in place during his first term.The push-pull was on vivid display on Saturday night as a routine procedural vote to take up the legislation in the Senatewas held open for hoursas Vice-President JD Vance and Republican leaders met with several holdouts. The bill ultimately advanced in a 51-49 vote, but the path ahead is fraught, with voting on amendments still to come.Senate Republicans scrambling to pass tax-and-spend bill by Trump deadlineRead moreStill, many Republicans are disputing the CBO estimates and the reliability of the office’s work. To hoist the bill to passage, they are using a different budget baseline that assumes the Trump tax cuts expiring in December have already been extended, essentially making them cost-free in the budget.The CBO on Saturday released a separate analysis of the GOP’s preferred approach that found the Senate bill would reduce deficits by about $500bn.Democrats and economists decry the GOP’s approach as “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks.In addition, Democrats note that under the traditional scoring system, the Republican bill would violate the Senate’s Byrd Rule that forbids the legislation from increasing deficits after 10 years.In a Sunday letter to Jeff Merkley, an Oregon senator and the top Democrat on the Senate budget committee, CBO director Phillip Swagel said the office estimates that the finance committee’s portion of the bill, also known as Title VII, “increases the deficits in years after 2034” under traditional scoring.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He also wrote that Tillis is making a “BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!”Senate Republicans scrambling to pass tax-and-spend bill by Trump deadlineRead moreIn a subsequent post on Truth Social, Trump threatened Tillis by saying he would meet with potential candidates to challenge him in a Republican primary in the battleground state.“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run” against Tillis,Trump wrote Saturday night. “I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America.”Before Tillis announced his decision Sunday to retire from the Senate, Trump continued to attack him on social media, writing: “Tillis is a talker and complainer, NOT A DOER! He’s even worse than Rand ‘Fauci’ Paul!”Tillis was one of two SenateRepublicans, along with Rand Paul of Kentucky, to vote against the bill championed by the president. Dr Anthony Fauci was the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during Trump’s first presidency, and once a key adviser on the Covid-19 pandemic whose support of lockdowns and vaccines made him a hate figure for Trump’s base.Trump’s attacks came hours afterTillis said in a statementthat he “cannot support” the current form of the president’s spending bill. He pointed to expected cuts to Medicaid that he said would “result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities”.With Tillis out of the 2026 Republican Senate primary, a source “close to the Trump family”told an NBC News reporterthat the president’s daughter-in-law, North Carolina native Lara Trump, is “strongly considering jumping in the race”.The retirement of Tillis,a swing state moderate, could make it easier for Democrats to flip the seat in 2026, with some in the party hoping to encourage former governor Roy Cooper to enter the race.A similar dynamic could be at play next year in Omaha, Nebraska, where the sitting Republican congressman and frequent Trump critic Don Bacon hasreportedly decidedthat he will not run for re-election to the House.Trump has backed primary challenges against Republicans who clashed with him. Notably, he endorsed Harriet Hageman’s successful push to unseat Wyoming’s former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who served on a House congressional committee that investigated Trump supporters’ deadly US Capitol attack after he lost the 2020 presidential election.Trump’s team also recently launched a group to unseat Kentucky congressman Thomas Massie, who opposed the US’s 22 June strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. Massie also formed an alliance with the California Democratic congressman Ro Khanna to introduce a war powers resolution meant to “prohibit involvement in Iran” as well as Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”.Trump news at a glance: president’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ clears first Senate hurdleRead moreChris LaCivita, senior Trump political adviser, has confirmed that he and Tony Fabrizio, another Trump adviser, would run an anti-Massie Super political action committee (Pac).Trump’s criticism of Tillis came as the Senate voted 51-49 in favor of passing a motion to advance the budget bill. It must now clear a formal Senate vote and be returned to the lower House for approval – which Trump wants done before the July 4th holiday.The legislation is a stuffed hamper of Republican priorities – making tax breaks from Trump’s first presidency permanent, and removing taxes on tips, to be paid for in part with cutbacks to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments. The bill also includes $175bn in additional funding for immigration enforcement, to implement the president’s mass deportation project.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS SenateTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicsUS CongressNorth CarolinanewsShareReuse this content"

He also said he believes this to be the “most outrageous action” that theTrump administrationhas taken on education since it retook office in January.University of Virginia president resigns under pressure from White House over DEI programsRead moreRyanresignedfrom his position as UVA president on Friday. He was facing political pressure from Washington to step aside in order to resolve a justice department investigation into UVA’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, the New York Times reported on the same day.“I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job,” Ryan said in his resignation message to the university community. He expressed an unwillingness to risk the employment of other staff, as well as cuts to funding and financial aid for students.Ryan had a reputation for trying to make the UVA campus more diverse and encouraging students to perform community service. He had served as the university’s president since 2018.Warner criticized the administration for what he said was its overreach in education. He said federal education and justice department officials “should get their nose out of [the] University of Virginia”.“They are doing damage to our flagship university,” he remarked. “And if they can do it here, they’ll do it elsewhere.”He referred to Trump’songoing battleswith Harvard, the US’s oldest university, including the president’s signing aproclamation to restrictforeign student visas and continued threats tocut fundingover its DEI policies.“They all want to make them like Harvard,” Warner said. “End of the day, this is going to hurt our universities,chase awaythat world-class talent.“And, frankly, if we don’t have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS universitiesVirginiaHigher educationRace in educationUS educationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The day after Botafogo fell to Palmerias, Flamengo departed too, cut down byHarry Kane.That sea of red and black will be missed and their team will too: the side who beat Chelsea showed that was not by chance, as they made a game of this one, scoring twice at the Hard Rock Stadium, their fans banging drums and their coach declaring his pride at how they had played. But it wasBayern Munichwho progressed.PSG sweep Inter Miami and Messi aside to reach Club World Cup quarter-finalRead more“It is about moments and we took our moments very well,” the England captain said. “We stayed calm, and scored our goals at the right time.” He scored two of them, finally securing a victory when he scored his second with quarter of an hour left, a goal which, in his own words, “eased the last 10 minutes” of an afternoon that had been far from easy. His brace, a Leon Goretzka strike and an Erick Pulgar own goal saw it finish 4-2, setting upa meeting with Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight.ForFlamengothere was a noisy farewell and as they wound their way down the ramps at the end, songs echoed off the stands. Filipe Luís, the coach, said that they they had in the end been beaten by a “superior team”, a “real colossus” but that they had played their way. Their way was good too, good enough that they may feel that justice was not entirely done and reflect on the part they played in their own downfall, even if Luís insisted that the errors that proved decisive in the end were forced by an opponent that is “absolutely elite”. They racked up more shots than Bayern, yet also slipped 2-0 and 3-1 down in the first half and, ultimately left too much to do. When Kane added the fourth, it was done.The first of Bayern’s four came after just six minutes and two more followed before the break, aided by an apparent nervousness about their opponents when pressure was applied and a willingness to take risks playing out. Agustín Rossi had already been forced to backpedal to reach an inswinging corner, seen a clearance hit Pulgar to set up a Joshua Kimmich shot, and gratefully watched a punch away hit a black balloon rather than setting up another dangerous delivery when they conceded an own goal opener. Jumping by Goretzka, the hint of a hand in his back, Gonzalo Plata succeeded only in deflecting the ball off the top of his head and into the net.Flamengo responded fast, Plata escaping up the right where they advanced often and delivering a cross from which Giorgian de Arrascaeta’s header flew just past the post. There was an aggressiveness and determination to Flamengo that went with the noise their supporters brought and underlined that this would be a proper game. It was, too, even if Bayern were soon two up when Kane took advantage of Dayot Upamecano’s steal, turned and hit a 25-yard shot that flew in off the post, a deflection taking it away from Rossi.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane scores Bayern Munich’s second goal.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersThere had been fortune in that and Flamengo certainly would have been entitled to feel unlucky to trail by two then and even more so a moment later when Manuel Neuer made an extraordinary save from Luiz Araújo, flashing out a strong right hand that had he and Kimmich celebrating. Next Leo Pereira struck wide. And not long after that, Araújo superbly controlled somewhere up near his neck, spun and volleyed wide. When Gerson belted a shot first time screeching right through Neuer’s hands to make it 2-1 on half an hour, Flamengo had deserved it.The problem for Luis’s side were those moments Kane mentioned. Within five minutes, Bayern had scored again, although another poor clearance set it up. It came to Goretzka, lurking outside the area. He controlled on his chest, took one touch and then, despite the distance, opened up his body to disguise the direction of the shot and calmly yet firmly side-footed into the corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A hop, a pause, and without a look Jorginho sent Neuer the wrong way, side-footing his penalty into the corner. Soon Bruno Henrique escaped behind the Bayern defence, but couldn’t guide his shot on target. The Brazilians behind the goal sensed an opportunity – “the fans are a big part of it,” Kane said after – and roared their team on but then came another of those moments, another error ruthlessly exposed.Dribbling out from deep, Araújo just about escaped the first challenge but couldn’t escape the second. Konrad Laimer won the ball, Kimmich gave it to Kane and that was only going to end one way, the finish so clean, the job done his way.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupBayern MunichFlamengoHarry KanenewsShareReuse this content"

We hope people reserve judgement until he’s charged – or if he’s charged. It’s not uncommon for there to be a federal investigation.”The probe into the 28-year-old comes 14 months afterthe NBA issued a lifetime ban for Toronto’s Jontay Porter, who was linked to a prop bet investigation and eventually pleaded guilty to committing wire fraud.This past season, the Wall Street Journal reported that Terry Rozier – then of the Charlotte Hornets – was under investigation for activity related to unusual betting patterns surrounding him in a March 2023 game. Rozier, now of the Miami Heat, has not been charged with any crime, nor has he faced any sanction from the NBA.Porter’s ban came after a similar investigation into his performance and “prop bets” – wagers where bettors can choose whether a player will reach a certain statistical standard or not during a game. The Porter investigation started once the league learned about unusual gambling patterns surrounding Porter’s performance in a game in March 2024.The league determined that Porter gave a bettor information about his own health status prior to the game and said that another individual – known to be an NBA bettor – placed an $80,000 bet that Porter would not hit the numbers set for him in parlays through an online sports book. That bet would have won $1.1m.US sports leagues have also come under criticism for promoting gambling during games, while simultaneously applying heavy punishments to players found guilty of betting.Beasley signed last year with the Pistons, taking a one-year contract for $6m in the hopes of cashing in this summer as a free agent. A second person, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because no deal was announced, said Detroit was “very interested” in re-signing Beasley to a multi-year contract – which ESPN reported to be worth $42m – this summer. Those talks may be in jeopardy, given the uncertainty regarding the federal probe. Hehas $59.5m in career earnings.Beasley made a single-season, franchise-record 319 three-pointers in the regular season. He helped Detroit make the playoffs for the first time since 2019 and end an NBA-record 15-game postseason losing streak in the first round against the New York Knicks.Beasley averaged 16.3 points last season and has averaged 11.7 points over his career with Denver, Minnesota, Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee and Detroit. He scored a career-high 19.6 points a game during the 2020-21 season with the Timberwolves.The Atlanta native played at Florida State and the Nuggets drafted him No 19 overall in 2016.Explore more on these topicsNBADetroit PistonsBasketballUS sportsMilwaukee BucksnewsShareReuse this content"

Here at last was the moment many had come for, one that didn’t matter as far as the match was concerned but that felt almost bigger than all that went before, a comment perhaps on this competition and the dimension of the man everyone was watching now as ever. Lionel Messi stood outside the area, a little to the right, the ball at his feet, a wall built before him.Paris Saint-Germainhad been 4-0 up for an hour and his team were long since defeated but maybe he could depart his way, leaving something else to remember him by.He took a step back, ran forward in that familiar way and curled the free‑kick into the bodies dressed in blue. This time it wasn’t to be; this time, reality was something else, implacably imposed by the European champions. The day before, Javier Mascherano admitted his Miami side had not really expected to get the chance to play this game and when it came to it PSG proved the coach right.Not until the second half of this match, by which time they had already conceded four, were Miami really given the chance to even participate here.Paris Saint-Germain 4-0 Inter Miami: Club World Cup, last 16 – as it happenedRead moreInstead, Luis Enrique’s team took them apart, asthey have many othersthis season – two from João Neves, one from Achraf Hakimi and an own goal from Tomás Avilés before half-time meant they eased into the quarter-finals.From the kick-off, Luis Enrique’s side booted long towards the corner and straight out of play, giving the ball to their opponents for the first and pretty much the last time. It was not just that PSG were a goal up on 5min 4sec or that they had all the ball. In fact, they didn’t, by their standards: 73% felt quite low, and PSG did respond a bit in the second half. It was not that they took 19 shots, that they scored four in the end, the score never giving their opponents the illusion of hope, it was something simpler – just an overwhelming and, in truth, unsurprising superiority.Football offers a “What if?” but this result was as expected, the game essentially an expression of what it actually is. No offence, just a reality: a club with a budget 15 times the size of the other; the best team in Europe against another that’s not the best in Major League Soccer and whose appearance in this competition was engineered by Gianni Infantino; the youngest, most dynamic, well-drilled side there is against some whowerethe best once but now watched these athletes fly around in front of them. In front, behind, to the side of them: PSG’s players were everywhere. Inter’s could hardly get in the game.By the break Messi had had just 14 touches, Luis Suárez 17. But a better measure was what was happening in the middle. Sergio Busquets had completed 10 passes, Fede Redondo 12. PSG were four up by then, all scored with a clinical simplicity; if there were not more it was because there didn’t need to be.View image in fullscreenJoão Neves gives PSG the lead.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockNeves had headed in the first, dashing on to a free-kick from behind an Inter defence that didn’t see him and didn’t look for him. A second, by Fabián Ruiz on 15 minutes, was ruled out for offside but had been almost as easy. Hakimi was blocked from close range, PSG finding little resistance, before Vitinha’s volley was stopped by Oscar Ustari and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia curled wide. When on 24 minutes Inter did advance a bit, it felt as much like a releasing of the pressure as an actual attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was half an hour in and it was the first time. The game also went back to normal, Nuno Mendes having one shot cleared off the line.Yet it was only one goal and the pace slowed, only for PSG to suddenly burst into life again at the end of the half, bringing three goals in six minutes. Busquets was robbed for the first, Ruiz rolling across for Neves to side-foot into an empty net to make it 2-0. Avilés then put a cross into his own net as PSG picked Inter apart again. Then Vitinha’s pass sent Bradley Barcola dashing in on another diagonal to find Hakimi. The first shot flew off the bar but the second was finished off.At half-time, Hakimi went off with Suárez and it was easy to imagine a conversation that said something like:that’ll do now. And it would.Miami played a bit in the second half, as much as they were allowed to. There were some shots, some moves, Messi had a header saved by Gigi Donnarumma, and then his moment, something for the montage, the moments, the mobiles held up, but this was done. It had been from the start.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Paris Saint-GermainInter MiamiClub World CupUS sportsLionel MessinewsShareReuse this content"

The remarks were echoed by the team principal,Christian Horner, who conceded the title fight was now a two-horse race.McLaren’s Lando Norris and Oscar Piastriachieved a dominant one-two, but Verstappen played no part in proceedings after he was struck by the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli at turn three on the opening lap, knocking both cars out of the race.Norris holds off Piastri to win Austrian F1 GP after Verstappen crashes out earlyRead moreIt leaves Verstappen 61 points adrift of Piastri in the championship, a lead that appears all but impossible to bridge given the pace advantage theMcLarenenjoys over the rest of the field.“This is a black day,” Marko said. “The gap is almost impossible to make up. If nothing special happens, we have to assume that the championship is over.“The McLarens, incredible, this pace in this heat. A half-second advantage per lap on this track. That’s alarming. Especially in these high temperatures. That’s a fact. This was a demonstration. We’re not really sure how we’re going to catch up.”Thirteen meetings remain butRed Bulllook no closer to chasing down McLaren despite the upgrades they brought to Austria. Indeed, Horner acknowledged that the form Norris and Piastri demonstrated at the Red Bull Ring was indicative of their enormous advantage, particularly in how well the McLaren works its tyres.“It looks very much like a two‑horse race,” Horner said. “You could see how McLaren are racing each other. They’ve got a cushion to the rest. For us we just focus on one race at a time. We don’t even think about championships.“What’s truly impressive is when you look at how close Oscar is able to run behind Lando with a car fat on fuel at the beginning of the race. He’s basically making love to his exhaust pipe lap after lap and the tyres are not dying.“That is their advantage.

Earps, however, has insisted it was a “very hard decision” that had been on her mind for a long time.Hannah Hampton aims to live up to Mary Earps’ legacy as England No 1Read more“It was difficult and it was painful,” said Earps, who earned 53 caps for her country. “Some people were amazing and the girls, the way they had my back … that meant the absolute world to me. These are girls that I grew up with and have so many amazing memories with. It was sad but I think it’s the right thing.“I think that I was villainised in a way, that probably was a bit hard to see things and read things, but it’s more what my friends and family see. I’m upset for them because I’m like: ‘You didn’t choose this. You’ve got to now deal with this.’ That’s hard. But in the end I feel like it was the right decision.”Speaking to the broadcaster Fearne Cotton on her Happy Place podcast, Earps was asked if she would find it hard to watch the Lionesses this summer. “I don’t want it to be painful watching them but I won’t know until it’s there because I felt almost a bit of relief because it had been so long coming,” the 32-year-old former Manchester United player said, referring to her retirement.“The girls are, first of all, a phenomenal team. I think they’re going to do really, really well, so I’m really looking forward to seeing that.“Mentally, physically, I was just like: ‘Right, I’ve given everything here.’ Maybe other people weren’t experiencing it the way I was experiencing it. I’m quite private, I keep everything in and I try to internalise it and rationalise it. Maybe it was shocking to some people but I think [that was because] we’ve been having those conversations behind closed doors.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A catastrophic red card?In the event it was left to VAR to drag it into extra time, an equaliser for Benfica arriving in the 95th minute when a penalty was awarded after Malo Gusto was punished for the kind of unavoidable handball that would no longer be pored over in the Premier League. A goal up when the weather gods took over at the Bank of America Stadium, now Chelsea had to show their mettle. How would they respond? The answer was resounding. Benfica collapsed, going down to 10 men early in extra time, and Chelsea were through to the last eight of theClub World Cupwith three late goals from Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.‘It’s not football’: Maresca furious after Chelsea’s two-hour weather delayRead moreThe lesson is that if you win it once you can win it again. There were two games in one because of the implementation of the severe weather protocol and, barring the bit where Benfica came out with nothing to lose and capitalised on a generous refereeing decision to score, Chelsea were better in both. Enzo Maresca’s initial system had worked well. On a day when Chelseaagreed a deal to sign another winger – Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens– Maresca picked a team with room for just one wide player and saw variety that bodes well for next season. Cole Palmer, playing as an inside-left, was lively and dangerous. Marc Cucurella surged forward from wing-back. Roméo Lavia, Fernández and Moisés Caicedo were impressive in midfield.Chelsea squeezed Benfica, pressing Bruno Lage’s side, making it impossible for them to play. Maresca saw control and maturity against a Champions League side. The head coach was not wrong to say that this was one of Chelsea’s best performances in recent months.It was certainly an improvement on their efforts during the group stage in the US. Maresca experimented with the same systemagainst Flamengobut the execution was not quite right. Reece James is a brilliant right-back but is less effective as a central midfielder. Palmer on the right and Neto on the left, meanwhile, created the wrong balance in attack.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer shone at inside-left during Chelsea’s victory.Photograph: DiaEsportivo/Action Plus/ShutterstockYet there was value in exploring the idea. It is said that Maresca’s system hinges on having two conventional wingers but there is undoubted benefit to having more than one way of playing. Chelsea are looking for versatility. It explains why they pushed hard tobeat Newcastle to the signing of Brighton’s João Pedro, who can play in a range of positions in attack.Equally important is Maresca finding a way to use Lavia, Caicedo, Fernández and Palmer without having to make compromises. Chelsea are smoother when Lavia is controlling play but starting the Belgian has often meant pushing Caicedo to right-back, which is an uncomfortable fit. By shifting Palmer wide, though, Maresca can find space for his three best midfielders and keep his chief creator in the team. It does not have to mean Palmer playing as a winger. He still had freedom to drift into the pockets against Benfica and his movement acted as a decoy at times, leaving space for Cucurella to maraud from left back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hierarchy did not like losing to Flamengo but it is worth stressing that they had no issue with Maresca trying something new. Adaptability in a manager is an enviable quality. Chelsea know that it can be important to look past the final score and pay close attention to the underlying data. Positives can be found even in defeat, just as wins can paper over tactical flaws.This is still a work in progress. Yet given that a lot has been made of Chelsea’s inexperience, it is only fair to point out that they have come through a lot of tough moments this year. They held their nerve to qualify for the Champions League, fought back from a goal down to beat Real Betisin the Conference League finaland dealt with a curveball against Benfica. There is a sense within the club that the pieces are falling into place. Perhaps Maresca is on the path to turning doubters into believers.Explore more on these topicsChelseaClub World Cup 2025Club World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ella Toone stepped up, scoring twice, Lauren James returned to action and provided an assist within eight minutes, there was a cohesiveness to England’s play and the substitutes made an impact.“We know next week we have to take our game to the next level,” said Wiegman afterwards.The noise was deafening before kick-off; fans in the Midlands, and those travelling from further afield, had read loud and clear the message that this was a sendoff game.There had been some theorising over what sort of starting XI Wiegman would choose for the visit of Jamaica. Would this be the opportunity to give those on the fringes a final chance to impress, or would it be much closer to the likely starting XI for England’s Euro 2025 opener against France?It was, in reality, always going to be the latter. Given a tough group, with no easy games, this was England’s chance to warm up into competition mode.Jess Carter was given the nod over Niamh Charles at left-back, Beth Mead started ahead of Chloe Kelly and Toone beat Grace Clinton to fill the No 10 role. It would be remiss to not expect some tweaks for the game against France – James starting on the bench was down to her return from injury, for example – but they will be minimal.View image in fullscreenLauren James was pleased to be back with the Lionesses after recovering from injury.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“We’re still building her,” said Wiegman of James’s return. “ She worked so hard to be where she is right now … This is the first time she could get minutes, we hope we can keep building her and then go again into France.”Toone repaid the faith of the manager within 10 minutes, the midfielder collecting the loose ball after it was forced from the feet of Georgia Stanway and curling into a corner from the edge of the D. After opening the scoring the 25-year-old poignantly kissed her hands and pointed to the sky, a tribute to her father, who died in September.There was always going to be a big gulf between these two teams: the European champions ranked fifth in the world, and Jamaica ranked 35 places below them. Emblematic of that gap was the 20-year-old Liya Brooks, the goalkeeper being one of four members of the Jamaica squad who play for a university team in the US.England were stunned 10 minutes later, though, when Kayla McKenna swept in past Hannah Hampton from a corner, with a deflection ­off Alex Greenwood wrongfooting the keeper. However, with the video assistant referee system in use to get the Lionesses ready for tournament conditions, ­McKenna’s effort was ruled out, as Kalyssa van Zanten was in an offside position and interfering with ­Hampton’s line of sight.Their one-goal advantage still in place, England’s second was inevitable and Carter was the architect, her cross from the left finding Lucy Bronze in the middle and the 33-year-old heading in. Toone added the third, Bronze battling the ball to her before she curled it into a corner.England’s dominance continued into the second half and the fourth goal came just before the hour, when Stanway fired in after a string of shots were blocked by the visitors. Changes came soon after, with Esme Morgan, Kelly and James on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She came on in the No 10 position, something Wiegman said they had wanted to experiment with.“We know that we have some players that can play in different positions, we know that LJ has played a lot up front, on the sides, she can play there too,” she said. “That’s what I wanted to see today and see how that worked. I think it went really well.”This was the time to get any rustiness out of her system but it turned out she didn’t need long: her clipped effort to the far post was pinpoint and all Alessia Russo had to do was nod her head forward slightly to ­convert. From there on out, James was a livewire.Lauren James sparkles in cameo as Wiegman looks to answer questions over starting XI | Tom GarryRead moreCharles, Clinton and Aggie Beever-Jones were given a chance to show what they can do with 15 minutes remaining and the subs inspired the sixth. Williamson’s ball from deep was met by Charles, who sent it into the middle for Beever-Jones to turn in, and Kelly set up Mead in added time, the forward firing in shortly after she had been down with a ­worrying-looking knock to a knee.Jamaica are not of the level of the victors’ Group D opponents France or the Netherlands, or Wales for that matter, but the Lionesses did the job that was in front of them. This was a mature England, a confident England and an increasingly tournament-ready England.Explore more on these topicsFriendliesEngland women's football teamJamaica women's football teamWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

We have so much talent in England so it’s only right that we utilise it to its full potential. With the right head coach, with the right staff, with the right mindset, with the right people, you can accomplish anything.”Bundesliga clubs weigh up bids for Manchester City’s James McAteeRead moreIt is a message Thomas Tuchel will no doubt have taken note of as he joined the celebrations. With the World Cup less than 12 months away, the example set by Lee Carsley’s side in emulating the back‑to‑back triumphs under Dave Sexton in 1982 and 1984 should give England’s head coach plenty of reasons to feel optimistic about finally ending the wait for a title at senior level.The player of the tournament,Harvey Elliott, and the no‑nonsense Toulouse defender Charlie Cresswell were also part of the squad in Georgia under Carsley two years ago, while several others have shown they have the capability to make the step up sooner rather than later. They join the former Tottenham winger Danny Thomas, who played in those successful teams more than 40 years ago, as the only Englishmen to win this competition twice.In particular the outstanding Elliot Anderson – who played for the Wallsend Boys Club that produced Peter Beardsley and Michael Carrick – could provide an immediate answer to Tuchel’s issues at the base of his midfield after excelling in a deeper role than he plays for Nottingham Forest. Tino Livramento, the only squad member in Slovakia to have won a senior cap, looks ready to make one of the full‑back positions his own while the captain, James McAtee, also has the ability to make the step up if he can play more regularly at club level after opting not to join Manchester City for the Club World Cup. The 22-year-old, who is attracting interested from Eintracht Frankfurt, RB Leipzig and Stuttgart in the Bundesliga, placed his trust in Carsley instead.The softly spoken 51-year-old blooded several members of his last victorious squad at senior level during hissix months as England’s interim managerafter the departure of Gareth Southgate, including Noni Madueke, Curtis Jones and Morgan Gibbs-White. Add to that Jarrad Branthwaite, Adam Wharton, Liam Delap, Jobe Bellingham and Jamie Gittens, all of whom were unavailable for this tournament because of injury or Club World Cup commitments, and Tuchel could be sitting on a goldmine.View image in fullscreenLee Carsley talked about ‘thinking outside the box’ to lead England to victory.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersOnly a handful of Sexton’s players who defeated a Germany side containing Rudi Völler in 1982 and then Spain two years later went on tomake an impact for the seniors, with Mark Hateley – top scorer in 1984 – ending his career with the most senior caps (32). But Carsley stressed before the final the importance of trying to establish “a period of domination” at youth level and said it had taken a completely new approach to mould this group into winners. “The lazy thing as coaches would be to try and just reproduce what we did last time, but we’ve done it differently,” he said.“We thought outside the box with our training, with our tactics, with the way that we wanted to play with our squad selection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McAtee and Elliott face uncertain futures despite their exploits in Slovakia, while Rowe took a gamble by swapping Norwich for the south of France last year. He will be joined by the former Burnley defender CJ Egan‑Riley, who was brought on in the final for his first appearance of the tournament as a makeshift striker, while Jarell Quansah, called up by Tuchel in his first squad, looks certain to leave Liverpool for Bayer Leverkusen.“Ultimately I need game time and I believe in myself that I can possibly push for [a recall],” Quansah said. “The standard of England now is unbelievable. You have to be world-class to get in and around it. It will be a huge privilege if I could but it’s going to be hard.“There’s a lot of experience in the side with the seniors now to hopefully get one over the line. We are always looking to win the next tournament and it will be massive if it’s the World Cup.”Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We played at school and then next to the school there was a small astro pitch. I played there until training began at five o’clock and so it was every afternoon.”Euro 2025 is sure to showcase just how far women’s football has come | Emma HayesRead moreBühl is one of Europe’s best, a left-winger who is as two-footed as she is electric. The Bayern Munich player is in form, without any injury concerns and looking forward to the Euros. “You can see the sparkle in everyone’s eyes. We are ready,” she says.At 24, Bühl is reaching her peak years and believes her skills were honed during that formative period in Münstertal. “I learned everything I can there,” she says. “Shooting, with both my feet, dribbling because it was so small and also how to push through because I was always the youngest – and the only girl there.”At the start of the year the Germany coach, Christian Wück, spoke to Kicker about Bühl’s capabilities with both feet, which makes her incredibly difficult to defend against. “I don’t know anyone who is as two-footed as she is,” he said. “For her it makes no difference if she takes a free-kick with her left or her right. There are only a few players, in men’s or women’s football, who are capable of doing that.”View image in fullscreenKlara Bühl fires off a shot during the Nations League match against Austria.Photograph: Marvin Ibo Guengoer/Getty ImagesSo where did that come from? “My brother, who is a year and a half older than me, was left-footed and there aren’t that many left-footed players so I simply thought it was a bit cooler,” she says. “I was 10 or 12 so I thought about it and decided I would rather be left-footed. There were a few months when I went to training and just did everything with my left.”Bühl stood out at an early age, soon swapping SpVgg Untermünstertal for Freiburg, where she made her Bundesliga debut at the age of 15. She rose through the German under-age teams before being called up to the senior squad in 2019. She was mainly used as a substitute at the World Cup in France that year asGermany went out in the quarter-finals, meaning that Euro 2022 was her first major tournament as a key player.The showpiece in England, which had been delayed for a year because of the pandemic, had been going well for Bühl until, before the semi-final, disaster struck. She grimaces slightly as she describes what happened. “One evening I had a bit of a headache and then I could feel my throat as well so I went to bed early to sleep it off. Then in the middle of the night I woke up and thought ‘OK, this is not good’. The next morning I had a test and it was positive.”Germanybeat France in the last fourand were looking forward to playing England at a full Wembley in the final. Bühl, however, was in isolation. “I spent a week on my own in a hotel room hoping that I’d test negative. Your only wish is that it is finally over. You see what the other girls are experiencing and you are there on your own.”View image in fullscreenKlara Bühl celebrates scoring against Spain at Euro 2022.Photograph: John Sibley/ReutersThe negative test did not come soon enough for Bühl to play in the final, whichEngland won 2-1after Chloe Kelly’s extra-time goal. “I was just happy I could be in the stadium to take it all in. Even on the morning of the final I didn’t know whether I’d be able to be there so I just tried to use all the energy I had collected in that hotel room over a week and take it to the girls.”Does she look back and think what could have been? “I knew it was important to work through what had happened and to do that quite quickly. I also learned you should always enjoy being on the pitch because you never know what is going to happen.“The coronavirus was really something different but it could be an injury or something else. I learned to enjoy being able to play in a big tournament, so that was a lesson, and this time I hope to be able to play from start to finish.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They arrive in a confident mood having won five of their six games in 2025, scoring an impressive 26 goals along the way. Their final two warm-up matches were 4-0 and 6-0 victories against the Netherlands and Austria.“We are a bit more carefree and think less about how the goals are going to come and then they seem to come naturally,” says Bühl. “We are a bit more attack-minded now as well. Scoring a lot of goals gives you confidence that you will score.“Does that make us one of the favourites? I don’t think it is in our mentality to say that, but we have a lot of quality in the team and we have also built a good atmosphere.

In the group phase there will be games against Pernille Harder’s Denmark and the Swedish trio of Magda Eriksson, Linda Sembrant and Julia Zigiotti Olme. Then, there may be a quarter-final against England and Georgia Stanway.“Georgia is super honest, very direct,” Bühl says. “That is really the English mentality that she has got, very funny On the pitch she is very good in the one-on-one duels and is a fighter. She is a real playmaker. She always wants the ball and she distributes it all the time. That includes the dangerous balls that can cut through two lines of a defence.”Stanway is also a budding tattooist. She has inked a few teammates, including Zigiotti Olme, so would Bühl let Stanway loose on her? Bühl laughs. “I have thought about maybe having one done. I would like a smiley here [she points to her left wrist]. But there hasn’t been the right moment yet. But I would say I can picture it happening. She does it really well.”On a more serious note, does she feel England have improved or gone backwards since beating Germany three years ago? “It will be hard to top the last Euros as that was at home and there was an incredible hype around the team that took the players along with it. If you know what it can be like, and it is not like that, it can be hard to get in the same flow.“Because of that I would say that they are not quite as good as with the 2022 Euros.” She pauses, then says, with a smile: “Without wishing to tread on any toes of course.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Euro 2025Germany women's football teamWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Her final total of 15.00 was also the highest of the event for the women at Praia de Itauna.Silva’s best two-wave score totalled 9.23, well short of being able to stop Picklum winning for the third time.“She [Silva] has been surfing so well. I knew she’s such a competitor and she’s such a fighter,” said the 22-year-old from Gosford. “I was pretty scared all the way until the end even though I had a couple of good scores. But yeah, she’s capable of great things and I’m so happy to get that one over her.”The WSL Tour’s most consistent women’s surfer in 2025 – reaching the quarter-finals in eight out of nine events, including three finals – Picklum enjoys top spot with just two regular-season events remaining on the calendar.“I’ve worked so hard this year to really put my best foot forward,” she added. “I’ve dreamt so much of winning here in Rio, too. I’m a real energetic person, I love the Brazilian energy, and to get a win this year means so much for sure.“Thank you so much and shout out to everyone back at home.

The 33-year-old prop has been instrumental in the first-placed Raiders’ charge up the ladder this year and will add extra vigour to Queensland’s pack come 9 July in Sydney.Chaotic State of Origin Game 2 gives exhilarating glimpse into excess | Jack SnapeRead moreGold Coast prop Moeaki Fotuaika has been axed from a forward group who have struggled to match it with NSW in this series. The selection shock comes as the Maroons recall Brisbane star Reece Walsh as 18th man and put faith in Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow as Kalyn Ponga’s injury replacement at fullback.The biggest surprise in the Maroons side is the elevation of Broncos journeyman Shibasaki to partner Robert Toia in the centres after a season where the 27-year-old has scored 12 tries in 15 appearances to resurect his career.Tabuai-Fidow has played in the Queensland backline for the previous two games of the series and has helped the Dolphins rise into finals calculations following a poor start. His four tries in the 50-28 win over South Sydney at No 1 in round 17 sealed the deal.Walsh has been instrumental in reigniting Brisbane’s season, with the Broncos winning all three games since he returned from the knee injury that scuppered his Origin chances earlier in the series. Walsh can also slot into the halves if need be and is the ideal 18th man.Maroons back Valentine Holmes downplayed a minor leg injury that prevented him from kicking goals towards the end of St George Illawarra’s win over Parramatta. He will be named on the wing as planned.Meanwhile, NSW named an unchanged team as Laurie Daley backs Brian To’o to recover from a knee injury in time to play.Jacob Kiraz replaces Canterbury teammate Matt Burton as 18th man in the only change to the game-day squad that lost Origin II. But as it stands, Kiraz will only play in Sydney in the event of multiple game-ending head knocks or one caused by an act of foul play that results in a sin bin.Daley has retained Stefano Utoikamanu despite speculation he could replace the Melbourne prop with versatile South Sydney forward Keaon Koloamatangi for Origin III.Jarome Luai is named at five-eighth despite missing Wests Tigers’ loss to Manly on Friday night with an illness that required hospitalisation.It marks the first time NSW have named an unchanged line-up for a Game 3 decider since their infamous 2020 series loss.NSW Blues: Dylan Edwards, Brian To’o, Stephen Crichton, Latrell Mitchell, Zac Lomax, Jarome Luai, Nathan Cleary, Max King, Reece Robson, Payne Haas, Liam Martin, Angus Crichton, Isaah Yeo, Connor Watson, Spencer Leniu, Hudson Young, Stefano Utoikamanu, Jacob Kiraz (18th man), Lindsay Smith (19th man), Bradman Best (20th man)Queensland Maroons: 1 Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow, 2.

The teams were ordered off the pitch by the officials and had to stay in their respective dressing rooms before play resumed after an hour and 53 minutes.Nkunku extra-time goal sees Chelsea through to Club Word Cup last eight after four-hour matchRead moreThere was further frustration for Chelsea when a controversial last-minute penalty allowed Benfica to force extra time. The Premier League side eventuallypushed through to win 4-1, four hours and 38 minutes after kick-off, but there was concern about off-pitch events a year before the men’s World Cup is held in Canada, Mexico and the US.“For 85 minutes we were in control of the game,” Maresca said. “After the break, the game changed completely. For me it’s not football. It’s already seven, eight, nine games that they suspended. I think it’s a joke to be honest, it’s not football. It’s not for us. You cannot be inside. I struggle to understand. I can understand that for security reasons, you suspend the game. But if you suspend seven, eight games, that means that probably [this] is not the right place to do this competition.”Storms have caused six games, all held in different cities, to be suspended during the tournament. Teams have also had to deal with a heatwave covering much of the east and centre of the US.“I’m very happy,” Maresca said. “We are in the last eight of this fantastic competition. The team was very good. For me, one of the best performances in the last weeks and months.“The problem is that when the game is suspended, it’s not football. Guys, it’s not football. You suspend the game, it’s not football. It’s completely something different. They [Benfica] scored because they need to chase. We are inside, we are winning. You go outside, mentally different. It’s difficult.“We had an hour and a half, two hour stop. Then it started completely different. It’s not the same game because you break the tempo. So two hours inside; people speak with the family outside, if they were good, the security. People eating, people laughing, people talking on the mobile. It’s two hours. That’s why I said it’s not football.“It’s something that you struggle to understand. But we tried to go out, continue in the same way, knowing that it was difficult. It’s not random that for 85 minutes, we didn’t concede nothing. And then for five minutes, we conceded a few chances. Why?

Each video typically has a title and AI-generated thumbnail that links a celebrity to Diddy via a false claim, such as that the celebrity just testified at the trial, that Diddy coerced that celebrity into a sexual act or that the celeb shared a shocking revelation about Diddy. The thumbnails often depict the celebrity on the stand juxtaposed with an image of Diddy. Some depict Diddy and the celebrity in a compromising situation. The vast majority of thumbnails use made-up quotes meant to shock people, such as “F*CKED ME FOR 16 HOURS”, “DIDDY F*CKED BIEBER LIFE” and “SHE SOLD HIM TO DIDDY”.John Oliver on AI slop: ‘Some of this stuff is potentially very dangerous’Read moreSome of the channels going all-in on Diddy “slop”, a term that refers to low-quality media generated by artificial intelligence, have a history of making false claims about celebrities and of using AI-generated thumbnails. But most of the 26 channels appear to be either newly created or older channels that were repurposed. At least 20 channels were eligible to earn revenue from ads.False and sensationalized Diddy AI slop is an easy way to make money on YouTube right now, according toWanner Aarts, who runs dozens of YouTube channels with AI-generated content and sells acourseabout how to make money on the platform. He said he’s not personally cashing in on the Diddy trend.“If you would say, ‘Hey, how can I make $50,000 as soon as possible?’ Number one would be like doing fucking drug [dealing], but number two would probably be to start a Diddy channel,” said Aarts, 25.Faked celebrity involvementIndicator reviewed hundreds of thumbnails and titles with false claims about Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Justin Bieber, Oprah Winfrey, Eddie Murphy, Leonardo DiCaprio, Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson, 50 Cent, Joe Rogan and others. Strangely, one channel,Fame Fuel, posted 20 consecutive videos with AI-generated thumbnails and titles that make false claims about the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and Diddy.One of the most successful channels isPeeper, which has over 74m views since being created in 2010, but has focused only on Diddy for at least eight months. Peeper has many of the most viral Diddy videos among the top misinformers, including a video with the false title “Justin Bieber Exposes Will Smith, Diddy, and Clive Davis for Grooming Him”. It received 2.3m views. Peeper has now been demonetized.A channel calledSecret Storyswitched to Diddy content after posting health and life advice in Vietnamese.Hero Storypivoted to Diddy after initially uploading videos about Ibrahim Traoré, the military ruler of Burkina Faso. A Brazilian channel that generated millions of views from embroidery videos switched to Diddy less than two weeks ago. And a channel calledCeleb Buzzgenerated more than 1m views from 11 Diddy videos in less than three weeks. It was created in early 2018 but appears to have removed any previously uploaded videos. Secret Story and Hero Story were terminated by YouTube after inquiries from Indicator; Celeb Buzz was demonetized.Pivot to DiddyIn another example, roughly three weeks ago, the channel Pak Gov Update started uploading videos about Diddy that use AI-generated thumbnails with false quotes attributed to celebrities such as Usher and Jay-Z. One video is titled “Jay-Z Breaks His Silence on Diddy Controversy” and features a thumbnail of Jay-Z crying and holding up a CD above the quote “I WILL BE DEAD SOON”.The nearly 30-minute video, which uses clips from TV news and other sources and AI-generated narration, has 113,000 views. It does not contain any new information from Jay-Z, and the rapper never said the quote that is attributed to him.Pak Gov Update previously posted short, amateurish videos with clickbait titles about public pensions in Pakistan. Its biggest hit was a video called Big information! Senior Citizen Pension Scheme || fedaral Cabnet Big Development, which received a relatively modest 18,000 views. (Typos theirs.)Cashing in on misinformationAarts said that the Diddy slop strategy is lucrative but risky. “Most of these channels aren’t going to survive,” he said, citing the likelihood of getting demonetized due toYouTubepolicy violations, or legal action from Diddy and other celebrities featured in thumbnails and videos.As with Pak Gov Update, most of the videos uploaded by the channels use AI-generated narration over real clips from news reports and other sources. Some also use AI images and, less frequently, synthetic video. The channels’ use of real footage often appears to test the boundaries of fair use.View image in fullscreenThe YouTube channel PakReviews-f2z, whose display name is Pak Gov Update, has uploaded myriad fake videos about the Diddy trial.Photograph: YouTubeAI slop is just one type of content that you can find about the Diddy trial on YouTube. But it appears to be a growing and lucrative niche. Similar Diddy AI content is also racking up engagementon TikTok.YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in an email: “We terminated several channels shared by Indicator for violating our terms of service and policies covering spam.” Malon said the company removed 16 channels, including Fame Fuel.

Just find a topic that people want to watch videos about, brainstorm ideas and hire overseas editors to pump out content at a nearly automated pace.Thanks to AI, it’s easier than ever to pursue the dream of faceless automation. Aarts said that anyone can create a script with ChatGPT or another large language model, generate images and thumbnails with Midjourney or similar models, use Google Veo 3 for video, and finish the process with a tool like ElevenLabs to create an AI voiceover. Then hire freelancers in the Philippines or elsewhere to edit the video, he said.“AI has opened up a lot more for people with lower budgets to enter YouTube automation,” Aarts said, noting that it’s possible to pay less than $10 per video. He said he earns more than $130,000 month from more than 45 channels.Muhammad Salman Abazai, who runsAS Venturer, a Pakistani company that provides video editing and YouTube channel management services, said that Diddy videos have become a “proper niche” on YouTube. Abazai showed off a few Diddy videos that his team created and uploaded to a luxury/wealth channel they run for a client.“It was a success for us because we got a lot of boost from that, we got subscribers from this,” he said.International Diddy slopThe pivot to Diddy doesn’t just work in English. A Spanish-language channel calledNV Historialaunched in January and had seen sporadic success with completely AI-generated videos about celebrities. Its first hit was a video with atitlethat translates to “A teacher laughs at a Black girl for saying her father is Chuck Norris – until he walks into the classroom”. It received just over 140,000 views.NV Historia pumped out Chuck Norris slop until views began to taper off about a month ago. That’s when the channel uploaded its first Diddy video. Its title translates to “1 MINUTE AGO: Nobody expected Dwayne Johnson to say THIS in court about Diddy … ” The thumbnail uses AI-generated images of the Rock and Diddy in court, as well as an image of the former wrestler being forced to eat what appears to be a brain. The thumbnail features the quote “He forced me to eat it.”Johnson has not testified and is not linked to any of Diddy’s alleged illegal activities. The video has received more than 200,000 views. NV Historia posted a video falsely linking Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities to Diddy the next day, earning 45,000 views. It went all in on Diddy content after that. YouTube has since demonetized NV Historia.A French-language channel,StarBuzzFR, launched in May and appears to only upload Diddy content.

It did not go smoothly.The 22 June launch initially appeared successful enough, with a flood of videos from pro-Tesla social media influencers praising the service and sharing footage of their rides. Musk celebrated it as a triumph, and the following day, Tesla’s stock rose nearly 10%.What quickly became apparent, however, was that the same influencer videos Musk promoted also depicted the self-driving cars appearing to break traffic laws or struggle to properly function. By Tuesday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) hadopened an investigation into the serviceand requested information from Tesla on the incidents.If Tesla’s limited rollout of the robotaxi service was the culmination of more than a decade of work, as Musk touted on X, its struggles are also emblematic of technical decisions and fixations that the world’s richest person has embraced as he pursues the goal of a fully autonomous car.Musk has cast the concept of a driverless car as a core part of the company’s future business, and, as saleshave sharply fallen this year, he has vowed that its robotaxi service will rapidly and drastically expand. Yet the faltering launch this week suggests Tesla is still facing technological challenges that have attracted regulators’ notice, delayed Musk’s vision of a robotaxi on every corner, and highlighted the gulf between it and its driverless rival, Waymo.The robotaxi launch featured about 10 cars traveling in a limited area ofAustinwith safety drivers in the passenger seat. The pilot included other restrictions, such as not operating in bad weather or during certain nighttime hours. Rides, which the company offered to a host of handpicked influencers, cost $4.20, in keeping with Musk’s proclivity for cannabis memes.“Tesla self-driving can be deployed anywhere it’s approved. It does not require expensive, specialized equipment or extensive mapping of service areas,” an official Tesla account posted on X the day of the launch. “It just works.”Footage from at least 11 rides showed that the trial run did not pan out as flawlessly as Tesla’s tweet suggested. In one case, a robotaxi failed to make a left turn and instead drove into a lane meant for oncoming traffic, then corrected itself by driving across a double yellow line. Other videos appeared to show the cars exceeding the speed limit, braking for no discernible reason and dropping passengers off in the middle of an intersection.The videos drew the attention of the NHTSA, which said in a statement it was aware of the incidents and had contacted Tesla to obtain more information.Musk, meanwhile, posted throughout the technical failures and regulatory inquiry, retweeting pro-Tesla influencers who praised the service. One account Musk posted showed off a video of a robotaxi stopping to avoid running down a peacock crossing the road, and another told followers: “Don’t listen to the media.”‘Lidar is lame’Musk has long insisted that using only cameras on driverless cars is the singular way to achieve true self-driving capability. Tesla’s consumer vehicles come with what it calls “autopilot” and “full self-driving” features that allow drivers to cruise on the highway hands-free. They rely on multiple external cameras to navigate, steer and brake. The company’s robotaxis use similar software and also depend solely on cameras.The reliance on cameras alone stands in sharp contrast with other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo and Zoox. Those companies use arrays that combine cameras and sensors, including radar and lidar. For example, the newest version of a driverless Waymo uses about 40 external cameras and sensors, whereas a Tesla with one of the latest versions of full self-driving uses about eight external cameras, according to ananalysis by Bloomberg. Lidar and radar allow for self-driving cars to better detect objects in bad weather and poor lighting.Despite the advantages to lidar and radar, Musk has been adamant that Tesla remain lidar-free. “Lidar is lame,” Musk said during a Tesla autonomy day in 2019. “In cars, it’s friggin’ stupid. It’s expensive and unnecessary.”Lidar is far more expensive, costing roughly $12,000 per vehicle, as compared with cameras, which come in at around $400 per car, according to Bloomberg. Musk maintains that camera-only technology is the most “human” way to approach self-driving, since people use their eyes to navigate the road.Tesla faces lawsuits and investigations over full self-driving modeMusk’s insistence on camera-only technology has landed Tesla in hot water over fatal crashes involving drivers using the full self-driving feature. The company is now the focus of government investigations and civil lawsuits, which allege that full self-driving is impeded by weather conditions such as sun glare, fog, dust and darkness. There have been at least 736 crashes and 17 deaths involving the technology, according to ananalysis by the Washington Post.“Tesla continues to have this fetishistic view that it’s going to operate its system solely on cameras, despite every intelligent human being in this entire space saying that can’t be done,” said Brett Schreiber, an attorney who represents several alleged victims of Tesla’s autopilot failures.“Everyone who has been following collision-avoidant technology since the 90s knows that the holy trinity is radar, lidar and cameras.”Schreiber said he was not surprised to see the wobbling rollout of Tesla’s robotaxis in Austin.“What you’re also going to see, which is the true tragedy of this thing, is people continuing to be injured and killed by this technology,” he said. “And that’s where it becomes less of a ‘Oh, isn’t that cute? The vehicle can’t make a left’ to now we’re actually at someone’s funeral because of the choices Tesla makes.”Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits, government investigations and crashes involving full self-driving.Tesla’s tactics v the way of WaymoThe differences betweenWaymoand Tesla’s approaches to launching commercial self-driving services in dense cities don’t end with the debate over lidar versus cameras. Waymo is seen widely as the frontrunner in the self-driving race in the US – a race that was once crowded with dozens of automakers, VC-backed startups and ride-share companies and has since been whittled down to just a handful of major players.There are numerous reasons why Waymo has outlasted so many of its competitors and why it’s ahead of the curve. The Google subsidiary has historically spent months, if not years, mapping cities and testing its vehicles in them before launching. In San Francisco, one of the first cities where Waymo launched its fully driverless commercial service, the company began mapping out and testing its service in 2021 before launching it to the public in 2024.Even with a careful and gradual city-by-city approach, Waymo, which launched as a project under Google’s X research lab in 2009, has encountered problems with its self-driving cars. Earlier this year, Waymo had torecallmore than 1,200 of its vehicles over a software issue that was causing collisions with chains, gates and other stationary roadway barriers. The NHTSA also launched aninvestigationinto the company last year after the agency received 22 reports of Waymo vehicles acting erratically or potentially violating traffic safety laws.Contrast Waymo’s approach with Tesla’s. While Tesla is still in the testing phase of its service, its robotaxi launch in Austin is the first time the car company’s fully self-driving technology is being unleashed in the wild. The company has not released information on whether, or how long, it has spent mapping out or testing the driverless technology on Austin’s streets.The launch is reminiscent of Uber’s first foray into a self-driving ride-share service in 2016. The company launched a self-driving pilot in San Francisco without seeking a permit from the California department of motor vehicles, as was required. On the first day of the pilot,an Uber vehicle ran a red light. The company was forced to shut down the service a week laterafter the DMV revoked its registration. An Uber self-driving executive at the time hadpushed the company’s engineers to rushto launch the San Francisco pilot to attract more investor and public attention.After being sued by Waymo over its self-driving operations and struggling to catch up to its competitors, Uber sold its self-driving arm in 2020.Tesla also did not have a permit to operate its robotaxi service in Austin. Texas does not currently have a process to acquire a permit and won’t have one in place until September.While there’s at the moment less visibility into what Tesla’s rollout of its robotaxi service looked like behind the scenes, the automaker isno stranger to rushing to meet deadlinesset publicly by Musk.With the launch of robotaxis, Musk, who has been promising thatTeslas will be fully self-driving since at least 2016, is perhaps getting closer to meeting the deadline that he set and has deferred several times over the past 10 years.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskAustinWaymoSelf-driving carsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a challenge the government appears alive to, with agri-tech includedin its industrial strategyearlier this month.The company has invested £80,000 in the Agras T50 drones, made by the Chinese company DJI and designed for agricultural use.Distributing potash or phosphate by drone rather than by hand will be “two to three times faster than walking”, Amery says. This will mean it can be applied in a more targeted way, reducing the amount of fertiliser needed for the crop, which ends up in the 25m bags of salad it sells each year through the UK’s largest supermarkets.Despite the long-running discussion over whether machines will replace humans in agricultural jobs, Amery said the investment would boost morale. “It’s about staff retention, taking out an unfavourable part of the job,” he adds. “We will pay the operators more. With more pay, staff are more likely to stay.”While such drones are already in use on farms in North and South America, asdocumented in detailon social media, they remain a novelty in the UK. The Watercress Company’s drones are currently grounded, as the business awaits the permits required by the aviation watchdog, the Civil Aviation Authority.However, Amery hopes they will soon be fitted with hoppers and whizzing above the watercress beds across the grower’s 20 hectares of land, spread across 12 Hampshire and Dorset farms. The route for each field can be programmed in advance, while 20-year-old employee George Mathews has been trained up and has obtained a licence to pilot the drones.Even though The Watercress Company follows growing methods largely unchangedsince Victorian times– when the leaves first gained popularity in the UK as a source of nutrition, especially for the urban poor – it is no stranger to technology.Today’s crop is still grown in watercress beds fed by natural streams that have been in use since the 1880s, although the leaves are now cut every other day between May and October using a bespoke harvester.View image in fullscreenThe crop.Photograph: Joanna Partridge/The GuardianThe grower is also trialling multispectral cameras, which are able to capture images in various spectral bands – or ranges of wavelengths – far beyond what the human eye can see. The images can produce a “heatmap” of the fields, which are analysed by AI to assess the location of any crop problems.The Watercress Company is pursuing the kind of innovation the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) wants to see adopted by more UK farms, as food producers look to work in a more efficient and more sustainable way.However, at a time whenmany farmers are feeling the financial squeeze, the NFU believes that few will have the money, or confidence, to invest in new and potentially untested technology.This is also essential to improve productivity in the farming sector, the NFU says, warning that without it, the UK risks slipping further behind its international competitors.“Driving forward productivity to build domestic food production should be on every government’s list,” says Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU. “Among our European neighbours there is evidence that we are falling behind and are not as productive in some areas.”In the industrial strategy, agri-tech, along with precision breeding, has been included as areas of focus within the growth sector plan and the NFU believes this will help farming businesses to “become more productive, sustainable and resilient”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was able to secure £20,000 of funding, representing around a quarter of its drone investment, from the government’s shared prosperity fund, through its local council.However, Amery says the business is rarely able to access funding such as R&D tax credits, which are only available to companies which are required to pay corporation tax. Partnerships, like The Watercress Company and many others in the farming sector, as well as sole traders, do not pay corporation and are therefore ineligible.This has not put the grower off seeking out the latest gadgets to improve his crop. “Innovation is usually driven by a desire to overcome a problem,” says Amery. “I think we get one major innovation every five to 10 years, one that is a game-changer.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingDrones (non-military)AgricultureFood & drink industryRural affairsHampshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rare earth elements, the mineral backbones of wind turbines and electric vehicles, are now the prize in a geopolitical arms race. The tradeagreementbetween Washington and Beijing restores rare earth shipments from China to the US, which had been suspended in retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariffs. Behind the bluster, there has been a realisation in Washington that these are critical inputs for the US. They are needed not just by American icons such asFordand Boeing but for itsfighter jets, missile guidance systems and satellite communications.This understanding suggests that Washington will scale back some of its countermeasures once Beijing resumes delivery of rare earths. The paradox is that to reduce its dependence on China, the US must depend on Beijing a little longer. This is not yet decoupling; it’sdeferment. That, however, may not last. Mr Trump has signed an executive order to boost production of critical minerals, which encourages the faster granting of permits for mining and processing projects. He eyesUkraineand Greenland’s subterranean riches to break dependence on China.The west became so reliant on a single geopolitical rival for such materials – materials it once extracted and refined domestically before shuttering operations – due to cost and environmental concerns. China, for its part, has come to dominate global rare earth processing. It has used that market power before – notably againstJapanin 2010. It’s hard not to think that it was strategic complacency that led to the west relying so heavily on China for key minerals.This month’s Nato summit has seen the west push to reindustrialise via rearming itself. This is also reawakening long-dormant extractive ambitions in the global north.Canada, flush with critical mineral deposits, says its planned mining resurgence will be a new foundation for alliance solidarity. This month the EUcalledfor strategic reserves of rare earths “to prevent supply chain disruptions and economic blackmail from China” – highlighting their importance not just for electric vehicles but for defence and aerospace industries. “Resilience” meansdigging deeperat home and controlling extraction abroad.The same minerals we need for net zero are being justified in terms of zero-sum rivalry. It is uncomfortable that “green growth” and militarism have merged into a single policy frame, collapsing the distinction between ecological transition and arms buildup. A magnet for anelectric caris also a magnet for ahypersonic missile. And meanwhile, the human and ecological toll continues to rise – largely out of sight and out of sync with the idea of environmental sustainability.A Guardian dispatch last week fromBaotou, China’s rare earth capital, found evidence of toxic ponds,poisoned soiland demolished “cancer villages” – the hidden cost of our digital and electric age. Framing this as an inconvenient necessity risks repeating past mistakes. For mineral-rich nations, the surge in global demand brings opportunity. But as aUN reportthis year noted, without strong institutions and safeguards, it risks a familiar fate: corruption, conflict and environmental ruin.Today’s scramble for critical minerals must not see the promises of responsible sourcing give way to a familiar logic – extract first, moralise later.Explore more on these topicsChinaOpinionAsia PacificDonald TrumpXi JinpingNatoeditorialsShareReuse this content"

What feels most perilous is the steady evaporation of the boundaries of what seemed impossible only a few weeks ago. Morality, compassion, care – slashed and burned.And yet I think of Beckett, “I can’t go on. I’ll go on”, “The world is essentially over. I will fight for another day”, “I have lost my faith in humans. I commit to love them more.”Trump is angry with a world that won’t give him easy deals | Rafael BehrRead moreTo live as Jung said – with two existing opposite thoughts at the same time. Survival right now depends on our ability to swim in this duality. To not linger in the pain, but to allow ourselves to be moved by it. To not whitewash reality, but also not to take up lodging in the house of despair. This is the dance of our times.We must become agile and flexible. To feel responsible but not so guilty we are immobilized. To feel rage but to learn how to direct it into action and passion and purpose. To lift ourselves to a more existential absurdist place where the fascists cannot touch us. Not disassociation or numbness, but finding the grace, energy and humor that come when we commit ourselves more deeply to one another.Before “No Kings” Day there was a part of me that frankly was tired of marching, wondering if these demonstrations really add up to anything. But then on 14 June, with anestimated 4 million to 6 millionpeople in the streets of America, I realized something profound. Marches and demonstrations are not merely acts of resistance and refusal, but they are community events in which we meet and strengthen our resolve and bonds with our own tribe of like-minded people.They are public moments to show the rest of the world that we are the majority and we do not want and will not accept a king, or genocide in Gaza or precious immigrants being dragged off and separated from their families. They are places to let off steam and make great art and music and network and ultimately they are what we have, the expression of our collective sorrow and outrage, thereby saving our own souls.So how do we resist and rise? We have to believe the impossible is possible.I think of my sisters at the City of Joy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo who give me inspiration and direction daily. The center is literally in the middle of a war zone. When the M23 militias invaded Bukavu in February, they made a radical decision to keep the center open despite the madness outside – gunfire, bombs and sometimes dead bodies on the road. They refused to stop building the world they dreamed. Instead, they developed strategies – coming to work on scooters, changing cars to avoid being noticed, keeping their hearts tuned to the work of healing survivors. It is now June and the 27th class of City of Joy is about to graduate and a new class is on the way.I think of one of my great inspirations, the former congresswoman Cori Bush who saw that in St Louis, after the recent tornado no local or national Fema had come or were coming. The majority of people had lost their homes or had huge holes in them. So she joined with local groups to provide tarps and food, cleaning products and formula. They formed hubs of care. They went to the senior homes who had lost electricity so there was no refrigeration for food or medicine and gave them both.She told me, “It’s my community. I believe that we take care of us. I learned through the Ferguson uprising that we can’t wait on politicians or leaders. We have to dive in and get to work. We have to talk to one another and know our communities. We need to organize in our living rooms, local businesses backyards – find out who amongst us are doctors, nurses, chefs, teachers. Knowing your community and what skills they can offer.” This is what we need to understand now more than ever.It is so clear something essential is dying. The illusion and seduction of the American dream is over. Neoliberalism is dead. There are huge cracks, openings in the old structures and narratives. These are opportunities to plant the seeds for the new world as we protect those suffering now.What the fascists want more than anything is our fear, exhaustion and despair. Or they want us angry, reactive, cruel and violent like them. In Cherien Dabis’s staggeringly brilliant saga about a family in Palestine, All That’s Left of You, (one of the best films I have ever seen), a married couple comes to a moral crisis and they turn to an iman for advice. This wise and very gentle iman tells them: “Your humanity is also your resistance. Don’t underestimate its power. It’s the only thing they can’t take away from you.” Every action matters now. Every effort small or large counts. And moving – movement is the essential key to dispelling despair. How we care now, how we love, how we come together, how we build and protect each other is in itself the building of the new world.V (formerly Eve Ensler) is a playwright and activist and the founder of V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women and girlsExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionProtestDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Except it’s not, not by a long chalk. The verbally agreed Iran-Israel ceasefire could be ripped to shreds at any moment. An aggressive theocratic regime still holds power in Tehran. The same is true of Jerusalem. In Washington, a president whose stupidity is matched only by his vanity prattles about making peace, but theangry old menin charge have learned nothing. Meanwhile, hundreds of civilians lie dead, thousands are wounded and millions have been terrorised.The war is over! Except only the naive believe thatBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister and prime warmonger, is done fighting. Even if Donald Trump is right and Iran’s nuclear facilities have been “obliterated” (“severely damaged” appears more accurate), its nuclear knowhow and elusive stockpile of enriched uranium have not. At the first sign, real or imagined, of rebuilding, Netanyahu and his cronies will surely attack again. Trump called them off last week. But this is a man who can change his mind three times before he’s even had breakfast.Who seriously believes Netanyahu will readily relinquish the dominance over Iran’s airspace that his forces have established with unexpected ease? It’s unlikely he will be able to resist the temptation to target Iran again, if fresh attacks are politically advantageous. Netanyahu is now reportedlyweighing up the possibilityof a snap election. Perhaps he hopes his Iran exploits will obscure his 7 October 2023 failures and abandonment of hostages held by Hamas.There is a pattern here. Since March, when he unilaterally wrecked the Gaza ceasefire, Netanyahu has sought to subjugate the territory. Palestinian civilians have been gunned down in repeated Israeli army andsettler atrocitiesaround Gaza food centres and in towns in the West Bank. In places such as Rafah, Bloody Sunday takes place almost every day. In Lebanon and Syria, Israel has dropped bombs with impunity. Netanyahu’s military grinder never stops. Why imagine that he will be any different with Iran?Most people deplore “forever wars”, typified by dismal, multi-year western entanglements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Not Netanyahu. Peace is his enemy. Forever war keeps him in power, in the limelight and out of jail. Like Vladimir Putin, he sees continuing war as an opportunity to boost domestic support and outflank his opponents. Unending state violence is deadly for democracy, legality and good governance (and on this note, Americans should worry, too: Trump’s presidency is on a similar trajectory, except his forever war is against the “enemy within”).Despite Netanyahu’svideo appealto the Iranian public in which he encouraged them to “stand up” against an “evil and oppressive regime”, he cares little for their freedom. What he wants is what imperialist powers always want: a permanently weakened, divided, degraded country that poses no challenge to Israel’s strategic interests and can be punished at will. By controlling Iranian skiesand pursuing covert cyber-attacks, sabotage and assassinations, Israel could ensure an enfeebled Iran is held in check indefinitely – or so Netanyahu may calculate.The war is over … except it’s not in Tehran, either. Rattled by talk of regime change and Israel’s killing of prominent allies, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has emerged from his bunker to wage another war, on his own people. Hundredshave been arrestedin a security crackdown. Alleged spies have been executed. In order to survive, the mullahs may now do what they have never done before: secretly race to build a nuclear weapon, or buy one off the shelf from North Korea.In truth, Iran’s loathsome regime didn’t even come close to falling. If anything, Israel’s bombs rallied public support and patriotic sentiment. Iran was attacked on the basis of a lie (neither US intelligence nor the UNbacked Netanyahu’s claim that it was weaponising) and European governments failed to condemn the bombing. These facts will only deepen distrust of the west. Iran wants relief fromUS sanctions, and may agree to discuss this, but not its future nuclear activities. It issuspending cooperationwith International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Rejecting Israeli containment, Tehran may in time resume asymmetrical conflict and revive regional proxy wars.The war isn’t over for Trump either (though, beguiled by delusions of a Nobel peace prize, he may think it is). He has demonstrated, as in Ukraine and Gaza, that his impulsive, unthinking, uninformed interventions only make the world more dangerous. He’s made it harder for the US to walk away if war flares up again. His sneak attack onIran, reminiscent of Pearl Harbor, breached the UN charter and will help rogue states justify illegal aggression. By continuing to aid and abet Netanyahu, an alleged war criminal, Trump is opening himself up to prosecution by the international criminal court.Trump has trashed multilateral diplomacy, sidelined and insulted European allies, relied on rookie envoys and rejected expert advice. His manifest untrustworthiness and monstrous egotism are all additional reasons why the US cannot be counted on. War across the Middle East is barely on hold. Trump took a shot at instant glory – and missed.The utter futility and pointlessness of this war is breathtaking. It achieved almost nothing positive. It caused misery, destruction and insecurity. Only rarely does brute force advance peaceful ends. Typically it inflames existing problems – and that’s what happened here. When will these angry old men get it? Probably never, unless and until democrats summon the courage to defy them.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionIsraelTrump administrationBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Thinking of my toddler and what might happen if I caught coronavirus and was treated under the then Nice guidelines “frailty” score was too much. I sobbed deeply. After 10 years of austerity, I knew then that disabled people would pay an enormous price for the pandemic thanks to the government’s handling of it. Disabled people did: almost 60% of Covid-related deaths involved disabled people in that first wave.I vowed then that I would do all I could to use my skills and experiences of 20 years working in disability law and policy to deliver a country that treats disabled people with dignity and respect. Five years later, I am one of the only visibly physically disabled members of parliament. I was proudto be elected last yearas the first person to have grown up in my constituency to go on to represent it in parliament for more than a century. I am proud, too, that Labour’s manifesto committed to championing the rights of disabled people, and to the principle of working with disabled people to ensure our views and voices are at the heart of all we do.Consequently, since April, I have been engaging relentlessly with government, at the very highest level, to change its proposals as set out in the universal credit and personal independence payment bill. I made it clear from the start I could not support the proposals on personal independence payments (Pip). Pip is an in-work benefit, designed to ensure disabled people can live independently.There are 4 million disabled people in poverty in the UK. As a matter of conscience, I could not support measures that would push250,000 disabled people, including 50,000 children, into poverty. Nor could I accept proposals that used a points system, under current descriptors, that would exclude eligibility for those who cannot put on their underwear, prosthetic limbs or shoes without support.The concessions now announced are significant, including that all recipients of Pip who currently receive it will continue to do so. I know this will be an enormous relief for many of my nearly 6,000 constituents in receipt of Pip and for disabled people across the country.However, I will continue working, as I have done from the beginning, to look at these concessions carefully against the evidence on the impact upon disabled people, including my constituents, and disabled people’s organisations.Fundamentally, I will be looking for further reassurances that the detail will fulfil Labour’s manifesto commitments to disabled people. The social model of disability must be central to this – removing barriers to our inclusion in society.Proposals must take a mission-led approach across all five missions to break down barriers to opportunity for disabled people. I hope to see three things from government, embedded in the text of the amendments, if the bill reaches the report stage.First, the review being led byStephen Timms, the minister for social security and disability, must not be performative. The government must not make the same mistake twice. I strongly recommend bringing in a disabled expert on equality and employment law, such asProf Anna Lawsonat the University of Leeds, to support this work.Second, the government must consult disabled people over the summer to understand the impact of the proposed changes from November 2026 on future claimants. These must mitigate risks of discrimination for those current recipients with similar disabilities and against pushing new disabled claimants into poverty after November 2026. In doing so, it must produce an impact assessment that also reflects the impact of unmet need for future recipients on health and social care services, and clarifies the application of new criteria on those receiving Pip if they get reassessed.Third, growth must mean inclusive growth. In implementing the £1bn employment, health and skills support programme, there needs to be a clear target for closing the disability employment gap. Importantly, there needs to be a commitment to a sector-by-sector strategy on closing this gap and a skills training strategy for the employment support workers enabling disabled people into work.Disabled Labour MP says welfare U-turn would create ‘unethical two-tier system’Read moreThese approaches outperform cuts or sanctions in getting disabled people into sustainable employment.This matters. The Conservatives left us with a pitiful 29% employment gap and 17% pay gap for disabled people. The Labour government has an opportunity to bring in a new era of policymaking for disabled people that takes a laser focus in closing this gap. The disability sector believes that this can be reduced by 14%; generating £17.2bn for the exchequer. We must seize this moment to do things differently and move beyond the damaging rhetoric and disagreements of recent weeks.In line with the prime minister’s statement that reform should be implemented with Labour values of fairness, a reset requires a shift of emphasis to enabling disabled people to fulfil their potential. I will continue to engage with government and disabled people’s organisations, to fight for a country that treats disabled people with dignity and respect.Marie Tidball is Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on autism and co-chair of the disability parliamentary Labour partyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’ve seen it workSun 29 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 20.04 EDTShareIwas born in Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, whenreligionbecame the architecture of public life. But it was precisely this fusion of faith and power that forced my family to flee. We were persecuted not for breaking laws but for belonging to a minority religious community,the Bahá’ís– apersecution that continues today. This experience taught me how religion can be used to exclude, to dehumanise, to dominate. But it also taught me that ignoring religion is not the answer.More than80% of the world’s population identifies with a religion. Yet in many parts of the world – especially in the west – religion is treated as a private matter, something best kept out of polite conversation, or at worst, a source of division and danger. We live in a paradox: a deeply religious world that increasingly doesn’t know how to talk about religion.This silence isn’t neutral. It creates a kind of cultural illiteracy – especially at a time when religion continues to shape geopolitics, social movements and personal lives, from the rise of religious nationalism to faith-based responses to humanitarian crises. And in placeslike the United States, it’s becoming even more central to public discourse, often with high political stakes.So how do we talk about religion in a world that needs moral clarity but fears moral language?Religion as a shared inheritanceOne idea that has helped me reframe how we talk about religion comes from my own faith – the Bahá’í concept ofprogressive revelation. It teaches that the world’s major religions are expressions of the same spiritual reality, revealed at different times to meet the evolving needs of humanity. They are not rival ideologies but chapters in a single story. Not different truths but different reflections of one truth.The concept of ‘naseeb’ offers a way to stay grounded even when the world refuses to make sense | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreImagine if we approached religion not as a set of camps to defend or oppose but as a shared inheritance. What if we stopped asking which one is right and started asking what they’re trying to show us – about justice, humility, forgiveness, the soul and the sacredness of life?This shift – from debating difference to seeking shared meaning – isn’t just theoretical. I’ve seen it work.In refugee communities in the Middle East, I witnessed how grassrootsinterfaith effortshelped displaced people from opposing religious backgroundsbegin to heal. Inone camp in Jordan, Christian and Muslim women began cooking together during Ramadan and Easter, eventually hosting communal feasts for the wider community. These weren’t institutional programs but quiet acts of dignity and repair – rooted in faith and in the will to see the human behind the label.Finding a connectionIn my doctoral research on Syrian religious-minority refugees in Berlin, I found that secular integration policies often failed to account for the central role religion played in people’s sense of identity, belonging and healing. Integration thrived not when religion was ignored but when it was engaged – through interfaith dialogue, shared spiritual spaces or recognition of religious holidays. These approaches didn’t erase difference. They helped people move forward together.Religionbecame less of a dividing line and more of a connective thread.Even here, in my suburban neighbourhood in Aotearoa New Zealand, I see glimpses of this every week. On our street families come from Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Hindu, Bahá’í and other diverse backgrounds. Every Friday afternoon I hosta simple classfor the children of the neighbourhood. We sing, tell stories and explore themes like kindness, truthfulness and the nobility of the human spirit. It’s a space for the children to discover their spiritual identity and their capacity to contribute to the world around them. Over time this has quietly knit our community together. Parents, too, have found connection – not through sameness but through a shared desire for their children to grow into just and compassionate human beings.Stay curiousThis idea – that spiritual truth unfolds over time – has changed how I live. It’s shaped how I raise my children, how I relate to neighbours of different beliefs and how I engage in public life. It helps me stay curious instead of defensive and to approach others not through fixed categories but with an openness to what we might learn from one another.And that’s the heart of it, really: moral imagination – the ability to see not just what is but what could be. It invites us to ask new kinds of questions:What does it mean to live a meaningful life?How do we hold both reverence and reason in the same hand?What truths do our traditions carry that the world still needs?What happens when we stop talking about religion and start listening with it?These are not easy questions. But they matter. While secular frameworks offer many tools, they often fall short of naming the deepest yearnings of the human spirit. And while religion has been misused, it can also be reclaimed – as a source of clarity, compassion and shared purpose.The ancient Chinese text of the Zhuangzi teaches us to reject entrenched values – and treasure the diversity of humanity | Karyn LaiRead moreRecognising the wisdom in religion doesn’t mean denying the harm it’s caused. It means telling the full story – separating faith from fanaticism and choosing not silence but better language: language rooted in humility, inquiry and hope.We don’t need less religion in public life. We need better ways of talking about it – ways that allow both believers and non-believers to engage meaningfully, with honesty and depth.Maybe it starts with a simple shift. What if the world’s religions are not competing claims but reflections of one unfolding truth? What if, beneath all our differences, there’s just one story being told in many tongues?If we believed that, we might stop asking who is right –and start asking what’s possible. And maybe then, we’d finally begin to build the world we all long to live in.Dr Kat Eghdamian is a human rights expert, writer and adviser on religion, ethics and social justice.

Like a well-loved family black-and-white album, the memories of my experiences during an assignment inBougainvillein 1996 are dog-eared, worn and have lost clarity.After nearly 30 years the timeline has merged with the jumble of other assignments I undertook in the region (the Sandline crisis and an excursion to West Papua to meet the resistance movement over the border). It feels like a monochrome film with the edits all mixed up.When I visited Bougainville for the first time, the conflict had already been raging for eight years, flaring up and settling down, breaking into factions, cruelty and atrocities, only to flare up again. After Francis Ona, the leader of the Bougainville Republican Army, unilaterally declared independence in May 1990, thePapua New Guineagovernment imposed a blockade on the island which was enforced using Australian-supplied Iroquois helicopters and Pacific-class patrol boats.‘It’s not Chinese assistance’: Australia accuses China of taking undue credit for aid projects in the PacificRead moreWe came across graffiti in abandoned classrooms that showed helicopters firing down on people in the jungle. It was a dirty war with numerous reports of abuses against the Indigenous population and combatants. As one survivor of the crisis told me, “The towns became too dangerous – we just took to the bush and hid.” The blockade meant that everything was in short supply.Q&AWhat caused the Bougainville civil war?ShowBougainville, a group of islands off Papua New Guinea to the north of Australia, has been variously controlled by Britain, Germany, Japan, Australia and PNG.It declared independence in 1975 as the Republic of North Solomons, but was absorbed into the newly independent PNG weeks later.Its close ethnic ties and proximity to the Solomons archipelago means it has always sat uneasily with Port Moresby’s rule.That discontent came to a violent head in 1988 after a long-running dispute over the lucrative Panguna copper and gold mine.The mine, carved from a mountain in central Bougainville, was critically important to PNG, at one point generating more than 45% of the country's national export revenue.Multinational Rio Tinto and other international investors earned nearly US$2bn from the mine over 17 years of operation. But less than 1% of the mine’s profits went to Bougainvilleans, whose homes and lands had been destroyed by it.Under the leadership of a former mine worker, Francis Ona, disaffected Bougainvilleans ran a sabotage campaign which forced the mine’s closure in 1989.The PNG Government responded by sending in police, then soldiers, to restore law and order. Bougainville was blockaded and the island descended into a brutal civil war that ran for a decade, and saw as many as 20,000 people die.PNG later hired international mercenaries to end the conflict (the notorious Sandline affair), before a peace agreement was signed in 2001.In a 2019 referendum, 97.7% of Bougainvilleans voted in favour of independence. Many argue that reopening Panguna mine will be key to the island’s economic future as an independent nation.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The soldiers I met during that first trip had kept me safe and escorted journalist Lindsay Murdoch and me into the jungle. I had a sense that it was a dangerous assignment, but I had no idea just how dangerous until meeting one of the fighters again. More of that later.The jungle on Bougainville is fast growing and almost cartoonishly dense and green. It had just about reclaimed the entire town of Arawa on the eastern coast of the island. Arawa was a ghost town during the crisis as all the inhabitants had fled to the safety of the hills. It was an old Bougainville Copper Limited company town and now marked the front line with the PNG defence forces occupying what little was left. The prefabricated houses, burnt-out hospital and solar hot water heaters on roofs were all Australian made. It gave the town a strangely familiar feel, like you could have been in a north Queensland coastal town.3:37Bougainvillians went to war to shut down the Panguna mine. Why do some want it reopened? – videoWe had to negotiate with the PNG defence forces to cross into BRA-controlled territory. The road south of town was no man’s land and was marked at the outskirts by a heavily sandbagged roadblock and nervous-looking PNG defence force privates. A few miles outside Kieta we pulled over and waited. After some time a rebel patrol materialised out of the thick jungle to escort us.Rommy Joel was a young BRA platoon leader when I first met him. He looked like a rebel from central casting, sporting dreadlock hair beads and holding a captured M16 assault rifle. He also had the kindest eyes – from the outset, I never felt threatened by him.He led us deep into the hills via a circuitous route where we felt we were travelling in circles, which for security purposes we probably were.I distinctly remember the heat and humidity. The thick jungle and constant danger made it feel close and claustrophobic. I was cautioned about what I could take photographs of: nothing that would give away their position, no communications devices, and some of the fighters were off limits. Luckily Rommy was not on the banned list so I concentrated on him. He was such a great subject.View image in fullscreenBougainville Republican Army platoon commander Rommy Joel in no man’s land on the coast road between Kieta and Arawa in Central Bougainville on 25 April 1997.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianWe jumped on to the back of an old ex-mine ute to travel further. Rommy sat in the back as we sped along the coastal road. He escorted us almost all the way back to the PNG lines at Arawa. With a casual wave he disappeared into the jungle, and that was the last I saw of him.Bougainville fought a war to shut down Panguna mine. Now it wants to reopen itRead moreThat is until he drove up from his home in South Bougainville to see us in mid-May 2025. I recognised him straight away – he may have aged, but he had the same kind eyes. When I showed him the old photograph of him in the ute he was annoyed because, as he put it, “no more Rasta hair”. “I’m old,” he added. So am I, Rommy, so am I.He told me he and his men remembered me because “you were the whitest man we had ever seen”. He also said that none of his men would accompany him to collect us all those years ago because they thought it was too dangerous, or as he put it, “the war was very strong at the time”.Even after 30 years it was a sobering fact to learn. My impression at the time was that these were tough boys, hardened by the jungle and the war. If they had thought it too dangerous, it obviously was a lot more risky than I had known at the time. Probably just as well I didn’t know.View image in fullscreenRommy Joel with his granddaughter Lolo in Arawa in May 2025.Photograph: Mike Bowers/The GuardianThe most poignant moment of our reunion for me, however, was when Rommy introduced us to his young granddaughter Lolo.Rommy was trained as a boilermaker by the mining company before the crisis – he had given up a life of relative comfort and fought in a nasty civil war. He had fought for an independent homeland and future generations, defending his fellow islanders. Here he was all those years later, older and as full of strength and pride as I remembered, and with him, the latest member of his family. This was brought into sharp focus later that day when we attended the reburial of some of his fellow fighters who were exhumed from a mass grave in the north of the island. Time had not dimmed the emotions; the shadow of that conflict was a long one.His fellow BRA Bougainvillians have lost friends and family and years in the jungle. They deserve their independence – I hope for Rommy and Lolo that they get it. I will be forever grateful that he kept me alive all those years ago.Mike Bowers is a photographer and host of Talking Pictures on ABC’s Insiders.

On 20 June, two activists spray-painted two RAF Voyager aircraft at Brize Norton, where flights regularly leave for RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. No person inside the compound was harmed.At worst, these actions may amount to offences around criminal damage and trespass. The former justice secretary Lord Falconer has stated that the action at Brize Norton would not justify outlawing the group.But that is exactly what is happening. The home secretary’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action and to lay an order so swiftly in parliament on Monday will be viewed as a dangerous acceleration to authoritarianism. This means the full weight of the British anti-terrorism state apparatus, including its coercive elements, will be deployed against Palestine Action’s leaders and potentially thousands of young British supporters, with devastating consequences for their futures.The actions used by Palestine Action are not new. They follow a tradition of protest that has been instrumental to civil rights movements throughout history. Indeed, these actions have shaped modern Britain and enriched democratic participation globally.As a veteran anti-racist civil rights campaigner, for nearly five decades, I continue to support scores of families seeking justice. These have included the families of Blair Peach, Stephen Lawrence, Zahid Mubarek and Victoria Climbié, who were not only traumatised by the way their loved ones were killed but faced a litany of institutional failures.During every campaign, we faced politicians who ignored or played down our lived experiences blighted by violent and state racism. They also chose to ignore the more subdued and normalised forms of protest that we organised. We were compelled to find creative ways to get the urgency of their message across.We shouldn’t forget the real purpose of the action at Brize Norton – it was to draw attention to Britishmilitary collaborationwith the Israeli government, including itsspy flights over Gaza. This is during a war that has led to an unprecedented level of mass killings of Palestinian civilians, near-complete destruction of Gaza’s infrastructure, including hospitals, and adeliberate policy of starvation, all leading to official accusations of genocide and action on crimes against humanity. British complicity in Israel’s war is a matter of public interest that is too often either ignored or under-reported.Palestine Action is a network of activists that organises peaceful direct-action tactics to expose and target property and premises connected to Israel’s actions in Palestine. Since its inception, more than five years ago, it has primarily disrupted the operations of Elbit Systems. Elbit is Israel’s largest arms company. The group claims that its campaign has successfully secured theclosure of several Elbit factories.What Palestine Action understands – and this is borne out by my own experience – is that to bring about change in Britain there is an almost inexhaustible need to press the issue and raise attention.In the Stephen Lawrence case, the family campaigners had to devise extraordinary steps that included an unprecedented private criminal prosecution coupled with protests before the state acknowledged and the public realised the significance of failures in this case. Even then it did not guarantee justice for the family. The actions deployed were peaceful but all of us – the parents, their barrister and I – suffered the indignity of being spied upon by undercover officers who were tasked to sabotage the campaign I coordinated. The deployment of undercover officers in protest groups is now the subject of theundercover policing inquiry.The home secretary will be aware that protest actions have been organised for decades targeting military bases and aircraft. For instance, from 1981 to 2000, activists disrupted RAF Greenham Common – locking on to the gates, breaking into the grounds and climbing on top of missile silos.In 2003, five protesters known as the the Fairford Five were arrested and charged for disrupting military operations at RAF Fairford. One of the defendants, Josh Richards, wasrepresented by Keir Starmer. Starmer argued that while the actions broke the law, they were justified as the protesters were trying to stop the planes from committing war crimes. Richards was acquitted because the jury failed to reach a verdict.The smear campaign against Palestine Action has already begun. It is accused of beingfunded by Iranor the mouthpiece of Hamas. These accusations are meant to malign a group that is made of ordinary citizens – teachers, nurses, students and workers. I have met many of them.The drastic move to outlaw Palestine Action would set a dangerous precedent where all civil disobedience actions could be classified as terrorism. Its real crime is being fearless and audacious in exposing the British government’s complicity with the Israeli government at a time when it is being pursued by the international court of justice for genocide, and its leaders have had arrest warrants issued against them for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Above all, the move by the home secretary reflects the diminishing of a mature democracy. As a society, we cherish solidarity actions that make a real difference to defenceless people. Will parliament stand up to the home secretary and reject her proposal?

They’re just channelling the ghosts of governments pastSun 29 Jun 2025 08.40 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 14.04 EDTShareThis summer’s “rebuild, rebuild, rebuild” campaign by the government feels less like a policy programme than a seance. Promising renewal, Keir Starmer instead channels the ghosts of governments past. As Karl Marx put it, people make history but not in circumstances of their own choosing; they do so haunted by dead ideas, dressing the future in secondhand costume. Labour wears what was fashionable in 1997 and 2010: Gordon Brown’s technocratic reverence for central bank independence andGeorge Osborne’sdevotion to fiscal rectitude.But we are no longer living in the world those policies were designed for.The global order that sustained Britain’s post-1979 model is cracking. International tradepeaked in 2008. The promise of seamless globalisation – of frictionless finance and footloose production – has faded. Donald Trump’s rise marked the terminal contradiction of neoliberalism: the moment its hegemon turned against it. As the US embraces a form ofeconomic nationalism, Britain – which is dependent on capital inflows, asset bubbles and open markets – faces a historic reckoning. It needs a new economic settlement. It needs imagination. But Starmer and his chancellor Rachel Reeves remain stuck in a paradigm whose time has passed.Take Reeves’s fiscal stance. Despite promises of transformation,departmental budgetswill grow more slowly than under the last parliament. This isn’t mere prudence; it’s the codification of a false scarcity – engineered not by inflation or investor panic, but by a Treasury framework that treats self-imposed constraints as natural laws.The most telling example? The silent havoc wrought by quantitative tightening (QT). While other G7 central bankstread cautiously, the Bank of England has embarked on the most aggressive QT programme in the developed world. To understand what’s going on, you have to go back to the 2010s. When the economy crashed, the Bank of England created money out of thin air to buy government debt. This was called quantitative easing (QE) – and the idea was to pump money into the financial system to keep the City running. It worked but it also meant the Bank ended up owning a huge pile of government bonds.Now, the Bank is doing the reverse: QT. That means the Bank is selling those bonds or letting them mature without replacing them. The goal is to shrink its balance sheet to “undo” QE. The problem? It’s reversing course in a more dramatic way than any other major central bank.Why does that matter? Because when those bonds were first bought, they were expensive. Now they’re being sold for less – so the Bank is making a loss. The trouble is that the Treasury (ie the state) has promised to cover those losses. On top of that, because QE created a lot of bank reserves (money that commercial banks hold at the Bank of England), the Bank is now paying billions in interest to those same commercial banks – at today’s much higher rates.As Starmer unveils his 10-year plan, here’s my advice: don’t fall into the Joe Biden trap | Sam AlvisRead moreThis means QT sees the Treasury handing over public money to cover bond losses and top up the profits of commercial banks. It’s a quiet and alarming transfer of wealth to the financial sector. The cost to the Treasury? About£40bn per year– money that could have paid for social care reform or scrapping the two-child benefit cap.These aren’t marginal technicalities. They are central political choices. And Reeves has chosen to uphold the orthodoxy – locking in monetary contraction while binding herself to fiscal rules that treat these giveaways to the financial sector as sacrosanct, but deny cash to local councils and legal aid. The result: a paradoxical state that both invests and cuts – that spends on nuclear reactors and tram lines but won’t supply the cash required to run them in the future.This is not rebuilding. It is auto-cannibalism. Worse still, the justification isn’t even compelling. Asked by former financier and Liberal Democrat MPChris Coghlanwhy the Bank doesn’t just abandon QT, its governor, Andrew Bailey, replied that it keeps markets “efficient”. Efficient for whom? Certainly not for the disabled person reliant on benefits, the underfunded headteacher or the hospital trust closing down services. The British state is not broke; it is being deliberately starved, not by financial markets, but by its own managers.A rerouting of QT cash would go a long way to restoring the state’s capacity to genuinely improve services, undoing some of the pandemic setbacks and austerity-era neglect. It would mark a first step toward coherent fiscal policy and honest political economics. Nigel Farage masquerades as the voters’ friend byhijacking this policy– but that shouldn’t deter Labour from doing what’s right.Instead of intervening, Reeves prefers the script of necessary sacrifice, in which there is no money for transforming the public realm but seemingly unlimited room for interest transfers to the banking sector.The deeper irony is that this deference to the Bank – and the belief that QT is untouchable – is a New Labour inheritance. The original sin was granting the Bank of England operational independence in 1997. Brownsacrificed policy controlover interest rates to reassure the City that New Labour’s monetary policy would be governed by unaccountable experts rather than political whims.But before New Labour turned central bank independence into holy writ, Tory chancellorKen Clarke,hardly a socialist firebrand, regularly overruled the Bank of England on interest rates. Monetary discretion wasn’t always heresy; it was governance.Yet this insulation was always a fiction. The Treasury still indemnifies Bank losses. The government could pause QT, rework reserve interest payments or end the indemnity altogether.Other countries do.With a commanding Commons majority, ministers can easily force such a change. The Bank of England may be operationally independent, but ministers can take control of it in“extreme economic circumstances”. If£150bn of Treasury spendingto needlessly cover central bank losses doesn’t qualify, what does?But in Starmer’s Britain, policy remains trapped in the costume drama of the late 1990s – where credibility meant sounding like the bond market, and success meant keeping one’s hands off the steering wheel. And so we drift.Labourcannot fund the transformation it promises, because it refuses to rewrite the rules that make transformation impossible.This is austerity by amnesia. A government elected to change Britain instead parrots the scripts of decline. It is reported that Reeves is looking totax banks. That’s not a bad idea but it avoids the far larger prize: reforming the policies that funnel billions into their coffers in the first place. And in so doing, she repeats the fatalism ofPhilip Snowden, Labour’s first chancellor, who insisted in the 1930s that there was no alternative to cuts. That path led to economic stagnation and Labour’s near-destruction. It may do so again.Randeep Ramesh is chief leader writer for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionEconomic policyBank of EnglandRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

My generation has been stranded in a rapidly changing and, since Covid, badly mishandled education systemSun 29 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 05.09 EDTShareReading about the role of artificial intelligence in higher education, the landscape looks bleak. Students arecheating en massein our assessments or open-book, online exams using AI tools, all the whilemaking ourselves stupider. The next generation of graduates, apparently, are going to complete their degrees without ever having so much as approached a critical thought.Given that my course is examined entirely through closed-book exams, and I worry about the vast amounts of water and energy needed topower AI datacentres, I generally avoid using ChatGPT. But in my experience, students see it as a broadly acceptable tool in the learning process.Although debates about AI tend to focus on “cheating”, it is increasingly being used to assist with research, or to help structure essays.There are valid concerns about the abuse and overuse oflarge language models(LLMs) in education. But if you want to understand why so many students are turning to AI, you need to understand what brought us to this point – and the educational context against which this is playing out.In March 2020, I was about to turn 15. When the news broke that schools would be closing as part of the Covid lockdown, I remember cheers erupting in the corridors. As I celebrated what we all thought was just two weeks off school, I could not have envisioned the disruption that would mar the next three years of my education.That year, GCSEs and A-levels were cancelled and replaced with teacher-assessed grades, which notoriously privileged those at alreadywell-performing private schools. After further school closures, and a prolonged period of dithering, the then-education secretary, Gavin Williamson,cancelled them againin 2021. My A-level cohort in 2023 was the first to return to “normal” examinations – in England, at least – which resulted in a punitive crackdown on grade inflation that left many withfar lower gradesthan expected.At the same time, universities across the country were also grappling with how to assess students who were no longer physically on campus. The solution: open-book, online assessments for papers that were not already examined by coursework. When the students of the lockdown years graduated, the university system did not immediately return to its pre-Covid arrangements. Five years on,70% of universitiesstill use some form of online assessment.This is not because, as some will have you believe, university has become too easy. These changes are a response to the fact that the large majority of current home students did not have the typical experience of national exams. Given the extensive periods of time we spent away from school during our GCSE and A-level years, there were inevitably parts of the curriculum that we were never able to cover. But beyond missed content, the government’s repeated backtracking and U-turning on the format of our exams from 2020 onwards bred uncertainty that continued to shape how we were assessed – even as we progressed on to higher education.In my first year of university, half of my exams were online. This year, they all returned to handwritten, closed-book assessments. In both cases, I did not get confirmation about the format of my exams until well into the academic year. And, in one instance, third-year students sitting the exact same paper as me were examined online and in a longer timeframe, to recognise that they had not sat a handwritten exam at any point during their degree.And so whenChatGPTwas released in 2022, it landed in a university system in transition, characterised by yet more uncertainty. University exams had already become inconsistent and widely variable, between universities and within faculties themselves – only serving to increase the allure of AI for students who felt on the back foot, and make it harder to detect and monitor its use.There’s no simple solution to universities’ AI worries  | LettersRead moreEven if it were not for our botched exams, being a student is more expensive than ever: 68% of students have part-time jobs, thehighest rate in a decade. The student loan system, too, leaves those from the poorest backgrounds with the largest amounts of debt. I am already part of the first year to have to pay back our loans over 40, rather than 30, years. And that is before tuition fees rise again.Students have less time than ever to actually be students. AI is a time-saving tool; if students don’t have the time or resources to fully engage with their studies, it is because something has gone badly wrong with the university system itself.The use of AI is mushrooming because it’s convenient and fast, yes, but also because of the uncertainty that prevails around post-Covid exams, as well as the increasing financial precarity of students.Universitiesneed to pick an exam format and stick to it. If this involves coursework or open-book exams, there needs to be clarity about what “proportionate” usage of AI looks like. For better or for worse, AI is here to stay. Not because students are lazy, but because what it means to be a student is changing just as rapidly as technology.Elsie McDowell is a student.

You are sunburnt. The heat is still brutal. You are exhausted. The state of the toilets is unspeakable, and you crave a certain straightforward reliability. And, despite his attempts to reboot the Chic brand with a new album a few years back and a handful of fresh production gigs,Nile Rodgersseems largely content to see out his days in the business of straightforward reliability, simply touring the world playing his old songs. In fairness, if you’d written the catalogue of material he has, you might be inclined to ensure people don’t forget about it.The initial shock you may have felt at seeing a reconstituted version of the greatest disco band of all playing Glastonbury’s West Holts stage in 2013 has long disappeared – Chic have become a ubiquitous live presence in Britain in the ensuing years – but the meat of their set remains preserved in aspic, more or less the same as it was 12 years ago. That said, anyone who quibbles with the quality of said meat – Everybody Dance, I’m Coming Out, Upside Down, He’s the Greatest Dancer – is the kind of person who shouldn’t be allowed to express any opinions about music whatsoever: this is unequivocally some of the greatest pop ever made.There’s an argument that it’s too good to be rattled out at such speed, crammed into medleys and interspersed with faintly corny interludes in which Rodgers encourages his vocalists to hit ever higher notes and discusses “maximum funkosity” – stuff that’s all a bit at odds with Chic’s original ultra-sophisticated image, the self-styled Black Roxy Music – and his triple-tested patter about his career (“You may not know that I also produced records for other people including Diana Ross, Madonna and David Bowie”: you’re joking, why have you never mentioned this before etc etc). It also might be nice if they didn’t cut out the breakdown from Sister Sledge’s Thinking of You – arguably the most exquisite 30 seconds of music in Chic’s entire oeuvre – in favour of a section where the audience is encouraged to clap along. But given the sheer frequency with which Rodgers and Chic perform live, becoming a little cavalier with your material is probably inevitable, even when your material is as good as this.View image in fullscreenDelighting the Glastonbury crowd … Nile Rodgers and Chic.Photograph: Shane Anthony Sinclair/Getty ImagesBesides, you can’t argue with the efficacy of what they do, or indeed the sheer profusion of hits, so many that you barely notice that they don’t play Lost in Music or My Forbidden Lover: this is a set in which Daft Punk’s Lose Yourself to Dance counts as a deep cut on the grounds that it was only the second single from Random Access Memories and shifted a mere 1.3m copies as opposed to Get Lucky, which sold 8m in America alone. The huge crowd go nuts, and understandably so: in the face of such widespread delight, it seems a bit off to nitpick. It’s the second time Chic have been played the slot immediately after the Sunday afternoon legend. Their appearance in 2017 was simply a matter of extending the elated atmosphere created by former Bee Gee Barry Gibb; following Rod Stewart feels more like a salvage operation. Straightforward and reliable, Nile Rodgers and Chic are clearly up to either task.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalNile RodgersFestivalsMusic festivalsDiscoPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the blazing heat, the crowd is packed to the highest point of the hill to catch Stewart roll through his hits – and perhaps elaborate on his comments to The Times earlier this weekend, that Britain should give Nigel Farage a chance. (Given reasoning: Stewart’s met his brother, and quite likes him!)Now 80 years old, Stewart is nonetheless instantly recognisable as Himself with his thatch of bottle-blond hair, deep tan and lounge-lizard styling. The fit today is a black brocade jacket with exaggerated lapels and gold threading, and flared jeans with naughty stars on his buttocks. The message is that Stewart’s still got it, and his diehard fans – readily identifiable and peppered within the vast crowd – are primed to lap it up.Perhaps naively, not being an active member of the Hot Rod community myself, I’m struck by their enthusiasm: I see several people wearing wigs in loving homage (again, despite the heat) and I’m told that some especially passionate fans have been queuing at the front barricades since the Libertines’ set earlier this afternoon.Stewart had earlier bemoaned the slot being known informally as the “tea-time slot”, saying it “sounds like pipe and slippers”. But his opening number, Tonight I’m Yours (Don’t Hurt Me), doesn’t grab the crowd in the same way as one of his hits – maybe he wants to ease into it.View image in fullscreenLulu performs with Rod Stewart on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty Images“Music brings us together, we need music, we’re having a party!” declares Stewart, before launching into Having a Party – again, hardly one of the hits. But he’s in good voice, especially given he cancelled gigs earlier this month. It helps that he’s never had a clear or stereotypically youthful voice to begin with; the years show, mostly, in his struggle to sustain long notes. But though a physical performer, writhing and launching around like one of the leggier Muppets, he entrusts responsibility for providing an on-stage spectacle to his bevvy of lovely ladies wearing short sequinned dresses, also supporting him with backing vocals, frequently fiddle and the occasional Riverdance action.Of course this broad-base, Benny Hill sex appeal is also what Stewart is known for, and what the Hot Rods love him for perhaps as much as his hits. Some Guys Have All the Luck is the first singalong – and also an opportune point for Stewart to observe that Some Wars Have All the Media Attention. “There’s been a lot about the Middle East, and rightly so,” he says. “But I wanted to draw your attention to Ukraine.” He then dedicates to those stricken peoples his cover of the O’Jays’ Love Train, which lyrically seeks to spread peace the world over.The First Cut Is the Deepest is the first to get the crowd swaying, but when Stewart tries to get a mood going with Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright) – always a bit seedy, with the invitation to “loosen up that pretty French gown” – it skews more queasy than sexy, despite the candles projected onscreen and steadily honking sax. Not today, Rod honey, it’s nearly 30 degrees out!Not to be dissuaded, Stewart switches to nostalgia with Forever Young, with Technicolour visuals of Polaroids reminding the crowd of the good old days. The show benefits from the energetic lift; Stewart even gets a little jog going across the stage before bringing down the pace, once again, for You Wear It Well and more fiddle.View image in fullscreenMick Hucknall joins Stewart on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty ImagesMaggie May naturally invites a singalong, but the crowd isn’t ready when Stewart invites them to start him off. The song rollicks along without either Rod or the crowd quite on top of the lyrics, but neither seem too fussed. Young Turks, with its Boys of Summer-style 80s panache, returns both parties to more stable footing; its propulsive energy and soaring chorus makes you wish that there were more like it in Stewart’s catalogue.It’s a Heartache, featuring more roaming fiddle, is a mid-tempo crowdpleaser; Stewart’s cover of I’d Rather Go Blind is less so, but he’s given a pass when he dedicates it to the late Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. Da Ya Think I’m Sexy? was perhaps never not going to be confronting, no matter where it appeared in the set; once swaggering, even leering, in this context Stewart sounds genuinely inquiring, though perhaps not prepared for an honest answer. “1978, those were the days!” exhales Stewart before disappearing for a costume change, leaving “the girls” to entertain us with Lady Marmalade.When Stewart returns, it’s with Michael Eavis, whom he embraces on stage and wishes happy birthday. I Don’t Want to Talk About It is another big singalong, and the best match so far for the crowd’s mood and energy. But then we descend, once again, into crooner territory with Stewart welcoming “Micky Boy” from Simply Red for If You Don’t Know Me By Now. Hucknall is just the first of Stewart’s long-trailed guests, the next being Ronnie Wood for Stay With Me. To see these old rockers united at the mic is a highlight of the set; Wood is still as slick as ever and the crowd, starting to flag in the high dry heat, responds to the energetic lift. Lulu joins Stewart for Hot Legs, which strikes the best note as the most straightforwardly silly of his “sexy” songs. Lulu isn’t afraid to draw attention to her own legs, which might very well be hot in white tassel trousers, but the staging keeps the focus on Stewart with photos of him in his prime, in short-shorts flaunting his pins (as the tabloids might have it). It’s an endearing twist, and supportive of Stewart’s icon status without pretending that he’s still a bare-chested sex symbol or rock god. The gentle strains of harp mark Sailing, and, naturally, the end of the set. Perhaps it’s the heat, but the singalong isn’t as lusty as you might expect – but nor has Stewart lost the crowd, which remains densely packed, just glad to be near him and then free.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalRod StewartFestivalsMusic festivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC needs to explain how these scenes came to be broadcast.”Wes Streeting earlierdescribed the chantingas “appalling” and said the BBC and Glastonbury had questions to answer, but he also had strong words for Israel.Responding to a statement from the Israeli embassy condemning the performance, the health secretary said: “Firstly, I do think that if I take the equivalent of the war in Ukraine, I’m unequivocal about which side of that war I’m on. I want Ukraine to win. Would I be celebrating or chanting for the death of Russian soldiers? No, I want to see an end to the war, and I want to see an end to the conflict.“I’d also say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and the settlers in the West Bank. So, you know, I think there’s a serious point there by the Israeli embassy I take seriously. I wish they’d take the violence of their own citizens towards Palestinians more seriously.”View image in fullscreenNadine Shah read an open letter from Artists for Palestine UK in support of the activist group Palestine Action during her set.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianDuring the festival, artists from the full cross-section of the music scene showed their support for the Palestinian cause.CMATandthe Libertinesshouted “Free Palestine” during their sets – as did Gary Lineker at the end of his talk – whileJoy Crookes, TV on the Radio, Sorry and Paloma Faith all had Palestinian flags or keffiyeh scarves on stage.During her set early Sunday afternoon, the musicianNadine Shah performedin front of a backdrop showing the destruction in Gaza. She told the crowd, many of whom were waving Palestinian flags: “I just don’t like seeing people being killed.”Shah read an open letter from Artists for Palestine UK in support of theactivist group Palestine Action, whom the home secretary, Yvette Cooper,has planned to proscribeas a terror organisation, if a Commons vote goes her way next week.It read: “Palestine Action is intervening to stop a genocide. It is acting to save life. We deplore the government’s decision to proscribe it. Labelling non-violent direct action as terrorism is an abuse of language and an attack on democracy.“The real threat to the life of the nation comes not from Palestine Action, but from the home secretary’s efforts to ban it. We call on the government to withdraw its proscription of Palestine action and to stop arming Israel.”Shah added: “And if I read this out after 4 July, I can potentially be prosecuted for that.”The Israeli embassy said of the Bob Vylan performance that it was “deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric expressed on stage at the Glastonbury festival”.A statement on X said: “Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy. But when speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out – especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms.“Chants such as ‘Death to the IDF’ and ‘From the river to the sea’ are slogans that advocate for the dismantling of the state of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination. When such messages are delivered before tens of thousands of festivalgoers and met with applause, it raises serious concerns about the normalisation of extremist language and the glorification of violence.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025BBCSomersetEnglandGlastonbury festivalMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

But there was plenty more to beguile, from Pink Pantheress to Busta Rhymes to Brandi CarlileAlexis PetridisSun 29 Jun 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 19.39 EDTShareOn Wednesday morning, as Glastonbury opened its gates, the Guardian canvassed the opinions of early arrivals as to which act they were most looking forward to seeing. Several suggested singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi, who wasn’t listed on the festival’s bill at all. His appearance – a re-entry into public lifeafter two years away, dealing with poor mental healthand Tourette syndrome – was meant to be a secret, but everyone already seemed to know when and where he was playing.Such is the peculiar conceit of the Glastonbury “secret set”: ostensibly a closely guarded surprise, but this year seemingly a matter of public record, only moderately less discussed than the controversial appearance of Belfast rap trio Kneecap, whose set even the prime ministerapparently had an opinion. So it was thatLorde’s “secret” set in the Woodsies tenton Friday morning was so oversubscribed that the entire area around it had to be closed off. In fairness, she did her best to thin them out a bit by playing her new album, Virgin, released that morning, in its entirety.It’s a great album– a sharp, intriguingly fraught update of the dancefloor-focused pop style she previously deployed on 2017’s Melodrama – but throwing in only a couple of the hits after nearly 40 minutes of unfamiliar material comes under the heading of A Big Ask at a festival.View image in fullscreenLorde.Photograph: Kieran Frost/RedfernsLater that afternoon,Capaldi’s appearancedrew a headliner-sized crowd to the Pyramid stage (“I don’t know who’s been fucking telling people,” he frowned) for a set that was brief, but that couldn’t help being emotionally charged: a chance, as he put it, “to finish what I couldn’t finish last time”. He last played Glastonbury in 2023: it was supposed to be a return to live performance after a string of cancelled shows, but instead his voice gave out, and he subsequently retreated from view. Whatever has happened to him in the intervening two years seems to have had an effect: there were no signs of the dramatic physical tics that beset him during the promotion of his second album, Broken By a Desire to Be Heaven Sent; his voice was restored to its full roaring power. Clearly, there has been no dramatic musical rethink during his time away – a new song, Survive, is clearly inspired by recent events in his life and is slow-paced, soaring chorused business as usual – but then, why would he? Whatever other advances have taken place in pop during his enforced sabbatical, the success of Alex Warren, Benson Boone et al proves there’s still a substantial space for earnest, melancholy young men with acoustic guitars. He ended, inevitably, withSomeone You Loved. The crowd, who had been singing along throughout his set, started singing along with a gusto that suggested they were previously just warming up. Capaldi’s eyes brimmed: it would require a very hard heart indeed not to be moved yourself.View image in fullscreenTriumphant return … Lewis Capaldi.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockAway from the secret sets, the sheer variety of music on offer can still knock even a seasoned Glastonbury-goer back a bit. This is an event at which the same stage can play host, in pretty short order, to teen-pop heroineGracie Abramsand roots reggae legend Winston Rodney, better known as Burning Spear. He’s now 80 years old, yet still exudes an enviable degree of cool as he reels off his greatest hits in the furnace-like heat. A short walk leads to TikTok-boosted bedroom pop auteur Pink Pantheress – where you get noticeably less chanting down Babylon – but a plethora of short, snappy songs that sound noticeably meatier live, boosted as they are by a band that includes an unexpectedly jazzy trumpet player. From there to singer-songwriter CMAT, whose sound splits the difference between country-rock and mid-70s Fleetwood Mac, and whose Pyramid stage appearance was one of the weekend’s unalloyed triumphs. It was one of those Glastonbury sets that captured an artist at a tipping point in their career, with the distinct sense that they may be on the verge of becoming absolutely huge. It was a sense compounded by the fact that she is clearly an absolutely fantastic pop star: smart, funny, gobbily outspoken, blessed with a potent octave leaping voice and a surfeit of hook-ladensongs. She’s also a spectacularly engaging performer, successfully encouraging the audience to engage in synchronised dance moves duringI Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!, announcing herself as possessed of “middle child syndrome” and “an amazing arse”, ending her set by motioning for the crowd to part, charging into its centre, and delivering the final chorus of Stay For Something in the middle of the audience.View image in fullscreenSmart, funny, outspoken … CMAT.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockThe surprise hit of Friday night turned out to be rapper Busta Rhymes, whose appearance twentysomething years after his commercial peak drew a huge crowd to the Other stage: clearly word had got out about how ridiculously entertaining he and his hypeman, Spliff Star, are live, up to and including unexpectedly dropping Queen’s We Are the Champions and the Pussycat Dolls’ Don’t Cha (“for all the freaky ladies”) mid-set. Meanwhile,the 1975 had clearly gone all-outto turn their Friday night Pyramid stage headlining set into a visually striking event. A plethora of LED screens had been installed around the stage: there was also a kind of moving walkway, along which frontman Matty Healy glided with impressive elan and – for reasons that weren’t entirely clear – the rear half of a car stage-left, from the interior of which Healy performed a song. But as ever with the 1975, all the bells and whistles came with a distinct twist. The stage-side screens not only displayed the songs’ lyrics as Healy sang them, but flashed up critiques of them – “MINDLESS HOLLERING” – and indeed of the 1975 generally: “IS THIS A JOKE?” Meanwhile, between songs, Healy switched from preposterous self-aggrandising – “I’m the greatest songwriter of my generation” – to earnest proclamations about the longstanding friendship at the band’s heart and playing the role of a raddled, tormented pop star, cigarette in one hand, glass of booze in the other.View image in fullscreenImpressive elan … Matt Healy of the 1975.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThe danger is that all this meta commentary erects a barrier between the band and the Glastonbury audience, who are perhaps less interested in deconstructing the idea of what it is to be a pop star in the age of social media than they are in singing along. But their set also provided a reminder of how skilled they are at the more prosaic business of songwriting: Love It If We Made It’s parade of millennial angst, the pastel-hued 80s synth-rock of If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know), the gleaming pop of The Sound, the epic balladry of closer About You. The band ended the show embracing, apparently genuinely emotional: a straightforward conclusion to a bold, experimental, occasionally confounding, but ultimately impressive performance.View image in fullscreenBusta Rhymes (right) with Spliff Star.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianSaturday arrived with the Kaiser Chiefs, celebrating the 20th anniversary of their debut album Employment, and country-inflected US singer-songwriterBrandi Carlile, who, as she noted, is substantially better-known back home – where she has been garlanded with Grammy awards and hosts her own festival – than in the UK (her recent collaborative album with Elton John notwithstanding). The crowd that initially assembled was small, but gradually built up, which was testament to the power of her voice and the immediacy of her songwriting: the surging power of The Joke, and You Without Me’s heartbreaking meditation on parenthood.View image in fullscreenKneecap play West Holts stage.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianRegardless of the headliners, the most talked-about Glastonbury appearance this yearwas that of Kneecap. Quite a lot of the conversation seemed to have been held by people who had evidently never been within a mile of Glastonbury, but the controversy over their comments about Palestine and Conservative MPs was clearly good for business: long before they appeared, the area around the West Holts stage had to be closed to prevent a crush. For now, the trio seem happy to lean into the controversy: their appearance was preceded by a montage of voices condemning the band. Sharon Osbourne featured heavily; Kneecap’s ongoing legal travails were regularly referenced, chants of “fuck the Daily Mail” and “fuck Keir Starmer” jostled for space with “free, free Palestine”. It’s probably too late to say it would be a shame if the furore overshadowed Kneecap’s actual music – far more people now have a virulent opinion about them than have actually heard them – but the point stands: Mo Chara and Móglaí Bap are impressive rappers – raw-throated but dextrous – their sound is a moshpit-inducing stew of drum’n’bass, dubstep and pounding house, decorated with fizzing rave synths. It’s genuinely exciting and feral. In the acres of subsequent coverage generated by their performance, it never gets mentioned.View image in fullscreenStepping up … Skepta.Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/ShutterstockElsewhere, you had to admire the fortitude of rapper Skepta: having already headlined the Other stage on Friday, he reappeared on Saturday, stepping in at short notice for the Deftones, who cancelled due to illness. He was rewarded with an immense audience and a rapturous reception: making the most of his 30 minutes, he packed the brief set with crowd-pleasing hits – That’s Not Me, It Ain’t Safe – while the closing Victory Lap, a freshly released warp-speed collaboration with producer Fred Again, caused something approaching delirium.“Crowd-pleasing” is not a description much applied toPyramid stage headliner Neil Young(whose set clashed withCharli xcx): indeed, he has spent a significant proportion of the last 60 years deliberately short-circuiting his own career whenever it looked as if the crowd might be a little too pleased for his liking. He arrived on stage in a tattered plaid shirt, with a cap pulled so far down it obscured most of his face: at nearly 80, he increasingly looks less like a legendary rock star than an old mechanic from a small American town. At its best, the ensuing set was utterly electrifying, powered by his evident chemistry with new backing band the Chrome Hearts, who spur him into a succession of caustic-sounding extended solos and extended codas comprised exclusively of churning, visceral guitar noise. There were a lot of highlights: fabulously sludgy versions of Fuckin’ Up, Cinnamon Girl and Like a Hurricane; a lovely, lambent acoustic take on Harvest Moon. Equally, there were puzzling moments, most notably an unexpected diversion into 2003’s Sun Green, a song one suspects no one wanted to hear at that precise moment, with the exception of Neil Young: it’s painfully slow, has18verses and lasted so long that you started worrying he’d still be there in three weeks’ time, performing it to a barren field and an audience entirely comprised of nonplussed dairy cows.View image in fullscreenUncompromising … Neil Young.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThat said, the encore of Rockin’ in the Free World was euphoric, but anyone after the fabled Glastonbury moment would probably have been better served with the biggest of the non-secret secret shows: Pulp on the Pyramid stage on Saturday evening. The whole performance acted as a reminder of what a singular band they’ve always been – with the benefit of hindsight, their music and lyrics seem so different from those of their Britpop peers, it’s as if they became huge coincidentally, rather than as part of a broader mid-90s movement. It climaxed with Common People: it was hard to judge exactly, but there is a distinct possibility it might have provoked the most vociferous reception of the weekend. As it built to a climax, a noise from above distracted the crowd’s attention. Entirely coincidentally, the Red Arrows staged a flypast: a slightly odd accompaniment to a song about class rage, admittedly, but weirdly impressive nonetheless.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalNeil YoungThe 1975LordeLewis CapaldiKneecapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the one hand, didn’t it speak of a profound unease in your own skin, the result of internalised patriarchal oppression, that you’d want to parade a hairlessness that everyone knew was fake, in order to satisfy a male gaze that fundamentally didn’t want to deal with the messy reality of you? And yet, on the other hand, wasn’t it so much neater and more feminine? Decisions, decisions. We argued a lot but shaved our pits anyway. Then the world moved on without us, and nobody does this any more. The worst thing is, if you’ve shaved your pits for long enough, they won’t grow back; like a metaphor for lost youth, made of hair.Skimpy: the new style bywordView image in fullscreenBimini rocking the skimpy look.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianDrag icon and activist Biminiwas wearing a red, white and blue bustier, fishnets, hot pants and 12in heels when they made their final adjudication on festival style: “Skimpy. Look, see what I mean?” They then pointed at someone in the crowd who was wearing a bra and shorts, and looked quite surprised to be singled out. “Skimpy, skimpy, skimpy.”Generally speaking – and no offence, surprised crowd-member – it’s not enough to get dressed, take off one layer and then go out; you have to mix it up a bit. Regular trousers with the arse removed; panels cut out to reveal random segments of hamstring; vest tops rolled up on one side. The vibe is Flintstone or fetish, your call.What became ofbrat summer?View image in fullscreenCharli xcx on the Other stage.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAThis time last year, the spirit ofCharli xcxseemed to herald a new spirit of rebellion and devil-may-care among young women specifically, all women generally, and actually, hell, all people. An awesome amount of time was spent explaining to each other what a “brat” was – she had ladders in her tights and didn’t wash her hair, except on a Wednesday; if she got drunk in the morning, it was because that’s what she’d decided; she was never waiting for anyone’s call. It was anti-consumerist, anti-wellness, anti-pilates, an emancipation from bullshit. If it had all been a flash in the pan, that would have been quite sad.Charli ceremonially burned the green brat curtain at the end of her set, and the homemade brat merch in the crowd has thinned out. But Charli xcx ain’t going nowhere – she’s like herself times a thousand.Everyone has one celebrity they’ll break forIf I saw someone famous, I would leave them in peace, up to the point of pretending not to notice who they were. I’d never ask for a selfie, I’d never tell them how much they’d meant to me and insert some heartfelt detail, I’d try not to even poke the person I was with and say, “Look,it’s so-and-so,” because, in the end, the celeb is a person, not a zoo animal. They always have to find some way to match your surprise and enthusiasm, which just isn’t possible. Plus they’ll have recently come off stage, and likely be way too hot.View image in fullscreenZoe Williams with Justin Fletcher, AKA CBeebies’ Mr Tumble.Photograph: Zoe WilliamsSo I thought, anyway. Then I saw Mr Tumble, fresh out of the CBeebies House Party, and I had to tell him he’d saved the 2010s for me, and I had to get a selfie, even though I was so overexcited that it only has my ear in it.Calling something ‘secret’ is the best way to guarantee that everyone immediately knows what it isStick in a band called “Patchwork” and everyone knows it’s Pulp. News of an unscheduled Lewis Capaldi show will go round faster than measles in a post-facts autocracy. Sometimes the details get a bit lost, so a “secret” Fat Dog set will become the rumour of a “secret” appearance by Wet Leg – don’t go to the rumour mill for accuracy. But the minute the mill grinds into gear, it will not rest until everyone, everywhere, knows everything. The information age has created a desperate appetite for intel that was not freely given up. No one ever asks whether it’s any more special than all the other intel.Fluffy hats are majorView image in fullscreenFluffy hat and fan at the Temple stage.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesAs Jarvis Cocker said, 30 years and four days after he first played this festival, Glastonbury is bigger than any of us. It is an entity, and it is alive. And, like any living thing, sometimes it spawns a stupid idea, which you just have to hope doesn’t spread. This year, imagine a bucket hat, made of fake fur, probably pink.How to share sunscreen in a wholesome wayDon’t rub it in on a stranger and look like a creep; don’t try to discuss their sunscreen needs and look as though you’re trying to make friends in the most boring possible way. If you see the back of a neck going a bit red, just spray them and be on your way.A less-often-mentioned side-effect of a late nightAs the queue for coffee snaked endlessly across the grass, the barista explained that nobody’s face ID was working because they were all too hungover.Nothing anyone says about Kneecap is going to stop people liking KneecapView image in fullscreenKneecap at the West Holts stage.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianNo amount of “whither political civility?” will do it, no casual or strident dismissals of their viewpoint. I decline to extrapolate from this anything about public opinion on issues besides Kneecap. Let’s just leave it at:people really like Kneecap.Headscarves are a self-conscious performance of dowdinessYou’ve got to wonder what you’re trying to say with this Betty Draper cosplay, which even Gracie Abrams was spotted in. Do you have to cover your head because your hair is too beautiful to look at directly, and your modesty too pronounced? Are you about to engage in some agricultural labour?I unlocked the mystery of the Pringles SuperMario mystery flavourSolid pickled onion on the front taste, and any idiot could get that; followed by a chilli kick, which in the Pringle universe goes by the generic “spicy”. Whether or not this is what Mario and Luigi would have wanted is anyone’s guess.Puppets are backIf you saw it on a flyer, you’d think: nah. Oversized sheep’s head atop a real person’s head, so they look like a sheep, but not very much like one? Nah, I’m good. Little Sooty-and-Sweep-style hand puppets, peeking over the top of the DJ booth? I can live without those.View image in fullscreenIf your name’s not down, you’re not coming in … one of Cosmic Slop’s puppets at Glastonbury.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBut you onlythinkyou can live without that, friend. Nobody knows why, but when they appear, puppets add an incomprehensible amount of gaiety.If you’re wearing an Arsenal shirt, don’t be surprised if Arsenal fans try to engage you in conversations about ArsenalThat’s part of the point! You’re not supposed to be wearing it just for the colourway.Stone circles are not all thatThird or maybe 30th-hand, I heard the story of a guy whose girlfriend was Egyptian, and she’d never heard of Stonehenge. He showed her a picture of it, thinking she must have seen it and not remembered its name, and her response? “Your ancestors were small and weak.” Hun, you think Stonehenge is not all that, you should see the stone circle at Glastonbury. And yet the hippies are all over it.A cowboy craze doesn’t have to have a meaningPeople might just be wearing the boots because they’re flattering, the hats because it’s hot, and the tasselled jackets to complete the look, and it might just be coincidence that everyone is doing that at the same time. However, let’s say that it isn’t, and there’s a deeper message: it’s that everyone wishes Beyoncé was here.A festival is the perfect place to field test the hierarchy of HariboView image in fullscreenHaribo … but do they love it so?Photograph: Matt Fidler/The GuardianEveryone thinks Starmix is the main Haribo; for years, we’ve all been sitting here thinking: “It’s weird, I don’t like them, they have a spongy texture, underwhelming flavour spectrum and insufficient interest, but other people must like them, because they’re the main Haribo.” This is completely wrong. If you leave a range of the popular sweets in a populated office space, as I did at Glastonbury, this is the order in which they disappear; Nostalgix; Tangfastics; Giant Strawbs; Strips; Supermix; Happy Cola. Starmix comes a solid last.BuzzBallz are not just for childrenNeon-coloured plastic balls of boozethat taste like a cocktail of battery acid and squash – I’ve asked family members before who drinks these things, and the answer is always: people whose fake ID is so amateurish it only works in a corner shop. But this is not so! They are amazingly well-designed for drinking on the move, especially if you want to play catch beforehand.Rod Stewart has gone over to the dark sideThe gnarly pop rocker stunned everyone in 2023 when he announced that not only had he fallen out of love with the Tories, he’d go one further and give Labour a go. All eyes were on Stewart this year, to see if anything in his swagger would indicate whether he was still team Starmer or had reverted to his true blue roots. Two days before his legend slot, he blew the suspense by coming out in favour of Nigel Farage. Which is … a worry, I guess?C-bombs are no longer explodingOK, fine, I’m old, but I remember when you’d never say “cunt”, even if you regularly thought it, without first checking that your interlocutor would be OK with it. I was there when it was thought of as possibly misogynistic. I can definitely recall a time when you might think the word, you’d be medium sure your companion also thought it, but you wouldn’t say it out loud in case you sounded a bit unboundaried. Those days are apparently well and truly over. Between the T-shirts, the fans and the flags, this no longer seems to be one of the strongest words in the language.Everyone’s wearing Spice Girls T-shirtsView image in fullscreenBrat girl power … Stuart, 34, from London and Ben, 35, from Liverpool.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianMel C was the only IRL sighting of a Spice Girl at Glastonbury, but they were all there in spirit, owing to the surprising amount of – what would you call it? – heraldry all over the place.Urinals for women are all very well …… and equality is great, but: when you see how much engineering and overdesign has to go into pretending standing up to wee is a good idea, it feels like a metaphor about adapting to the patriarchy.Find another way to ask: ‘Are you OK?’You think you’re being concerned and nice, and you probably don’t mean anything by it. In your head, it might have a jaunty upwards inflection: “You OK, all well in your world?” To the hearer, however, it can sound likeanything: are you angry, are you on the brink of a nervous breakdown, are you the most hungover you’ve been in your life, are you on the level, are you reliable? Find something else to say. A simple “how are you?” works well.It’s annoying to obsess over your step countThere is a lot of step chat at Glastonbury, but come on. You’re in a big place, where things are far away from each other, and there aren’t any buses. Obviously you walked a lot.Forget the wet wipes, remember the parasolView image in fullscreenMembers of Gathering Voices wander the Circus Fields, armed with parasols.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockPeople go on so much about portable hygiene, and nobody ever mentions that you’ll use precisely three wet wipes, and then you’ll forget about them for a year, and – pro tip – whatever happens, you will never come back from any camping experience going”: “Thank God for those wet wipes.” A parasol, on the other hand, is the difference between you and that idiot who’s in A&E right now.Tallying up the full cost of a classic Glastonbury is pretty bracingAfter some epic inflation, a ticket is now £373.50 plus a £5 booking fee, up from £225 a decade ago. Travel is going to be a hundred quid unless you live in one of the surrounding villages; food bargains do exist but only if you think £6 for a bag of nachos is a bargain; and there is no way on earth you’re getting into the festival spirit, which is to say drunk, with change from £50. It’s an £800 long weekend, which is hardly a newsflash, but it does mean that acts likeFaye Webster, with more of a teenage following, are underpopulated. Is it unreasonable to mourn a time when more young people could afford to come? Am I being nostalgix?Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025FestivalsCharli xcxGlastonbury festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What unfolded was a weekend of shock, confusion, throbbing testicles – and unbridled joyAdrian ChilesSun 29 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 12.12 EDTShareIthought I would never go to Glastonbury, and that was fine with me. Six years ago, I wrote about how it wasmy idea of hell, my event 101. Ever since then, for reasons known only to themselves, my Guardian handlers have been badgering me to come. They wore me down. They got me to Glastonbury.What was my problem? Well, while I knew I would love a lot of the music, there are some creature comforts I won’t be without. Nothing fancy – my personal hygiene bar is rather low; going without a shower for a few days holds no fear for me. All I insist upon is a clean bog and a bed on which to sleep, neither of which are easy to find at Worthy Farm.The odd thing with Glastonbury is that even those who love it will also tell you terrible things about it. Murder when it’s hot. Misery when it’s wet. Chaotic, confusing, can’t get near the stage. Flip-flops? You must be mad – your feet will be covered in filth! The toilets? God, they’re – retch – awful. But youmustgo, they would all conclude. Must I? Apparently so.As the weekend neared, my anxiety ratcheted up. In one stress dream, I was bundled, protesting, on stage to introduceSelf Esteem. Weird. In another, I was up there in a spelling competition trying to spell arboretum. Weirder still.View image in fullscreenCreature of habit … Self Esteem at this year’s festival.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOn the radio, I sought listeners’ advice for a Glastonbury virgin. The first text in read: “Baby wipes, baby wipes and baby wipes.” I bought some baby wipes. Someone else said: “Make sure you get your drugs tested at the back-of-house testing sites.” I’ll be sure to do that – and if my atorvastatin turns out to be knock-off, I’ll be speaking to my pharmacist in the strongest terms. Rob, 49, got in touch to say it would be his first time too, and he was more nervous than excited.My daughters, both of whom would be there, said things like: “Don’t do anything strange,” and: “Don’t do anything embarrassing.” They both asked, sweetly enough, if I had any friends going, because they didn’t want anyone saying: “We just saw your dad walking around on his own.” Parenting is about the journey from being the carer to being the cared for. This has been the weekend my children and I crossed that Rubicon. Are you OK? Have you eaten? Did you bring your sun cream? Toilet paper? Surely it should be me asking these questions, not struggling to answer them.To dodge the traffic, I decided to travel on my motorbike. That way, if it was really awful, I could attempt an exit à la Steve McQueen in The Great Escape. It turned out to be a good decision: I swept right up to the gate, trundled into the secure bike compound and parked alongside the incredibly few motorbikes in there. Bingo. It’s the way to go. So there I was, a Glastonbury first-timer not even into the festival proper, already offering dad advice on how to do it better.Fifty-eight is decidedly late to lose your virginity at anything. This weekend felt like going to a Doctor Who convention without having seen an episode of Doctor Who, or taking up skiing having never trodden on snow. Last summer, I went on a cruise for the first time and it was the same then – everyone apart from me seemed to know the ropes. All at sea, then and now.At first, I always seemed to be walking in the opposite direction to everyone else. On one occasion, a river of people marching in the same direction blocked my way. Ill-advisedly, I tried to dance across the general flow. There was an obvious lesson: chill out, Grandad, and go with that flow.View image in fullscreenIt takes all sorts … Adrian looks for a party outfit.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI’m not a grandfather, by the way, but I felt like one there. While it was not exactly a youthful crowd, 95% of them appeared to be younger than me. Anxiously, I scanned around for someone, anyone, to make me feel young again, or at least not so old. There were the odd one or two, but not many. “Shed Seven,” someone said to me. “You should have been at Shed Seven. Everyone there was ancient.” Damn, that would have been a good place to start.Instead, I broke my duck atAlanis Morissette. “What’s Alanis Morissette?” asked my younger daughter. Fair question, given she wasn’t even thought of when Jagged Little Pill came out. So how come I seemed to be the oldest one there, too? I certainly felt more than seven years the senior of Alanis, who looked no different on Friday than she did back then.View image in fullscreenGoing with the flow …Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI picked up a particular vibe about the Glastonbury crowd. It was in the look on everyone’s faces, the way they walked, the very set of their jaws. I would characterise it as a mix of pleasure and pain, excitement and exhaustion. By the time I turned up, everyone already looked a bit knackered. Happy, no doubt, but knackered. And this was only Friday afternoon. Blimey. What is this, a funfest or an endurance test? “Both!” said everyone to whom I posed this question. As one young woman said to me, with feeling: “The highs are high, but the lows are very low.” Right, I get it now: no pain, no gain. I can work with that, I thought. Once I understood what this Glastonbury caper was all about, I could engage.Pain was certainly something I experienced listening toBusta Rhymes. Without wishing to sound as old as I felt, his act seemed to involve a lot of shouting. Go with the flow, I reminded myself. I put my arms in the air when commanded by the great man to do so. I even endeavoured to move them backwards and forwards in time with everyone else. God loves a trier.View image in fullscreenTry before you buy …Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI got a text from a friend, Max, a Glastonbury old hand who turned out to be there busting some rhymes, too. My daughter, seeing a chance to get shot of me, led the way to him. Picking your way through a crowd is a skill this festival novice lacks. She yelled at me to keep up with her. This was easier for her to say than for me to do: she is quite small, with small feet, whereas I’m quite big, with correspondingly big feet. It is tricky to make brisk progress without knocking a drink – or the drinker – over, or causing lasting damage to fingers or toes. This must happen all the time, with all sorts of pushing, shoving and bad blood ensuing.View image in fullscreenBuckets of character …Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI asked Max how often fights broke out. “At Glastonbury? Never,” he said. And this, astonishingly, seems to be the case. All this chaos, intoxicants of all kinds and general exuberance, yet no trouble at all. Miraculous. OK, there have been political blows exchanged, but that is different. In terms of physical skirmishing, there will have been more nonsense on your high street this weekend than on the whole Glastonbury site.Max suggested we go to seeSelf Esteemon the Park stage. She had managed to start without me introducing her. And she was brilliant, really properly brilliant. With the help of nothing more than some warmish lager, my mate Max and this gifted woman from Rotherham, I felt a perfect high. I even, incredibly, bumped into Rob, who had texted in to my radio show that it was his first time. We agreed it was all very nice. Yes, this was great. But, as I had been warned, every high is followed by a low.View image in fullscreenSmall world … with Rob, who had texted Adrian’s radio show about visiting Glastonbury for the first time.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI had a look atLoyle Carner, who was just wrapping up on the Other stage, then called it a day. It was only then, back in my tent, that I realised I had got something very wrong. Two years ago,Lana Del Rey’s microphone was cutbecause she overran her headline slot. From this, I had drawn the conclusion that the organisers took their curfews and noise abatement responsibilities very seriously. Quite right, too. I assumed everyone else would be turning in now, too. I honestly thought my sleep would be disturbed by nothing louder than the sound of fellow campers snoring or, at worst, having sex.How very wrong I was. The snoring or sex would have needed to have been loud indeed to break the infernal racket that banged on for hours, all over the site. Why did they cut poor Lana’s mic if this aural pandemonium goes on all night anyway? Sleep came only as dawn approached, and fitfully. Truly, the God that is Glastonbury giveth and taketh away.Irose early to commence the search for some highs to make up for the night’s bottomless lows. For reasons of vanity, the previous evening I had dispensed with the compression sock I am always supposed to wear on my left leg. Now, I was paying a price for that, so, odd though it looks when I’m in shorts, back on it went. I was too tired to be anything other than my authentic self.View image in fullscreenMake some noise … Busta Rhymes(right)with Spliff Star on the Other stage.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianI chanced upon the Glade stage, where a modest but appreciative crowd were swaying in a relaxed fashion to the sound of – and I quote from the programme – Channel One’s Mikey Dread bringing roots, rock and reggae vibrations with MC’s vinyl and dubplates. Even though I’m familiar with more than half of those words, this didn’t mean a lot to me. Still, what’s not to like about a slow, heavy reggae beat? Among the swayers there were a good few blokes my age – at last! – shifting their weight from foot to foot. I stood there a while, enjoying it, and, almost despite myself, found my weight tentatively shifting from foot to foot.Then, two very odd things happened. First, the prodigious, dungeon-deep bass slightly changed pitch. I was astonished, not to say alarmed, to find that this – and I’m sorry not to spare you this detail – made my testicles throb in time with the music. I couldn’t work out if the other blokes were feeling the same thing. Perhaps Mikey Dread had just found my frequency. Look, I don’t mind a bit of something different late at night, but at lunchtime on a sunny Saturday, I wasn’t ready. Gingerly, I started to edge my way out, only for something even odder to happen.View image in fullscreenCheese! Adrian meets fans at the Glade.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianI was stopped by a petite woman, around my age, who shouted something in my ear that sounded like “DVT”. I thought this was some reference to my cursed compression sock, but it turned out she had said “DMT”. Specifically: “You need to smoke some DMT,” which presumably is what was emanating from the thing she was waving under my nose. I thanked her very politely, but refused. It became clear that this was an extremely good decision. “The effects of DMT take hold almost immediately when smoked. Users may feel like they are instantly transported to another universe,” I read. Crikey. “Within five minutes … users may experience increased blood pressure, rapid heartbeat and dilated pupils.”Relieved but shaken, I went off to the Healing Fields. There, a nice chap from Dorset calmed me with instructions on how to carve a heart into a square of Maltese limestone. All this before lunch. There really is something for everyone at that place.View image in fullscreenSomething for everyone … Adrian gets whittling.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe sun got hotter, the crowds thickened and still, to my increasing admiration, not a temper frayed. The sheer good nature of everyone in attendance started to feel almost absurd. My daughter told me to meet her at the Other stage, where she saidI would enjoy Beabadoobee– no, me neither. But she was right, I did. It was all getting nicer and nicer.Word reached me of fire and brimstone elsewhere ahead ofthe Kneecap gig. It came across like news from a distant planet where they did things differently. I neither saw, heard nor felt anything along those lines anywhere I ventured all weekend.Kneecap at Glastonbury review – sunkissed good vibes are banished by rap trio’s feral, furious flowsRead moreBy the timePulp took to the Pyramid stage, the peace-and-love control knobs were turned up to 11. Sensing the softening of my heart, my colleagues took the opportunity to force me into silly hats and whatnot. Everyone sang along. Everyone danced. Even me, nearly. The Red Arrows flew over. What next? Santa? To my consternation, I got a bit tearful. I give in. Glastonbury is a good thing. Anything that makes the world feel this nice has to be a seriously good thing.To anyone who has been scathing about Glastonbury without having attended – as was the case with me – I humbly suggest your cynicism would not survive the reality of being there.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before the hour is out, no one in the audience will be left in doubt as to the Grammy winner’s mastery of her craft, or how much work she has put in to achieve it. But at the same time as flaunting her natural ability, Doechii is also eager to show her working and the paths she used – and her debut UK festival appearance is all the more mesmerising for it. The 26-year-old performer’s schoolgirlish styling – giant lockers, rows of desks, Doechii’s long braids and exceedingly brief kilt – is immediately obvious as a feint: she may be a relative newcomer to the scene, but she is no rookie.The videos playing either side of the stage bring the set’s concept into focus: Doechii (real name Jaylah Ji’mya Hickmon) is leading us, step by step, through the steps necessary to become a hip-hop master – from how to distinguish between “good bars and GREAT bars”, to understanding “the aspect of flow” and the importance of genre.The overarching suggestion is that Doechii is the total package, and she makes it hard to argue with: she is pure power, head-to-toe sinew, as tightly coiled as a snake and just as hard to tear your eyes off. Doechii spits, she lunges, she sprints the length of the stage and seems to hardly pause for breath throughout the entire show.View image in fullscreenSpitting and lunging … Doechii.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianShould you catch yourself wondering where this force of nature sprung from, she’s eager to tell you, peppering her set between snippets of Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, Missy Elliott and even Daft Punk. It not only adds richness to the show but also places Doechii within a musical lineage, identifying her as an artist who swotted up on the greats, then found a spin uniquely her own.After Bullfrog, the screens switch from black-and-white to vivid colour, and Doechii launches into Boiled Peanuts, defined by its irresistible, cackling refrain – the crowing “ha ha ha” of a victor who knows herself to be head and shoulders above the competition. That triumphant glee extends into Nissan Altima: Doechii is held aloft by her posse of backing dancers, swinging her braids like the imperious head cheerleader.The show’s pace is so relentless, the choreography so precise and the Doechii’s flow so airtight that all the crowd can do is hold on and hope for dear life to be carried along. With her freestyle over America Has a Problem, from Beyoncé’s Renaissance, Doechii challenges anyone who dares fancy themselves her competition to step up: “I see a lotta bitches, I don’t see a lotta stars / I hear a lot of rappers, I don’t hear a lot of bars.”The follow-up nod, in that song, to the Barbz – Nicki Minaj’s famously fanatical fanbase – makes Doechii’s most obvious comparison explicit, but not only does she match Nicki’s impeccable flow, she also bests her stage presence. Nicki’s never been known as much of a performer, whereas Doechii runs the length of the stage in heels and throws her body around like it’s another special effect at her disposal. Through Alter Ego, she’s flirtatious, casting coy glances over her shoulder, then antagonistic, spitting fire from a low squat position. Doechii’s association with alligators, appearing on the cover of her album Alligator Bites Never Heal, is apt: they share the same implacable ferocity, bared teeth and glint to the eye.View image in fullscreenDoechii and her dancers.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianA dance break involving umbrellas adds to the spectacle, but slightly obscures the school of hip-hop through-line. The show restores equilibrium with Persuasive, Doechii’s track with SZA – obviously performed tonight without her, but with such force that you don’t feel the absence. Doechii’s back and forth with her DJ/hype woman Miss Milan adds to the party atmosphere; by the time she launches into Nosebleeds from atop of a giant pair of speakers with her dance troupe way below, the crowd is hanging on her every word.From that apparent peak, the highs only continue with an X-rated performance of Crazy and a rendition of her hit Anxiety that blasts the sample, Gotye’s Somebody That I Used to Know, with heavy distortion. For all her immense technical ability and precision, there’s actually something quite metal about Doechii in her commitment to spectacle. On top of all that, she has a strong, clear voice, capable of acrobatics but not inclined to launch into them just for show. On GTFO, she spars with her dancers, then the camera; for Catfish, she shows off her vocal timbre, descending into a guttural, bristling growl.It is brilliant, but unrelenting; a reprieve from all that intensity arrives with Denial is a River – Doechii’s Salt-N-Pepa-esque, gossipy hit about a cheating partner and the narrator’s own self-deception. It’s presented within the educational framework of tonight’s set as an exemplar of “the art of storytelling”, and more than delivers on that promise: Doechii is relaxed, self-deprecating and conversational with Miss Milan. You could happily watch her riff in this register for hours.As it is, Doechii concludes her “school of hip-hop” with a rousing rendition of Boom Bap, then skips off stage. It might seem anticlimactic – West Holts seems to be left slightly reverberating by her sudden absence – but it’s in fact one last lesson: a true master knows to always leave the crowd wanting more.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025DoechiiGlastonbury festivalRapPop and rockFestivalsMusic festivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Two days later, he announced he’d changed his mind, although the wrangling over whether or not the BBC would be allowed to livestream his performance seems to have gone down to the wire: last week they issued a statement saying they wouldn’t, but in the event the live stream went ahead.A man who’s been conducting his career according to his own baffling internal logic for the best part of 60 years, Young clearly sees no reason to change his approach as he nears 80: not for nothing is his online blog called the Times Contrarian. It lends a certain frisson to his Glastonbury appearance: as longstanding fans will tell you, with a mixture of weariness and fond admiration, you never quite know what he’s going to do, although what the floating voters who invariably make up a significant percentage of a Glastonbury audience will think of it is anyone’s guess.View image in fullscreenNeil Young and his bandmates the Chrome Hearts.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianHe takes the stage clad in a tattered plaid shirt, jeans and a Casey Jones hat pulled down over his face: in old age, he increasingly looks less like a rock star than a mechanic from a small American town who distrusts anyone not born within a mile radius of its centre. He dispatches a version of Sugar Mountain on acoustic guitar, before the Chrome Hearts arrive. This is essentially his earlier outfit Promise of the Real augmented by 82-year-old keyboard player Spooner Oldham, a man whose career stretches back to Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett’s legendary late 60s albums. They may well be the best backing band Young has assembled since Crazy Horse, their sound simultaneously tumultuous and lumbering and heavily distorted.Cinnamon Girl, from 1969, and 1990’s Fuckin’ Up alike conclude with lengthy barrages of noise: during the latter, guitarist Micah Nelson creates feedback by throwing this guitar into the air. At their best, they’re impossibly thrilling. Young’s lengthy guitar solos have an impassioned, almost caustic quality, and the sense of the musicians huddled together at the centre of the stage sparring off each other is really striking.At one point, it seems as if Young is going to start rolling out one venerable classic after another, to general delight: a version of Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) is followed by an acoustic section featuring The Needle and the Damage Done and a lovely, lambent take on Harvest Moon provokes the audience into singing softly along.Charli xcx at Glastonbury review – a thrilling hostile takeover by a pop star at the peak of her powersRead moreBut simply playing a crowd-pleasing selection of what you might broadly describe as the hits wouldn’t be very Neil Young: instead, he throws in Sun Green, a painfully slow, musically unchanging track from his coolly received, ecologically themed early 00s concept album Greendale. It has 18 verses, and lasts so long that you’re occasionally gripped by the very real fear they’ll still be up on the Pyramid stage playing it long after the festival has ended. Some of the floating voters take this as a cue to see what’s happening elsewhere on site. But then he plays Like a Hurricane, accompanied by Nelson playing a keyboard that seems to be suspended from the roof of the stage.An acoustic version of Old Man is warmly received yet makes for a weirdly downbeat end to the set, but an encore of Rockin’ in the Free World offers what you might call the full festival experience. The screens keep flashing on to the audience: there are people on their friends’ shoulders singing along. A suitably inscrutable onstage presence for most of the night, Young is visibly enjoying himself. He leaves the stage having headlined Glastonbury in a manner entirely in keeping with his longstanding reputation.Explore more on these topicsNeil YoungGlastonbury festivalGlastonbury 2025FestivalsMusic festivalsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Streeting said what people should be talking about in the context of Israel and Gaza is the humanitarian catastrophe in the territory and the fact that Israeli settlers attacked a Christian village in the West Bank this week.“All life is sacred. And I find it pretty revolting we’ve got to a state in this conflict where you’re supposed to sort of cheer on one side or the other like it’s a football team,” he said.Asked about the Israel embassy’s response to the chants at Glastonbury, he said: “Well, I’d say sort of two things in response to those words from the Israeli embassy. Firstly, I do think that if I take the equivalent of the war in Ukraine, I’m unequivocal about which side of that war I’m on. I want Ukraine to win. Would I be celebrating or chanting for the death of Russian soldiers? No, I want to see an end to the war, and I want to see an end to the conflict.“I’d also say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and the settlers in the West Bank. So, you know, I think there’s a serious point there by the Israeli embassy I take seriously. I wish they’d take the violence of their own citizens towards Palestinians more seriously.”Police are examining videos of comments made by the acts Bob Vylan andKneecapat Glastonbury as the festival enters its third day.View image in fullscreenBobby Vylan, of the rap punk duo Bob Vylan, led crowds in a chant of ‘Death, death to the IDF’.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOn Saturday the rapper Bobby Vylan, of the rap punk duo Bob Vylan, led crowds at the festival’s West Holts stage in chants of “Free, free Palestine” and “Death, death to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]”.Describing himself as a “violent punk”, he said: “Sometimes we have to get our message across with violence because that’s the only language some people speak, unfortunately.”Glastonbury organisers said on Sunday that the act had crossed a line. “With almost 4,000 performances atGlastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share, and a performer’s presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs,” the festival said in a statement.“However, we are appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan yesterday.“Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”Bob Vylan performed before the Irish rap trioKneecap, who called on fans to show up at Westminster magistrates to support the band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara, who wascharged with a terrorism offencefor holding a Hezbollah flag at a London gig last November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve got to keep each other safe.” He thanked the Eavis family, the festival’s organisers, for “holding strong” and allowing their performance to go ahead.Avon and Somerset police said: “We are aware of the comments made by acts on the West Holts stage atGlastonbury festivalthis afternoon. Video evidence will be assessed by officers to determine whether any offences may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.”The Israeli embassy said it was “deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric expressed on stage at the Glastonbury festival”.A statement on X said: “Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy. But when speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out – especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms.“Chants such as ‘Death to the IDF,’ and ‘From the river to the sea’ are slogans that advocate for the dismantling of the state of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination. When such messages are delivered before tens of thousands of festivalgoers and met with applause, it raises serious concerns about the normalisation of extremist language and the glorification of violence.“We call on Glastonbury festival organisers, artists, and public leaders in the UK to denounce this rhetoric and reject of all forms of hatred.”Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader, called the scenes “grotesque”, and said: “Glorifying violence against Jews isn’t edgy. The west is playing with fire if we allow this sort of behaviour to go unchecked.”Asked about the controversy ahead of Kneecap’s performance on Wednesday, Emily Eavis said: “There have been a lot of really heated topics this year, but we remain a platform for many, many artists from all over the world and, you know, everyone is welcome here.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Wes StreetingIsraelIsrael-Gaza warKneecapLabourGlastonbury festivalnewsShareReuse this content"

Keyboard player Candida Doyle even gave an interview to a local Somerset newspaper insisting that while they wanted to play, Glastonbury “weren’t interested”. But clearly no one was convinced – the Pyramid stage is headlining-set heaving.There’s something charming about the fact that they open with Sorted For E’s & Wizz, a song that takes a pretty equivocal, even steely view of the kind of hedonism that prevails at Glastonbury: proof, should it be needed, that Pulp remain a band who seldom go about things the straightforward way. Listening to them play their 90s hits – Mis‐Shapes, Disco 2000, Babies – you’re struck by how little they had in common with their ostensible Britpop contemporaries. Their wonky collision of 70s glam, French pop, disco and analogue electronics didn’t sound like any of their peers, nor was the prevailing mood of their songs much in tune with the supposed mood of the era. They’re substantially darker and grubbier, consistently sticking up for oddballs and outsiders at a time when alternative music was making a lunge for a mainstream audience. It’s as if they became huge coincidentally, rather than as part of a movement.View image in fullscreenDarker and grubbier … Cocker with Pulp on the Pyramid stage.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockThis means that, for all the nostalgia their old songs evoke in anyone who can remember the 90s – and a quick scan around the audience reveals a number of people looking distinctly moist-eyed as they play – they aren’t welded to the era in which they were first recorded, so they haven’t really dated. Moreover, there isn’t really any diminution in quality when they drop in Spike Island and Got To Have Love, two songs from their comeback album More, a smart reapplication of their longstanding approach to a later stage of life. Cocker, meanwhile, remains a fantastic frontman, dispensing sage wisdom about the festival itself – “to enjoy Glastonbury, you have to submit to it” – and reflecting on how terrified the band were to find themselves filling in at short notice for an indisposed Stone Roses in 1995: “But I feel very relaxed today – how about you?”You’d probably feel quite relaxed too if you knew you had Common People as your closing number. Surely the most straightforwardly rousing anthem ever written about class rage, it causes delirium on a scale not so different from that you can see in old footage of their headlining appearance: a highlight then, it’s also one of the most joyous moments so far in this year’s festival. Presumably somewhat by coincidence, the Red Arrows stage a flypast midway through the song. And off Pulp go, Jarvis promising to see the audience in Arcadia later.This review was updated on 29 June with a correction: it was 30 years since their last appearance on the Pyramid stage, not the broader festival.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsPulpJarvis CockerreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like the album it was supporting, the Yeezus tour was abrasive and minimal and totally spectacular: West stood in front of gigantic bright-red screens and blasted arenas with some of the harshest, most acidic sounds ever considered mainstream. That tour was unrelenting and uncompromising and, as a result, totally compelling.Charli xcx’s Brat tour may be the only clear successor. It is a show whose main components are a curtain, a few stadium strobe light rigs, and one star whose vision is so specific and so well realised that the “necessities” of an A-list pop show – dancers, set pieces, etc – suddenly seem like crutches for anyone less in tune with themselves. This makes sense, given that Charli is also our clearest successor to West himself: despite being a prodigiously talented mainstream songwriter, she has dedicated her career to exploring the most caustic, hallucinatory sounds of the underground, and working out how best to synthesise them with the pleasures of pure pop music.View image in fullscreenCharli xcx performs during the Glastonbury Festival in Worthy Farm, Somerset, England, Saturday, June 28, 2025. (Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP)Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APWith the release of last year’s Brat, an album that became a cultural moment without ever diluting Charli’s ingenuity, mainstream culture finally caught up to Charli. So it’s fitting that she’s here at Worthy Farm headlining, by some metrics, the biggest music festival in the world. Of course, she’s not really headlining – Charli’s Saturday night set closing the Other stage is, on a purely technical level, second billed to Neil Young, who is headlining the Pyramid at the same time. But ask anyone here, and the headliner of the entire weekend is Charli.Her audience at the Other stage is dizzyingly huge, surely at least 60,000 people – a surreal sight for the many gay men who saw her perform in 200-capacity clubs as recently as 2019. And from the very first moments of her set, when she intones, gravely, “Glastonbury, don’t fucking play with me”, it’s clear that she is at the height of her powers, totally capable of holding the attention of a stadium’s worth of people. After all – who else could warrant a general expanding of the Other stage and the addition of more screens and speakers? Even if Charli wasn’t first billed, everyone at Glastonbury knew she was headlining.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t fucking play with me’ … Charli xcxPhotograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APThis was made clear with an intense, totally uncompromising set in which Charli performed totally alone, not even with collaborators such as Lorde, who was also at Glastonbury. The Brat tour is at its most effective when the viewer has to submit to Charli’s world, and this show, loud and bawdy and sometimes very unnerving in its intensity, was practically Charli-led hostile takeover.Her skill is in welding sophistication on to brute force – consider a song like Club Classics, which deftly stitches together at least four different styles of dance music in barely four minutes, but also brandishes a chorus of simply “me, me, me, me” – and even when she breaks script, you see that skill in action. “I’m known to have a heart of stone,” she tells the crowd, “But this is very fucking emotional.” She should save her tears – with an audition so memorable, so fun, so spectacular, the Pyramid has to be next.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMusic festivalsFestivalsCharli xcxreviewsShareReuse this content"

He discusses anxiety, his earnest new record and why he and his castmates are ‘bonded for life’Sun 29 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 29 Jun 2025 05.35 EDTShare“It was a crazy situation – this song that I wrote was being linked to the head of the Catholic church!” Joe Keery sounds incredulous as he recalls his latest viral moment. The track in question wasEnd of Beginning, the wistful indie anthem from his 2022 album Decide. It first became an online hit last year, taking on a new life soundtracking TikTok users’ videos of their home towns. As it happens, the home town – or university town, in Keery’s case – that he sings about in the song is Chicago. Fast forward to this May, when Illinois native Robert Francis Prevost was elected as the new pope. The song began to do the rounds all over, with fans overlaying the lyrics (“And when I’m back in Chicago, I feel it!”) over videos of the new pontiff.It was just the latest surreal chapter in the 33-year-old’s career, which has seen him juggle musical success with acting megastardom, thanks to his breakout role as villainous jock, and later beloved fan favourite, Steve Harrington in Netflix’s retro sci-fi smashStranger Things. Performing under the name Djo, he has released two albums of hazy psychedelic rock and angular electro respectively, plus that aforementioned, absolutely inescapable viral hit, which peaked at No 4 in the UK charts. He’s now on tour in support of recent third album The Crux, aptly named as he reaches the end of a nine-year stint in Stranger Things, whose extremely long-awaited final season will be released on 26 November.“It’s about the journey to reconnect with your roots and your family and your friends, and to rediscover what your real priorities are,” Keery says. It could sound trite, but it does seem like this is exactly what he’s done – even bringing his pre-Stranger Things band Post Animal on tour with him (he rejoined the group earlier this year).We meet at a shabby-chic north London pub, with Keery two shows into a three-night run at the nearby O2 Forum. Looking very much “incognito musician”, he wears a paint-splattered grey shirt, striped white barrel jeans and snakeskin-effect black cowboy boots, with hair that toes the line between artfully lived-in and a little greasy, and slim, rectangular sunglasses. Although he is a New Yorker these days, he was born and raised in Massachusetts and sports a Boston Red Sox cap. Initially, he seems a little guarded (the glasses stay on for 10 minutes or so), but that slowly seeps away and a playful, thoughtful music nerd emerges – the same Keery who recently appeared on the YouTube “name that tune” seriesTrack Star*waxing lyrical about Bryan Ferry and the Cars. He instantly recognises the face on my T-shirt as a young Billy Joel, and you get the sense that he’d happily just talk about Joel for the next hour.There’s a temptation – and maybe rightly so – to see actors turned musicians as hedging their bets, but it’s clear that Keery really cares about music, and has a talent for it to boot. He hails from a “creative family” (teacher mum, architect dad) and grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, James Taylor, ELO, Sheryl Crow, Shania Twain, Alison Krauss – the list goes on. While his last album, Decide, bore many of the hallmarks of his favourite electronic artists (hi Justice!), The Crux leans more heavily on those earlier influences, for a sound that Keery describes as “far more organic”.View image in fullscreenThrowing down … Djo.Photograph: Pooneh GhanaKeery is the second oldest of five children, the rest all girls, and it was Caroline – two years older than him – who pushed him to pursue acting. The first person in his family to leave the state for university (not for any good reason, he says, but because he didn’t get good enough grades to go to UMass in Amherst), he landed at drama school in Chicago, and fell in love with the city (“Working-class town, great art scene, affordable … absolutely ungodly weather that will test you all year, but then the most glorious summer”). After studying there, he stayed in the city and played guitar and keys with Post Animal, whose style was (and remains) psychedelic, flecked with prog and classic rock. He recalls the band’s early days, playing at events such as Austin Psych Fest as “a cool bonding experience. You’re kind of cutting your teeth doing that stuff, you’re having your highs and lows together. Sometimes it sucks and you bomb. It’s fun to have those experiences, though, to look back on.”Stranger Things came a couple of years into Post Animal’s existence and was a huge coup for Kerry, who to that point had only had small roles in procedural dramas such as Chicago Fire. Still, he has often talked about the “big-time Fomo” he felt when he had to leave Chicago for Atlanta, where the Netflix series was filmed. “What an opportunity … I got plucked out of obscurity and put into this thing that thrust me into the public eye,” he says. “But then, immediately, I was met with a sense of … oh man! I miss my friends and my sense of community. It took me a few years, honestly, to grapple with that.”View image in fullscreenSome kind of monster … Keery and Maya Hawke in Stranger Things.Photograph: Tina Rowden/NetflixKeery had to stop touring with Post Animal, and ultimately leave the band altogether, due to his Stranger Things commitments, but he still made music during filming, in part to keep himself busy and away from potential vices. (“It’s like, four in the afternoon. I’m not gonna go to the bar! That can be dangerous.”) Now he’s enjoying bringing his acting friends into his music (his Stranger Things co-star Charlie Heaton features on the new record), while also linking up again with his old bandmates. Even so, he’s the first to admit that it’s quite an unusual situation, and one clearly bolstered by his own existing status: his first appearance with Post Animal, after rejoining them, was on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Finding their feet on such a high-profile platform has led to “a level of stress. But it’s also good, I think, to release that and be like, well, it’s not gonna be perfect. I’m figuring it out, too.”Although he is now – once again – part of a group, Keery is also very much a solo artist as Djo. Ina 2020 interview, he said that his stage name (for the uninitiated, it’s pronounced like his actual name) had come about because he “didn’t just want to be a dumb actor who releases an album”. How does he feel about that statement now? “I mean, that’s a little harsh,” he says, sounding reflective. “What I’ve learned is that a lot of people do something creative, and odds are they do something else that is also creative. It sounds a little dramatic in retrospect, [but] I think I just really wanted to be taken seriously. I was just trying to give myself the best shot at that.”It’s difficult not to be anxious about how your work is going to be received, right? He nods. “Not for maybe, like … Daniel Day-Lewis. But everybody [else] wants to be in the cool crowd.”View image in fullscreenDjo public … Keery in Kentish Town, London.Photograph: Pooneh GhanaFittingly for an album full of expert, pastiche-swerving callbacks to artists of decades gone by, The Crux was recorded at Electric Lady studios in New York, made famous by Jimi Hendrix, alongside Keery’s longtime producer Adam Thein. Despite its vintage vibes, it feels decidedly millennial in its malaise. A case in point: Basic Being Basic, which has a jagged 80s powerpop sound, while also rallying against Instagram culture, or as Keery sings, “looking hot and keeping monotone and understated”.“I was not trying to make some big, cultural statement,” he says. “But [social media] is flattening culture, and I do think that we are kind of at risk of homogenising everything and losing rare things in different corners of the world.” He’s a little more online than he has been in recent years, he says, “but, yeah, it’s horrible for us and ruining the planet. It makes everybody so self-conscious.”Elsewhere, Egg – named after the Wings album Back to the Egg – zooms in on the angst that Keery still feels, in spite of his successes (sample lyric: “Deep down inside / There’s always that fear / That I’m not enough”). “I suffer with fear and anxiety every day,” he says. “A great example: you come home to your hotel or whatever. You’re like: I could, like, go get a drink and meet some people. [Then you think] ummm, no, I’m gonna go upstairs. You’re constantly confronted with the anxiety of interacting versus the payoff of meeting a new friend or having a new experience. It’s always worth it to go and talk to somebody, but there’s always a little voice that’s like: well, we could just be safe right now, you know.”Is it because he worries about being recognised? “No, no, not because of that. It’s just the fear of rejection, normal human stuff. Everybody has this little monkey on their back. Everybody wants to desperately connect, but also is afraid of it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Keery’s sisters sing on the Springsteen-in-training bop Back on You (“Why not have a love song for your sisters or for your friends or for your parents?”). Charlie’s Garden – a jaunty paean to 70s pop – sees Keery and Heaton, who plays Steve’s victim turned pal Jonathan in Stranger Things, perform an ode to the latter’s home in Atlanta. What sort of things went on in Charlie’s back yard? “All sorts of bad stuff,” Keery says with a mischievous giggle. However, the place sounds incredibly wholesome. “There was a cold plunge, ping pong. You’re exercising, digging holes, pulling down trees, hanging lights. Guy does a lot of chores! He’s a very good homeowner.”Djo review – Joe Keery mixes genres in an endearing, if uneven, Brooklyn setRead moreThe song – “bouncy, fun, not serious” – is, Keery says, a tribute not just to Heaton and his partner Natalia Dyer (Stranger Things’ Nancy) but to all his mates down there. “It’s a little tip of the cap to everybody in Atlanta who had such a big effect on me,” he says. “My community down there ended up being so much more important to me than I ever thought that they would be. We’re all bonded for life.” Being part of a huge TV franchise (Netflix’s third most-watched series ever, at the time of writing) could sometimes feel uncanny, “numbing” even. But, he says, “we always had each other. It wasn’t like being Macaulay Culkin or something, where you’re like, the one person in that one thing. I always feel pretty lucky in that way, where it’s like, I got one eighth of that …”View image in fullscreenTouching bass … Keery in the studio.Photograph: Sofiah YatesKeery says he’s wary of following trends or trying to pre-empt what people might like. The album could be seen, he says, as “a real reinterpolation of the classics, or dad rock-y. It’s not sleek pop music or cool indie music, either. It kind of lives in this grey space of like … sort of happy, sort of cheesy. But I’m also sort of cheesy.” Being earnest can be synonymous with being uncool, but, says Keery, he thought: “Fuck that. I do not care. If it’s like: this sounds too much like this band to you, well, you know what? Listen to every other band that sounds like every other band. These are my influences.”Criticism is a tricky subject between artists and journalists at the best of times. For writers, it often feels like a question of free speech and integrity. For artists, though, harsh reviews can obviously sting. Has he read, for example, the 5.9-rated Pitchfork review of the record, which calls it “frictionless” and includes the line “music you could imagine in a faux Urban Outfitters at Starcourt Mall [from Stranger Things]”.“I read the headline enough to kind of get the idea,” says Keery. “And, I mean, I understand it. You kind of can’t really let it get you down, I guess, or affect what you’re doing too much, to be honest with you.” He raises the same publication’s review of Benson Boone’s Coachella performance, which described the Beautiful Things singer as “horrible, just godawful”. “I read that and thought: ‘My God, why would you do this to somebody?’ You can not like stuff, but what’s the real point? I guess you just can’t let it sway you too much. You have to just keep following your creative instincts and doing what you find interesting.”View image in fullscreenGig economy … Djo at his London concert.Photograph: Pooneh GhanaWith Stranger Things now out of his calendar for good, what do those creative instincts look like? “No idea,” says Keery drily. “I don’t have an acting job, if anyone’s hiring! But I am a little addicted now to being in the driver’s seat. [Being a musician] is different to being an actor, where you’re the violin player in an orchestra, and you’re doing your part for this bigger thing.”Equally, there’s a kind of freedom in being part of something larger than you, he says, and he would love to go back to his drama school roots and do some theatre. If he sounds a little undecided, he also acknowledges that it’s good to have options. “I’ve been incredibly lucky, so I do have a pretty heavy sense of impostor syndrome-slash-gratitude,” he says. “It would be scary if that gratitude faded.”Again, this could all sound a little saccharine, but with Keery it feels genuine – a humble response to just how wild the past few years have been. I mean, he basically soundtracked the pope’s inauguration! “That was,” he says, fighting back his laughter, “so ridiculous.”Djo plays Glastonburyfestival on29 June; The Crux is out now.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockStranger ThingsTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now her sister Bella is writing her own version of their childhood. Does fact or fiction come closer to the truth, she asksEsther FreudSun 29 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareI’m four and I’m pretending to be dead. I’ve been lying here behind the sofa, and I’m hoping I’ll be missed, but more than that I’m hoping it will make a story. The story of the games I like to play, and how I profess to remember my past lives. It is 1967, a few months before we set off for Morocco – my mother, my sister Bella and I – travelling overland by van, taking the ferry from Algeciras to Tangier, breaking down on the road to Marrakech. From then on everything becomes a story. The camel festival we visit, the path into the hills so steep that Bella and I are packed into saddlebags while the donkeys’ hooves skitter and slip. I can’t remember later whether it is a camel that is sacrificed when we reach the top, or a chicken. But either way I keep the description of the chicken to myself, running in circles, blood spouting from its headless neck.For all the decades since, I’ve been the family chronicler, as much in my novels as in our lives. I’ve kept the few possessions from those years in Morocco. The kaftans we bought in the souk when we arrived, the corduroy patch that I unpicked from a pair of too small trousers, embroidered with a flower by a boyfriend of my mother. “Are you my Daddy?” I’d asked him, as I’d asked others, not because I thought he was, but because I’d read about another little girl asking the same question in a book. I can still see the look of consternation on the boyfriends’ faces, hear my mother’s embarrassed laugh.I had a treasure box in which I kept a choker, coins with Arabic stars, lengths of braid, and when, aged six, we returned to England and I started school, I saw the minutes set aside each day for “news” as an opportunity to expound. To tell my classmates how I saw a mirage in the desert, found amethyst in a seam of rock as we hitchhiked through the Atlas mountains, became lost on the beach at Agadir, until I was nicknamed “In Morocco …” and I learned to stay quiet. But the stories remained, coalescing, condensing, until in my mid-20s, on a break from the acting career I’d chosen for myself, I began to write them down. At first they were nothing more than anecdotes, but slowly, painstakingly, I forced myself inside them until I found the voice of the child I’d been, the scent of the alleyways, the heat of the baked earth, the fear and exhilaration, the freedom of our lives. “Hideous kinky,” my sister and I would murmur to each other when events became too strange or too confusing, and so, when it was finished,Hideous Kinky was what I named my first novel.As an actor I’d immersed myself in Stanislavsky, consoling myself that spells of heartbreak could be repurposed “for my art”. As a writer, I found that everything and anything was useful, and as I mined my life, digging deeper, unearthing half-forgotten truths, I wondered about the splinter of ice that Graham Greene so famously alluded to, and whether it really does lurk in every writer’s heart. Is having a writer in the family the death of the family?View image in fullscreenEsther Freud (left) with her mother, Bernardine, and sister, Bella.Photograph: PRI wrote my first novel in innocent naivety. The second was finished in a burst of exhilaration before the first was published, but for my third – nerves shattered, my mother reeling (who wants their five-year-old to remember every experiment in parenting and write it down?) – I turned to history. Berlin during the first world war had never been my subject, but I had the seeds of a story about my German Jewish grandmother gleaned from my father,Lucian Freud, during long hours of sitting for a painting, and much as I struggled, pre-internet, with the research, at least (if I ever managed to finish it) there was no one left alive to be furious or upset. Four exhausting years later I published Summer at Gaglow, and almost immediately, as a reward, I plunged back into my own life, to rake over the experience of living in a step-family, as I myself had done from the age of eight to 14. That’s when I discovered I’d become a different writer. I’d gained the confidence to invent, when often it had seemed no invention was needed – what, in actuality, could be more surprising than the truth? I had taught myself the art of camouflage, and by doing so had created a level of protection for everyone involved.In the books that followed I was free. That’s not to say I didn’t sometimes agonise, but I’d learned to pick and choose, research, obscure, allow my characters to spread their wings and fly. So it is with trepidation that I have returned to the central relationships at the heart of my first novel. My Sister and Other Lovers draws on the themes that shaped my writing – family, loyalty, division – the completion of which has coincided with the new storytelling career of my fashion designer sister, Bella, who has been publishing a weekly column on Instagram, Sunday Stories.How strange, over this last year, to read my sister’s interpretation of events. Free from the wiles of fiction, her voice rings out, clear and clean, and I am tempted to respond, as she must have been doing for years: “That’s not what it was like!”The Polish poet Czesław Miłosz is quoted as saying: “When a writer is born into a family, that family is finished.” So what happens when there are two writers in the family – I won’t even mention here my literary half-siblings – and is it fact, or fiction, that comes closer to the truth? Screenwriter and memoirist Nora Ephron once declared that all writers are cannibals, and her own mother, a writer herself, is known to have insisted that “everything is copy” – something Ephron proved with Heartburn, a blisteringly funny and painful account of the breakdown of her marriage. But even she must have wrangled with the dilemma: What exactly is allowed? What remains off limits? There’s no doubt I’ve been eyed by friends who’ve read my stories. “Gosh,” they’ve gulped. “You do have a good memory.” Then, of course, there are those friends with whom I’ve lost touch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It doesn’t matter whether this mother is alive or dead. Secrets, and the shame of them, have a way of stopping people in their tracks. However hard I encourage them to write – to edit, abandon, disguise the work later – fear acts like a bindweed. No wonder writers need that splinter of glass. Julian Barnes has said that while working on his first novel he had to pretend his entire family was dead. But what has surprised me more is the mistrust of anything considered to be true. If a piece of work is semi-autobiographical my students often tend to give it less value. That’s brilliant, I might respond, only to be met with a dismissive shrug: it’s virtually all true. This is a phrase I’ve been tempted to ban from the class. What matters, I try to impress upon them, is that the story is alive. And which story, once repeated, is ever actually all true? Is this because for years so many novels by women were branded as “domestic”, categorised as aga sagas, chick lit, while the angry young men of the 1950s and60s created kitchen sink drama unimpeded? More recently there’s been a wave of Autofiction which has risen above this prejudice, by Maggie Nelson, Annie Ernaux, and the ‘living autobiographies’ of Deborah Levy. Which brings me back to my sister’s Sunday Stories and whether it is fact or fiction that gets closer to the truth. Could I have told my own stories as memoir? Would I have had the courage?For me fiction is the frame I need to tell the stories I’ve been turning over all my life, the writing of which has freed and saved me. As I dig I can feel the splinter of glass pressing so hard it threatens to draw blood, but even as I worry for those I love, who inadvertently I may have hurt, I tell myself: it’s fiction. And I remind myself of my father’s liberating words after reading an early novel in which a character (just possibly) based on him appears. “For a moment I did think it was me, then I realised: I don’t wear a watch.”Explore more on these topicsBooksFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

City officialsremoved his monumentin April 2018 after a unanimous vote by the Public Design Commission.Edward Burtynsky: ‘My photographs are like Rorschach tests’Read moreBagwell will be the first Black woman to have a memorial on Fifth Avenue. Bagwell began sculpting in 1993 and created the First Lady of Jazz in Yonkers, the first public artwork made by a contemporary African American woman commissioned by a municipality in the United States.Her 9ft (2.7-meter) monument is of a Black woman with 14ft wings, only the second Black Angel statue to be visible publicly in the US.The shape of Africa cut away from the woman’s heart symbolizes the enslavement of 12 million people over hundreds of years. On her right side the braille will read “My Soul looks back and wonders how I got over!” and on the left it will read “Primum non nocere!” (First do no harm).View image in fullscreenCity workers remove a statue of J Marion Sims in 2018.Photograph: Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis/Getty ImagesTo honor the suffering of Sims’s victims, whose anguish brought advancement to the field of gynecology, there will be 12 women silhouetted on her back. A slave ship is also depicted on the back to illustrate the inhumanity of slavery. The names of the survivors we know will be emblazoned into the helm of the garment.Bagwell hopes that the monument, which will be across the street from the New York Academy of Medicine, will function as a vehicle of change for the community. “Women are more under fire now than we were before. So many of us women have lost a lot of the right to control our bodies. New York is still safe, but [women in] Arkansas aren’t,” she says. “When you look at some of the things that this particular administration is talking about, they’re talking about going backward; that is still something to be concerned about.”A US city took down its racist statues. Where do they go next?Read moreBagwell’s situation is not unique, with many other cities also stalling progress to replace Confederate statues and symbols. However, Vinnie has encountered many obstacles.First, a committee chose artist Simone Leigh as the winner, even though community members had voted for Bagwell. After a heated debate, the city ultimately reversed its decision. Then, the city attempted to cut $250,000 from its budget but failed. Bagwell has been waiting longer than the typical 90 days after signing her contract to receive the money.In a statement to the Guardian, the department stated its excitement about the project moving forward. “New York City has taken bold steps in the effort to foster a collection of public artworks that better reflect who we are as a city, including this project – long called for by the local community – to commission a new monument for this site in East Harlem,” they note.“This administration remains committed to fostering a diverse, vibrant public art collection that more fully represents the vast range of stories, experiences, and backgrounds that define New Yorkers. We’re excited for the Victory project to move ahead.”View image in fullscreenVinnie Bagwell’s Victory.Photograph: Courtesy of Vinnie BagwellOn 23 June, the design commission voted unanimously to approve Bagwell’s designs, and she can now begin work.Bagwell’s situation reflects a broader failure to follow through on legislation and promises made following the 2020 racial justice protests, where Americans dismantled statues of Confederate soldiers that stood in their communities after the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.In 2021, Joe Biden passed legislation toreplace the monumentof Roger Taney, a pro-slavery chief justice who served on the court from 1836 until 1864, with one of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American supreme court justice, in the United States Capitol. Theintended deadlinefor the building of the statute was December 2024, but that month, a source familiar with the matter said the joint committee on the library had only just signed off on a memorandum to begin the process.Wonderstruck: an art exhibition that will make even weary adults feel like kids againRead moreNow, a2025 executive ordersigned byDonald Trumpmandating that the secretary of the interior restore monuments removed in the last five yearsputs in jeopardythe already fragile progress made by past laws to diversify the public landscape in the US.Jamaican sculptor Basil Watson said that it’s “very possible” that more people are now in support of removing objects that help tell Black stories. “It’s the risk we take that is part of the struggle,” he said. Watson worked to replace a Confederate monument with a John Lewis memorial in Decatur, Georgia. “It would be a tragedy if it were to be removed, but then we’ll just have to do it again,” he said. “The journey cannot be stopped.”In 2017, Trump tweeted: “the beauty [Confederate monuments] that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!”This debate on the rise and fall of monuments dates back to the 1870s. In 1876, Frederick Douglass called into question the making of the Emancipation Memorial, built by artist Thomas Bell in Washington DC. The creation of the statute was funded using donations from recently freed people.View image in fullscreenA man waves a US flag during a rally to protect the Emancipation Memorial in 2020.Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the city created the monument to honor emancipation, it depicted a white man holding out his hand over a chained kneeling Black man, a design Douglass found problematic. “What I want to see before I die is a monument representing the Negro, not couched on his knees like a four-footed animal, but erect on his feet like a man,” he said. DC officials removed the statute in 2021, and advocates are still discussing its replacement.Nearly 150 years after Douglass’s speech, only 10% of the top 50 national monuments are of Black and Indigenous people, according to anaudit completed by the Monument Lab,a non-profit public art and history studio.The monuments we have tell a partial story. Adding a monument or the selective removal of a monument can have a profound effect for a city or townPaul Farber, Monument Lab“The story of this continent is not reflected in our monument landscape in full,” said Paul Farber, the director and co-founder of the Monument Lab. “The monuments we have tell a partial story. Adding a monument or the selective removal of a monument can have a profound effect for a city or town. If we don’t respond to the erasures, the lies by design we will be doomed to repeat. Our audit also showed that 99.4% of monuments were not taken down in 2021 or 2022.”TheTrump administration’s influence has now rolled back even that little bit of progress. This year, Pete Hegsethrolled backthe names of two military forts to their namesakes of confederate soldiers. Following pressure from Republicans, Washington DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, also ordered the destruction of the Black Lives Matter plaza in front of the White House.Trump has proposed reviving hiscontroversialNational Garden of American Heroes, usingmoney cutfrom the National Endowment for the Humanities, which ended hundreds of grants for libraries, museums and archives. The garden would include George Washington and Christopher Columbus statues alongside Martin Luther King Jr, Kobe Bryant and Whitney Houston.“When you look at some of the things that this particular administration is talking about, they’re talking about going backward,” Bagwell says. “That is still something to be concerned about.”View image in fullscreenStarlette Thomas holds a chunk of pavement from the Black Lives Matter mural.Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/APNationally, Republicans have been mixed on the issue of inclusion in public spaces. A Kentucky state senator, Chris McDaniel, is still advocating for the replacement of a Confederate statue. In 2020, he pre-filed a bill that would replace Jefferson Davis in the Capitol Rotunda with Carl Brashear, the first African American US navy master diver born in Tonieville, Kentucky.“His story is inspirational,” he says. “That’s what monuments are supposed to be about. It’s supposed to be able to point to people and say: ‘This is somebody you can look up to.’”McDaniel’s bill to replace Davis in the Capitol is at a standstill as the Kentucky Capitol Arts Advisory Committee and other legislators must weigh in on who they believe deserves to be honored.How centuries of racist images came down in one year – a visual guideRead moreMississippi’s Republican governor, Tate Reeves, has shown mixed messages about Confederate symbols in his state. During the 2020 election, almost 73% of people in Mississippi voted to remove the Confederate flag with a new state’s flag. “This is not a political moment to me but a solemn occasion to lead our Mississippi family to come together, to be reconciled and to move on,” Reeves said after the vote and before it was eventually replaced.In the same year, Reeves simultaneously opposed the removal of Confederate monuments. “I reject the mobs tearing down statues of our history, north and south, Union and Confederate, founding fathers and veterans,” he says. “I reject the chaos and lawlessness, and I am proud it has not happened in our state.” ​Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative who led the building of Legacy Sites in Montgomery, Alabama, a civil rights museum that works to reshape the racist narratives about African Americans in Alabama, explains Reeves’s messaging.“I think it’s a struggle, a competing narrative, and sometimes they give away a little something by holding on to something that makes what they’re giving away feel acceptable,” he tells the Guardian. Stevenson says it “is about power, because most of the people who are kind of in control of these things [are] aligned, in my view, with this problematic history. We can’t accept just what [they’re] gonna give” us.Some artists who have worked to replace Confederate monuments with ones that honor Black history have succeeded and received praise despite government resistance. In Roanoke, Virginia, the city sculptor commissioned Lawrence Bechtel to replace a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee with one of Henrietta Lacks.View image in fullscreenHenrietta Lacks and the John Lewis monument.Photograph: Courtesy of Lawrence Bechtel and  Basil WatsonLacks’ cells, now called HeLa, were taken without her knowledge in 1951 and have now become vital to medical research; they have been used to develop polio and Covid-19 vaccines. It took about four years for the city to raise the money for the statue and a year from the contract being signed for Bechtel to build the monument.“I had bought a veil to cover it over, and everyone was invited to come close as the veil was pulled off, and people just mobbed it. It was fantastic,” he says. “It was just wonderful. It was very uplifting.” Bechtel said he has yet to receive a negative email.Trump is terrified of Black culture. But not for the reasons you thinkRead moreWatson, who built a monument of John Lewis to replace a memorial put in place by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, recalls the community’s excitement about the monument before he even finished. “The idea of putting up John Lewis in its place was quite exciting for the community, and since it has been up, I have had nothing but positive responses,” he says.Watson remains steadfast in his belief that the inclusivity of public art is crucial. “I think we artists need to represent our community; we need to have our values represented in our environment,” he says. “I think it’s important that we do have art in our community that represents the truth, represents our values, represents our history, and points our way forward.”Stevenson, a civil rights lawyer, believes that reclaiming the narrative in public spaces can challenge the racist narratives embedded into some Americans’ mindset.When he first started working in public art, there were 59 markers and monuments honoring the Confederacy in his state yet none paid tribute to Alabama’s history of being the state with one of the largest slave populations, so he and his team worked to create plaques in public spaces that honored those who were enslaved.View image in fullscreenA memorial to lynching victims at the Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesHe refers to the process of reframing public conversation as narrative work, responding to the racist views long perpetuated by institutions. With the building and taking down of monuments, he suggests that we need a new framework to tell the full story of American history as a nation.“I think we have to find a better way to help people in this country recognize that there’s a place for people of African descent in this country and that our stories can’t be denied any longer,” Stevenson says.Bagwell also emphasizes the importance of honoring African Americans’ vital contributions to American society through public art. “It’s just stunning that we have made so much out of so little,” she says. “The contributions we’ve made to this country are phenomenal, and they should be remembered because we are very much a part of what made America great in the first place.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designBlack US cultureDesignSculptureArtUS politicsTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If passed, the ban would become law, making it illegal to become a member of the group or invite support for it, with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.Since Tuesday, the documentary about their activities has been downloaded by people all over the world, but its directors have been scrambling to take legal advice and fear they will end up being in breach of counter-terror laws if they continue distributing it.Showings of the film have been lined up across Britain in the coming days and weeks – from gatherings in homes through to screenings at cinemas – but there are now doubts about what proscription will mean for this too.Its London-based directors, Hannan Majid and Richard York, said they were concerned that Britain could end up being the only country in the world where people would not be able to see the film.“We’ve operated around the world and have a lot of experience of regimes telling us what we can and can’t do. We’ve had authorities in Bangladesh telling us we shouldn’t even be editing footage of garment workers and activists advocating for their rights, and we’ve been followed by the police in Cambodia, but we have never encountered anything like this in Britain,” said Majid.He and York have been working together since 2006 through their production company, Rainbow Collective, on documentaries that focus on human rights and have collaborated with organisations including Amnesty International.To Kill a War Machine was the product of more than six months of work and was made independently of Palestine Action, while using real-time bodycam and phone footage that the group had put into the public domain.Activists are shown smashing and occupying weapons factories in the UK and explaining their motivation for actions they view as legitimate to take in the face of alleged war crimes in Gaza. There are interviews with two activists from Palestine Action, Sohail Sultan and Joe Irving, both of whom were acquitted of charges of causing criminal damage.However, the move to proscribe Palestine Action means there are now question marks over ​the documentary ​a​nd events including a London premiere on 18 July.“We set out to make this film in a completely legitimate and legal manner, as we have done with other films. It’s been certified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) and it is good to go but now we are being advised that the curtailing of Palestine Action could have a major knock-on effect for us as it could become not only illegal for others to voice support for them but also for us, as film-makers, to distribute this film,” said York.“People are still excited and there has been a tremendous outpouring of support on social media. Hopefully we can still go ahead with much of our plans, but we have had to rush things forward and do the digital release this week rather than waiting for September and try to build on the awards we have already picked up. That all changed on Monday night and there has been a spike as soon as we put it online,” said Majid.The film-makers are having discussions with distributors in the UK and the US but are alive to the risks.“On the basis of some of our legal advice, we may not even be able to distribute it in other countries and territories if the film is seen as being somehow in support of a group which is proscribed. We are still hoping to be able to show it in cinemas within the law,” said York.They are also considering whether they will have to withdraw submissions for a range of international film festivals. It is part of the Zanzibar international film festival this week.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsProtestUK security and counter-terrorismIsrael-Gaza warCensorshipnewsShareReuse this content"

On the back was a lengthy description of the soldiers that included “their antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.”Images of the shirt and videos of the performance are also featured on Beyoncé’s website.As she prepared to return to the US for performances in her home town this weekend, fans and Indigenous influencers took to social media to criticize Beyoncé for wearing a shirt that framesNative Americansand Mexican revolutionaries as anything but the victims of American imperialism – and for promoting anti-Indigenous language.View image in fullscreenArtifacts are displayed inside the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston, Texas.Photograph: Ashley Landis/APSeveral Native influencers, performers and academics took to social media this week to criticize Beyoncé or decry the shirt’s language as anti-Indigenous. “Do you think Beyoncé will apologize (or acknowledge) the shirt?” indigenous.tv, an Indigenous news and culture Instagram account with more than 130,000 followers, asked in a post on Thursday.Many of her critics, as well as fans, agree. A flood of social media posts called out the pop star for the historic framing on the shirt.“We have to be honest about what they did, especially in their operations against Indigenous Americans and Mexicans,” said Chisom Okorafor, who posts on TikTok under the handle @confirmedsomaya.A spokesperson for Beyoncé did not respond to a request for comment.The Buffalo Soldiers served in six military units created after the US civil war in 1866. They were comprised of formerly enslaved men, freemen, and Black civil war soldiers and fought in hundreds of conflicts – including in the Spanish-American war as well as the first and second world wars – until their 1951 disbanding.As the quote on Beyoncé’s shirt notes, they also fought numerous battles against Indigenous peoples as part of the US army’s campaign of violence and land theft during the country’s westward expansion.Some historians say the moniker “Buffalo Soldiers” was bestowed by the tribes who admired the bravery and tenacity of the fighters – but that might be more legend than fact, said Cale Carter, the director of exhibitions at the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston.Carter and other museum staff said that, only in the past few years, the museum made broader efforts to include more of the complexities of the battles the Buffalo Soldiers fought against Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries – and the role they played in the subjugation of Indigenous peoples. They, much like many other museums across the country, are hoping to add more nuance to the framing of American history and be more respectful of the ways they have caused harm to Indigenous communities amid political pressure on schools to avoid honest discussions about the US’s past.View image in fullscreenThe Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston, Texas.Photograph: Ashley Landis/APSimultaneously, Beyoncé’s recent albumAct II: Cowboy Carterhas played on a kind of American iconography, which many see as her way of subverting the country music genre’s adjacency to whiteness and reclaiming the cowboy aesthetic for Black Americans. Last year, she became the first Black woman ever to top Billboard’s country music chart, and Cowboy Carter won her the top prize at the2025 Grammy awards, album of the year.But Tad Stoermer, a Johns Hopkins University professor and historian, also points out that the Buffalo Soldiers have been framed in the American story in a way that also plays into the myths of American nationalism.As Beyoncé’s use of Buffalo Soldiers imagery implies, Black Americans also use their story to claim agency over their role in the creation of the country, said Alaina E Roberts, a historian, author and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies the intersection of Black and Native American life from the civil war to present day.The problem, she said, is the Buffalo Soldiers “were literally involved in not just the settlement of the [US] West but of genocide in a sense”.Okorafor said there is no “progressive” way to reclaim the US’s history of empire building in the west – and that Beyoncé’s use of Western symbolism conveys the message that “Black people, too, can engage in American nationalism.”“It is a message that tells you to abandon immigrants, Indigenous people, and people who live outside … the United States,” she said. “It is a message that tells you not only is it a virtue to have been born in this country – but the longer your line extends in this country, the more virtuous you are.”Explore more on these topicsBeyoncéUS militaryUS politicsNative AmericansnewsShareReuse this content"

She has regularly been on display for the two centuries since. In that time, we have also changed as a museum and are thinking more about how we care for people.”The story of Asru’s body is one of several that show how the development of the UK museum sectorbenefited from colonialism and transatlantic slavery, at a time when the ethics of displaying human bodies and spoils from imperial expansion are being questioned.In March a report by MPs from theall-party parliamentary group for Afrikan reparationscalled for bans on selling ancestral remains and publicly displaying them without consent.Asru’s finely decorated wooden coffin reveals a few biographical details. An affluent woman who was about 60 when she died, her father was called Pa-Kush, which means “the Kushite”, a Black man from modern-day Sudan. Pa-Kush worked as a scribe, a high-status role, whenEgypt had Kushite pharaohs. Asru’s name means “her arm is against them”.In the 19th century, Asru’s sarcophagus was acquired by Robert and William Garnett, the sons of a former trader in enslaved African people, who had followed him into the cotton industry, research by one of the museum’s curators, Campbell Price, found. The Garnetts donated Asru’s body to the Manchester Natural History Society, the forerunner to Manchester Museum.Alongside the Asru consultation, the museum has launched its Decolonise! Trail , named after the initiative in arts and culture that is being used to challenge stereotypical perspectives linked to empire and colonialism.The trail links displays of items from Africa and Asia, subverting traditional “Eurocentric” narratives about them through artworks newly displayed alongside them.It is supported by a booklet that asks questions such as “Should a desire for knowledge override the wishes of ancient cultures?”, “Do you know where the minerals in your technology come from?” and “What is climate justice?”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It features a 1928 quote from the then UK home secretary, William Joynson-Hicks, who, speaking of India as a major export market for “Lancashire cotton goods”, said: “We did not conquer India for the benefit of the Indians … We conquered India as an outlet for the goods of Britain. We conquered India by the sword, and by the sword we shall hold it.”Chloe Cousins, Manchester Museum’s social justice manager, who created the trail, said: “The trail is new but the concept of decolonising isn’t new to Manchester Museum at all.

The academically gifted Perales, who was eight years old at the time, argued that the rule excluding under-18s from democracy, which isenshrinedin the US constitution, amounted to age discrimination.Her case was thrown out, but it wasn’t the first time the voting age was challenged and it won’t be the last. The issue of whether the limit should be removed entirely has been raised periodically since at least the 19th century, and the ageless voting movement has been gaining momentum since political philosopher John Wall wrote amanifestofor it in 2021. More recently, children’s author and education researcher Clémentine Beauvais published a shorttractin her native France making the case for it.Both Wall and Beauvais report that a common first reaction to the concept of ageless voting is laughter. Then people start to think, and often they end up saying that they can’t find any serious objections.Wall first confronted the question 20 years ago, when he took on a PhD student who had been researchingchildren’s parliamentsin India. He soon came round to the idea that it was unjust that up to a third of the population was excluded from the democratic process, since political decisions affected them, too. As he became better informed, he realised that excluding the young was bad for society as a whole.Beauvais agrees. In her tract she highlights evidence that larger electorates produce better decisions. Younger people’s gaze is fixed further in the future than that of older people, for obvious reasons, but older people have more experience, so they complement each other when it comes to prioritising societal issues. And children are observant and can ask questions that are troubling because they are so fundamental: questions about war, meat, money, love and death, for instance. When Greta Thunberg started campaigning for urgent climate action at the age of 15, Beauvais writes, many adults criticised her, but her position is now mainstream.Children can also be silly and naive, of course. But if silliness and naivety were reasons to deprive people of the vote, many adults would come a cropper. In fact, although the human brain takes years to mature, it hasn’tcompletedthat process by 16, 18, or even – for some parts of the brain – the early 30s. And however you define competence to vote, you’ll find that it doesn’t start or stop cleanly at any age.This line of thought led Wall to conclude that the only criterion for eligibility to vote should be wanting to vote. Again, Beauvais agrees. But they disagree on the practical implications of this. Wall assumes that wanting to vote is the default and proposes that someone else should vote for the young person by proxy until they are able to do so themselves – as already happens for certain categories of adult in many countries, including the cognitively impaired. Most often, the proxy voter in the case of a very young person would be a parent.Beauvais considers proxies risky – what if a five-year-old changed her mind and her parents refused? – and also difficult to implement, for example in the case of divorced parents. She would rather societies accepted that, though a person would have the right to vote from birth, it would be some time before they exercised it. In that time – the length of which would depend on the individual – the right would be purely symbolic. It would still mean something, just as it means something that everyone in the UK has the right to marry a person of the same sex even if many of them will never exercise it.Acommon objection to ageless voting is that individuals who can’t be trusted to drink, drive or have sex shouldn’t be trusted to vote. But Harry Pearse, research director at the Centre for Deliberation, part of the UK’s National Centre for Social Research in London, says that’s ared herring. We don’t allow the very young to indulge in those behaviours because we want to protect them from the potentially harmful consequences, but voting isn’t harmful to the voter. It’s not as if we’re asking babies to make policy. They may vote badly, whatever that means, but again, so do many adults.Some countries, including Scotland, already allow 16-year-olds to vote, so data exists on16-year-olds’ voting habits. Five-year-olds are an unknown quantity, on the other hand, and Pearse thinks that’s a good thing: “Some healthy chaos gets chucked into the system.” For him, the beauty of democracy – for all its flaws – is its simplicity. When the rule is one-person-one-vote, politicians feel pressure to serve all constituencies.In practice, Beauvais says, because we know so little about how the very young would vote, the voting age would probably have to be lowered incrementally. That way society could address any vulnerabilities the new regime exposed – the risk of a charismatic teacher capturing large numbers of young votes for a given political cause, say – before advancing to the next stage. The goal would still be to abolish the age threshold completely.Many people feel that modern democracies have become calcified. In the past, when that happened, societies sought to expand the franchise, and in time, Pearse says, the expansion reinvigorated democratic life. At this point in history, the only way we can expand, short of violating the species barrier, is downwards in age. Beauvais sees that as much more than a political project. It invites us to stop thinking about participation in terms of competence or productivity, she says, and to focus more on our lived experience and interdependence. It’s about what it means to be an individual in society. In her view, we should all want Alisa Perales to vote – and not just for her sake.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He lays out his argument in Through It All Together, which is at once a paean to his football club, a contention that fandom is a glue that binds with more ferocity than a Norman Hunter tackle, and an appeal for the deification of the manager who led Leedsback into the Premier Leaguein 2020.Where Liverpool had Bill Shankly – recently given his own moment in the stage spotlight in the moving and epicRed or Dead– the Whites had Marcelo Bielsa, or El Loco as O’Connor reminds us, the nickname with which the Argentinian arrived at Elland Road.

The Polish-born film-maker, though, hasmaintained that it was not just a political critiquebut a universal portrait of lone, dispossessed motherhood.This stage adaptation, written by Natalia Fiedorczuk and directed by Anna Smolar, tests that thesis – and in some was proves it – by lifting the story out of its original sociopolitical context and transposing it to a modern-dayPolandof online abuses, zero hours contracts and today’s lone parenting culture.Irena (Anna Ilczuk) is failed by all around her, even those presuming to be on her side. She is desperately poor, and has to care for her nine-year-old son Boguś (Ryfa Ri) while they face eviction. Her world is filled with well-to-do parents who judge her at the school gates – one of whom is also her bullying landlady – and liberal leftie teachers who perform acts of charitable solidarity but condemn Irena’s parenting style and problematise her son’s behaviour. Boguś’s estranged father is part of the story for his refusal to pay child support, as is Irena’s abrasive mother, who grudgingly puts Irena up after she is evicted.Despite the potent subject matter, it all seems skimmed across, with a plethora of plotlines and an examination of motherhood that does not penetrate beyond familiar ideas of responsibility overload and the desire for escape. The expressive elements of the production create a languorousness at their best, but the tone flattens as it goes on, and emotion is subsumed by meta-theatrical tics that are better in idea than effect (such as one elaborate scene in which two mothers put on VR headsets to access an alternate reality that offers escape from the tyranny of parenting).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Karolina JozwiakWhere Holland’s film is arresting in its matter-of-fact horrors, the hardships here are spoken of, or rapped into mics, in laboured lyricism. Or perhaps something is lost in translation with the Polish-to-English surtitles?Originally staged at Teatr Powszechny in Warsaw, and co-produced by the Malta festival in Poznań, it is an example of post-dramatic theatre, which is intent on deconstructing theatrical convention. What seems refreshing at first spirals into artifice. An ensemble of actors initially gather in a semi-circle before emphatically constructing scenes. Irena narrates an endless shopping list of tasks, which is striking at first but begins to sound like a stylistic flourish. Irena’s disabled lover Jacek (Oskar Stoczyński), who sits at the heart of the film, is tangential here, both in action and emotion. Perhaps this is to give Irena an even greater sense of aloneness, but it means the story is filled with incident yet devoid of an emotional core.Some scenes jar, such as the one involving a series of phone calls between Irena and an actor who changes roles numerous times while they sit next to each other on a sofa. It seems little more than a game for the actors, and leaves you confused as to who is whom.View image in fullscreenHeavy symbolism … a Damoclean boulder in A Woman Alone.Photograph: Karolina JozwiakIt all becomes confounding as the narrative travels between Boguś’s absent father, figures from his school, and the rather purposeless presence of Jacek. All the while, Boguś expresses himself in a repetitive and mannered dance, occasionally rapping, although his interiority remains largely unknown.‘Making this film was forbidden’: how Agnieszka Holland’s migrant thriller inflamed the Polish rightRead moreThe drama seriously falters when Irena stages a Pulp Fiction-style hold-up, exploding into anger at figures from her son’s school. What follows does not re-enact the shock of the film’s ending but gives us a paler alternative.A stone boulder hangs over a corner of Anna Met’sset design – to represent the Damoclean weight dangling above Irena, perhaps? Again, this feels like laboured symbolism. It is a shame because the production begins with such freshness. Jan Duszyński’s sound design is exciting and there is power to the earlier scenes. But it spins in too many directions, ponderous and unwieldy in its portrait of a lone woman trapped in capitalist consumerism, which is no less blind to her suffering than Holland’s original communist state.Explore more on these topicsTheatrePolandPovertyreviewsShareReuse this content"

A defunct MiG-21 fighter jet that recently arrived at Seattle’s Museum of Flight is not most planes.While many decommissioned vessels collect rust, the Soviet-designed aircraft is blanketed from top to bottom, inside and out, in tens of millions of glass beads that explode in a riot of color.Titled The MiG-21 Project,the work belongs to South African artist and filmmaker Ralph Ziman, and stands out among heavyweights like the Dreamliner and the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 on display at the museum’s colossal exhibition site. The vessel’s sharp silhouette is softened by the beadwork’s geometric patterns and shiny finish, which outfit every part of the small-yet-ferocious aluminum body and cockpit of the plane, except for the nose cone and afterburner.Ziman has spent the last 12 years covering decommissioned weapons of war such as AK-47 assault rifles with brightly hued beads for his project titled Weapons of Mass Production. The kaleidoscopic airplane, Ziman’s final work in the series, is the result of a five-year collaboration between the artist and roughly 100 craftspeople based in Johannesburg.View image in fullscreenNdebele artisans Sophie Masombuka, Thenjiwe Pretty Chinedo and Poulinah Mahlangu from Anointed Hands working on beaded panels for the MiG-21 Project.Photograph: Nic HofmeyrThe jet found Ziman through a logistical partner who informed him about a group of Polish air force MiGs left to rot in a Florida warehouse. “They often use these jets for stress-testing the pilots but this one didn’t have any combat record, so the US military contractor decided they wouldn’t use them,” he says.Ziman, who was already in search of the right jet to dress in beads, couldn’t let this one wallow on the runway any longer. “It was being rained on for I don’t know how many years,” says the artist about his cold war-era find, which he shipped cross-country on a flatbed truck to his Los Angeles studio in 2019.Around 12,000 MiG-21 jets were produced during its 70-year history, making it one of the most-used fighter jets of the 20th century. They are in fact still in service in countries such as India and Pakistan. The warplane played a grim role in combat, from 1967’s six-day war in the Middle East to the Croatian war of independence in the 90s. Ziman’s urge to repurpose military gear was fueled by more recent uproars, particularly the Black Lives Matter protests. Seeing white cops in the US sitting on Casspirs, he says, referencing a commonly used police vehicle in South Africa, especially in the 1980s and the 90s, “made me go out and talk about militarization of police forces even more”.Long fascinated by airplanes as well as Afrofuturism, Ziman says his project reflects his trust in beauty to initiate conversation about heavy topics.View image in fullscreenRalph Ziman.Photograph: Simone Niamani“When you cover a weapon or a warplane with beads, the public, especially young people, can see them with a new perspective and become interested in talking about what they actually mean,” he says.The aircraft’s role in South African apartheid particularly intrigued the 62-year-old. During the Angolan civil war in 1976, Cuba – which had made a pact with the MPLA (the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola) – gained the upper hand through a group of MiG planes gifted by Russia. As a result, South Africa, which supported the opponent Unita (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), withdrew from the war. The MPLA’s victory prompted South Africa to reconsider its position on the continent, helping to hasten the end of apartheid. “I have always been amazed by this parallel,” adds Ziman.The eye-catching geometric emblems reflect craft traditions across the African continent, particularly in Zimbabwe and South Africa’s Mpumalanga province, where Ziman’s collaborators hail from. Ziman, however, omitted any direct reference to a singular regional ornament tradition such as Zulu or Ndebele, and rather opted for what he calls an “eclectic pan-African feel”. The overall effect is one of communal celebration of the motifs commonly seen across the continent in beads, murals and paintings.The intercontinental project was both laborious and logistically challenging, requiring Ziman’s team in Los Angeles to send casts of the plane’s parts, such as the leading edge of the wing or the rivets, to Johannesburg as templates for the craftspeople to weave their motifs, with most of the beadwork taking place during the pandemic lockdowns.Among those spearheading the work on the South African side was Thenjiwe Pretty Nkogatsi, the founder of Johannesburg’s women-run collective Anointed Hands, which promotes the long history of the Ndebele tribe’s recognizable and intricately formed arts-and-craft tradition, which has been passed down for generations. Nkogatsi oversaw the project’s leg in Mpumalanga, driving around the remote parts of the region for five years and commissioning craftswomen to adorn Ziman’s templates. “Different techniques stem from different subcultures and families, and we had to be able to master all in order to make the vision come to pass,” she said via email.View image in fullscreenThe embellishing of the cockpit in process.Photograph: Nick BonamyShe considers beadwork a way to “break down cultural elements into smaller elements that we can incorporate into our day-to-day. They serve as a refreshed reminder of who we are and our potential of where we are headed.”As the vessel crescendoes Ziman’s 12-year-long beading project, he admits: “[I] hate finishing things because I can no longer improve them.” He hopes, however, at a time whenconflicts are sweeping the world, the project will offer visitors an alternative outlook and inspiration to consider ways to take part in the discourse.To that end, a portion of the proceeds from the beaded plane’s potential sale will benefit a charity organization that works with Ukrainian children for art therapy. “We will basically use this plane initially created by Russians during the Soviet Union to help some of the war victims in Ukraine,” he says. “The work is already even more relevant now than when we started working on it only five years ago.”Ralph Ziman’s The MiG-21 Project is open at the Museum of Flight in Seattle through 26 January 2026Explore more on these topicsArtSeattleWashington stateWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Husband-and-wife team Ben and Bo Humphreys have brought their joint skills to the Edinburgh Castle, an elegantly restored 19th-century pub with an upstairs restaurant that in recent years has made quite a name for itself; before the Humphreys’ arrival, this same space was the lair ofWinsome’s Shaun Moffat, where plaudits and gongs were in ready supply, but then Moffat got his hands on his own place and this upstairs room needed a pair of cool, capable hands to take over.Look no further than Ben and Bo, who have a pedigree in forward-thinking Thai cuisine. Bo was born and raised in Thailand’s north-easternIsaanregion, before moving to Bangkok in her teens, while Ben has cooked at Manchester’s Thai fusion restaurantDistrictand, before that, atTattu,Rabbit in the MoonandLucky Cat. After the closure of District in 2022, the couple spent three years eating their way across Thailand and the US, picking up inspiration for dishes in which authentic Thai flavours, and occasionally Bo’s family-favourite recipes, could merge with the Korean and Mexican barbecue flavours of Miami smokehouses. Here, heat, citrus, fresh turmeric, shrimp paste and all the complexities of Bangkok cuisine meet relatively sleepy, low-and-slow American barbecue.View image in fullscreen‘A highlight’: Bangkok Diners Club’s artichoke and golden beetroot massaman curry with ‘decadently good chicken-fat rice’.Yes, many chefs in Bangkok do indeed cook over live fire, but the flames there are generally a little more lively than those permitted in this tiny kitchen of a wooden-floored pub in north-west England. And when Bangkok meets Manchester via Miami, you get the likes of pork jowl taco with a rich, smoky, burnt-tomatojaew, and southern Thai muttongaeng khuathat’s hot with black pepper and dried red chilli, and served with pickled celeriac and fresh roti.Bangkok Diners Club claims to be new and innovative, as, let’s face it, every new restaurant does, but they actually have a valid point here. This small kitchen slinging out raw bass with silky calamansinam jimand rice bran to a tiny collection of tables is a very long way away from the traditional timeworn Thai scene in the UK, where pad thais and green curries are dished up on a table featuring a golden statuette of Buddha from Dunelm. That said, the place is also a long way from that purposefully edgy UK-Thai cooking I’ve suffered at many a hip British Bangkok-led establishment, always with an English chef and where the dishes turn up as and when, with each one hotter, grittier, twiggier and less moreish than the last.View image in fullscreen‘A long way from the traditional UK Thai scene’: raw bass, calamansinam jimand rice bran at Manchester’s Bangkok Diners Club.The Humphreys’ restaurant, on the other hand, is authentic, boundary-pushing, a little odd – and also makes perfect sense. Smoked mackerel with jet-black charred skin comes on a salad of fresh grapefruit and ginger, followed by anam toksalad that’s heavy with thick slices of salt-aged beef and comes with bone marrow aïoli. Bo serves us, taking delight in the fact that I’ve brought my brother for his birthday and he’s ready to eat. She’s keen we try the battered pickled onion rings with curry salt and the grilled chicken skewers made heavenly with milk caramel.Artichoke and golden beetroot massaman curry – heavy on the cardamom, cinnamon and star anise – is a highlight for me, and comes with decadently good chicken-fat rice, while the roast pork bellyphat phetwith rhubarb stir-fry is also a huge hit. We order steamed broccoli with funky, fermented yellow beans to hit our vitamin quota, and pick our way through a papaya salad made more meaningful by the addition of shrimp floss.View image in fullscreen‘Simple, fun’: Bangkok Diners Club’s lolly of rice ice-cream.This is a cracking little progressive, family-run place that has hit the ground running and will no doubt soon be one of Manchester’s hottest dining tickets. It has a small menu that has totted up many air miles in its making, and a big, generous heart. That evening’s menu was the first to feature a Bangkok Diners Club dessert in the shape of an ice lolly-shaped mass of rice ice-cream with a Jackson Pollock-esque topping of zinging fruit sauces. Simple, fun and just enough to send us off out into Saturday night Manchester with a spring in our step and deep intentions to come back.When so many far-afield cuisines collide, I don’t usually expect the middle ground to be some battered pickled onion rings, but this is Manchester, and that’s bizarrely, beautifully fitting.Bangkok Diners ClubThe Edinburgh Castle, Blossom Street, Manchester M4, 0161-414 0004.
