We stand by Ukraine. We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor.“Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”Addressing Zelenskyy directly, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, wrote: “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone.”She added: “We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.”8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – videoThe British prime minister, Keir Starmer, who just a day beforehad visited Trump at the White House, called Zelenskyy to express his support, a No 10 spokesperson said.Starmer – who failed in his effort to convince Trump to commit US support for a European-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine – told Zelenskyy that “he retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace, based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine”, the official said.Two days after his own meeting with Trump in Washington the French president, Emmanuel Macron, responded indirectly to the US president’s baseless claims that Zelenskyy was responsible for the war, telling reporters: “Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people … These are simple things, but they’re good to remember at times like these.”European leaders had already been shaken byVance’s speech to the Munich security conferencetwo weeks ago in which he lectured them about the state of their democracy.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, called for an emergency meeting between the US, Europe and Ukraine.“A summit without delay is needed between the United States, European states and their allies to talk frankly about how we intend to tackle today’s major challenges, starting with Ukraine, which together we have defended in recent years,” Meloni said in a statement.Jonas Gahr Støre, Norway’s prime minister, described the episode as “serious and disheartening”.“That Trump accuses Zelenskyy of gambling with world war three is deeply unreasonable and a statement I distance myself from,” he said.The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said his country would stand by Ukraine after the row.Sánchez, a staunch backer of Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion who pledged €1bn of aid in a visit to Kyiv earlier this week, wrote on X: “Ukraine, Spain stands with you.”Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, was among the first to show his support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine on social media, telling them: “You are not alone.”The outgoing German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, Luxembourg’s prime minister, Luc Frieden, and Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, also professed their support for Ukraine, along with other leaders from Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Sweden.Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ukraine’s fight against Russia is a defense of democracy.“Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine. For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all,” he posted on X.“Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine,” Trudeau added.Some world leaders, however, sided with Trump.Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, wrote on X: “Strong men make peace, weak men make war.“Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!”Orbán, an outspoken critic of western aid to Ukraine,has been at odds with other Nato countriesover Orbán’s continued cultivation of close ties to Russia.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Sure. And as they slipped into the icy depths, the captain of the Titanic probably assured his passengers that this would make a great movie some day.Trump on Friday presided over one of the greatest diplomatic disasters in modern history. Tempers flared, voices were raised and protocol was shredded in the once-hallowed Oval Office.As Trump got into a shouting match with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy,a horrified Europe watched the post-second world war order crumble before its eyes.Never has a US president bullied and berated an adversary, still less an ally, in such a public way. Of course the reality TV star and wrestling fan turned US president had it all play out on television for the benefit of his populist support base – and a certain bare-chested chum in the Kremlin.‘Dummies for Putin’: Democrats defend Zelenskyy after ‘shameful’ Trump meetingRead moreZelenskyy came to the White House to sign a deal for US involvement in Ukraine’s mineral industry to pave the way for an end to the three-year war. The president has inspired many by refusing to flee Kyiv whenRussialaunched its invasion – “I need ammunition, not a ride” – delivering nightly addresses to rally his people and visiting his troops on the frontlines.But Trump, a profile in courage who dodged military service in Vietnam because of alleged bone spurs and who hid in the White House during the 6 January 2021 riot, has reportedly described soldiers who die in combat as suckers and losers. He was impeached fortrying to strong-arm Zelenskyyin 2019 and last week called him a dictator.There was a hint of trouble to come when Zelenskyy arrived at the West Wing wearing a dark, long-sleeved shirt – not a suit – and Trump greeted him with a handshake and sarcasm: “Wow, look, you’re all dressed up!”Inside the Oval Office, which has seen much but never anything quite like this, Zelenskyy thanked Trump for the invitation. At first all was sweetness and light as they fielded questions from reporters.There was a minor wrinkle over how much Europe support has given Ukraine, which ended with smiles, a playful but pointed tap on Zelenskyy, and ominous words from Trump: “Don’t argue with me.”But the last 10 minutes of the nearly 45-minute meeting devolved into acrimony and chaos. Zelenskyy found himself ambushed by Trump and his serpentine vice-president,JD Vance. He was expected to sit back and take a beating from Nurse Ratched and Miss Trunchbull. He refused.Exuding preternatural obnoxiousness,Vance said Joe Biden’s approach had failed and that diplomacy was the way forward. Noting Russia’s betrayals of trust in the past, Zelenskyy challenged: “What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?”Vance, who once declared he didn’t care what happened in Ukraine, was riled. Finger jabbing, he lectured Zelenskyy: “I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media ... You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.”Uh-oh. The politicians and journalists in the room could surely tell this was going off the rails. At one point the Ukrainian ambassador would put her head in her hands. She was all of us.Zelenskyy tried to push back, asking if Vance had ever been to Ukraine. Vance got angry and spoke of “propaganda tours”. Zelenskyy tried to answer and suggest that the US could feel threatened by Russia some day. Trump interjected: “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.”The men spoke over each other. Raising his voice, the US president said: “You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now.”Zelenskyy responded: “I’m not playing cards. I’m very serious, Mr President. I’m the president in a war.”Trump, pointing an accusing finger and descending into his worst self from the presidential debates, admonished: “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.”TV pro tip: Trump has spent so many campaign rallies warning about world war three that the phrase has lost its shock value.Trump and Vance tried to scold Zelenskyy like an ungrateful child. Vance –who recently went to Munichto condemn Europe as being on the wrong side in the culture wars – demanded: “Have you said ‘thank you’ once this entire meeting? No.”Zelenskyy tried to respond. Trump told him his country was in big trouble. He went on: “The problem is I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States and your people are very brave. But, you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out.“And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty … But you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing.”How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless ally!Zelenskyy looked shellshocked. Trump, the eternal showman, commented on what great TV it would be, then wrote on social media that Zelenskyy “disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office”.No deal was done. A planned press conference was cancelled. Zelenskyy drove away empty-handed, having just endured his own diplomatic Chornobyl. As for the rest of Europe, a bust of Winston Churchill, looming over the shoulders of Trump and Vance, may have shed a tear or two.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe US politics sketchTrump administrationJD VanceUS politicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a cabinet meeting, several spoke of the risk of unintended consequences.David Lammy, the foreign secretary,said earlier this monththat the US’s plan to cut aid funding could be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence. Starmer has been accused of pandering to the US president.Dodds, the MP for Oxford East, said she was told about the decision by Starmer only on Monday, but delayed resigning so as not to overshadow the prime minister’s trip to Washington to make the case to Trump for security guarantees for Ukraine.Starmer made his surprise announcement in the Commons, telling MPs that Britain would “fight for peace in Europe” with a generational increase in defence spending.The announcement, two days before the prime minister was due to meet Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was following the US’s lead and promptedfury from aid groups, who said it could cost lives in countries that relied on UK support.Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army, said thedecision to cut foreign aid was a “strategic mistake”that would ultimately add to the burden on Britain’s armed forces, and risked making the UK “weaker not stronger”.Dodds, in her letter to the prime minister, wrote: “Undoubtedly the postwar global order has come crashing down. I believe that we must increase spending on defence as a result; and know that there are no easy paths to doing so.“I stood ready to work with you to deliver that increased spending, knowing some might well have had to come from overseas development assistance [ODA]. I also expected we would collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, as other nations are doing.“Even 3% may only be the start, and it will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country’s security cannot be ducked.”Labour’s aid cuts are morally wrong. Here’s why they make no economic sense either | Larry ElliottRead moreDodds, who was also a minister for women, was sceptical about Starmer’s promise to maintain aid funding for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, as well as for vaccination, climate and rules-based systems.Officials have said that the portion of the development budget going on asylum-seeker accommodation – which stands at almost a third – would eventually be freed up for aid.But Dodds wrote: “It will be impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut; the effect will be far greater than presented, even if assumptions made about reducing asylum costs hold true.”She cautioned about the effect on Britain’s national security and global influence as hostile countries moved into the breach.“The cut will also likely lead to a UK pullout from numerous African, Caribbean and western Balkan nations at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence,” she said. “All this while China is seeking to rewrite global rules, and when the climate crisis is the biggest security threat of them all.“Ultimately, these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people – deeply harming the UK’s reputation. I know you have been clear that you are not ideologically opposed to international development. But the reality is that this decision is already being portrayed as following in President Trump’s slipstream of cuts to USAid.”In reply, Starmer wrote: “Overseas development is vitally important, and I am proud of what we have done. The UK will still be providing significant humanitarian and development support, and we will continue to protect vital programmes – including in the world’s worst conflict zones of Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.“The decision I have taken on ODA was a difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly. We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and to rebuild a capability on development.“However, protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government and I will always act in the best interests of the British people.”Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the Commons international development committee, posted on X: “What else could she do? She knows these cuts are unworkable. Honourable as always, she’s done right by her department and right by the PM by not resigning before DC visit. Deep shame for development where she was respected.”The Conservative former aid secretary Andrew Mitchell said Dodds had “done the right thing” by resigning, adding: “Labour’s disgraceful and cynical actions demean the Labour party’s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world. Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle.”Romilly Greenhill, the chief executive of Bond, the umbrella organisation for aid charities, said: “This will be a huge loss. It is clear from the devastating UK aid cuts announced this week, which must be reversed, that the government is trying to step back from its development ambitions.”Explore more on these topicsAnneliese DoddsAidKeir StarmerLabourDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands who could not get to the area due to packed metro trains instead vented their anger outside stations in the capital’s suburbs.View image in fullscreenParis Economou, 27, at the mass protest in Athens on FridayPhotograph: Helena Smith/The GuardianThe huge crowds in Athens and elsewhere reflected multiple opinion polls indicating that most Greeks believed officials concealed vital evidence after the crash, slowing down an investigation that is still incomplete.“I think all of us wanted to say: ‘You have to take responsibility,’” said 27-year-old Paris Economou, a drama student who attended the Athens demonstration.“Young people like me needlessly lost their lives,” he said. “And it boils down to this: either the state is so inadequate it can’t run a modern railway system, or we should believe the conspiracy theories and everything they say about a cover-up. One or the other is true.”As Economou spoke, the crowd dispersed as the otherwise peaceful protest was eclipsed by the eruption of violence between rock-throwing youths and riot police firing teargas. A young woman dressed in black, her head covered with a headscarf, stopped to show the cardboard placard she was carrying, which bore the message: “It was state murder.”View image in fullscreenA demonstrator is held during clashes at the protest.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/ReutersOn the night of 28 February 2023 two trains collided in the gorge of Tempe in central Greece: an intercity Thessaloniki-bound passenger train that had set off from Athens crammed with students, and a freight train that was moving north to south. The head-on collision was of such ferocity that the front carriages of the two locomotives exploded into a fireball that instantly incinerated several of the victims. The remains of many were never found.Questions over what the cargo train was carrying has fuelled much of the public outrage. This week, a 178-page report, released by an independent investigative committee, did not exclude its wagons containing highly flammable chemicals, citing “the possible presence” of an “unknown fuel” at the site of the crash.The relatives of the victims, who have spent two years trying to get to the bottom of the tragedy, have for many become potent symbols of the public desire for transparency and demand for answers.View image in fullscreenA protester holds up a sign reading: ‘It was state murder.’Photograph: Helena Smith/The GuardianPoll after poll has agreed: with a trial yet to begin and no government official ever convicted, Greeks have lost trust in public institutions and their judicial system. “That’s why today’s were the biggest protests this country has witnessed since the collapse in 1974 of the military dictatorship,” said Petros Constantinou, a prominent figure in the leftwing activist movement who had spent days marshalling support for the rallies.Not since he first won office in July 2019 has the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a former banker, confronted such unrest.Anger over the response to the crash – not least the controversial decision to rapidly clean up the site and remove debris that included vital evidence and human remains – has been exacerbated by the perceived and growing sense of a government cover-up. Within days of the crash, in a move that has yet to be fully explained, authorities rushed to gravel over and cement the area.View image in fullscreenFifty-seven people, almost all of them students, died when a busy intercity service collided head-on with a freight train on 28 February 2023.Photograph: Vaggelis Kousioras/APOn Friday the embattled leader admitted that “nothing will be as it was before”.“That night we saw the worst face of the country in the national mirror,” he wrote in an online post. “Fatal human mistakes bonded with chronic state insufficiencies and violently derailed our certainties.”Until recently, Mitsotakis has proved to be adept at handling crises – a talent that has helped reinforce a rare sense of political stability in a nation that for years was roiled by economic and social crisis.But Friday’s outpouring of dissent, with demonstrations taking place across time zones in more than 270 cities in Greece and abroad, has piled on the pressure as never before. It is pressure that will grow when the main opposition Pasok party leader, Nikos Androulakis, submits a vote of no confidence in the government next week.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the Greek parliament in Athens. There is growing distrust in public institutions and the judiciary.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/ReutersAmong those who took to the streets on Friday were a sizeable cohort of once fervent Mitsotakis supporters. They, too, are now united with opponents of the ruling New Democracy party in believing that the tragedy – and its fallout – is indicative of everything that is wrong with their country. “A lot of us are very disappointed. Tempe is just the tip of the iceberg,” said one veteran conservative who had once held a public position and preferred to go unnamed.Addressing the crowd from a podium in front of the Greek parliament, Maria Karystianou, whose daughter was killed in the disaster, and who heads the Tempe Victims Association, struck a chord that he and so many others believe.“Every day, the monster of corrupt power stands before us,” she said. “You have insulted and dishonoured our dead. The bodies and bones of our children remain unburied and hidden. You have committed the ultimate sacrilege, and you will receive what is due through the vengeance of the dead.”Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropeTrain crashesnewsShareReuse this content"

Mendoza said it was a “good assumption” that was the last day of the actor’s life.Officials had said earlier on Friday that initial autopsies had found that the actor and his wife suffered no external trauma.That means the mystery over the couple’s deaths remains unanswered.The Oscar-winning actor, who graced the silver screen for more than 60 years, and his classical pianist wife werefound deadat their home undersuspicious circumstances. Maintenance workers found the couple’s bodies at their home on Wednesday, along with one of their three German shepherd dogs, who was also found dead.Mummification: what is it and how can it occur?Read moreOfficials have cautioned that the full results of autopsies may only come in weeks.The suddenly discovered deaths have stunned movie fans around the world and sent shock waves through Hollywood and New Mexico, where the couple lived for decades.The Santa Fe International film festival organization said it was “deeply saddened”.“Not only was Gene one of the greatest actors of his generation but he and Betsy were members of our community here in Santa Fe,” a statement said.New Mexico’s state senate held a moment of silence at the state capitol in the historic city, with one lawmaker stating: “We were lucky to call him a New Mexican.”In downtown Santa Fe there were no signs of any immediate tributes visible among the traditional adobe buildings of the area, hailing or mourning the famous residents, and the streets were quiet on Friday morning under characteristic brilliant blue skies and bright sunshine.Meanwhile, the sheriff of Santa Fe county, Adan Mendoza, had also revealed that the couple had been dead for “quite a while” before they were found. The two maintenance workers who made the grim discovery said the last time they had been in touch with Hackman and Arakawa was two weeks previously.Early on Friday Mendoza told the Today Show on NBC TV that it was difficult to put a timeline on how long the couple had been dead. But he added: “It appears, several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks.”The possibility that several days might have passed before the couple’s bodies were discovered chimes with an affidavit in which a sheriff disclosed that Arakawa’s body “showed obvious signs of death, body decomposition, bloating in her face and mummification in both hands and feet”. Mummification occurs when dead tissue dries and hardens over time.The sheriff’s office has reported that when the deceased were found the front door was open, although there were no signs of foul play, and no obvious evidence of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning. But the scene was strange enough that the sheriff’s office sought a search warrant on Wednesday evening.View image in fullscreenGene Hackman with his wife Betsy Arakawa at the Golden Globes in 2003.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APHackman, 95, appeared to have fallen in an entryway, a deputy said, and a cane was found nearby.

The dead German shepherd was found in a bathroom closet.“There was no indication of a struggle,” Mendoza said. “There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed … you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.”Hackman and Arakawa appeared to have suddenly fallen to the floor and neither showed signs of blunt force trauma, an affidavit said. Mendoza said two other dogs were found alive, and that those dogs were not in a crate and were able to move freely in and out of the house by a pet door.Authorities were contacted after a worker performing pest control came across their open door but was unable to get in touch with the couple and dispatched security in the area to check on them.“I think we just found two or one deceased person[s] inside a house for purchase here,” a caller told 911. “I’m not inside the house. It’s closed. It’s locked. I can’t go in. But I see them. She’s lying face down on the floor from the window.”The caller can be heard saying: “Damn, damn, damn.”Hackman, a former marine known for his raspy voice, appeared in more than 80 films, as well as on television and the stage during a lengthy career that started in the early 1960s.View image in fullscreenThe house owned by actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa.Photograph: Roberto E Rosales/APHe earned his first Oscar nomination for his breakout role as the brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow in 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde. He was also nominated for best supporting actor in 1970 for I Never Sang for My Father.His role as Popeye Doyle, the rumpled New York detective chasing international drug dealers in director William Friedkin’s thriller The French Connection, brought him stardom and a best actor Academy Award.He also won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1992 for his role as a mean sheriff in the Clint Eastwood western Unforgiven, and was nominated for an Academy Award for his turn as an FBI agent in the 1988 historical drama Mississippi Burning.Since the 1980s, Hackman had lived near Santa Fe, a charming arts town – in 2005 it was recognized as a Unesco “creative city” with a thriving tourism industry. It has become well-known in part due to the famed artists and writers that have called it home, including George RR Martin and Cormac McCarthy.Hackman became well-established in the community, and for many decades could be seen making his way around town. Between 1997 and 2004, he served on the board of trustees for the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum. Speaking at the grand opening of the museum, hesaid: “In the 10 years I’ve lived here, I’ve been taken with the excitement and indomitable spirit of this place.”The couple lived in a gated community just outside Santa Fe.“He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,” his daughters and granddaughter said in a statement on Thursday.“We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.”Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

His doctors’ prognosis remains guarded.‘We brought him 4kg of ice-cream’: Pope Francis’s parlour shares papal favouritesRead moreA Vatican official said the breathing crisis on Friday did not last for long and that his doctors were expected to need 24-48 hours to assess how the event would affect his clinical condition.The episode came after three days in which the pontiff’s health had shown “slight” improvements, meaning his situation was no longer considered to be critical.On Wednesday, a CT scan of the pontiff’s chest “showed a normal evolution” of the inflammation in his lungs, while the “mild kidney insufficiency”, which was diagnosed on Sunday, had resolved.It is unclear how long he will remain in hospital. The Vatican said earlier on Friday that Francis would not be leading the church service on 5 March to mark the beginning of Lent.Francis was admitted to hospitalon 14 Februaryand was subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in both lungs.He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was 113.She died on Monday in New York, according to theClaims Conference, a New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.“She just was a terrific lady,” her daughter, Reha Benicassa, said by phone on Friday. “Nothing was too hard. She wasn’t fearful. She was an adventurous person. She did well.”Girone was born on 13 January 1912 in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was six, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Adolf Hitler, she said that he “came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody”.Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.“Rose was an example of fortitude but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,” Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice-president, said in a statement on Thursday. “The lessons of theHolocaustmust not die with those who endured the suffering.”Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.“This passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,” Schneider said. “The Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today’s world, to be forgotten.”Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.She was nine months pregnant living in Breslau, which is now Wrocław, Poland, when Nazis arrived to take Mannheim to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Their family had two cars, so she asked her husband to leave his keys.She said she remembers one Nazi saying: “Take that woman also.”The other Nazi responded: “She’s pregnant, leave her alone.”The next morning her father-in-law was also taken, and she was left alone with their housekeeper.After her daughter Reha was born in 1938, Girone was able to secure Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband’s release.In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only six months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bedbugs crawled through their belongings.Her father-in-law came just before the second world war started, but fell ill and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself “King of the Jews”.“They did really horrible things to people,” Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. “One of our friends got killed because he wouldn’t move fast enough.”Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors as British radios were not allowed.When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone’s mother, grandmother and other relatives in the US. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.They arrived inNew YorkCity in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.“Her theories were always, ‘Don’t sweat the small stuff,’ and ‘anything you can fix with money is not a problem,’” her daughter said. “She just had a great head on her shoulders.”Also in New York, Girone was reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his US citizenship by joining the army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was her first time seeing him in 17 years.Girone later divorced Mannheim. In 1968, she met Jack Girone, the same day her granddaughter was born. By the next year they were married. He died in 1990.When asked in 1996 for the message she would like to leave for her daughter and granddaughter, she said: “Nothing is so very bad that something good shouldn’t come out of it. No matter what it is.”Explore more on these topicsHolocaustNew YorkSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

But the experiment was abandoned after a few trials in northern Gaza.It has been revived by Cogat at a time whenIsrael is negotiating the potential start of a second phase of the January ceasefire agreement, which is supposed to include the full withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from the Gaza Strip. The Cogat plan instead involves a tightening of Israel’s grip on day-to-day life in the Palestinian territory.According to aid sources briefed on the plan, the “humanitarian hubs” themselves could be secured by private security contractors, but they would be located in areas “under full IDF control”.The only entrance toGazathrough which aid would be allowed under the plan would be the Kerem Shalom crossing, controlled by Israel. The Rafah crossing, between Egypt and Gaza, would be permanently closed.Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) allowed to operate in Gaza would have to be registered in Israel, and all staff working for them or for UN agencies would have to be vetted.As aid would only be allowed through an Israeli crossing and not through Rafah, it would make operating in Gaza all but impossible for the UN relief agency for Palestinian Refugees (Unrwa) – by far the biggest aid organisation in Gaza – which has been banned by Israel.Aid officials familiar with the Cogat briefing said the plan was presented as an established fact, with Israeli officials claiming it already had full US support and would therefore be hard for the UN to resist.The scheme envisages a Gaza in which basic necessities are distributed to approved Palestinians at limited distribution points under tight Israeli control. It makes no mention ofDonald Trump’s planfor the US to take ownership of the Gaza Strip and for the territory to be emptied of its Palestinian inhabitants.Cogat did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Its presentation of the scheme comes as Arab governments discuss their own plan for Gaza’s future. A meeting in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, of representatives from Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states on 21 February endorsedan Egyptian-designed $53bn reconstruction planlasting three to five years, starting with the establishment of safe zones of tents and mobile homes for people to live in during reconstruction.The proposal is due to be presented to an emergency summit of the Arab League on Tuesday in Cairo.“The Cogat plan is meant to be a spoiler, an alternative to the Arab plan,” an aid worker in Jerusalem said.In January 2024, theIDF carried out trialsof “humanitarian bubbles” in three areas of northern Gaza. Selected Palestinians such as community elders were to administer the distribution of food and other basic supplies, but the plan never got off the ground. It was hard to find local volunteers prepared to work with the Israelis and Hamas killed some of the local people who were co-opted into the experiment.“The bubble approach, which was rejected from the beginning of the war, has all kinds of serious implications since the Israelis will control each single supply coming in,” Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, said.Shawa said it would be an extension of the restrictive aid regime currently overseen by the IDF. Under the ceasefire, the flow of humanitarian assistance entering Gaza has reverted to its prewar level of 400 to 600 trucks a day, but Shawa says Israel has not delivered the number of tents promised, when children have been freezing to death.Unrwa reported that six infants died from exposure to cold on Monday and Tuesday this week in the Gaza Strip.Shawa said the IDF was also preventing water tankers from entering, as well as notebooks and crayons intended for the improvised school classes being taught under canvas, on the grounds that such materials were “dual use”.“They want to control the ABC of the lives of Palestinians,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Others flagged footage of a man being dismembered by a helicopter and a video where “a guy put his face into boiling oil”. Several users posted videos of their Reels feeds dominated by “sensitive content” screens that are designed to shield users from graphic material.A list of violent content on one user’s feed,published by the tech news site 404, included: a man being set on fire; a man shooting a cashier at point-blank range; videos from an account called “PeopleDeadDaily”; and a pig being beaten with a wrench. The user in question had a biking-related Instagram account, 404 Media reported.Another Reddit user wrote: “For the past 24 hours, it feels like Instagram’s algorithm has gone rogue. My feed is absolutely packed with violent Reels – like, one after the other.“It’s like Instagram is now trying to make me question if I accidentally followed a ‘bloodshed and chaos’ account. I get that the platform’s all about ‘engagement’ and ‘trending,’ but did they really think this was the way to get people to scroll more?”A spokesperson forMeta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said: “We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content on their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologise for the mistake.”The error followsrecent changes to Meta’s approach to content moderation. However, the company told 404 Media that the deluge of graphic videos was not related to theoverhaul of Meta’s content rules, which included removing factcheckers and “dramatically” reducing the amount of censorship on its platforms.Meta’scontent guidelinesstate the company will remove content that is “particularly violent or graphic” and that some imagery will be shielded by sensitive content screens. In the UK, the Online Safety Act requires social media platforms to take measures to prevent under-18s from seeing material that is harmful to them such as violent, hateful or abusive material, which will include configuring their algorithms to filter out such content.One internet safety campaign group demanded a “full explanation” of what had happened to Instagram’s algorithm.The Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the family of the UK teenager Molly Russell, who killed herself in 2017after viewing distressing content on Instagram, said questions needed to answered about why such graphic content was on the platform in the first place.“As Instagram rolls back content moderation this is likely to be a sign of things to come,” said Andy Burrows, the foundation’s chief executive. “Meta’s changes will mean this type of content is more freely available and will more often be recommended to appear in user’s feeds.”Explore more on these topicsMetaInstagramSocial mediaDigital mediaMark ZuckerbergInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

They have been updated and will be supported by a family liaison officer. I’d also like to thank the officers and paramedics who attended … and tried to save her life. Support is in place for them.“A full investigation is now well under way to establish the full circumstances of the events that led to her death.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been a tormentous time and all I want now is to readjust to what has been such an ordeal.”Explore more on these topicsDerbyEnglandTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

A fog alarm at Longships Lighthouse, just off the Cornish headland, has been going off every 13 seconds for the past week.Local people have been advised to invest in a set of earplugs while visitors heading to the tourist destination said they feared being kept awake at night.The National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) Gwennap Head, a maritime charity, said on social media that the horn had been sounding “all day, all night” and “a set of earplugs might be a good investment”.In a statement, it said: “Anyone living in the area may have noticed that, for the past six days, the Longships Lighthouse has been sounding its foghorn every 13 seconds … all day and all night.“Our watchkeeper has reported this ‘interesting’ occurrence to HM Coastguard Falmouth and they, in turn, have reported it to Trinity House. It has been fed back to us that Trinity House are aware of the problem; apparently, there is a fault in the fog sensing mechanism and they are awaiting delivery of a part to fix it.“Of course, once the part has arrived, the maintenance crew will still have to wait for calm enough weather conditions to allow them to get out to the lighthouse and install it. In the meantime, a set of earplugs might be a good investment.”Trinity House, which manages more than 60 lighthouses across the UK, said there was an issue with the “audible hazard warning signal” on Longships, whichit planned to fix.It told the BBC: “It will likely be an issue with the visibility sensor not functioning as expected. The hazard warning signal indicates diminished visibility in the area, such as fog.”David Hocking, of Land’s End Landmark, said the continuous beeping was “a bit of a talking point and conversation starter” in the area.A tourist visiting the spot told the BBC it was “the noisiest sunset I’ve seen so far”. Another said she hoped the alarm would have been “silenced” overnight. “It’s been going for a week I think. This is not normal forCornwall.”Another visitor said the alarm was “noisy”, adding that it would “probably keep me awake”, but a visitor staying nearby said they could not hear the noise from their room.The high-pitched electronic beep, which is usually only heard during foggy conditions, has gone off despite the skies having been fog free this week. The alarm can be heard most clearly at Land’s End, but residents in nearby villages including Sennen and Cape Cornwall have reported hearing it too.Longships Lighthouse was built in 1875. It is 115ft (35 metres) tall and is located about 1.25 miles (2km) off Land’s End. It was crewed by resident lighthouse-keepers until 1987, when it became automated. Since then it has been monitored and controlled by Trinity House from the company’s planning centre in Harwich, Essex.Explore more on these topicsCornwallnewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister had just landed in Washington DC and been driven straight to a glitzy reception at the UK ambassador’s opulent Edwin Lutyens-designed residence.Under the sparkling crystal chandeliers and among the grand marble columns, his euphoric host, Peter Mandelson, introduced Starmer to guests including the new FBI director, Kush Patel. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham and the New York-based editor Tina Brown were also present.“I’ve only just arrived but already I can feel there’s real buzz around Washington right now,” Starmer told the gathering. “You can sense that there’s a new leader. He’s a true one-off, a pioneer in business, in politics. Many people love him. Others love to hate him. But to us, he’s just … Peter.”But alongside the levity there was also apprehension among the prime minister’s most senior advisers at what might unfold the next day, which held probably the most consequential meeting of Starmer’s premiership, and also the most unpredictable.“We’re well prepared but also aware that absolutely anything could happen. Trump is so mercurial,” a second official said. “So it’s rather fraught.”The groundwork for the visit had been going on for some time. In May last year, David Lammy made his sixth visit to Washington since becoming shadow foreign secretary, spending several days in the US capital meeting the Democrat and Republican campaign teams.When he got back to the UK, he wrote a memo for Starmer, then leader of the opposition, sharing how impressed he had been by the professionalism and focus of the Trump campaign. At the top of the page were the words: “The Democrats are in trouble.”Since then, Starmer and his senior team have been preparing for a Trump presidency, putting personal relationships at the heart of their strategy. In September, by now prime minister, Starmer dined at Trump Tower in New York.Three months later his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, travelled to the US for talks with his Trump counterpart, Susie Wiles. Others have been out to Washington in recent days, leaving nothing to chance.“If Donald Trump likes somebody he’s doing business with, it makes all the difference,” one senior government official said. “He likes that Keir is down to earth. It’s important because it means it’s possible for him to raise difficult issues without risk.”During their meetings, Trump’s warmth towards Starmer was apparent, describing him as a “special man”, lauding the “incredible” and “unprecedented” offer from King Charles of a second state visit, and even lavishing praise on the prime minister’s “beautiful” Surrey accent.1:25Starmer gives Trump invitation from King Charles for UK state visit – videoThey had not got there by accident. The government’s strategy has been threefold: flatter Trump’s not insubstantial ego; characterise the UK’s “asks” through the prism of how they might benefit America; but also stand up for the British national interest.As part of the first, there was a conscious decision to “dial down the volume” in public about Trump’s more outrageous public outbursts, whether that was falsely labelling Volodymyr Zelenskyya dictator, suggesting making Canada the51st US state, or sharing anAI videoof “Trump Gaza”.Starmer brought personal gifts with him from the UK. The president’s included a golf cap in his family tartan and some Downing Street golf balls, while his wife, Melania, received a Liberty scarf and No 10 candle. In return, Trump gave the football-mad prime minister a US jersey with his name and the number 10 on the back.The second part of the UK strategy involved presenting a deal on theChagos Islandsas a national security issue, suggesting a tech-focusedtrade dealwould be an economic boon for the US, and encouraging Americansecurity guaranteesfor Ukraine so that any peace treaty is durable.The Downing Street team was also aware that to truly earn Trump’s respect, Starmer would have to – in the words of one adviser – “show some balls”, demonstrating that he was willing to stand up for the UK’s national interest.He did so repeatedly, reminding Trump that Vladimir Putin was the aggressor in Ukraine, challenging JD Vance on free speech in the UK and arguing the case against tariffs. “He tried,” Trump joked with reporters at a press conference later in the opulent east room of the White House when asked about tariffs. “He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.”1:13Trump praises Starmer’s negotiating as he suggests UK will be exempt from US tariffs – videoWhile No 10 will have been relieved that the White House visit went without any obvious hitch, in the longer term, was the prime minister’s strategy successful? “I think we’ll have two deals. A deal on ending the war, and I think we’re going to end up with a great trade deal,” Trump concluded.Starmer left the White House with positive noises on tariffs, although Trump did not rule out imposing them entirely; also the prospect of a tech trade deal, although officials admitted there would have to be policy and regulatory compromises ahead. And the president hinted he could accept the Chagos Islands deal – although some in his administration are vehemently against.When the prime minister came to the back of the plane on the flight back to London to chat briefly to journalists, he confirmed he was “happy” with how the day had gone, giving a Trump-style thumbs up.But the prime minister and his senior team know there is a danger that any endorsement from Trump may prove short-lived, and there is always the risk the president could very publicly change his mind. Also, Zelenskyy was due to arrive in Washington on Friday, so the situation in Ukraine could change extremely quickly in either direction.One Starmer aide said: “I wouldn’t put too much stress on one meeting, what’s important is the process. We’re at the very beginning of that and there are very basic things not yet agreed or defined.”Chief among those is Starmer’s push for a US military “backstop” to support any European peacekeeping forces that may end up in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached. Trump repeatedly resisted making any sort of commitment. Instead, he suggested that an economic backstop of US civilians working in Ukraine on a multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal would be enough to deter Putin, perhaps also hoping that the vagueness of his position might prevent another Russian attack.Starmer is trying to keep his eye on the ultimate prize. “When there’s a Trump presidency, the rhetoric is always very destabilising, so we try to zoom out,” an aide said. “The president has been very clear he wants to end the war. That’s all that matters, and we want to help him get there.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It will therefore underpin any action she must take. Reeves’s policy decisions will then be incorporated into the final economic and fiscal outlook report published alongside the spring statement.What has happened to the chancellor’s headroom?Back at the October budget, Reeves had held back £9.9bn of headroom in reserve against her primary fiscal rule – requiring day-to-day spending to be matched by tax receipts in the fifth year of the forecast.However, the government has been borrowing more than the OBR forecast, and Britain’s debt servicing costs have risen sharply on financial markets.Analysts at CapitalEconomicsexpect this could whittle down the chancellor’s headroom from £9.9bn to £2.8bn. However, there are other factors that will influence the OBR’s assessment.An economy under pressureGrowth in the UK economy has been weaker than forecast in October, having narrowly avoided a recession in the second half of 2024. The OBR is widely expected to nearly halve its 2% growth forecast for 2025 closer to 1%. In addition to the rise in borrowing costs, analysts say a weaker growth outlook could eradicate the chancellor’s headroom.The danger was highlighted by the Bank of England after it halved its GDP growth forecast for 2025 from 1.5% to 0.75%.Inflation is also expected to stick at higher levels than anticipated by the OBR. Back in October, the watchdog had forecast 2.6% inflation in 2025. The Bank now expects it to peak at 3.7% in late summer.Business leaders have cautioned Reeves’s autumn budget has added to the economic headwinds, arguingthe £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributionswill force them to cut jobs or raise prices.However, Reeves told the Guardian last week there would be no U-turns on the autumn budget. “I’m not resiling from that budget in any way. It was a budget that enabled us to start cutting NHS waiting lists, put more money into defence and return stability to our economy.”What can the chancellor do?The Treasury said the fiscal rules were “non-negotiable”, in a signal that an OBR forecast showing a breach would lead the chancellor to cut spending or raise taxes to ensure they were still being met. With Reeves having promised not to raise the Treasury’s three biggest revenue raisers – income tax, VAT and national insurance – and under pressure to fund a revival in public services, that will be tough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I haven’t completed thespending reviewand I will come back to this in the autumn’,” he said.“That said, simply saying that probably won’t cut the ice at the current juncture – and in particular given her credibility personally has probably been somewhat weakened.”Showing the lack of wriggle room, Keir Starmer’s promise to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 involved cutting the international aid budget, after Reeves warned “tough decisions” were needed to stick to the fiscal rules.To counter the rise in debt servicing costs and a sluggish economy hitting the government finances, Reeves has indicated she will prioritise spending cuts and “rooting out waste”.This could mean tougher restraint on public spending in the later years of the parliament, although details are still being worked on for the spending review – due to be completed in June. Benefit cuts could also be announced, to the dismay of charities andLabourbackbenchers.Reeves had promised late last year there would be no more tax rises, aiming to assuage business anger after her autumn budget. But the strength of her language on this point has softened in recent weeks. The Financial Times also reported that Reeves was leaving the door open to changes – including a possible extension of the freeze on income tax thresholds beyond 2028.Reeves said last week that she was committed “not to be repeating anything like that I had to do in October,” when she announced £40bn of tax rises, but did not rule out smaller revenue-raising measures.“There’s no way the chancellor is going to box themselves in to the extent that they are going to rule out ever making changes to taxes again. I’m not going to fall into that trap,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityLabourEconomicsGovernment borrowingTax and spendinganalysisShareReuse this content"

The men in full combat kit are crawling underneath rows of razor wire and through bunkers as controlled explosions blast columns of dirt into the air. Pink and green smoke blooms in a simulated gas attack, requiring the conscripts to quickly don gas masks so they can rush the zone. But it’s here where many of them pause, stopping the assault drill to spend precious seconds removing their glasses so the masks will fit.The conscripts mostly look to be in their early 20s. Statistics suggest that means anywhere up to 90% of them have some degree of myopia, otherwise known as shortsightedness.Taiwan has one of the world’s highest rates of myopia, alongside most of east Asia and Singapore. As well as the platoons of soldiers in spectacles, there are plenty of other signs. Optometry shops are everywhere – just around Taipei there are more than 40 outlets of Own Days, a chain which tests customers’ eyesight and makes prescription eyewear on-site within an hour. Laser eye surgeons advertise the latest tech, relatively cheaply, to a virtual production line of patients each day. And if you were to visit the front desk of a hospital in Taiwan, instead of pens chained to the counter, you’d probably find a pair of glasses.‘Once they onset myopia the progression is very fast’“Eye health is the most important sensory organ in our body. Every day we wake up and need to use our eyes,” says Dr Wu Pei-chang, a leading Taiwanese researcher of the subject and director of the Myopia Treatment and Prevention Center at Kaohsiung hospital.Why is myopia rising in children, and what can parents do about it?Read moreMyopia is a preventable disease in which abnormal elongation of the eyeball causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of on its surface. The distortion level is measured in diopters, and high myopia (when the distortion has progressed past -5.00 diopters) can lead to blindness if left untreated. The most crucial time is childhood, while a child’s eyes are still developing. “Once they onset myopia the progression is very fast,” says Wu.For decades science said myopia was a genetic condition, but from the 1960s and 70s an explosion in rates in east Asian countries – which were concurrently undergoing massive economic and educational expansion – upended that thinking. By the 1990s rates of myopia in Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore had risen from about 20% to more than 80%. China, initially delayed by the Cultural Revolution, soon joined them.Governments studied the phenomenon extensively, but it turned out to be quite simple. Myopia is now known to be linked to excessive “nearwork”, like reading, studying and computer work. And more recent studies have found that increased outdoor time is a crucial protective factor.That’s why scientists say the rates are so high in east Asia and Singapore, where the cultures heavily emphasise high educational outcomes, with extensive study time favoured by parents over outdoor play.It’s now a problem that is spreading around the world.A studypublished in September in the British Journal of Ophthalmology found global rates of myopia tripled between 1990 and 2023. By 2050, almost half the world’s population is projected to have it, with corresponding earlier onset, faster progression and greater severity.Taiwan’s rates are still high but government and social programs have shown measurable success and experts say it is well past its peak. As rates rise in the west, it may have lessons to share.Outdoor time v screen timeWu, himself shortsighted, was a young resident when he started to notice an alarming number of his patients and colleagues also had myopia, with many facing serious complications of the disease’s advanced progression. It became his life’s work. In 2004 a paper found that high myopia was the number one cause of irreversible blindness in Taiwan. Lobbied by Wu, who was now on national advisory boards, the government enacted new policies including twice-yearly testing of school students, and improved treatment options. But the rates were still increasing.“The eyes are developing rapidly [in childhood],” says Prof Ian Morgan, a leading expert in the field, from Australian National University. “The myopia has until around the age of 18 to 20 before it stabilises. So if a kid becomes myopic at the age of six, they still have about 14 years for it to get worse.”View image in fullscreenA junior high school in Taipei conducts a twice-yearly check of students’ eyesight.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianA few years later, two studies – including one from Australia led by Morgan – offered a lightbulb moment for Taiwan. Both found that the more time kids spent outdoors, the less likely they were to have myopia.Wu ran his own trials, finding similar results. It led to a 2010 government initiative “Tian-tian 120” (120 every day), calling for all children to spend at least two hours outside a day as a “protective factor”.“It was actually very simple – [the problem was] that myopia has a protective factor and a risk factor, but we had only been focusing on the risk factor,” says Wu.Taiwan holds its breath as Trump turns on Ukraine and upends US foreign policyRead moreThe outdoor time reversed myopia’s upward trend, bringing the rate among primary schoolchildren from more than 50% down to 45% within a few years. In Yilan, a 2014 community program achievedabout a 50% reductionat the preschool level.Researchers were emboldened. They had found a way to slow the onset of myopia, allowing children to reach the crucial stage of adulthood with minimal progression of the disease.But they had to convince parents and schools to ease up on the homework time.Taiwanese statistics show myopia appears to significantly worsen at the times when students move to new school stages with sudden increases in study load. A 2017 study found the rate of myopia increased from 9% to 19.8% between the ages of six and seven, when children start first grade, while high myopia increased by more than 50% between 6th and 7th grade.At a junior high school in central Taipei, dozens of 8th grade students are lined up outside the school clinic for their twice-yearly check. If any show signs of myopia, the two staff nurses will send a letter home to the parents within days, with requests to show proof of medical follow-ups within a fortnight.There are also growing concerns about the impact of screen time, which is rising globally. Last week aKorean study foundevery hour of screen time raised the chances of myopia among children.Hong Kong primary students – who spent much of the Covid pandemic doing online learning – more than tripled the averages hours they spent on screens each day, SCMPreported in 2023. In the same period, rates of myopia went up 2.5 times, according to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In China’s Shandong province, Wu says, the rate among six- and seven-year-olds jumped from about 5% to 25%.Rates in Taiwan are still high but Morgan and Wu say the peak is over and Taiwan is on the way to bringing rates down. Government data is frustratingly scant, but Wu says he is finalising a 10-year study that is suggesting the prevalence is now “down very low” from a decade ago.At the Taipei junior high school, the teachers estimate their students get probably 60 minutes of outdoor time during school hours, and maybe another 30 on their way home. But as the kids move up grades, “the pressure to study increases”.Asked where the pressure is still coming from – the school, parents or peers – the teachers laugh. “Everywhere.”Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificHealthMedical researchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They were like this in the early stages of their relationship, too – “there was something wrong with us” – Zoe jokes about their prolific lovemaking. But this new, “giddy” phase is different.“It feels like we’ve just started again. But with all this history, and this amazing child, and all this other stuff that binds us together,” she says.Less than a year before I spoke with her, those bindings were coming loose. Zoe had a young child and she was working a difficult, high-stress job. To top it off, Charles was not helping. He chafed against the constraints of early fatherhood and parenting brought up difficult feelings about his own childhood that he struggled to understand.We’re in a relationship recession – and a lot of women are absolutely fine with that | Emma BeddingtonRead more“He started projecting all his insecurities on to our marriage,” Zoe says. He’d complain about how they hardly went out, hardly had sex. “All these things that are just a phase of your life when you have a small child … I was just getting so frustrated, because I felt like I was his carer and the carer of a baby.In the end, she told him she could not cope any more and that there was no space for her emotional wellbeing. She was just worried about him, or catering to his needs, or catering to the baby’s needs.She said: “It would just be easier to have me and the baby, to be honest.”After some time apart, Charles realised he had to make changes. First, he tried to enlist Zoe in his self-improvement efforts. He asked her to write a list of everything she was doing around the house, so he could understand the tasks he had not been helping with. Her list being long enough without the addition of writing another list, Zoe refused.Charles started seeing a psychologist and soon realised Zoe had been right about the housework too. “It was a long road of therapy, and he did a lot of work trying to understand the mental load … figuring out how to be a grownup, and a dad, and a husband all at the same time,” she says.Eventually, “we got there. I finally have a teammate, an actual partner who picks up the slack without being asked, and who does things for us without being asked, and who takes control of situations without me having to tell him to.”“It’s kind of hard not to be horny for someone who’s put in all this work to be a better person,” she says.To me, Zoe’s story is a 21st-century fairytale. But not every Cinderella who finds herself stuck doing most of the emotional labour – alongside childcare, housework and work outside the home – can convince her handsome prince to pick up his broom and start sweeping.Zoe is one of 55 women to have told me about her love life in the last two years. Some of those women were newly coupled up, some divorced, some permanently single and some in long-term relationships. And at least a quarter of those women had been in situations like Zoe’s at some point – long term relationships where they felt there was “no space” for their needs or desires. While Zoe’s story is far from the only happy ending these women shared, it is the only one that did not involve a breakup.It’s kind of hard not to be horny for someone who’s put in all this workZoe*Aleks Trkulja, an Australian sex therapist, says it’s not uncommon for female clients to come into her practice with low desire or other sexual function issues that are clearly relational, not individual. Several other therapists have told me similar stories.Therapists are trained not to be directive, says Dr Lori Brotto, a Canadian clinical and research psychologist who works with women experiencing low desire. While a girlfriend can tell a woman, “He’s a jerk, get rid of him,” Brotto can’t do that, “even when I’m thinking that”.Rather than telling someone to leave, “it’s about asking the questions in a way that helps the person realise that actually their partner is contributing quite a bit to their low desire”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe dynamic Zoe was experiencing before Charles stepped up is something Brotto sees frequently in her clinic. It is part of why she contributed to the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men.Published in 2022 by some of the world’s leading researchers on human sexuality, this theory lays out how several gendered expectations placed on women (and men) serve to obliterate women’s sexual flourishing.View image in fullscreenWhen households are not functioning fairly, accountability and trust break down – and so does intimacy.Photograph: skynesher/Getty ImagesDr Sari van Anders, a Canadian scientist, is the heteronormativity theory’s lead author; her work is in neuroendocrinology, sexuality and gender/sex. Over a video call, she explained to me that while the pressures that create gendered roles are social, they end up having a biological impact too.For instance, being sexually aroused is a form of stress in that it’s different from how you usually feel. “People don’t walk around sexually aroused all the time, even those of us who might be sexually aroused very often,” van Anders says.It’s not just our feelings that get burnt out, it’s also hormones and bodiesDr Sari van AndersBut if you’re stressed out, over time your body decreases the amount of stress hormones it releases in response to any given situation – regardless of whether that stress is good (like arousal) or bad (like coming home to a cockroach in the sink because someone didn’t do the washing-up at breakfast).Women tend to experience much higher levels of chronic stress than men do, van Anders says, which can mean that over time, women’s bodies are just less able to react to things that might once have given them sexual feelings. “It’s not just our feelings that get burnt out, it’s also hormones and bodies.”This isn’t the only change that takes place in unequal households. While her research is still in its early stages, van Anders is beginning to explore the ways in which certain forms of caregiving – a conflation between the role of sexual partner and mother – might also decrease women’s sexual responses.“There’s evidence that parenting is associated with … a suppression of sexuality for most people,” van Anders says. This is a good thing – you do not want parents craving sex around their children. While it is hard to test for, there is some evidence to suggest that when women start to view their partners more like another child to care for rather than as an equal, the same suppression of sexuality might happen then, too.While research into this phenomenon is only just beginning, the circumstances are nothing new. In 1987, when Shere Hite, a sex researcher, surveyed thousands of women, she reported that in 76% of households where women worked full-time or cared for young children, those women felt there was no concrete arrangement for sharing the domestic load. The assumption was that women would do the work and men would, possibly, help.Hite also wrote that 76% of women felt there was a “maddeningly unfair” disparity between the emotional support they were expected to provide and the emotional support they received in return.In 2012, economist and author Eve Rodsky also surveyed women around the world for her book Fair Play. She also wanted to understand the division of household labour in heterosexual couples. What she found was “the same shit, different decade”.As Rodsky puts it, when households are not functioning fairly, accountability and trust break down. “And that was when I would see the lack of intimacy,” Rodsky says. People rarely want to have sex with someone they resent or a person they see as just another chore on a long to-do list.If you ever expect to spend quality time with a woman in bed, then you have to be the one making itErik*The link between household labour and sexual flourishing is something Erik’s mother might have known intuitively when, during his teenage years, she told him: “If you ever expect to spend quality time with a woman in bed, then you have to be the one making it.” As in: doing the laundry, drying the sheets, bringing them in and putting them on the bed.I spoke with Erik because I put a callout on social media asking women to nominate men they thought were exceptionally good in bed; Erik’s new girlfriend put him forward. While this egalitarian attitude towards housework is far from the only reason Erik impressed his partner, it certainly did not hurt.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harper CollinsWhile men in Australia spend an average of 3 hours and 12 minutes a day on unpaid labour, women spend 4 hours and 31 minutes. What’s more, men’s efforts tend to be concentrated on higher schedule control, more rewarding activities like car maintenance, home maintenance and gardening, while women take on the lower schedule control, less joyful chores like housework, cooking and shopping.Good sex takes time, space, physical and emotional energy – something many women, particularly working mothers, are missing from their lives.Eve Rodsky calls this conscious cultivation of time and distance “unicorn space” – inspired by the Ancient Greek concept of eudaemonic wellbeing. Having unicorn space means having not just the time but the emotional support to pursue your own passions.In her research, “the more you have a strong sense of self and identity, the more people were reporting sexual intimacy”, Rodsky says.If the burden of unpaid domestic work was split down the middle, just think what an extra six hours a week could do for straight women’s love lives. One woman wrote to Rodsky saying that after reconfiguring her domestic load, she finally had the time to join a rock band. In her letter, she said: “Sex is so much better when I get offstage in leather pants.”This is an edited extract from All Women Want by Alyx Gorman,published by HarperCollinsand released on 5 March 2025 in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsSexWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)extractsShareReuse this content"

One of the most glamorous names in fashion is up for grabs, with Prada, its longtime rival for Milan bragging rights, thought to be close to purchasing the company. The prospect of a sale raises the question of whether Donatella, designer since the death of her brother in 1997, will remain as creative lead.Versace without Donatella is hard to imagine. She remains a hands-on designer, and the lightning rod through which Versace’s energy is conducted. “Everyone should have a little Versace attitude,” she said before this show, held under the iron shelter of a historic tram depot in Milan where, as a concession to guest’s skimpy outfits, the benches were heated.View image in fullscreenDonatella Versace, centre, presenting her new collection.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/Reuters“Our house codes are recognised all over the world, and they make us so strong,” she added. Nonetheless, references in this collection to autumn/winter 1997, the last collection Gianni designed before his death – a distinctive Sex Pistols punk fusion of black and daffodil yellow, oily leathers and Roy Lichtenstein brights - fuelled rumours of a possible departure.“The first great post-Freudian fashion designer” was how Richard Martin, curator of an exhibition of his work in 1992, once described Gianni Versace. “He’s thinking about sex.” Donatella’s aesthetic is equally bedroom-coded, with crystal mesh dresses that shimmer and melt like hot candle wax.In less tumultuous times, the biggest concern for Versace this weekend would be which actors might wear Versace gowns on Sunday’s Oscars red carpet. (Cillian Murphy, who recently starred in an advertising campaign, was seated next to Anna Wintour in the front row.) But with American group Capri Holdings looking to offload the label it bought for $2.1bn in 2018, a lot more is at stake. Backstage after her show on Thursday, Miuccia Prada told reporters the Versace deal was “on everyone’s table”. A potential deal with Prada, or with Diesel founder Renzo Rosso, would bring the baroque exuberance of Versace back into Italian ownership.Versace has suffered with slowing sales, recently reporting a 15% year-on-year decline. As a fashion house without a strong line in perennials such as luggage or cashmere, Versace is in a precarious position at a time when consumers are tightening their belts. It remains a powerful brand with a strong and recognisable image. But Donatella, who turns 70 this year and received a substantial payoutin the 2018 deal, could decide to walk away if not enamoured with Versace’s next owner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wet, dry, dirty or clean, the classic cocktail has long been associated with suave, retro characters such as James Bond and Mad Men’s Roger Sterling (though Sterling’s is a Gibson – a martini garnished with pickled onions). In recent years the drink has returned to the top of cocktail menus, driven by bartenders’ experimentations and appreciation of its versatility.When the martini-dedicated Bar Planet opened in Sydney’s Newtown nearly three years ago, Jeremy Blackmore, the creative director of Mucho Group, the company behind the venue, says the cocktail’s image was: “Still a bit stodgy … a grandma’s drink. I thinkthe Queen would drink one at lunch.“It had lost a bit of its pop culture power.”View image in fullscreenBar Planet in the Sydney suburb of Newtown.Photograph: Dexter KimNow drinkers realise the martini’s classic form – about five or six parts gin or vodka to one part dry vermouth – is endlessly riffable. Not only can you increase the vermouth (making it “wetter”) or add olive brine (making it “dirty”) and garnish with olive, lemon peel or pickled onion, there are other variations in the martini family, such as the turf club (which adds maraschino liqueur, orange bitters and absinthe) and the vesper (which has a splash of Lillet blanc).View image in fullscreenJeremy Blackmore, creative director of Mucho Group.Photograph: Dexter KimSimon Dacey, venue manager of Applewood Distillery in Gumeracha, South Australia, says the cocktail renaissance in the early 2000s and 2010s came with a level of prescriptivism. “It was: ‘I’m the bartender. I know how to make drinks. This is what you will drink.’” That has given way to more personalised experiences. “There’s definitely a trend towards people being a bit more experimental, wanting to try stuff,” he says.Blackmore says now drinkers “get a bit of sweat equity” in their order. “You get to own a little bit of that martini.”Rob Libecans of Melbourne’s Caretaker’s Cottage, which last year wasnamed the best bar in Australasia, says its martini outsells everything but Guinness on the menu; in 2024 they served more than 12,000.Adding a small amount of another ingredient can radically change a martini, Libecans says. “Add a touch of Chartreuse and you have an Alaska. Use sweet vermouth and add a cherry liqueur and you have a martinez – known by cocktail historians as the precursor to the modern martini,” Libecans says. “There’s a variant that everyone can enjoy.”Blackmore has a simpler theory about its appeal: “It gets you drunk really quickly. I’m not sure if you’re allowed to say that, but that’s part of what the joy is.”How to order a martini for the first timeDacey says choosing a martini doesn’t have to mean “a straight shot of gin”.Alex Costin, Applewood’s bar supervisor, says they have a choose-your-own-adventure martini menu – perfect for the uninitiated – which walks you through a number of choices: clean or dirty, how dry and which flavours. These determine how briny your drink will be, how much vermouth goes into it and what gin is used.View image in fullscreenApplewood Distillery has a choose-your-own-adventure martini menu.At The Gidley in Sydney’s CBD, martinis areserved with accoutrements on the side, brought to the table on a tray so customers can add their choice of olives or brine, a lemon twist or pickled onions.Costin recommends first-timers ease in with a wet martini “if they’re not looking for a spirit-forward drink straight away”. Libecans agrees, suggesting a 50-50 vermouth-gin martini.The dirty martini – a martini with olive brine and extra olives – is a crowd favourite (which could be due partly tosalt’s ability to suppress bitter flavours). Blackmore estimates half of Bar Planet’s drink sales are dirty.“It’s a pretty punchy drink,” says Bar Planet bartender Kate Howlett. “Having the brine in it makes it a little bit more approachable.”Libecans says: “At Caretaker’s Cottage we serve a lot [of dirty martinis] from guests’ choice. The saltiness heightens all of the flavours already present in the cocktail. Also, having a snack of olives on the side is a bonus.”View image in fullscreenThe Gidley in Sydney serves martinis and gibsons with a tray of accoutrements.Photograph: Dominic LoneraganHowlett adds: “We stack as many olives as we can on the stick [at Bar Planet].”Temperature mattersBlackmore and Dacey both say keeping a martini cold is “crucial”.A number of venues chill batches of the cocktail in the freezer; the high alcohol content means it stays liquid. Libecans serves his at -18C. “The viscosity changes and the drink remains colder until the last sip.”View image in fullscreenAlex Costin, Applewood Distillery’s bar supervisorDacey says keeping the drink cold minimises the taste of alcohol: “Ethanol doesn’t necessarily have a flavour but, if it does, that flavour perception tends to be very, very bitter.”“If you have coffee in the morning, that first sip of coffee can be really intense, really harsh” but once it cools down “suddenly all these flavours burst out”.The same is true for martinis. “You want to taste the botanics in the gin and in the vermouth – temperature is a really good way to eliminate flavours you don’t want while highlighting ones you do.”Making your ownBar Planet serves their martinis from a porrón (wine pitcher) but at home you can drink one in a highball glass full of ice with a lemon wedge, Blackmore says. “Top it with soda for a sundowner, or in a frozen stemmed martini glass for max class.“I have a bottle of martini in my freezer at every moment, ready for that emergency, opportunity or problem that can only be solved/seized with the perfect cold cocktail.”That’s the spirit: Australian twists on the classic negroniRead moreJeremy Blackmore’s freezer martini recipeMakes10(70ml per serve)460ml good gin70ml dry vermouth30ml fino sherryPinch (1g) of salt1 tsp (4g) white sugar140ml waterStir all the ingredients together until the sugar and salt dissolve.

But whether or not his performance asBob DylaninA Complete Unknownbeats out presumed frontrunner Adrien Brody – the current youngest best actor, at 29 years, 11 months and nine days in 2003 – Chalamet has already won arguably the most important prize of modern movie stardom: the hearts and minds of the internet.Oscars 2025: best picture nominees – reviews, awards and where to watchRead moreIf we’re in the business of giving out awards for deserving, boundary-pushing work, then Chalamet’s best actor campaign – unofficial and often unspoken efforts to sway awards voters and build public sentiment – deserves its own Oscar. For the past several months, ostensibly in support ofA Complete Unknownbut seemingly just as much for laughs, Chalamet has embarked on a rare press run of consistent wins that generated viral moments and appealed to the reference-averse, absurdist sensibilities of his generation, bucking the usually staid methods of Hollywood promotion. Whereas past best actor hopefuls have erred on the side of grateful, serious and dutiful to the self-importance of the boomer-skewing Academy, Chalamet has worn kitschy outfits to red carpet events, treated social media like an ironic art experiment and made the rounds with influencers. In other words, though Chalamet is technically a millennial (born in 1995), we are witnessing the first genZ Oscar campaign.Oscars 2025: best actor nominees – awards, interviews and what their chances areRead moreAnd what a delight it’s been. There is plenty to be cynical about when it comes to awards season – the repetition, the speeches written by consultants, the cloying campaign-ness of it all – but Chalametout-predicting professional sports analystson College Gameday (?!) is not one of them. The first sign that Chalamet would be up to something different – that he would be in on the joke – was back in October, two months before the domestic release of A Complete Unknown, when hecrasheda crowdsourced lookalike contest in New York’s Washington Square Park, temporarily causing gleeful pandemonium (until the cops showed up). He followed with a series of wacky, weird, surprisingpublic appearancesthat have deftly threaded a needle of sincere and unserious, fromdressing up as Bob Dylancirca 2003’s Sundance, blond bangs and all, to remixing Dylan deep cutson Saturday Night Liveas one of the few musical guests who isn’t a recording artist.A non-exhaustive list of highlights:riding a Lime bikeon to a red carpet (and later telling a French interviewer that he wasfined £65for illegal parking);giving podcast bro Theo Von a lessonon publicly subsidized housing (Chalamet grew up in Mitchell-Lama arts housing in Manhattan); fanboying over Kendrick Lamar in a ride-along“interview”for the Super Bowl; hosting abizarre Instagram livefrom an empty warehouse in which he smashed a guitar, writhed with confetti to the 2009 Black Eyed Peas track I Gotta Feeling, and appeared in front of a screen with intentionally misspelled messages like “congratulations timmothee”.A Complete Unknown review – Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan is an electric revelationRead moreFor every conventional, in-the-feels interview stop – a classic Serious ArtistRolling Stone cover, a60 Minutes interviewwith Anderson Cooper on honing his ambition, anApple Music interviewwith Zane Lowe on inhabiting Dylan’s music – there have been multiple ridiculous, internet-aiming victory laps. See:talking Bratwith oddball Canadian music journalistNardwuar, and an absurd and delightfulinterviewwith YouTuber Brittany Broski in which hedescribedhis lean aesthetic as “empowering the anemic”. And that’s not even getting into a series of lo-fi Instagram videos in which Chalamet sings along to various songs – the Dylan trackVisions of Johanna, a number from the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack – at various outdoor locations in a style I can best describe as “aspirational performing arts school project”.Saldaña squished and Chalamet chafing as Ariana and Cynthia bag the best seats: the 2025 Oscars class photoRead moreAll of this evinces a fact that many forget: being an actor and being a movie star are not the same thing. Timothée Chalamet is a phenomenally talented actor who, by his own admission, strives to be considered one of the greats. He said the quiet part out loud (unusual) in his Sag acceptance speech a week before the Oscars – his first major award after nearly two dozen nominations by the age of 30: “I’m really in pursuit of greatness,” he said, wearing a lime green shirt, leather suit and bolo tie in tribute toanother archival Dylan look. “I know people don’t usually talk like that but I want to be one of the greats.”But awards campaigns are never just about talent, and Chalamet is, crucially, great atbeing a celebrity.This entire press run has evinced his concurrent talent for holding attention in the ways he wants to, for not taking oneself too seriously while also maintaining deep reverence for the craft, for balancing the esoteric and the very dumb, with some clear YouTube research. And mostly, to laugh at oneself in a way that also benefits one’s appeal, a through-line from the lookalike contest to showing Cooper a video of his high schoolrap alter ego, Timmy Tim. Chalamet is the rare extremely famous person who seems to actually enjoy being famous – or, at the very least, is having some harmless fun with it. So here’s to Chalamet’s Oscar campaign, a breath of fresh air in a practice that tends to range from just moderately enjoyable to outright annoying. Especially this year, the Oscars season, and pop culture at large, needed it.Explore more on these topicsOscarsTimothée ChalametAwards and prizesA Complete UnknownfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New study identifies four types of romantic loverAustralian research is ‘first to empirically show that we don’t all love the same’, lead author saysGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastTory ShepherdFri 28 Feb 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 18.02 ESTShareNew research has identified four types of romantic lover, including one that has sex up to 20 times a week.The research, published in the journalPersonality and Individual Differences, categorised lovers as mild romantic, moderate romantic, intense romantic, and libidinous romantic.Lead author, Australian National University PhD candidate in biological anthropology Adam Bode, defined romantic love as “a motivational state typically associated with a desire for long-term mating with a particular individual” – and one “that arose some time during the recent evolutionary history of humans”.“It occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive, emotional, behavioural, social, genetic, neural, and endocrine activity in both sexes. Throughout much of the life course, it serves mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding functions.”Men say ‘I love you’ first – but are they really more romantic than women?Read moreBode said that definition was “not perfect” but was “the scientifically most useful and most precise”. He plans to update it to include the age of the onset of romantic love, to note that it “doesn’t have all its features until puberty”, and that it is associated with the early stages of a romantic relationship.According to the study, the romantic love stage can be measured through changes inhormones and blood neurotransmitter levelsand is thought to last up to two years, after which it transitions to “companionate love”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn some cases it persists longer.Bode said this was “the first paper to empirically show that we don’t all love the same”.“That seems pretty obvious, but science just hasn’t shown it before,” he said.The researchers, including experts from the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia as well as ANU, used theRomantic Love Survey 2022of 1,556 people, the world’s largest dataset of people in love.This longitudinal study across 33 countries selected 809 people aged 18 to 25, who self-reported being in love. And among them, Bode’s team identified four major “clusters”.Mild:About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by “the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex”. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was “definitely” in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%.Moderate:About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as “fairly stock-standard” – or in the words of the journal article, “entirely unremarkable”. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had “relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex”.Intense:This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as “crazy in-love” types. They were characterised by “the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex”. About six in 10 people in this group were female.Libidinous:About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as “relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex”. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.Love story: Australian researchers becoming world leaders in the study of romantic loveRead moreThe team’s research measured people’s romantic intensity, obsessive thinking, commitment and sexual frequency to come up with the categories. Bode noted other interesting associations, including that libidinous lovers were also more likely to want to smoke cigarettes, travel and spend more money.The study measured the intensity of romantic love by the Passionate Love Scale (or PLS), a “robust measure of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural characteristics of romantic love” used cross-culturally,developed in 1986.The research noted that obsessive thinking about a loved one has been recognised in theories about the understanding and mechanisms of romantic love. It cited previous research positing that obsessive thinking helps with bonding and faithfulness, that commitment plays a role in forming bonds, and that sex is a function of romantic love (the 2022 survey participants were told to define sex by “whatever they thought it meant”).The authors of the new study suggested it might “be fruitful” to further explore variables of sex, gender and sexual orientation, as well as the impact on mood of romantic love, and its effect on relationships over time. They also recommended future research focus on cultural or ethnic variations in the expression of romantic love, as well as the role of gender inequality.The study noted that the survey at its heart was limited to young, English speaking adults, many of them from Weird (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) countries.“Romantic love is under-researched given its importance in family and romantic relationship formation, its influence on culture, and its proposed universality and we want to help world researchers understand it,” Bode said.“These findings have implications for the evolution of romantic love.“Humans may still be evolving in terms of how they express [it].”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsPsychologyBiologyAnthropologynewsShareReuse this content"

Australiansare the largest consumers of fast fashion in the world, and wedispose of our clotheswith an intensity that reflects this.The simplest antidote to fashion’s impacts is wearing clothes for longer. A2017 study foundextending the life of a garment by just nine months could reduce its carbon, waste and water footprints by up to 20%. With this in mind, here are eight ways to spot durable garments you’ll be able to keep, repair and wear for an extended time.1: MaterialsThe most significant determinant of a garment’s durability is what it’s made from. Start by rubbing the fabric between your fingers to get a sense of the hand – “how something feels when you touch it,” says Gareth Kershaw, a lecturer in fashion technology from RMIT University. Take into consideration things like softness, smoothness, fluff, elasticity, strength, drape and density.Next, according to sustainable design consultant Kristen Nuttall, you should check the label to see the fabric composition. “Is this a wool cashmere, or is it a viscose blend made to feel like cashmere?” she says.Natural fibres like cotton, linen, wool, cashmere and silk will generally be more durable when not blended with a synthetic like elastane, polyester or nylon. A telltale sign of high-quality cotton and wool is a smooth finish as this indicates longer, finer staple fibres. The density of a knit or weave is another sign of quality as it generally requires more fibres (which is more expensive) and reflects that advanced technology was used in production.2: ConstructionThe next step is to assess how a garment has been constructed, which means taking a look inside.A well-made garment will have thoughtfully constructed openings and closures that are reinforced at more than one point (like a button that does up inside the lapel or a tab inside the top of the fly on trousers). And they will move with you. When you try a jacket or shirt on, there should be no tension when you raise your arms. Similarly, trousers shouldn’t pull or gape when you sit down.In the context of construction, elastane is a red flag. It has a four-way stretch, which is necessary for swimwear and underwear, but in other garments, it does a lot of heavy lifting to make poorly constructed clothes fit. Plus, over time, it loses elasticity from repeated stretching and washing, which causes the material to sag.3: SeamsSomething else to pay attention to is how neat the seams are.French seams – folded over and sewn down along both edges – and those bound so the edges are covered are much stronger and more durable. These, Kershaw says, “give you more stability in the garment itself” compared with the widely used overlocked or lock stitch seams with a row of stitches running along a raw edge. Dodgy seams will also have larger stitches, which indicates that a garment was rushed through the machine quickly. This can lead to faults like puckering in the fabric.4: LiningSince it adds warmth, keeps the exterior of a garment from getting dirty and makes it more pleasant to get dressed, lining is another indicator of quality. But it’s important to be mindful of what it’s made from, as cheap polyester, nylon or acetate will disrupt any thermoregulating properties in the outer layer since they don’t breathe and make garments feel sticky and sweaty. Look for lining made from cupro, silk, cotton, modal or lyocell.5: PocketsWell-placed, deep pockets made from a thin but strong material are another indicator that a garment has been designed and manufactured by someone skilled and knowledgable.“Pockets can wear out quickly, so the quality of the fabric is important, as is the placement,” Kershaw says. Look for pockets that have been reinforced or tucked into the seams and are sitting appropriately on the body so when you put something inside them, it won’t fall out or upset the line of the garment.6: Effective hardwareThe weight and material of zippers, buttons, press studs and hook-and-eyes are also key. “There should be an elegance to opening and closing the zippers or snap buttons or whatever the fastening is,” Nuttall says. “If it’s difficult and they’re not functioning well, that’s a sign of a garment that wasn’t well considered.”7: Versatility and repairability“If something is well made, as you grow or shrink and change or your style changes, you should be able to adapt it,” says Nuttall.Look for garments that have extra fabric stored in the seams so they can be let out or taken in if your body changes. Or design features like ties or fastenings that mean they can be worn in a variety of ways.8: Emotional durabilityChoosing styles you love and want to keep wearing is perhaps the hardest thing to get right. It requires developing a strong sense of your own personal style – a good place to start is analysing what you already own and love to wear. It can help to view each new purchase as an investment, which might mean researching and saving up so you can find and afford the dress, trousers or coat with the most value embedded in it.Share your experiencePlease share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Zelenskyy was being forced to buy hope of  survival by people who have no care for our freedomFri 28 Feb 2025 14.07 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 19.27 ESTShareIt’s warming up in Kyiv. The temperature has risen from -5C to 4C. Sometimes, the sun peeps through breaks in the clouds, but Kyivites are not much cheered by the sunshine. They are not watching for signs of spring as they usually do at this time of year. The atmosphere in the city and in the country as a whole has been one of nervous expectation. This was not an expectation of an end to military action or the signing of a peace treaty with Russia – nothing so specific. Indeed, it was not at all clear what we were waiting for, but it was something connected withDonald Trumpand the change in US policy towards Ukraine.Clarity emerged at today’s macabre theatre at the White House: handshakes, a thumbs up and some fist pumps from the US president, before Trump sat side by side with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a minerals-for-war-support deal and to humiliate him. At the same time,air raid sirens were soundingin northern and eastern Ukraine. Soon the talks were off and Zelenskyy was gone.What proceeded, in front of TV cameras, was chilling, extraordinary. Zelenskyy grave, angry, desperate – as befits a leader being obliged to bargain away his nation’s birthright. Trump claiming to be the honest broker, saying: “I am not aligned with anybody. I am aligned with the world.” Be thankful, he tells a man who has seen his people murdered, his territory captured and besieged. “Make a deal or we’re out.”It got worse. Zelenskyy showed him photos of war atrocities. “I think President Trump is on our side,” he said, with no genuine hope and certainly no expectation that that was true. The vice-president, JD Vance, attacked Zelenskyy for being disrespectful. Both Trump and Vance verbally pummelled him for the cameras, for this is the art of the deal now: loaded, hectoring, callous, bloodless.But then Ukrainians’ belief in a concrete proposal from Trump to end the war had already been replaced by the conviction that the president had no such plan, but rather, many different ideas about US involvement in the region – ideas that often relate toUkraine, but sometimes conflict with each other and are never focused on supporting a country that is a victim of Russian aggression.During the past two weeks, we have watched as the issue of ending the Russian-Ukrainian war has transformed into the issue of rare earth metal mining in our country. As it turned out, in Saudi Arabia the participants in the Russian-US negotiations also discussed the extraction of rare earth metals, only they focused on resources in Russian territories and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. These rare earth metals have pushed the topic of the war and military aid to Ukraine out of the media space. That space is filled with dollars now.Older Ukrainians, who grew up in the Soviet Union, have recognised in this situation the US that was depicted by Soviet propaganda cartoons as a nation of greedy, irresponsible, grab-what-you-can capitalists, who spat on complex problems and had eyes only for dollar superprofits.8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – videoThis is an existential war, and a new reality. Trump says Zelenskyy is “not ready for peace”, but Ukraine has no choice but to fight on, whatever the cost. Aid that was previously given for nothing must now be bought. If there is no money, then it is necessary to pay with resources. After three years of full-scale Russian aggression, US geopolitical interests in Ukraine have been replaced by financial interests. Instead of the politician President Biden, the businessman President Trump has entered the arena.Note that the US proposal on the extraction of rare earth metals in Ukraine, if realised, would allow the US side to sign a similar agreement with Russia and start digging without waiting for the end of hostilities.The notionis an “investment fund”, managed by the US and Ukraine on “equal terms”, into which Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas “to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine”. Trump insists it is “very fair”.Would such an agreement encourage Russia to cease its aggression? No! Does it contain security guarantees for Ukraine? It seems not. Does Ukraine have any choice? Debatable.In this situation, Britain and the EU become much more important partners for Ukraine than before. While organising favourable access to Ukrainian resources for the US, Trump hopes to hand over toEuropeand Britain responsibility for Ukraine’s security in the event of a cessation of hostilities, and responsibility for further military assistance. Given this, it is by no means clear what advantage such an agreement on rare earth metals would give Ukraine.Trump’s claims that US mining on Ukrainian territory will be a sufficient guarantee of Ukraine’s security because Russia will not risk attacking US economic interests do not stand up to criticism. The Chinese state-owned COFCO corporation invested in a new grain and oil handling complex in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv port, but Chinese involvement did not protect the port from beingtargeted by Russian missiles. It has not been operational since March 2022 and the region islosing about 40%of its revenues.The fact that Trump has been so complimentary aboutVladimir Putin, and so hostile to Zelenskyy, says everything. “I think he will keep his word,” Trump assured the world. “I have known him for a long time.” Trump’s phrase that peace will be achieved “fairly soon or it won’t happen at all” indicates that he will not waste too much time on negotiations with Putin if they drag on, or if Putin puts forward conditions that are unacceptable to Ukraine. Some conditions have already been announced by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who reminded us that Russia still plans to seize the entirety of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.Zelenskyy was brave, but we are supplicants now. Trump and the Kremlin have made it abundantly clear that Ukraine’s participation in these negotiations between the US and Russia is not necessary or desirable. Like so much else, the principleannounced by Biden, “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”, has been trampled underfoot. Zelenskyy was called to the White House to sign, but not speak.Trump has had his way. He has transformed Ukraine from a subject into an object, and after this White House humiliation some Ukrainians are convinced that the extraction of rare earth metals on Trump’s terms would turn our country into a “colony” of the US. Still, many Ukrainians would prefer to live in a US colony than in a Russian one, if that’s the choice.Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and the author of Death and the PenguinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was the January 1984 issue, with model and pop-rock singer Nick Kamen on the cover, in a ski cap. As a young kid, I bought magazines weekly, starting with Look-in, a preteen music and television magazine, followed by the brightly coloured teen bible Smash Hits and then the Face, the last two founded by Nick Logan. The Face was like a cool, older teenager who invited you into a sexy new world where fashion, music and design fused to create a revolutionary culture. As a young Black gay man, that invitation meant everything.This truly was the heyday of magazines, as I was reminded when visitingThe Face Magazine: Culture Shiftat the National Portrait Gallery last week. I was moved to see all of the magazine covers and spreads that I had collected and hung up on the walls in my youth. There was a particular image of the Kiss FM crew in their studio with Norman Jay, Gordon Mac and Paul “Trouble” Anderson, DJs whom I had loved and followed. When I was 16 and had left school, the Face opened a window into London’s arts, music, clubbing, queer and fashion scene, which took me out of my small world in south London and allowed me to aspire to something different. Beyond the capital’s walls, the magazine introduced me to the emerging house music scene in Chicago and New York, and foreign-language films.The 1980s and 90s are often described as something of a “monoculture”, a period in which there was a shared participation in cultural phenomena – people watching the same shows and consuming the same music. But the decades saw an explosion of youth subcultures, and the Face revealed and brought together different tribes that were previously siloed off – rockabillies, rude boys, skinheads, soul heads, goths. What was important to me as a young person was that the Face told you that you didn’t have to belong to one tribe; it could be cool for you to enjoy pop music and a bit of ska and a bit of soul.The Face also did not simply report on culture, it shaped it, and it helped me build a sense of style and identity. Images created by the Buffalo movement, a fashion collective headed up by the stylist Ray Petri and the photographer Jamie Morgan, often filled the pages and the cover. Buffalo had drawn on Jamaican culture, dancehall music and hip-hop, and embraced sports labels such as Lacoste, Fila and Sergio Tacchini. It also pioneered playing around with gender representation – putting men into leather skirts with combat boots; choosing steely, masculine depictions of women over glitter and elegance.View image in fullscreenMarc Thompson looking at a photo of Clinton McKenzie at The Face Magazine: Culture Shift exhibition.Photograph: Marc ThompsonThe Face also used a diverse range of models, and had Black men as cover stars at a time when you would not see them in fashion stories or magazines anywhere else. It featured young Black male models now lost to historysuch as Tony Felix, Simon de Montfort and Wade Tolero. In June 1985, a month before I came out as gay to my family, the boxer Clinton McKenzie was on the cover of the Face in a beret with his muscles bursting out of his shorts and tank top. It’s an image I still love now.That truly subversive, culture-defining era of magazines feels like a bygone era now. Perhaps I cannot claim, at age 55, to be completely tapped into the youth market, but the landscape of culture and the means of its dissemination are so much broader now. The decline of print magazines in the 2000s and 2010s was a consequence of the rise of the internet and social media, which spawned millions of cultural influencers and micro-trends. While magazines such as the Face weren’t gatekeepers of culture, they were published by a select few people who set the narrative. Trends now feel much less substantial and much less consequential for popular culture.I remember being heartbroken when the Face closed down in 2004. While I had stopped collecting the magazine in the mid-90s, moving on to the more sophisticated GQ and Vanity Fair, it felt like one sign that we were entering a new era. The Face was founded at the beginning of the Thatcher era, and carried on through to New Labour and the explosion of Britpop. By the time it closed, the optimism of New Labour was crumbling, the advent of technology was not bringing the innovation and productivity gains for which we had hoped, and soon enough a financial crisis would appear on the horizon. The death of this truly British youth style bible – a symbol of growth, cultural revolution and promise – was the canary in the coalmine.The Face Magazine: Culture Shift review – rebellious fashion photography with a raucous sense of funRead moreI have followed the Face from a distance since itsrelaunch in 2019and am pleased to see it back. Perhaps magazines cannot shape culture in the same way as they did in my youth. The pursuit of clicks means magazines, with their additional digital presence, are now doomed to follow trends rather than set them. However, the preservation of definitive print products feels vital when our culture is dominated by an online world in which our attention is infinitely split and an identity is hard to establish. Perhaps I’ll go out and buy a copy again, even if I won’t have the foggiest what anything in there means any more.Marc Thompson is a queer archivist and the lead commissioner of the London HIV Prevention ProgrammeAs told to Jason OkundayeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His country’s best hope now lies with EuropeFri 28 Feb 2025 17.54 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 18.39 ESTShareNo matter their position on the Russia-Ukraine war, people who view thetelevised encounterbetweenDonald TrumpandVolodymyr Zelenskyyin the Oval Office will likely be shocked. It didn’t morph into a full-on screaming match, but it came close.The meeting might have gone sideways anyway, butJD Vance’s presence ensured thatit became ugly– and quickly. The vice-president spoke over Zelenskyy, accused him of ingratitude for the assistance provided by the United States (“Have you ever said thank you?”) and of disrespectingTrump, his host, and, for good measure, scolded him for litigating his country’s case in public. That raised the temperature – a lot.To be fair, the Ukrainian president shouldn’t have sprung the trap Vance set. He might have said that he had in fact expressed his gratitude in the past, wished to do so again, and was pleased to be in the United States to have a direct discussion with Trump, a man he regards as a strong leader.3:20'Make a deal or we are out': the worst of Trump and Zelenskyy’s clash – videoYuck, you might say: that would have been obsequious and undignified. True, but there are two rules for anyone meeting Trump, especially when the press corps is on hand: use flattery and avoid arguments.The formula works.Consider Keir Starmer’s Thursday meeting with Trump, in a similar public setting. The British prime minister played Trump like a violin. He nodded earnestly, smiled and delivered the coup de grace by whipping out of his pocket King Charles’s letter inviting Trump to visit the UK and underscoring how important a gesture it was. Trump, momentarily taken aback, beamed with pride and gushed over the UK and its monarch.Was Starmer genuflecting? Yes. Was it a bit queasy to watch him? Yes. Did his approach work? Absolutely. It was a masterly lesson in Trump-handling.It’s too late for Zelenskyy to try the Starmer method. He and Trump didn’t hold a press conference; a state dinner was scarcely possible after the Oval Office fiasco; the US-Ukraine mineral deal is likely dead – and Zelenskyy left.Where does Ukraine go from here?The video of what happened between Trump and Zelenskyy will course through the news cycle for a few days and make for dinnertime discussions – or quarrels – but it won’t elicit attention for long.Kyiv had best abandon all hopes of ensuring its postwar security through a place in the Atlantic AllianceYet for Zelenskyy, there’s no coming back from this debacle. Trump holds grudges, doesn’t forget slights and never forgives.Leave aside the mineral deal; Trump has slammed Nato’s door shut in Ukraine’s face. Kyiv had best abandon all hopes of ensuring its postwar security through a place in the Atlantic alliance, especially given that other members, such as Hungary and Slovakia, are already determined to lock it out.There’s more bad news for Ukraine. It might have hoped that a mineral accord worked out with the Trump administration could pave the way for American arms sales paid for by Ukraine with its mineral revenues. That is now all but impossible.So how can a Ukraine that’s been shut out of Nato and won’t get any sort of American security guarantee, or even US arms, ensure its postwar security? It must look toEurope.Ukraine ‘gambling with world war three’, Trump tells Zelenskyy in fiery meetingRead moreZelenskyy’s idea of a 200,000-strong “army of Europe” peacekeeping force won’t work. Europe can’t field a ready-for-battle army anywhere near that size. It’s not just a matter of insufficient troops. Having relied comfortably on American protection for over a generation, Europe had the luxury of neglecting its defenses. Consequently, it lacks the firepower (aircraft, armored personnel carriers, tanks and artillery) and logistical capabilities to field a force that can defend Ukraine if Russia attacks again.Yet Europe can help Ukraine build a well-trained army with top-flight weaponry – one that Russia will find an even tougher opponent than it does now.To be sure, the Russian army is scarcely facing defeat in Ukraine; nor are its economic problems so severe that it can’t fight for much longer. Yet the performance of Vladimir Putin’s forces in Ukraine has been far from stellar. Russia has just entered year four of a war with a far weaker country – one that just about every military expert thought would be overrun in weeks, even days.Europe, with its world-class defense industries and resources for training troops, can help build Ukraine’s future army so that Russia must reckon with a far more powerful adversary than the one it has fought since 2022. The purpose of that army wouldn’t be to defeat Russia’s but rather to deter it by raising the cost, in blood and treasure, that it would have to pay to prevail.Trump can abandon Ukraine without endangering American security. Europe can’t and therefore has a stake in Ukraine’s security. Both Ukraine and Europe now have a Trump problem. They should turn it into an opportunity for defense cooperation.Rajan Menon is Spitzer professor emeritus at City College of New York and a senior research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia UniversityExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpEuropeJD VanceNatoUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Decades ago he went off to New Mexico, away from the bright lights of fame. And the dog went with him and his wife. Hackman was a firm man – you might say hard. He had been a marine, and seldom bowed to all the suck-up stuff about being lovable and a movie star. He was 95.Clint Eastwoodis 94, Robert Duvall the same. Jack Nicholson is only 87, still the kid.Dustin Hoffman is 87 too, Robert Redford 88, Warren Beatty 87. Harrison Ford is 82, and he seems older, or worried. We can’t expect these guys to go on for ever, just because they’re geezers, veterans and not forgotten.Not all of those fellows are as hard as Hackman was. None of them could summon up the nastiness he had in Unforgiven or the desperate isolation of Harry Caul in The Conversation. Hackman went off to Santa Fe and stopped working (on movies, anyway), while Eastwood directed a picture last year, Juror #2, which was not bad. I wonder if Eastwood has dogs.View image in fullscreenBy any means necessary … Gene Hackman as sheriff Little Bill Daggett and Clint Eastwood as gunslinger William ‘Bill’ Munny in the 1992 western Unforgiven, which Eastwood directed.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarPeople speak of these guys and their generation as real or tough movie stars. I get the point, and I know it’s meant kindly. But bear in mind that Hackman, Nicholson, Eastwood and the others came of age as an earlier wave was dying off – Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Gary Cooper, who was the godfather then. He was only 60, but he had looked anxious for years, and he would have thought of Douglas Fairbanks Jr, John Gilbert and even Rudolph Valentino as the real men.It’s not just that the generations come and go, and that in time a name such as Power sounds fond or quaint. It’s more that we put a load of affection and expectation on stars and it can wear them out.We shouldn’t make as much as we do of actors and stars when they are trying to represent usHackman’s generation seem like “the right stuff” now, good guys who had come up the hard way and had to struggle for attention. But Philip Kaufman’s wry picture The Right Stuff realises that the stuff can be like a slogan or ice-cream. The best of us understand that real hardness is having your Medicaid slashed in Oklahoma or Kentucky, even if you were befuddled enough to vote for the golden slasher. Hard was the 1930s when you might be a vagrant hitching a ride on the burning prairie, wondering if you’d end up a thief or worse.We shouldn’t make as much as we do of actors and stars when they are trying to represent us – no matter the money, the wives, the residuals and the magazine covers.View image in fullscreenHold up … Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackman in Bonnie and Clyde, 1967.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarThe stars who were “men” once know that the new generation has to wrestle with CGI and social media.Gene Hackman: the star of every scene he was inRead moreThere are guys around – such as Brad Pitt, Robert Downey Jr and Ed Harris – who may look like worn rock soon, as well as top actors. Can you anticipate Mel Gibson at 90? That’s only 21 years away, and maybe that’s too long to wait. Most of these fellows still remember their lines, or make them up. They can do an acceptable smile. It’s having to run on camera that finds them out.Actors playing strong men often fret over their own weakness. That’s how close to us they are, and why Hackman knew, without resentment, that no one quite looked at his character Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde, when Clyde was played by Warren Beatty.Hackman was firm enough to have no faith in being likable – and that is rare among movie actors, who can be comically insecure. So in The French Connection he was a rowdy scumbag, as great a danger as the advertised rascals. In Crimson Tide he was a grim tyrant, a threat to the world, someone Denzel Washington had to take down. He let us hate him. And in that role, as Captain Frank Ramsey, even on the submarine, he had a dog.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanClint EastwoodFilm industrycommentShareReuse this content"

A parable for our timesJane MartinsonOf the many lessons arising from this week’s report into the presenter’s alleged bullying and misogyny, one is the corporate cynicism that sustained himFri 28 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 06.04 ESTShareMore than 30 years have passed since Tim Westwood joined the BBC, 12 since he left and three since Guardian and BBC journalistsreported on allegations of abuseby a man considered by the corporation to be the voice of hip hop. Then this week, some of the many concerns raised during his 19 years working therewere detailedin the latest edition of one of the BBC’s weightiest and longest-running series, Official Reports into Men We Employ Behaving Very Badly.Westwood’s career at the Beeb ended in 2013, amid a flurry of accusations and a sense of deja vu best summarised as “oh God, not another one”. But the 174-page report is well worth reading, not just for what it says about theBBCbut, as so often with the media, what it says about attitudes in Britain.First, there’s the heartbreaking testimony from so many young women, mainly young Black women – claims of abuse that they say left them feeling so awful they blamed themselves or ended up contemplating suicide. Many did not realise the alleged behaviour was wrong until they were much older and admitted they didn’t report it at the time as they feared they would not be believed or would be blamed. The worst allegations are redacted because of ongoing police investigations. Westwood has denied all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and says he has not had the opportunity to answer the allegations, partly because of the ongoing police investigation.Then there was the apparent blind-eye turning to let’s just call it dodgy behaviour by a man who was not only considered a star, but was one of just two BBC presenters in 1997 to have,according to BBC research“made an impact with young Black and Asian listeners”. Yes there are the many junior staff members who complained of bullying and harassment but ended up being moved instead of the main man, but there is also in this scandal the extra spice of the BBC’s patronising efforts to be not only down with the kids but down with Black and minority kids. Let’s call it the “Ali G factor”.Westwood, the public school-educated son of an Anglican bishop turned pirate radio DJ, joined BBC Radio 1 in 1994 to launch the UK’s first national hip-hop radio show. He was described as a “dominant force” in rap music, a genre popular among the young people, particularly Black ones, who didn’t listen to the BBC. Both of the BBC Radio 1 controllers in charge during Westwood’s tenure mentioned the need for the BBC to attract this demographic. The Radio 1 controller between 1998 and 2001 described Westwood as being “bilingual”, able to speak to BBC management in a language they understood and could also “authentically connect” with a young minority audience. Westwood’s bad language and sexualised commentary was, according to a BBC executivequoted in the report“a sort of swaggering hip hop cartoon character”. When asked in 2017 for the highlights of his time running the station, Matthew Bannister started with “Westwood’s rammed stage at the Notting Hill carnival”.So, in summary, the BBC hired the white, middle-class son of a vicar who affected the vulgar language of rappers (and once met the Notorious BIG and was, sort of, friends with Pharrell Williams) in an effort to increase cultural representation and appeal to Black and Asian listeners on the national broadcaster. Let that sink in. Could there be a greater example of the dangers of Auntie throwing all caution to the wind to be down with the kids, kids she feels are not her own, kids she doesn’t understand, kids she apparently made little genuine effort to understand?The report leads to many conclusions, but one that seems inescapable is how much the BBC still needs diversity among its staff. It must be obvious this does not mean middle-aged posh white boys pretending to be Black. It means more people of colour, some of them minority women.The problem of under-representation in the media is not unique to the BBC and at least the corporation has made strides to get better. In 2019 Lorna Clarke, a Black woman, became first, controller of pop and then director of music at the BBC. But despite a target of 20% minority ethnic staff, just17% of its staff are not white.The BBC response to this latest report shows that some things have been learned since the run of scandals going back to Savile in 2011. In a statement that outlined changed processes since and promised to do better, the BBC admitted that it had for too long “been too siloed [and] deferential to high profile individuals”. New processes for complaints to allow allegations to be looked at together rather than piecemeal are also in place. A review into its broader culture launched bySamir Shah, its first minority ethnic chair as well as a distinguished former journalist, will be produced by the end of this year.This review should consider the culture of silence around inappropriate behaviour by many powerful men, some of whom were moulded and feted by the BBC. But it should also address the lazy thinking that led to this scandal, this trauma – continuing for so many victims – while everyone looked the other way.The problem with saying “not again” is that we keep on having to say it.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fresh off the plane from Washington,Keir Starmerwill spend this weekend hosting the great and good of our continent as they take stock of prospects for Ukraine. For the third time since the second world war – after Suez in 1956 and Iraq in 2003 – the United Kingdom is being forced to work out where it stands between the US and Europe.In the aftermath of those past crises, Britain chose to hug the US as tightly as possible, even if that meant drifting away from European friends. The prime minister appears to have secured a diplomatic coup ingetting through his crunch encounter with Donald Trumpmostly unscathed. But don’t let bonhomie andbad taste comments about wivesfool you: we are still in crisis, and the old routine won’t save us.Now is not the time for victory laps of the lobby over good headlines or the special relationship. If the past week has reinforced anything, it is how delicate are our prosperity and security, and that both now find stronger sustenance in Europe. The president may enjoy the pageantry of a second state visit, but six weeks into office he’s made it crystal clear his alliances are based not on grand ideals of shared values but profit margins. In negotiating withVladimir Putinover Ukraine’s head while humiliating President Zelenskyy, Trump has shown that we can no longer assume that when push comes to shove, US core interests will align with ours.Indeed, even hard interests appear negotiable if they interfere with the bottom line. Take critical minerals, the vital lifeblood of our advanced economies. Trump has strong-armed Zelenskyy into signing over preferential access to the revenues from Ukraine’s national deposits. This comes just weeks after the UK signed its own 100-year partnership with Ukraine that included plans to work together on these very same resources – a promise our government is yet to say can still hold. Meanwhile, there arereports that the US is gearing up to work directly with Russiato extract natural resources in the Arctic.View image in fullscreenBritish PM Anthony Eden and President Dwight Eisenhower after their three-day conference on world problems, 1 February 1956. The Suez crisis came in October.Photograph: JR/APTrump may have restated his own liking for Brexit, but it has left us outside the room at a time of high peril. Every nation recognises the need to pour oil on the troubled waters of international affairs at present. Yet we cannot take for granted that our neighbours will be pleased to hear talk of exempting us from the same tariffs being used to threaten their own growth. With stakes this high, now is not the time to indulge rehashed scare stories about cooperation with Europe from the Conservatives, or ignore thevacillation over standing up to Putin from Reform. Nor should we be distracted by the perennial rabbit hole of whether to rejoin the EU – or let either side derail the reset of relationships by old enmities.Trump and Starmer sat side by side – and the gulf between two nations seemed wider than ever | Gaby HinsliffRead moreInstead of red lines, it’s time to talk shared interests. These will not be achieved if either side delays a new strategic trade partnership for the sake of arguments over fisheries policy. Nor can the UK be asked to fight for Europe, but at the same time be cut out of deals to finance crucial defence industries. British businesses need us to ruthlessly reduce the paperwork currently crippling trade with Europe. TheBritish exchequer needs us to link our emissions trading schemesso that we won’t face a multibillion-pound bill when the EU’s new border charge comes into force. With energy security crucial to our ability to stand up to Putin as well as cutting the cost of living, there is also mutual interest in working at pace with our neighbours on the renewable energy potential of the North Sea – and to protect crucial undersea cables from sabotage.History shows that when the UK has tried to please everyone, our international reputation – and influence – has diminished for decades afterwards. The prime minister has this week carefully walked a tightrope. It is a start, but it isn’t an answer as to how to secure our own interests in such uncertain times. From intelligence to nuclear weapons, our national security apparatus istightly bound to the US. So, too, our volume of trade with Europe outweighs any hysteria about a hypothetical new deal with the US that could be years in negotiations.Realpolitik requires cold, hard calculation now more than ever. Even if we can keep the special relationship intact, it is across the Channel, not the Atlantic, that Britain will need to look first to protect our citizens’ prosperity and security.

If I listed all the structural acronyms throughout the decades, and the new staff starting new jobs with new brass nameplates, it would fill this page.This week, Wes Streeting accepted the resignation of NHS England’s chief executive,Amanda Pritchard, after ousting its chair,Richard Meddings, signalling an effective merger in all but name with Streeting’s own department. Whitehall says NHS England will have “a smaller, leaner role”, with thousands of duplicated jobs lost.Few people will regret the swallowing up of this remnant of the disastrous 2012 Lansley reforms, which fragmented everything in the NHS. Pritchard and Meddings recently suffered an unwarranted pasting by the Commons public accounts and health committees fortheir lack of “ideas”, but that was hardly fair. They had been barred from revealing the health department’s imminent 10-year plan. And there is a truth that the committees ignored that bears stating here: the NHS is on the turn for the better.Jim Mackey takes over NHS England, and even those who say Pritchard got the push unfairly tell me they welcome his arrival. Currently CEO of Newcastle hospitals foundation trust, he was head ofNHS Improvementwith a record of innovation until it was abolished by one of the three Tory health secretaries passing through in 2022. It’s also worth saying that Pritchard suffered six changes of health secretary in three and half years.I interviewed Mackey two years ago when he had returned to Northumbria healthcare trust, to start a pioneering scheme that others now copy. Failure to bind social care with the NHS leavesmore than 13,000 beds in Englandtaken up by old people waiting for a care package.Mackey set up a care system within his trust to relieve hospital bed shortages. His Northumbria Care is an NHS-owned domiciliary service that bids for social care contracts from local authorities that would usually be awarded to private providers, seamlessly integrating care within the health service. Here is a smooth transition without bottlenecks between the two sectors, with health and social care funded from the same budget, and every incentive to stop patients needing a hospital bed, and to get them home quicker.Heplanned to build care homesto take over residential contracts too, if he could raise the capital.The idea short-circuits the cumbersome introduction of 42 integrated care boards (ICBs). They were designed to bring local services together, but are largely regarded as failing. They lack the clout to knock local heads together so that GP and community services integrate with hospitals. They have no power over integrating local authority social care. Half the ICBs are in debt; they may yet be merged into half that number.Rarely has top talent moved from hospitals to run ICBs. Instead, many hospitals are forming groups, which may work better than ICBs. These are not big-bang changes and they slide under the radar, but the Mackey model has inspired other trusts to try similar schemes: expect more of that thinking from him.8:48‘Fix poverty, fix health’: A day in the life of a ‘failing’ NHSThe Darzi reportlaid bare the state of the NHS Labour inherited. Austerity cut everything, including medical training, with huge gaps in staff as the NHS struggled to cope with the effects of deprivation and a far sicker population.Streeting is rightly wary of boasting about any progress yet, given public outrage over the still appalling waiting lists (7.46 million cases,according to the British Medical Association), as well as ambulance delays, andailing A&EandGP services. The Treasury, meanwhile, seems happy to say that NHS productivity is lagging and that extra money ploughed in is failing to produce enough improvement. But that’s not the whole story, and the NHS should speak up. The Treasury traditionally sees the NHS as a bottomless pit, but its productivity is being badly misrepresented with faulty Office for National Statistics figures that are eagerly seized on by enemies of the NHS on the right.Anita Charlesworth, senior economist at theHealthFoundation thinktank, says ONS figures only count acute hospital activity, leaving out the 12,000 new virtual hospital-at-home beds. These are costly, but less expensive than actual hospital beds. The stats leave out GP care. Productivity there is rising fast now that GPs are paid to seek advice from specialists, instead of automatically referring patients to them directly: 1.5 million fewer patients have been referred, the department tells me. Instead, they are being cared for in surgeries under guidance. That GP productivity should be counted in.The concerted attack on assisted dying won’t stop the public supporting this bill | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThedepartment’s own figuresshow waiting lists falling and the 2m extra appointments promised within a year have been provided months early, with surgical hubs working evenings and weekends, as well as new diagnostic units.In his last month as chair, Meddings points to widespread improvements, a service “overwhelmed”, but not “broken”, he tells me. GP appointments are rising fast: 98% of surgeries have digital phones ensuring every call is answered, or called back promptly, with half the callers getting same-day appointments, and 70% face-to-face consultations. April’s year end figures will show “NHS productivity up 2.5%, more than any other public service”, Meddings said. He echoed the curious optimism you often hear throughout the NHS, even from those who describe near-impossible tasks undertaken to cope with rising need.Keep perspective. Trolleys line many A&E corridors, ambulance delays persist, waiting times are horrendous. I hear laments from managers and medics facing the prospect of 4% “efficiency savings” next year, to be achieved on top of already existing deficits, which must also be cleared. (Spoiler alert: they won’t be.)But there is hope. Times are tough and funding remains below the NHS historic average. But, as the Health Foundation’s Charlesworth says, this is not a repeat of the NHS austerity years.Statistics are just that, and what they represent cuts through very slowly, so it will take a long time before the public feels and believes in progress. But, for all the turmoil, green shoots are there.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionWes StreetingLabourHealth policyHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Sir Keir Starmer’s decision to cut the aid budget to “pay” for increased defence spending was wrong. Making the world’s poorest foot the bill for Britain’s security is reckless and self-defeating. Slashing aid fuels instability – it won’t buy safety. From her perch in government Ms Dodds, who was Sir Keir’s first shadow chancellor, knew this better than most.The former cabinet minister’s letter is right to warn that the cuts will mean the UK withdrawing from many developing countries and having a diminished role in global institutions like the World Bank, the G7 and climate negotiations. She pointedly argued Britain will find it “impossible” to deliver on its commitment to maintain development spending in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine with the shrunken budget. Sir Keir rebuffed this charge, but Ms Dodds is right to say his move is being seen as following the Trumpian lead in cuttingUSAid– a framing that implies the UK is losing its independent foreign policy direction.Like many others, including thiscolumn, she understood that in an increasingly volatile world, defence spending must rise. But rather than a collective discussion on whether the government’sfiscal rulesand tax policies remain fit for purpose, the prime minister chose to gut aid budgets to fund defence spending with little debate, as if stability abroad weren’t essential to security at home. Such high-handed treatment left Ms Dodds, a soft-left intellectual politician, with no choice but to resign.Herdeparturehad been in the air since Sir Keir made his announcement – but she held off until he returned from Washington. Sir Keir now owns the decision, and its consequences will define his leadership. That he was shaped by events rather than shaping them will not be lost on his MPs.Clive Lewis, a leftwing Labour MP and former soldier, has called for awealth taxto fund defence. This is a sensible idea that merits wider discussion, as does relaxing borrowing rules – a debate already under way inEurope. The party’s right wing wants to frame Sir Keir’s move as more than fiscal,briefingthat Sir Keir has made a deliberate break from the party’s pro-aid stance. It is reported that the Treasury didn’t push this – it was the prime minister’s personal call. Ms Dodds’ rise and fall mirrors his hardening leadership style.Sir Keir is seizing this crisis to remake his party. His government has embraced militarisation,welfare cuts, climatebacktrackingand nationalistasylumpolicies. The political rationale is to ward off attacks from the extreme right and particularly Reform, which has seen its support rise. Why amplify rightwing narratives instead of challenging them? If this is just tactical positioning, fine. If not, he risks losing Labour’s soul – a perilous path as concerns over the lack ofgood jobs, equality,child povertyand pensioner support are likely to keep growing. Labour voters may turn away if “hard-headed” geopolitics trumps fairness. The reaction from MPs and the electorate will determine whether this gamble pays off – or exposes rifts within Labour’s coalition.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After the combined persuasion and flattery ofSir Keir Starmerand Emmanuel Macron brought out a somewhat tamer and more jovial version of the US president, there were modest hopes that the Ukrainian president’s visit to Washington might be more productive than feared – even if there was no sign that they had succeeded in tempting Mr Trump towards the security assurances so desperately needed.Instead, his Oval Office meeting withVolodymyr Zelenskyysoon exploded into acrimony, with the US president berating his guest for ingratitude. Mr Trump had earlier spoken of partnership with the Ukrainian president. But he and his vice-president, JD Vance, teamed up to deliver a public kicking. It would, the president added, be “great television”.8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – video“You are gambling with world war three,”Mr Trump accused him. He attacked Mr Zelenskyy’s “hatred” for Vladimir Putin, suggesting it was the obstacle to achieving peace – no mention of Russia’s invasion. So much for Mr Trump’s remark that “I’m in the middle, I’m for both Ukraine and Russia” – itself a shameful pronouncement. It is hard to see how the curtailed visit – Mr Trump said that Mr Zelenskyy “can come back when he is ready for peace” – could have gone worse. “President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Mr Trump wrote.Europe’s charm initiative was always a long shot. Like Mr Macron, Sir Keir enjoyed a jovial reception from Mr Trump. He had learned to speak his language. Havingarrived armed with an invitationfor a second state visit, he gushed that Donald Trump’s return to Britain would be “so incredible. It will be historic.” He also managed to speak the truth: he stressed that peace must not reward the aggressor and factchecked the president’s lie that European aid to Ukraine was merely loaned. Asked about Mr Trump’s vision for Gaza, he stated the need for Palestinians to return home and reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to the two-state solution.Mr Trump, in affable mode, suggested he would probably back the UK’s plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He dangled the prospect of a bilateral trade deal, but its substance remains unclear – and likely skewed in America’s favour.It would have been folly for Sir Keir to burn bridges. But it was always clear that Mr Trump would be ready to set the torch to them himself whenever he saw fit. And so on Friday he put the boot into a democratically elected leader fighting to defend his country against invasion – “You don’t have the cards,” he told Mr Zelenskyy – yet has said he believes that Mr Putin can be trusted to keep promises. No one else does, which is why a security backstop from the US is needed.The mineralsdealthat Kyiv was set to sign with Washington smacks more of a shakedown than a partnership. Mr Trump’s suggestion that American workers mining those resources could be the backstop against further Russian aggression was both a reminder of his priorities and further confirmation that he will not offer anything more substantive. Then came his blistering attack on Mr Zelenskyy.Sunday’s defencesummitof European leaders in London is now more crucial than ever. “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,” wrote the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, following the disastrous meeting. The extent of their erstwhile ally’s betrayal is now undeniable. Kyiv is the first but not the only victim. The extent to which European countries are able to formulate a plan for acting accordingly, and in unison, will be critical to Ukraine’s future, and to the continent’s.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionDonald TrumpUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronEuropean UnionJD VanceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

How can children explore and gain confidence in their creative potential if they can’t test it in an art department, music room or on an assembly hall stage?Receiving support from teachers and practitioners who know from experience how to develop artistic or performative careers can be transformative, but governments of all stripes devalue the arts and humanities in schools and further education, and heads juggling their budget choose not to allocate staffing to art, drama or music.It is much less fair to rely on fortune – perhaps having family members who already work in the relevant field, or living somewhere with access to after-school activities, creative writing workshops or drama groups. For the past 20 years at least, regional theatres, museums, opera companies and those working in arts and culture charities have rightly made huge efforts to widen access and address inequalities.If the culture secretary wants a more diverse workforce in the arts, a good start would be to increase public funding for arts education, particularly in regions where provision is scarce. Presenting the issue as one of upper-class privilege is facile and misleading – sustained investment by government in the next generation of potential cultural leaders now, enabling schools, colleges, cultural organisations and charities that deliver creative programmes to extend their reach, could be the key.Cathy BaxandallIlkley, West YorkshireYour article on the crisis facing working-class creatives highlights the urgent need for sustained public investment in the arts. Without it, we risk shutting out a generation of talent. Exposure to the arts fosters creativity, confidence and critical thinking – skills essential not just for the creative industries, but for every sector. Yet access to theatre is becoming increasingly unequal, with parents and teachers reporting a decline in school trips, particularly in deprived areas where rising transport costs create additional barriers.Theatre staff across the country are working hard to bridge this gap, running outreach programmes, youth drama clubs and creative projects that introduce thousands of young people to the magic of live performance. But without public investment, their impact is limited. That is why the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre are championing theTheatre for Every Childcampaign – to break down barriers to attendance and ensure that all children, regardless of their background, have the chance to engage with live performance.As the culture secretaryrightly said: “Every child and adult should also have the opportunity to access live theatre, dance and music – to believe that these spaces belong to them and are for them.” With proper investment and commitment, we can make that vision a reality.Hannah EssexCo-chief executive, Society of London Theatreand UK TheatreYour article asks why the arts are not an attractive career choice for those from a working-class background. Having served on the boards of two theatres, the greatest problem we faced in hiring staff was the inability to offer competitive salaries. If you come from a less privileged background, why would you opt to work in an industry that would condemn you to live in relative poverty?Raj ParkashLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Little attention is currently paid to manufacturing, perhaps because it comprises only8%of British GDP.The opening of the review focuses on the domestic kettle, Posnett emphasising that the “tocks” of automatic kettles switching off are as significant for us as the nightingale’s song was for John Keats. But despite this cultural significance, no electric kettles are made in Britain now.Posnett’s discussion of the kettle comes from a case study in Minshall’s book. Minshall describes how John Crawshaw Taylor, and his company, Strix Controls, manufacture the thermostats that switch off automatic kettles all over the world. While Taylor invented the modern form of kettle thermostat, he did not invent the automatic kettle. My father, Bill Russell, took out the first patent to switch off a boiling kettle in 1955. With his business partner, Peter Hobbs, he founded Russell Hobbs in 1952 and from 1955 built automatic kettles in a small factory in south London. In 1960, the firm bought out the iconic K2 design, which was in production for 20 years, gracing wedding gift lists well into the 1970s.Protected by patent, Russell Hobbs had a monopoly. Other manufacturers had a strong incentive to get round the Russell Hobbs patent. The man who broke it was John C Taylor in the late 1960s, more than a decade after Russell Hobbs began making automatic kettles. Taylor spotted a flaw in their thermostat patent and devised a way round it. Taylor and Strix have subsequently been successful, rare stories of modern British manufacturing achievement.It is a pity that the postwar generation of British design innovators, epitomised by Bill Russell, have been forgotten. Russell Hobbs persists, as does another British brand, Morphy Richards. John Taylor and James Dyson are famous contemporary inventors and designers. Equally significant earlier industrial designers, such as Bill Russell and Donal Morphy of Morphy Richards, are hardly remembered. Bill and Peter anticipated that they might be forgotten even if their firm survived. They considered themselves mere “household names” rather than notable individuals.I tell their story in my bookHousehold Names: Russell Hobbs and the Automatic Kettle – A Story of Invention and Design.Dr Nicholas RussellEmeritus reader in science communication, Imperial College LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But, four points off fifth place in the Premier League and with a last-16 tie with Club Brugge to relish on Tuesday, all ­feasible ­targets remain on the table.FA Cup fifth round: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreCardiff, six points above the ­relegation zone in the Championship, made Villa work hard for their win but Asensio, on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, was delighted to convert another assist from Marcus Rashford and one from Leon Bailey.Rashford remains in search of his first goal for Villa, and spurned a ­couple of very convertible ­opportunities here but, since he made his Villa debut after joining on loan from Manchester United, no ­Premier League player has created more than his 13 chances.“Marcus is a top player,” ­Asensio said. “We are together not so much but I know what he wants to do, where he passes and I am very happy to have Marcus and all of the teammates.”Emery revealed that part of gambit to entice Asensio to Villa was that he would play in his preferred position. “He’s adapting very well and has a very good opportunity with us here to play as a 10,” the Villa manager said. “He decided in the last window to join us because we planned for him to play in his best position. He’s ­showing us his qualities to link through him with our midfield, ­strikers and ­wingers and has the capacity to score goals too.”The game was preceded by a ­celebration in memory of Peter ­Whittingham, who died five years ago this March after a career in which he represented both these teams with distinction.The 6,500 Cardiff fans, in ­particular, were in fine voice for this rarified occasion. But with John McGinn and Youri Tielemans ­anchoring the Villa midfield, the game soon settled into attack versus defence mode. This made ­penetrating a low block ­challenging, and the ­Cardiff goalkeeper Ethan Horvath performed superbly throughout.Having only returned to the ­Cardiff team for their 1-0 win over Hull City on Tuesday, after the first-choice, Jak Alnwick, was ruled out for the ­season with a hamstring injury, the pick of the American goalkeeper’s saves came from Leon Bailey’s ­piledriver and Ollie Watkins’s point-blank ­volley in the first half and from Rashford’s powerful effort early in the second.“He was brilliant,” Omer Riza, the Cardiff manager, said. “He’s had to show real patience and a great ­character and application [and] had to wait for his chance because Jak’s had a real good season as well. He produced a great performance and deserves all the accolades he gets this evening.”Rashford, it has been reported, has made his mind up he wants to turn his loan from Manchester United into a permanent deal this summer. Although he has impressed to some degree with flashes of his outstanding talent in his first month at Villa Park, he will want to finesse his ­scoring technique if the admiration is to be as strongly mutual. When Bailey got to the byline and flashed over a cross to the far post, Rashford failed to set himself properly and wafted his ­volley over the bar from six yards out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Yousef Salech’s effort from Perry Ng’s cross had squirmed past Emiliano Martínez, the roof might have come off the visitors’ stand.Instead the Villa fans were ­celebrating moments later as ­Asensio gave the Premier League side the lead. Tielemans spotted ­Rashford’s run and lofted his pass into the left channel perfectly for the England striker to square a pass first time for his fellow loanee to half-volley home.The clinching goal arrived 10 ­minutes from time when Bailey pulled a cross back from the right byline and, after Watkins ­dummied, the former Real Madrid forward ­slotted the ball calmly into the ­bottom corner.Explore more on these topicsFA CupAston VillaCardiff Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Maksym Talovierov, known as Maxi, is detailing the sobering reality of life sinceRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “It’s really hard because for three years every morning I wake up and I see a lot of notifications about rockets and missiles in every city, including Kyiv, where my parents are,” the Plymouth defender says. “I text them immediately to see how they’re doing. ‘Are you in the [underground] car park? Are you in the metro?’ Because when they [Russia] are bombing and it’s dangerous, that’s where they go because they are the closest things to safe zones.”The 24-year-old has not seen his mother, Maryna, and father, Vadym, a former professional footballer, for three and a half years. “Sometimes they might not have a connection or wifi and then it’s stressful because they don’t respond and you don’t know what’s going on. On the news it might say: ‘In this area of Kyiv, five rockets.’ But you never know exactly where.Miron Muslic: ‘Real life is a lot more difficult than playing a football game’Read more“Yeah,” Talovierov says, taking a breath, “it’s a really hard situation. Some of our soldiers are my friends, friends of friends, parents of international teammates. They joined the army to help our country and I appreciate it a lot.”There will be 7,800 Plymouth fans in the away end at Manchester City on Saturday evening keen to show Talovierov support in theFA Cupfifth round. He has already felt the love around the place he now calls home. He tells a story about a couple sparing him a wasted walk into the city centre to create a bank account. “About 50 metres before the bank I realised that I forgot my passport,” he says. “Some fans who recognised me and wanted to have a picture said: ‘If you need anything, we can always help you.’ So I said: ‘Guys, can you please drop me to my hotel and back because I forgot my passport?’ The man moved to the back seat: ‘Maxi, sit here in the front seat, my wife will drop you back.’ They shared a lot of stories about the history of the club and the city during these five minutes in the car.”The ponytailed centre-back, a £1.4m buy from the Austrian club Lask, has earned cult-hero status among Plymouth supporters in the 28 days since he became the Championship club’s record signing. He completed his medical at Home Park at midnight, signed his contract at 1am and returned for training hours later. His debut came the next day in a victory against West Brom. Before his man-of-the-match performance he limbered up by doing press-ups in the tunnel and during the game he toasted perfectly timed challenges with double fist-pumps. “This match will be in my head until my last days. The following evening I was just walking around the streets and fans were screaming at me: ‘Maxi! Maxi!’ I had a hat on so I don’t even know how they realised it was me.”View image in fullscreenMaksym Talovierov tackles Liverpool’s Luis Díaz in Plymouth’s famous FA Cup win.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersThere were more hulking celebrations after thwarting Luis Díaz and Kostas Tsimikas when Plymouthshocked Liverpool in the previous round. The council lit Smeaton’s Tower on Plymouth Hoe in a green hue to mark the occasion.“Sometimes I don’t remember doing it [celebrating] … then I see videos when scrolling TikTok or Instagram reels and I’m surprised: ‘Ooo, I don’t remember.’ I don’t even recognise that it’s me. I might remember the tackle but not the celebration. I really like that it comes from my soul. When the fans cheer, it just goes inside of me,” he says, slowly raising both hands towards his chest. “I don’t think about it before games: ‘When I defend, I will scream.’ No, I’m very emotional on the pitch. You never know when it will come to you.”Another Plymouth defender, Nikola Katic, lost one of his front teeth in the heat of battle against Liverpool, though the groundsman discovered it post-match. “But I think he was still happy … we were all laughing about it. Niko is a warrior; he doesn’t worry about these things. After the game I slept a few hours because I was so tired and then all night I couldn’t sleep because of this adrenaline in my head. I think we didn’t even have enough energy to celebrate much because we were so tired. Against teams like Liverpool you have to be concentrated, focused all the time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My parents lost their business in Donetsk because it was captured and moved to Kyiv to help me.”Now Vadym, who watched one of his son’sgames at Euro 2024from the safety of a Kyiv underground station while Russia bombed the city, works as Talovierov’s analyst. “He is preparing a lot of information about the [opposition] strikers, my strengths, my weaknesses, good and bad things. From the age of seven, he was at every training session, he would join in the training and then just watch, analyse and on the way home from the stadium he would highlight good moments, bad moments and the things I needed to improve. Sometimes I was really angry because when you’re a teenager listening to advice you think you’re always right. Now I understand how important it was.”A possible duel with Haaland awaits. “A few months ago I played on the PlayStation as Haaland and as them [City]. Last year I played Fifa more and I really loved him because I played a lot with him in my Ultimate Team.” For Talovierov, the ultimate inspiration is Virgil van Dijk, whom he played against whenLask faced Liverpoolin the Europa League in 2023-24. After Talovierov missed out on Van Dijk’s shirt in Austria, the Dutchman promised to give him his shirt at Anfield.Preston and Burnley’s FA Cup clash evokes memories of a golden ageRead moreVan Dijk stayed true to his word. “One of my teammates wanted to take the jersey from Virgil but Virgil said: ‘No, no, no, because I promised Maxi,’ and he pointed at me. I was really surprised because it was two months later and imagine how many players ask Virgil for his jersey. He showed me the person I want to be in a few years, and that if I promise something, I will do it.”Talovierov is one of several Ukraine internationals flying the flag for their country in England, including Illia Zabarnyi at Bournemouthand Oleksandr Zinchenko at Arsenal. He is good friends with Mykhailo Mudryk of Chelsea. “I know [Andriy] Shevchenko and Zinchenko created a charity match [Game4Ukraine] at Stamford Bridge. I know Mudryk helps a lot but you will not find it in newspapers. I don’t know one player who doesn’t want to help. Everyone does their maximum to help.”Talovierov is softly spoken but makes his point. “Of course, every day is so hard and sometimes you try to find a few things to make you smile a bit. It would be easy to be serious and think about the war all the time but then you can destroy yourself mentally. Hopefully it will finish as fast as possible and we will win. It will finish how we want. Hopefully.”Explore more on these topicsPlymouth ArgyleFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This Champions Trophy was always make or break for England’s white-ball captain and, after two defeats extinguished any semi-final hopes, the latter won out.The cat was pretty much out of the bag two nights earlier in Lahore when, slightly shell-shocked from England’sfailed run chase against Afghanistan, Buttler said he would be considering his future.When a captain begins openly asking whether they are “part of the problem”– Buttler’s words that evening – the story rarely ends any other way.Jos Buttler steps down as captain of England’s white-ball cricket teamRead moreAfter arriving in Karachi 24 hours later, scene of Saturday’s final group game against South Africa, Buttler flicked McCullum a message asking him to come to his room for a chat. Knowing what this was likely to mean, the head coach initially thought about persuading him otherwise. Instead, stopping to think for a moment, McCullum accepted it was time.Thereafter it was about informing the players, the pair announcing it in the team room at the hotel the next day before the bus set off for training. Joe Root was originally slated to speak to the media, with the sight of Buttler and McCullum striding across the floodlit outfield offering the first hint that something more significant was coming.The good news, McCullum stressed, is that after leading the team out one last time, Buttler intends to carry on as a player. As well as flatlining results, and the loss of two world titles in the past 18 months, this may be the crux. The runs have worryingly dried up for Buttler at the past three major events but, even aged 34 and with his market value in the franchise world still high, he remains unsated in an England shirt.To that end, Buttler said he wanted to learn from Joe Root on how best to operate as a former captain. Root’s time in charge of the Test team – the final days of which bore striking similarities to these past few weeks – has been followed by some of the most golden years of his career under Ben Stokes. Right now, England having lost their aura in white-ball cricket, they need their premier white-ball batter to do the same.Under whom is the question here, even if Harry Brook, the vice-captain who led the team against Australia last summer, appears the likeliest choice. McCullum said he would take “a couple of weeks” to decide but, with the schedule starting to ease, the New Zealander believes that being a multi-format player, as Brook is, should be no impediment.View image in fullscreenEngland need Jos Buttler to find his form with the bat again after some diminishing returns during his captaincy.Photograph: KM Chaudary/APThings had started so brightly for Buttler too. After serving his apprenticeship as Eoin Morgan’s deputy duringEngland’s thunderous four-year charge to World Cup gloryin 2019, he took the role full-time in 2022. Later that year, alongside a new head coach in Matthew Mott,Buttler lifted the T20 World Cup in Australia. Even with a suspicion that all this was built on the foundations laid by Morgan, the good times appeared set to roll on.English cricket has a history of struggling to win on all fronts, however. Once the Test side led by Ben Stokes and McCullum took over as the priority, the bilateral white-ball series morphed into proving grounds as the big names rested. England then tried to throw much of the old band back together for the World Cup defence in India, hoping the same music would flow. Instead,what they got was a succession of bum notes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What followed summed up a dismal campaign as a whole,Heinrich Klaasen delivering the kind of brain-boiling centurythat was suddenly beyond England’s fading world champions.Rob Key, the team director who initially hired Mott as a light touch foil for the all-powerful Morgan, offered the pair a second chance at last year’s T20 World Cup. The journey toa semi-final defeat at the hands of Indiawas unconvincing to say the least, Buttler increasingly tetchy in public, no team of note beaten, and the tactics baffling at times.Out went Mott, Key expanding McCullum’s brief in the hope it would defibrillate results, as occurred with the Test team. Instead, nine defeats from 10 has brought his methods into question almost immediately. Little wonder, having briefly thought about dissuading Buttler the captain, McCullum found the idea of resuscitating the batter more appealing.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamJos ButtlerCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

It has sought legal advice from leading international law firm Pinsents, and insists any such move to bring back Wood would fall foul of its own constitution, as well as Sport England’s Code for Sports Governance.The RFL told clubs that the appointment of Wood or any individual currently in position at a competing club would amount to “multiple breaches” of the sport’s governance requirements and could lead to severe financial ramifications. They also allegeIt also claims that any attempt to appoint Wood would be “impossible” under the sport’s Articles of Association and such a move would immediately be revoked.But perhaps most tellingly, clubs were warned that, if such a move succeeded, it would lead to major financial implications for a sport already wrestling with a changing monetary landscape. Failure to adhere to Sport England’s code, according to the RFL, could put at risk the £3.4m funding rugby league currently receives every year, with talks ongoing on securing more funding over the next 12 months.And the RFL also stressed that it would potentially compromise the terms of a long-term loan arrangement with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport secured during the pandemic. The sport currently owes around £4.5m and if that money was liable to be repaid immediately, coupled with the loss of Sport England funding, it would result in a black hole of more than £7m, it claimed.The governing body told clubs: “This will potentially have catastrophic financial consequences for the RFL, its members and stakeholders.” It subsequently described the proposals as “unlawful” and “unreasonable” in the view of its legal counsel, and said it is under no obligation to put the planned proposals forward before members.Johnson’s immediate removal as chair is understood to have support, irrespective of whether or not the plans to bring back Wood succeed. A counter-proposal by the RFL suggesting Johnson will step down before the end of 2025 will be heard at the same meeting with the RFL agreeing to a strategic review of the sport: but only with the governing body’s input into the appointment of the relevant individuals.However, the clubs driving the proposals – led by Leigh’s Derek Beaumont and Leeds’s Gary Hetherington – want to be solely responsible for appointing any committee tasked with reviewing rugby league’s governance. Beaumont, in further emails seen by the Guardian, wrote to clubs on Thursday insisting the RFL was “trying to alarm” members by warning of grave financial consequences.In a statement, the RFL said it had shared supporting papers for its spring council meeting according to process, adding: “New papers include an explanation, from the RFL Board, of the submission of a board resolution to be considered before the four member resolutions, following legal advice on the potential impact of the member resolutions.“This paper explains why the board has submitted its own resolutions, which aim to demonstrate that the Board has listened to the concerns of blubs and is willing to enable discussion of changes, provided it is in accordance with good governance and ensures smooth and stable leadership.“The Board and Executive must always remain fully focused on strong governance and the future health of the sport and will continue to listen to and engage with members and stakeholders.”Leigh Leopards, Batley Bulldogs and Leeds Rhinos have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Palace are through to the Women’s FA Cup quarter-finals, in which they travel to Chelsea on 9 March.In their inaugural WSL season the London club have won one game and drawn three but there had been a widespread feeling externally that the side had performed well in attempting to bridge the gap between the second and top tiers.PosTeamPGDPts1Chelsea Women1433402Man Utd Women1421333Arsenal Women1425304Man City Women1416285Brighton & Hove Albion Women14-5186Tottenham Hotspur Women14-12177Liverpool FC Women14-11158West Ham Women14-9149Everton Women14-101310Leicester Women14-101211Aston Villa Women14-121012Crystal Palace Women14-266Last term Bristol City were relegated straight back to the Championship with six points, a tally Palace equalled by drawing at Brighton on 2 February in their most recent WSL match. But they have not won in the league since 6 October and remain the favourites to be relegated.Parish said: “This has been an extremely difficult decision for the club to take. Laura has made a fantastic impact since arriving in the summer of 2023, getting the club promoted to the WSL for the first time in its history. Laura has given her all, on and off the pitch, and she leaves here with all of our thanks and best wishes for the future.”Kaminski’s exit follows WSL manager changes this season at Arsenal, Aston Villa and Liverpool. The Liverpool interim manager, Amber Whiteley, has said she will put her name forward to become their full-time manager. The former Liverpool academy coach, who was Beard’s assistant, said: “I’ll put my name in the hat.”As revealed by the Guardian, it is likely she will be in interim charge for the rest of this season. “That’s the indication I’ve been given,” Whiteley said, “but obviously that recruitment process has already started.“There are always mixed emotions when a manager leaves a club – it’s never an easy thing to go through. But the players have been absolutely brilliant today, the way they’ve responded and turned their focus to Palace at the weekend.

The club represent a pretty village an hour’s drive south of Oslo, fielding teams from the under-14 age group down. Their goals are modest but of the kind that nourish an entire sport: to provide a safe and welcoming environment in which the community’s youngsters can play. There are hurdles to overcome, such as a need for up-to-date artificial pitches and the challenge of increasing participation among girls.On Saturday afternoon, though, Skoppum and Norway’s 1,700 grassroots clubs will be asked to make a decision that could cause shockwaves far beyond their country. They will gather online or at Oslo’s Ullevaal Stadion for the Norwegian Football Federation’s (NFF) annual general assembly and are entitled to vote on whether video assistant referees are scrapped in the highest division, Eliteserien. It will conclude a saga that has ripped at the domestic game’s fabric. The top two tiers have voted for the technology to be discontinued but, in the final stage of an outwardly democratic process that many believe has been the opposite, the clubs whose lives it barely touches are in effect tasked with the final say.Norway on verge of abolishing VAR from domestic leagues after club voteRead more“It surprises us that we’re being dragged into this,” the Skoppum chairman, Kenneth Laumb, says. “It’s something that only affects the top clubs in Norway. We appreciate that there’s a democracy in Norwegian football where clubs, even of our size, can help decide big issues but this isn’t one that we feel we should have been involved in. It feels like we’re being used as pawns in a power game.”Last month Norway’s top 32 clubs recommended, by a margin of 19 to 13, that VAR be scrapped. Each had held a meeting of its members to decide how to vote. The expectation was that the NFF, which had encouraged a vote after extensive protests inside stadiums and promised to give weight to its outcome, would mirror that recommendation but instead it proposed the technology be retained.The thoughts of clubs further down the pyramid will decide everything. Such is the level of discontent that, whereas grassroots outfits tend to side with the NFF’s proposals and as few as 10% traditionally turn up to the general assembly, all bets are off this time. Many local sides may mirror the stance of their nearest top-flight club, and Skoppum are far from the only ones disgruntled at being hauled in to the sharp end of an impassioned debate.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Vålerenga protest against VAR in August 2023.Photograph: Frode Arnesen/Alamy“We feel our involvement is pointless,” says Jørgen Grydeland, general manager of the suburban Oslo club Oppsal IF. “It did not require a democratic decision from the grassroots clubs when VAR was introduced. This was decided through a Teams meeting with the top clubs. If VAR had been introduced through a democratic process with grassroots clubs back then, it would have felt more natural to decide VAR’s future fate in 2025.“This is no longer about VAR itself; it’s about trust in the NFF, how they undermine democratic processes and create a distance between themselves, grassroots clubs and their supporters.”There is a sense the NFF and its president, Lise Klaveness, widely feted as a progressive figure for much of her tenure, simply refuse to lose the argument. They are hugely reluctant to diverge from a continent in which, with Sweden a notable exception, VAR has become a highly controversial staple. “It feels like the NFF has kept moving the goalposts whenever they see they’re losing the battle over VAR,” Laumb says.This week a pro-VAR interview with Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees’ committee, appeared on the website of domestic television rights holder TV2. It had been organised by the NFF. In advance of Saturday’s vote, leaders of the federation’s 18 district associations came out in favour of its continuation. They had seemingly been whipped into line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot of supporters believe they were lied to, that this has all been just for show and not a real process, and that everything was decided ahead of it.”Using the hashtag#BreddenMotVAR[grassroots against VAR], a number of grassroots clubs have been cohering their rebellion online. The hope is that it energises those who would not ordinarily engage with the vote. Skoppum have held a board meeting and confirmed that they want VAR to be discontinued. A similar process has driven Oppsal’s decision. “What I can say is that we will not vote for VAR,” Grydeland says. There are more relevant matters at play for Oppsal, who have more than 100 teams at various levels: they have tabled a proposal that involves removing transfer fees for youth and amateur players.Laumb and Grydeland fear a majority will land in favour of keeping VAR, although many other voices around Norwegian football believe the issue is delicately poised. Perhaps Norway will break ranks and, to the disquiet of governing bodies elsewhere, stoke appetites for other countries to follow suit.“Ignoring the majority now risks pushing more people away from the sport,” Laumb says. “We believe football is about joy, community and fairness, not technology that overcomplicates the game and silences the roar of the crowd. Let’s give the sport back to those who live for it.”The NFF was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsVideo assistant referees (VARs)European club footballFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cop16 president Susana Muhamad wept as she brought down the gavel on the agreement outlining a roadmap for nature finance. The agreement broke a deadlock at UN talks seen as a test for international cooperation inthe face of geopolitical tensions.Despite some wins, difficult questions were kicked down the road, including the creation of a new fund to distribute money, and significant issues including nature-destroying subsidies and cutting pollution have not progressed.Scientists have long warned that action is urgent. A million of the world’s species are threatened with extinction, while unsustainable farming and consumption destroy forests, deplete soils and spread plastic pollution to even themost remote areas of the planet.More than half of countries are ignoring biodiversity pledges – analysisRead moreKey decisions were adopted in the final minutes of the last day of rebooted negotiations at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome.Muhamad called it a “historic day”, and added: “We achieved the adoption of the first global plan to finance the conservation of life on Earth.”A number of leaders called the agreement a victory for cooperation. “Our efforts show that multilateralism can present hope at a time of geopolitical uncertainty,” said Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s minister of environment and climate change.Jean-Luc Crucke, Belgium’s climate and ecological transition minister, agreed. “Today we are in a world that is politically changing,” he said. “And not always in the right direction.”He said that getting the agreement over the line proved that multilateralism was still working, and added: “So there is a great significance to these negotiations.”Crucke described the Cop negotiations as the “least bad” process. If we really want to save nature, he said, “there is no other solution than this one”.Q&AWhat is Cop16 and why is it reconvening?ShowEvery two years, representatives from around the world meet to discuss UN targets to halt nature loss by 2030. The gathering is formally known as the conference of the parties of the UN convention on biological diversity – shortened in this case to Cop16, as it is the 16th meeting.The last gathering was in Cali, Colombia, last November, but themeeting ended in chaoswith key issues left unresolved. From 25 to 27 February in Rome, parties will gather for an additional meeting to finish those negotiations, and tackle the most divisive issue: money.The main topics being discussed include who will pay for conservation and how to distribute the money. Delegates are also set to agree on a monitoring framework, so countries can be held to account on their progress on meeting thebiodiversity targetsfor this decade.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The decision comes more than two years after a landmark deal to slow the rampant destruction of nature this decade and protect at least 30% of the world’s land and seas. That would protect ecosystems and wildlife that humans rely on for food,climate regulationand economic prosperity.View image in fullscreenThe US and other countries did not turn up to the Rome summit.Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty ImagesThe meeting comes as countries face a range of challenges, from trade disputes and debt worries to the slashing of overseas aid – particularly by the Trump administration.Washington, which has not signed up to the UN’s convention on biological diversity, did not send representatives to the meeting.Seals, sharks and spiny squat lobsters: Underwater Photographer of the Year 2025 – in picturesRead moreBut others at the summit expressed frustration at the agreement’s lack of ambition when it comes to the environmental crisis. The negotiator from Bolivia, Juan Carlos Alurralde Tejada, raised concerns about the text “diluting” commitments to biodiversity and opening the path to an “indefinite discussion” on who will pay for conservation and how to distribute the money.“Biodiversity cannot wait for a bureaucratic process that lasts for ever, while the environmental crisis continues to get worse,” Alurralde said. “Forests are burning, rivers are in agony and animals are disappearing.”Meanwhile, the overarching ambition to halt nature loss by 2030 is looking more difficult to reach, with global wildlife populations havingplunged by more than 70%between 1970 and 2020, according to the most recent assessment, with no sign of slowing.“Honestly, it’s almost impossible when you see the trends of where things are going,” said Max Fontaine, environment and development minister in Madagascar, one of the most biodiverse countries. “We are not going in the right direction, we all need to strengthen efforts.”Five years to implement the biodiversity targets was not enough, said the Liberian negotiator, Datuama Cammue, who believed the UN process had been too slow. “It will take a lot of financial input and expert input to get it done. With this type of spirit, I really don’t think that it’s possible.”View image in fullscreenDelegates at the opening of Cop16 in Rome, Italy, 25 February.Photograph: Mike Muzurakis/IISDThe failure to finalise an agreement in Cali was the first in a string of disappointing outcomes at environmental summits last year.A climate finance deal atCop29 in Azerbaijanin November was criticised by developing countries as woefully insufficient, while separate negotiations about desertification and plastic pollution stalled in December.Countries had already agreed to deliver $200bn (£159bn) a year in finance for nature by 2030, including $30bn a year from wealthier countries to poorer ones.As of 2022 (the latest year for which data is available and before the Cop15 deal was signed), wealthy countries that signed the agreement had provided $10.95bn in biodiversity funding, according to the report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and Campaign for Nature.Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, Norway’s climate and environment minister, said countries had a “big, big job ahead” to meet the 2030 finance goal. “We have to do everything we can to meet those targets,” he said, adding that it was important to be ambitious in climate and biodiversity targets. He said: “Ambitious is not the same as impossible.”Thursday’s decision sets out two main strands of action in the coming years – finding the extra billions of dollars in funding for biodiversity; and deciding on the institutions that will deliver the money.Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns at the Zoological Society of London, said the finance roadmap was a “key milestone” but stressed that money is needed urgently.“With only five years left to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, securing the necessary funds to accomplish this mission is more essential than ever,” she said.What has been agreed?‘Agreeing to agree’ on a new fundMany developing countries demanded a new bank account to distribute nature finance. They argue that the current fund – which sits within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) – is too burdensome to access and is controlled by wealthy nations. This was the subject of the most tense negotiations.“Agreeing to agree is maybe not sexy,” said Bernadette Fischler Hooper, global advocacy lead at WWF, “but it is a big achievement.” She added: “We’re going to live to fight another day. That is exactly what that is about.”Countries will agree what to do on the new fund in 2028. In the meantime, all options are on the table – it could be a new fund, or an existing fund that has been made more palatable.Roadmap for producing cashThe headline figure agreed on by countries at Cop15 in 2022 was togenerate $200bn a year in nature finance. Developed nations committed to delivering $20bn in international biodiversity finance by 2025 – a deadline that has not yet been met. Negotiators agreed a roadmap to raising the money, which includes looking for new forms of finance as well as a push for development banks to increase spending on biodiversity.For the first time there will be an “international dialogue” between ministers of finance and environment (as happens within the UN climate framework) which will make sure that finance for biodiversity is not siloed within environmental ministries. Brian O’Donnell, director of Campaign for Nature, described it as a “highlight of this deal”.Monitoring progressCop17 in 2026 will be about measuring how countries are doing relative to their targets. In Rome they signed off what indicators they will use to submit their national reports. “The monitoring framework will allow us to do the accountability process at the next Cop,” said Chandler.Launch of Cali fundThe Cali fund is a way to distribute money from companies who benefit from nature’s genetics. The fund was launched with nothing pledged, but the UN said commitments were coming “very soon”. According to the agreement, companies that met two of three criteria – sales of more than $50m (£39m), profits of more than $5m, and $20m in total assets – would need to contribute 1% of profits or 0.1% of their revenue to the fund.The deal is voluntary and governments will need to introduce the rules domestically for it to have teeth.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCop16The age of extinctionBiodiversityConservationWildlifeUnited NationsConservation and indigenous peopleClimate aidnewsShareReuse this content"

They may soon be again, after the government announced on Friday it would approve thefirst wild beaver releasesin England for hundreds of years.Walking to the edge of Jones’s farm, you can feel the soil start to get damper. Lush blades of grass – perfect for his cattle – grow around fat splodges of frogspawn as pasture slowly gives way to wetland.That, along with the half-munched willow branches strewn across the ground, is a sure sign you are entering the realm of the beaver.View image in fullscreenThe first wild beaver releases in England could happen this autumn.Photograph: Josh HarissWalk further on and you can hear the gentle trickling of the water moving through the series of dams built by the industrious rodents, and see glassy pools around lichen-covered trees. At the very top of the enclosure is a magnificent pond, featuring two beaver lodges. This furry couple clearly decided it needed two homes. “I’m not sure what thecouncil tax situationis for them,” Jones jokes.The beaver enclosure was once wet pasture and became a wildlife area with the pond – though before its rodent inhabitants moved in it was about a third of its current size. “I still bring the animals in to graze sometimes, particularly when it’s dry,” Jones said. “There is no conflict between livestock and beaver.”The habitat is stunning, with wetland areas of various depths and rivulets of water flowing at different speeds. There are shallow areas lined with gravel which make perfect fish nurseries, and lush vegetation that will be humming with invertebrate life come spring. The birds clearly like it – as we walk past, woodcock stir from the bushes and fly off.But Jones is not satisfied with this awe-inspiring habitat. He yearns to free his beavers. “This really is a postage stamp,” he sighs. “If we could let them out, we could have this landscape all the way down to the sea. The water companies and theEnvironment Agencyshould be all over it.”View image in fullscreenA beaver dam during a period of high flow. Beavers can build dams quickly.Photograph: Joshua Glavin/PAThis is because beavers operate a free water treatment facility. Our rivers are deluged with nitrates and other pollutants from human and animal waste. Researchers from the University of Cambridge studied Jones’s farm and found that the river fed from the beaver enclosure had 80% lower levels of nitrates compared to farther upstream.Though farmers like Jones can have beavers in enclosures on their land, and there have been some illegally released in England, it has not – until now – been lawful to release them into the wild.Jones has been on the farm all his life. Initially it was beef and dairy, and now he just rears beef cattle. The farm has always been organic, which he credits to his father’s old-fashioned prewar farming methods, before pesticides became prevalent. Since taking over the farm 20 years ago, Jones has moved from organic to grass-only – and begun rewilding in earnest.“I’ve doubled the soil carbon since I started this rewilding thing,” he says proudly. “I don’t trim my hedges, and 60% of the farm is now agroforestry – cows grazing around trees. This leaves grass undisturbed which gives habitat for small mammals, like voles and mice. These in turn have brought birds of prey, which feed on them, to the farm. As a result I’ve seen barn owls come to the farm for the first time in my lifetime – 65 years.”He says his farm is as economically productive as t was before he started bringing nature back “I am trying to be as productive as possible while seeing how far we can go with rewilding. We need to eat but we also need lots and lots of wildlife. I think we can achieve both these aims.”View image in fullscreenTwo beavers engage in mutual grooming.Photograph: Elliot McCandless/PAMost farmers will tell you nature has disappeared from the countryside in recent decades. Jones has seen it on his land since childhood. “I’m very aware of the wildlife we have lost over the years, particularly bird species which have just gone, curlews and grey partridge, for example,” he says. “It’s bloody distressing. But this feels like bringing something back and making a small difference.”Introducing beavers was a natural progression. Jones started researching what other farmers were doing and came across some writing by the UK’s leadingbeaver guru Derek Gow. “It sounded like getting beavers was a total no-brainer. It makes the river more interesting, increases biodiversity, is good for fish and it reduces flooding. It sounded like we could really turbocharge what we were already doing.”So he got in touch with Gow and decided to build a beaver enclosure on his land with the help of CornwallWildlifeTrust and some scientists at the University of Exeter. The beavers were released in 2017. “We released them on the Friday and by Sunday they’d already started damming,” Jones says.The beavers have helped Jones a lot in recent years. In 2022, England was hit by a severe drought meaning the grass dried up and many farmers had to give winter feed to their livestock as there was nothing for them to graze. Jones did not have this problem. “We pumped water from the beaver pond, and in that bad drought we actually had more water in our pond than at any other time – the beavers built the dam up higher because they were able to work with the lighter flow of the stream.”Beaver releases into wild to be allowed in England for first time in centuriesRead moreIt’s not just Jones and other beaver fanatics who make this claim about the rodents’ ability to create anti-flood infrastructure; arecent reportby the government body the Environment Agency into ways to prevent flooding recommended the release of beavers. They can save the government money, too – in the Czech Republic, a family of beaversrecently builta dam themselves. This infrastructure was due to cost the government £1m – and the beavers did it for free.Jones says more farmers need to get on board with beavers. “Some farmers really have their head in the sand. We really need to adapt to climate breakdown, and make our land more resilient. Storing water is part of that – we can’t keep carrying on like before.”Gesturing to the margins of his field that have been flooded by the beavers, he said: “There are some farmers who would see this and have a heart attack. They would think I was nuts. But firstly, this is the land of least agricultural value, and secondly during a drought they would all be jealous as this is the best grazing in town.”The idea of a farmer bringing beavers to the quiet countryside perturbed some neighbours and incensed others. But most have come around. Jones has calculated that 10,000 people have come to visit his beavers since 2017 – and they all need places to stay, and pubs to eat and drink in.“We’ve brought business to the pub and the village. We aren’t making anyone millionaires, but there is definitely a gentle uptick in the economy,” Jones said. “Some people absolutely loathe my beavers, there are a few very serious dairy farmers who are enraged by them, as they take the occasional tree down. Also, to begin with our neighbour who runs a riding stables hated the beavers but then realised their clients were so overjoyed when they saw a beaver on their ride, that they realised beavers are actually good for business.”Another benefit Jones’s beavers have brought to the local area is an alleviation of flooding. “Our beaver area holds a huge amount of water, and their leaky dams slow the flow and stop the village from flooding. In 2013, before we got the beavers, it flooded twice in two months. It really should only flood once a decade.” Poor river management – straightening watercourses so water drains off the land and sluices down into the village below – has exacerbated the problem.Fans of Falmouth oysters should also thank Jones and his beavers. “Going into the enclosure you see just how much silt they have stored here,” Jones says. “That silt would normally have gone down the river into the oyster beds on Falmouth bay.”They make Jones happy, too. “I go down to the enclosure by myself sometimes, it is a very nice thing to sit there in the evening and I’ve had some extraordinarily close encounters – the beavers get very curious when it’s just me and come straight up to me. It’s been very fulfilling.View image in fullscreenBeaver damning in a rewilded part of Derek Gow’s farm in Devon.Photograph: Alexander Turner/The Guardian“The first time I saw a beaver was when it was in a cage in the back of Derek Gow’s van, ready to be introduced on to my farm,” he reminisces. “It was just extraordinary.”When they were released, Jones felt elated. “It just felt like the most incredibly positive thing to be doing.”And the beavers made quick work of bringing nature back to his farm. “I had no idea how fast they’d work but we have had 11 or 12 bird records, we now have 11 species of bats, 17 of dragonflies, the fish have all increased in size. When you see it happen in front of your face, it is just extraordinary. They are the ultimate bringers of life.”After this initial excitement, progress to return the beaver to Cornwall has been a lot slower than Jones hoped for. “We wanted to end up starting something that ends up with beavers across Cornwall. But it has taken longer than we thought because Defra has sat on it for so long.”Jones isn’t stopping at beavers. He wants to bring storks back to Cornwall next. “I’m part of something called the Cornwall Stork Project and we are trying to get some stork colonies set up across the country. They are utterly fascinating and we have lots of food for them here – frogs, toads, grasshoppers and worms.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeConservationMammalsFarmingRiversCornwallFloodingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Severe Tropical Cyclone Alfred formed on 20 February in the Coral Sea to the north-east of Australia, reaching an intensity equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on Thursday with sustained winds of 105mph (170km/h) and gusts at about 140mph.Alfred is tracking south, moving roughly parallel to theQueenslandcoast, and warnings have been issued for strong winds and rough seas. Though Alfred is not expected to make landfall, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring the cyclone as it remains uncertain how close it will pass by the coast.Farther east in the south-west Pacific, there were two shorter-lived storms, Rae and Seru, which reached a maximum intensity equivalent to a category 2 hurricane. Tropical Cyclone Rae developed just north of Fiji on 22 February before travelling south across the island. Tropical Cyclone Seru formed on 24 February over the southernmostSolomon Islands, travelling southwards and passing to the east of Vanuatu and New Caledonia.While Seru remained offshore, Rae caused significant damage to some Fijian islands, owing to a combination of flood waters from heavy rain, gusts of about 100mph, and huge waves.Severe Tropical Cyclone Bianca, which formed in the Timor Sea to the north-west of Australia, was active between 18 and 27 February in the south-east Indian Ocean, during which time it travelled west before veering south, allowing it to curve around the continent without making landfall. This cyclone had a peak intensity equivalent to a category 3 hurricane.And in the south-west Indian Ocean, two more cyclones are bracketingMadagascar, both of which developed on Monday. The category 3-equivalent Intense Tropical Cyclone Garance formed to the north-east of Madagascar and travelled south. After passing to the west of Mauritius, Garance will affect the French island of Réunion on Friday, with 120mph gusts and up to 600mm of rain.Meanwhile, the category 1-equivalent Severe Tropical Storm Honde formed in theMozambiquechannel and travelled south-east, where it is skirting the southern tip of Madagascar.Though infrequent, it is far from unusual for this many named storms to exist concurrently. A far rarer occurrence is for this many to occur within a single ocean basin.The Pacific Ocean has recorded six simultaneous named storms on just one occasion, in August 1974, while the Atlantic record is five, set in September 1971.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsWeather trackerQueenslandMadagascarPacific islandsSolomon IslandsMozambiqueAfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Scientistshave been asked by the UK government to forecastwhat this means for British food supply and predict potentially dangerous tipping points that lie ahead.While the UK already has milder winters because of warmer seas and heavier rain because of extra moisture in the atmosphere, this investigation is about what is happening under the waves. Already fishers are travelling ever further north to catch British favourites such as cod and haddock, and some salmon stocks face extinction.Anchovy, bluefin tuna, sardines, squid and red mulletare already replacing these speciesand fishers need British consumers’ culinary tastes to change if they are to make a living marketing these new species.But more dangerous changes may also be afoot. The increasing acidity of the seas caused by greater carbon dioxide absorption might kill some marine species and the melting Arctic ice has the potential to switch off vital currents such as the Gulf Stream.These dramatic changes could cause the loss of one of the UK’s major food sources. This fear has led the government to fund this new research aimed at predicting when these dangerous climate tipping points might occur.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeatherwatchWildlifeFishClimate crisisFishingFishing industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it was to drop by 40%, the amount overall aid is falling, it would lead to many hundreds of thousands of otherwise preventable deaths.Chart showing top recipients of UK aidThe Foreign Office says no decision on specific programmes will be taken before next month’s spending review, and pointed to Keir Starmer’s pledge to particularly support vaccination efforts, as well as relief in areas such as Sudan and Gaza. However, aid officials are braced for a potentially significant cut.While the reduction is from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027, given nearly a third of this is spent on housing asylum seekers in the UK,experts have saidthe amount spent overseas could end up being as little as 0.23%, the lowest proportion since records began.This has caused particular alarm given it comes after Donald Trumpin effect shut downthe United States Agency for International Development (USAid), halting much of its own vaccination work.The UK has given Gavi more than £2bn over the past four years. The US has also previously been a key funder, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Aid campaigners argue it has proved to be hugely cost-effective in its work. Gavi’s statistics show that it has vaccinated more than 1.1 billion children across 78 countries in its 25 years of operation, preventing nearly 18m deaths.“Reducing UK funding for Gavi would be fiscally easy, but disastrous,” one aid agency official said. “It would cost large numbers of lives – there is no way around that.”A Gavi spokesperson said the alliance was “heartened” to hear Starmer mention vaccination as a priority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s why they make no economic sense either | Larry ElliottRead moreDoing this would be “reversing years of progress, leaving the world less secure in face of inevitable future emergencies, and setting countries back on their pathway to self-sufficiency”, the spokesperson said.Also at risk is the British Council, whichwarned last monthit faced potential budget cuts of £250m, which would remove its presence in up to 40 countries, a legacy of commercial interest rates charged on Covid-era loans from the government.Scott McDonald, the council’s chief executive, said while defence spending was needed, “we must not forget the importance of building alliances and global influence through soft power activity, which supports the UK’s security objectives, through which the British Council has a proven track record in countering disinformation, building media literacy and supporting cohesion”.It was, he added, “critical that the simultaneous cuts to the aid budget are not delivered in a way that damages the UK’s reputation and soft power”.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyVaccines and immunisationKeir StarmerAnneliese DoddsLabourDefence policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

And we also saw a very strong recovery in business travel onboard in the transatlantic in the second half of the year,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, affluent tourists are boosting its margins, and Doyle said BA was devoting ever more space to premium economy, with 15% more seats in the mid-range cabin than in 2019.While analyst consensus is that IAG’s price will climb higher, some warned of the risks ahead with Donald Trump in the White House. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, a business recovery consultancy, said: “Despite current successes, IAG must remain wary of the potential headwinds of a volatile geopolitical climate, the possible impact of tariffs and a highly competitive travel market. There is some careful navigation to be done to capitalise on success and avoid unwanted turbulence in 2025.”The group’s airlines carried 122 million passengers in 2024, up by 5.6%; 46 million of them were travelling on BA services.Doyle said Gatwick’s second runway, which gainedbacking but not planning ratificationfrom the UK government on Thursday, was likely to see BA build up its presence again at London’s second airport. But he ruled out restoring its operations there to pre-pandemic levels, after switching BA’s focus almost entirely to Heathrow in the crisis in 2020.He said: “I think strategies tried before haven’t necessarily worked, but we have a big presence – both BA and IAG – at Gatwick, and have been growing our businesses there for the last three years. So we would evaluate the opportunity to grow when the capacity came on – but it wouldn’t be in the form of a second hub.”Explore more on these topicsBritish AirwaysIberiaInternational Airlines GroupAer LingusAirline industryTransportSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet the drier and milder conditions of the weekend will give way to sunshine and lots of bright weather next week.Creswick said the beginning of March would be “actually more lamb-like than lion-like”. The proverb “in like a lion, out like a lamb” is a reference to the tendency for March to shift from cold, wet weather at the beginning of the month to warmer conditions by the end.UK insurers paid out record £585m last year as climate breakdown intensifiesRead moreIn London, temperatures are expected to reach 14C next Wednesday, replacing the grey skies of February.Spells of rain and strong winds are expected to hit the UK during the middle of March, but dry and bright conditions could develop again later in the month.Alex Deakin, a meteorologist for the Met Office, said that the UK has experienced a “duller than average winter”. He said: “It’s getting warmer, it’s feeling warmer already” and that most of the country could expect to see clear skies on Friday evening.This means that good conditions are expected for theplanetary parade on Friday evening– a rare alignment of seven planets that will be visible simultaneously between sunset and 6.30pm for the last time until 2040.Deakin said: “You’ll need a really good view of the horizon [to see some of the planets].

GSK is led by Emma Walmsley, one of the few women to head a FTSE 100 company.Donald Trump took aimat efforts to increase the representation of minorities in workplaces soon after starting his second term in the White House. His executive orders tried to ban federal agencies and contractors from having diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets.The orders have faced challenges in US courts, but that has not stopped a procession of American companies, including Goldman Sachs,Walmart,McDonald’s, Ford,Amazonand the Facebook ownerMetafrom rushing to remove their own diversity policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest investor, on Friday joined the crowd, saying it would abandon targets of increased representation of minorities in its workforce.However, the move by GSK, formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline, has acted despite being a British company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in central London.Internal communications said the company was obliged to comply with Trump’s executive orders because the US is the company’s largest market and the US government is its No 1 customer. GSK argued on Thursday that it could raise the potential pay package for Walmsley tonearly £22min three years’ time in order to compete with US rivals.The British company’s position on diversity contrasts with others. Notably, its British pharma rival AstraZeneca, which also employs thousands of workers in the US, has not made any changes to its diversity, equity and inclusion policies.The GSK communications said that all diversity and inclusion policies were being reviewed. In the meantime, there is to be a pause on diversity and inclusion activities, although it is understood that efforts to promote diversity in clinical trials – vital to understand medicines’ effects across varied populations – will not be affected.References to “diversity, equity and inclusion”, presentas late as 19 February according to the Internet Archive, werechangedto merely “inclusion” on one section of GSK’s website.Mentoring groups for women have been put on hold, as has a social mobility programme in the UK that works with students from less-privileged socioeconomic groups to support them entering the workplace, according to sources. Charitable activities with a diversity element are also under review.A GSK company spokesperson said: “We are strongly committed to GSK being an inclusive workplace where our people can be themselves, and have their different perspectives, experiences and characteristics valued, because this helps everyone perform at their best.“We have to ensure we remain compliant with the law in the countries in which we operate, including the US. This is why we have paused some activities to review them. To be clear, this does not necessarily mean they will be stopped but we may need to make some changes. We are consulting and talking to our people about all of this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s likely to go down very poorly with many of GSK’s longest-standing investors, clients and stakeholders. Companies that abandon policies that promote equal opportunities will likely lose talent over time and fail to attract the best. It’s a shortsighted approach with significant risk.”A GSK spokesperson added: “The company completely rejects this characterisation of our actions.”Sarah Tahamtani, head of the employment practice at Clarion, a UK law firm, said: “I can’t imagine a situation where a UK employer would be bound by an executive order in the US.” However, she added that Trump’s orders may shift “the general mood” with regard to diversity and discrimination, which could affect how UK companies operate.Explore more on these topicsGSKPharmaceuticals industryShareReuse this content"

Most services were restored by Friday afternoon.It is the second month in a row that users have had to grapple with delays on crucial days for payments. At the end of January, an IT glitchleft some Barclays customerslocked out of their accounts for almost 24 hours on what was also HMRC’s deadline day for settling self-assessment tax returns.MPs on the influential Treasury committee have demanded answers from banks and wrote to the chief executives of lenders including Lloyds, NatWest, Santander,Nationwide, Barclays and HSBC in early February. Executives were ordered to give details of the outages, how they affected customers, how their board responded, and how they planned to prevent future problems. The committee was due to publish lenders’ responses in the coming days.However, Friday’s outages are understood to have raised further concerns among MPs. The Treasury committee is assessing its options and will consider next steps next week, a person close to the committee said.The outages come amid a wider push towards digital banking by lenders who are facing growing competition from online-only lenders such as Monzo, Revolut and JP Morgan’s Chase.Lenders who once dominated the high street have continued shutting branches, in a move they say is justified by dwindling use of in-person banking. It has led to thousands of closures, with the number of branches across the UK falling from roughly 10,565 in 2014 to 6,870 by 2024, according toBritish Banking Association and Office for National Statistics data.But repeated IT failures have highlighted the importance of providing face-to-face and manual banking services, ensuring that neither lenders nor their customers are held hostage by tech glitches, IT meltdowns or cyber-attacks.The regulator has tried to curb the prospect of banking deserts. As of last year, the Financial Conduct Authority requires banks to hold off from closing their sites until they can guarantee access to cash will not be affected. But that has resulted in banks pushing customers towards alternatives, including banking hubs or Post Offices that offer cash services.Commenting on the latest outages, UK Finance defended its members, who it said worked hard to fix any IT problems affecting customers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He attacked two fellow inmates and two staff members, one of whom needed hospital treatment.He was assessed by prison psychiatrists, who judged he had psychosis or possible paranoid schizophrenia and was prescribed olanzapine, which stabilised him. The healthcare services were run at the prison by a private health provider, Practice Plus Group (PPG).Cole was unexpectedly released on 27 October 2020 with only a month’s worth of the medication. After it ran out, he attacked two people at the accommodation where he was staying and was placed in the Travelodge where Vento worked by his family after he was evicted from another hotel where he had been placed by the housing authority.On 9 December, Cole punched, kicked and attacked Vento with hair clippers. The attack lasted for 42 minutes, in which Vento sustained 55 injuries. She later died.Recording a narrative verdict on Friday, Griffin said: “Marta Elena Vento was unlawfully killed by another who, at the time of her death, was unmedicated for a diagnosed mental health illness because of a failure to sufficiently plan and ensure the continuity of his mental healthcare upon his release from prison six weeks prior to Martha’s death, and because he was not adequately managed as a sex offender in line with national guidance on his release from prison.”After the hearing, Vento’s family issued a statement. “Today’s conclusion confirms what we have suspected in the four long years since our dear Marta was torn from our lives,” it said.“It is overwhelmingly hard for us to understand how the English prison health system could allow someone like Stephen Cole, who was so clearly unwell, to be released without a care plan and the ongoing medication he needed.“It is equally hard for us to understand why the English police did not make themselves fully aware of the danger Cole posed when he stayed at the Travelodge on that night.“Our daughter paid with her life for lapses in the English prison and policing systems. The cost to our family can never be measured. Without our Marta, our lives will never be the same.”In her concluding remarks, the coroner said that a discharge summary was not sent to Cole’s GP upon his release from prison, nor was there a referral to the mental health team to continue his care.“At this time, there was no integrated mental health policy in place within the healthcare department of the prison,” she said.“There was a lack of comprehensive care planning infrastructure across prison healthcare nationally and the prison healthcare team were experiencing pressures arising from reduced staffing following the mobilisation of the healthcare contract at the prison and the impact of the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.”Griffin said Cole was given medication upon release from prison, but there was no “continuity of the mental health care” and it soon ran out, leading to a relapse of psychosis.Dorset police’s team dealing with violent and sexual offenders was responsible for managing Cole in the community, the inquest heard.Griffin recorded that there was “incomplete information gathering to identify, assess and manage his risks in the community, and no Armss [at-risk mental state service] risk assessment was completed or management plan put into place in respect to the perpetrator prior to Marta’s death”.The inquest previously heard that just before the attack, Cole told a police offender manager he was being spied on through the smoke alarms at the Travelodge and people were knocking on his window, though he was on the fourth floor.Also, shortly before, Cole’s family arranged for him to see a GP to try to get more olanzapine but the doctor said he was not able to without details from those who had prescribed it.In 2021 Cole pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility due to a psychotic episode and was given an indefinite hospital order.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationDorsetBournemouthUK criminal justiceEnglandNHSPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

But that doesn’t always mean the descent has to be slow.“There may be circumstances when a slower-than-expected descent is justified but there will also be times when conditions require that the pace has to quicken.”The Bankcut rates by a quarter point to 4.5%earlier this month and signalled that it expects to continue reducing borrowing costs, despite forecasting a “bump” in inflation in the coming months.In an address that repeatedly stressed the heightened uncertainty facing policymakers, Ramsden said that inflation is now as likely to overshoot as to undershoot.Ramsden backed a quarter-point interest rate cut in December, against the majority, fearing the jobs market was cooling rapidly and could lead inflation to undershoot.But with the Bank now expecting inflation to rise to 3.7% later this year, and average weekly earnings growth to be 6.75% in the first quarter, much higher than previously forecast, he now believes the risks are balanced.“Because of the evidence of recent months, I no longer think that risks to hitting the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium-term are to the downside. Instead, I think they are two sided,” he said.He highlighted particular uncertainty about the outlook for the jobs market. Policymakers are concerned about the risks of a rapid downturn as the government’s increase in employer national insurance contributions takes effect in April – but are also worried aboutrecent stronger-than-expected wage data.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This review must be comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened in this case.“It is critical for trust in the BBC that this review happens quickly, and that appropriate action is taken on its findings.”After the BBC board met on Thursday to discuss the issue, the corporation said an internal review identified “serious flaws” in the making of the programme. “Some of these were made by the production company and some by the BBC; all of them are unacceptable … We apologise for this,” a spokesperson said.They added: “The processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations. Although the programme was made by an independent production company, who were commissioned to deliver a fully compliant documentary, the BBC has ultimate editorial responsibility for this programme as broadcast.”The BBC had asked Hoyo Films several times in writing about any potential connections Abdullah al-Yazouri, the film’s young narrator, and his family “might have with Hamas”.Since transmission, Hoyo Films told the BBC that it knew Abdullah’s father was a Hamas minister but had failed to tell the corporation, the spokesperson said. “It was then the BBC’s own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.”The BBC was seeking further information about the payment made to the boy’s mother.In a separate statement, the BBC’s board said mistakes made in producing the documentary were “significant and damaging to the BBC”.Stuart Andrew, the shadow culture minister, called for a “full independent” inquiry into the making of the documentary, and said police should become involved if any payments had been made to “Hamas or their affiliates”.Andrew told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the “possibility of payments being made to Hamas or their affiliates is deeply troubling. That is why we believe there needs to be a full independent inquiry, so we can have absolute faith that everything is being looked at in the round, and make sure we know the processes that were followed or not followed, and exactly how much money has been potentially given to Hamas or its affiliates.”If it emerged that “public money has got into the hands of Hamas or the official, that needs and warrants a proper criminal investigation”, he said. Hamas is designated a proscribed terrorist organisation by the UK government.A former senior executive at the corporation said the BBC had made “basic rookie errors” over the documentary.Roger Mosey, who was the head of BBC television news until 2013, said mistakes by the corporation were “not an unfortunate accident” but the upshot of “some people not doing their job properly and making sure this programme was fit to be broadcast”.Speaking on the Today programme, Mosey said: “If you’re going to make a film about the most contentious issue in the world today, and where the BBC has to prove its impartiality, you have to get it right. The fact is that the BBC broadcast it, they took editorial responsibility, and then it has unravelled incredibly quickly.“I think there are some basic rookie errors made here. It’s not an unfortunate accident. It’s actually that some people were not doing their job properly and making sure this programme was fit to be broadcast.”Mosey rejected claims there was a “systematic bias against Israel” at the broadcaster. He said: “I don’t think the BBC is biased on the big issues of Israel and the Middle East. I think the BBC tries very hard on the most difficult of stories to get it right, and this so undermines it.”The BBC said it had no plans to broadcast the documentary again or return it to iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsBBCHamasGazaDocumentaryTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Previously, your £20,000-a-year Isa allowance could be spread between different types, including a cash Isa or stocks and shares Isa, but since April 2024, the tax authorities have let you have any combination.In theory this means that someone, for example, who has already during this tax year opened a fixed-rate cash Isa that they are no longer able to pay money into can now open another one with the same bank or building society and make the most of the best available rates that it is offering.It is one of several moves designed to simplify the system, but in practice many providers will not accept an application for a second cash Isa.Research from the financial data company Moneyfacts suggests that almost two-thirds of cash Isa providers do not allow customers to open a second account with them in the same tax year. This is the case at most of the UK’s biggest banks, including Santander, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC, and at several building societies offering some of the best rates on the market.A saver attracted by the 4.22% two-year fixed cash Isa rate on offer this week at Coventry building society, for example, will find in theterms and conditions this rule: “You must not have paid in current tax year subscriptions to another cash Isa with us in the same tax year.”Anna Bowes, a savings expert at the financial advisory firm The Private Office, says that while the rules on what you can do have changed, providers have not been obliged to adopt them.When she looked at what was available, “what I found was that most providers would let you open an Isa with them if you had one with someone else, but most would not let you open a new one with them”.She says that some providers were already offering what was called a flexible Isa, which allowed a similar thing ahead of the change.Nationwide building society is one of the best-known providers to offer this kind of cash Isa to savers. It describes it as a “portfolio cash Isa”, in which you can hold different types of accounts opened at different times. A spokesperson says: “This means [a saver] could put some in, say, a fixed-rate Isa and leave some in an easy access Isa, or have two fixed-rate Isas with different terms, etc.”At the time of writing, Nationwide was offering a one-year, fixed-rate Isa at 4.1%, and a two-year one paying 4%, plus a one-year triple access online Isa that you can make up to three withdrawals a year from before the interest rate is cut from 4% to 1.75%. You can take advantage of these rates even if you already hold money with the society, and spread your savings money across all three types of account.The Moneyfacts research found that only 36 out of the 98 cash Isa providers it lists said they allowed multiple accounts in the same tax year. These include the online bank Zopa, which was offering a table-topping 5% on a one-year cash Isa at the start of the tax year, and this week appeared in the best-buy tables paying 4.4%. OakNorth Bank was offering a best-buy rate of 4.41% and will let you pay in even if you already have one of its cash Isas. Kent Reliance, M&S Bank and Skipton building society are among other providers that allow it.Several banks, including Santander, indicated that they could review their position in the future.However, if there is a question mark over the accounts in the future, there might not be an incentive for providers to make changes.Another rule change designed to make paying into an Isa easier was the scrapping of the requirement to sign a declaration before moving money into a previous year’s account; but again, many providers have ignored this change.Yorkshire building society’s website, for example, states that if you have a cash Isa from a previous tax year that you want to add to, “you’ll need to complete an Isa declaration form. We can’t add money to your account until we’ve received this.”The good news is that the process is pretty straightforward and, whoever your account is with, it should just involve filling in a form online or in a branch.Partial transfers on money saved or invested this year were also introduced, with the government website now stating: “You can transfer all or part of the savings in your individual savings account (Isa) from one provider to another at any time … The investment can have been made this year or in previous years.”However, banks and building societies are typically refusing to take partial transfers of money invested in this tax year, and insisting that if you do want to switch, you have to move the whole lot.A spokesperson for the Treasury says: “It is a commercial decision for individual Isa providers whether they take advantage of increased flexibility in the Isa system, and customers should compare the terms offered by providers to find a product that suits their needs.”Explore more on these topicsIsasConsumer affairsSavingsSavings ratesTaxBanks and building societiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, prisoners can reduce the length of time they serve by earning “good behaviour and good time” credits, which means they can serve as little as 25% of their sentence behind bars if they maintain good behaviour and work productively.Automatic early release was introduced inEnglandand Wales in 1991 for prisoners sentenced to less than four years, but expanded to more serious criminals in 2003. Now up to 70% of prisoners will be released automatically. If rolled out, prisoners could earn credits via work, training or taking part in any education scheme.Mahmood toldthe Daily Telegraph: “We’ve got to be open to all potential future constructions of sentences. If you’re going to think about incentivised behaviour, obviously it’s a carrot and a stick, isn’t it? So you can’t then leave unchanged the rest of your current sentencing framework on automatic releases.“If you’re going to go down the road of incentivisation, actually that might mean some things no longer become automatic. But we would have to consider carefully how you would take the best learning from the law and read across to our system because our arrangements are different. Although that’s the benefit of having a review, which means we can.”The Guardian view on the Gauke review: prison isn’t working | EditorialRead moreDavid Gauke, the former Conservative justice secretary under Theresa May’s premiership, accompanied Mahmood on the Texas trip, during which they assessed how well good behaviour and intensive rehabilitation schemes had helped to reduce prison overcrowding.Such changes in the US state have reduced the number of offenders recalled to jail to 16.6%, as national levels hover about 68%.Gauke said incentivising people over time allowed a “more considered approach to assessing their behaviour”.A large proportion of prisoners in England andWalesare released on licence after serving 40-60% of fixed-term sentences.Last week, the Prison Reform Trust urged the government toconsider abolishing the use of short, fixed-term recallsof 28 days or fewer, amid concerns that the rising numbers of people being recalled to prison was “trapping” them in the criminal justice system.Anindependent sentencing reviewsaid longer jail terms had been a “kneejerk” policy response to show action by successive governments.According to the latest data from the Ministry of Justice, the number of prisoners in England and Wales reached 86,941, the highest since 21 October last year, which was the day before the government released more than 1,000 prisoners as part of its urgent measures to ease the overcrowding crisis.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justicePrisons and probationEnglandShabana MahmoodWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Above, the setting sun tints the clouds red. Fountains of lava that explode from a crater soar hundreds of metres into the air and Etna’s roar echoes across the Sicilian sky.Its recent eruptions were abreathtaking spectacle, drawing thousands of tourists and unwary daytrippers – many there for a selfie. For some, the outcome was catastrophic.View image in fullscreenTourists take selfies on Mount Etna.Photograph: Antonio Parrinello/The GuardianDozens of people, lacking appropriate mountain gear,went missinglast week and were recovered late at night suffering from hypothermia. Many sustained various injuries as hundreds of cars, haphazardly parked along the road leading to the lava flows,blocked the streetsand prevented rescue services from reaching those in need of assistance. Authorities threatened to report imprudent visitors to the police and introduced restrictions to stay away from the magma.“They have turned a volcano into a playground,” said Luca Ferlito, commander of the operational unit of Sicily’s Guardia Forestale. “After images of the eruption started circulating on social media, showing people skiing just a few metres from the lava flow moving over the snow, thousands of visitors stormed the mountain. Many of them were completely unequipped.”Ferlito added: “We saw all sorts of scenes. People approaching the lava flowin high heels and miniskirts, people in shorts, someone started roasting sausages, others were takingshirtless photos near the lava. A couple brought a six-month-old baby; an American man showed up in jeans, a T-shirt, and crutches. We stopped a 70-year-old tourist who was wearing cotton trousers and summer rubber shoes.”View image in fullscreenA rescue team monitors Etna’s lava flow.Photograph: Antonio Parrinello/The GuardianThe Guardian joined rescue services on Mount Etna who had been brought in to assist residents and curb the flow of tourists and daytrippers from Sicily and beyond, even after mayors of the towns on the volcano’s slopes ordered visitors to stay at least 500 metres from the lava.“The presence of so many people forced us to work non-stop, day and night without rest,” says Paolo Bernardini, commander of the Alpine Rescue Unit of the Guardia di Finanza. “Since the lava flows started descending to lower altitudes, the number of rescue operations has increased exponentially.”Etna mapItaly, home to the most Unesco heritage sites in the world, is becoming wearily accustomed to episodes of overtourism. Last month, the mayor of Roccaraso, a popular Italian ski resort,clamped downon daytrippers after the town was overwhelmed by 260 buses carrying more than 10,000 visitors from Naples and the surrounding Campania region, lured by a TikTok star.But Etna, 3,300 metres (10,800ft) above sea level, is not just a ski resort. It is one of the world’s most active volcanoes, and has been in explosive form in recent weeks, spewing incandescent magma and a copious shower of ash that has reached as far as the port city of Catania on the island’s east coast.View image in fullscreenVisitors cross the snow on bikes to the lava flow.Photograph: Antonio Parrinello/The GuardianAnd though visually striking, the interaction of lava and snow exposes visitors to serious risks. ABBC teamand a number of tourists suffered minor injuries in 2017 when a lava flow ran into snow and produced superheated steam that pelted the group with boiling rocks.The landscapes of its peaks are wild and nearly devoid of life, the temperatures plunge to freezing even in the height of summer and the weather is inconsistent. Bernardini and his unit rescued four young men in the middle of the night on Sunday after they had lost their way.“We found them after hours of searching in the dark, with fog rolling in,” he says. “They were wearing sneakers and jeans and were already showing early signs of hypothermia. One of them wasn’t even wearing socks.”In just six days since early February, 1m cubic metres of lava have erupted from Mount Etna. The lava flow – which began on 8 February from an eruptive fissure at the southern base of the Bocca Nuova crater – slowly descended to an altitude of 1,900 metres, making it more accessible to visitors. While the magma from this fissure gradually cooled, another fissure at 3,000 metres near the mountain’s south-east craterproduced fresh lava flows last Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guides and nearby residents complain that it is unfair that people are not allowed to enjoy the beauty of their own territory, due to the restrictions introduced by the mayors.“We are used to mountain excursions,” said Danilo Spongano, 45, from Lecce, who was visiting Etna with his family. “Depriving people like us to enjoy a natural spectacle like this, I really find it a shame.”0:54Drone captures breathtaking footage of Mount Etna eruption – videoGabriella Cannata, a teacher who lives in Catania, has been exploring Etna for years. “There are reckless individuals who come without proper preparation,” she said, “but that shouldn’t mean penalising those who act responsibly.”Two weeks ago she was able to visit the lava flow, wearing a helmet, headlamps with spare batteries, and hand and foot warmers.View image in fullscreenDanilo Spongano from Lecce poses for a selfie with his family in front of the lava flow.Photograph: Antonio Parrinello/The Guardian“I witnessed the latest eruption, and before leaving – by then in darkness – I turned for one last look at the lava,” Cannata said. “The scene before me was magical: the crowd of visitors had grown, each person moving around the flow with a small light on their head. It felt as if we were all part of a pilgrimage to Mother Nature.”“In that moment,” she said, “I realised how important it is to continue being moved by the beauty of nature.

But the platform has struggled to keep up with easier-to-use and more reliable rivals such as Zoom and Salesforce’s Slack in recent years, in part because Skype’s underlying technology grew less suited for the smartphone era.When the pandemic and work from home fueled the need for online business calls, Microsoft batted for Teams by aggressively integrating it with other Office apps to tap corporate users, once a major base for Skype.Online video communication was once the near exclusive purview of Skype before the likes of FaceTime, Zoom and Google Hangouts took over. Skype was an early example of a tech product that was so ubiquitous it was used as a verb. Users would “Skype” someone in much the same way they would Google something.When Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 for $8.5bn after outbidding Google and Facebook, its largest deal at the time, the service had about 150 million monthly users; by 2020, that number had fallen to roughly 23 million, despite a brief resurgence during the pandemic.Over the years, Microsoft struggled to integrate Skype into its suite of tools and could not meet the moment when the company began seeing competition from Apple’s FaceTime and Google’s various communications app attempts. And when Microsoft launched its collaboration product Teams in 2017that quickly took priority.“We are honored to have been part of the journey,” Microsoft said on Friday. “Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications.”To ease the transition from the platform, its users will be able to log into Teams for free on any supported device using their existing credentials, with chats and contacts migrating automatically.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Launching successful communication tools has been a challenge for many of the big tech firms including Google. Now Skype will be laid to rest in the graveyard of communication tools alongside Duo and AOL Instant Messenger.Microsoft declined to share the latest user figures for Skype and said there would be no job cuts due to the move. It added that Teams had about 320 million monthly active users.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMicrosoftSkypeInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities alleged that Czuba had targeted the family – who had been renting rooms in his house – because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas that erupted on 7 October 2023.Jurors deliberated less than 90 minutes over the crime that renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination in the Chicago area’s large and established Palestinian community.Ben Crump, the national civil rights attorney representing Shaheen, called the verdict a “measure of justice” in a statement.“Wadee was an innocent six-year-old child whose life was stolen in an act of unimaginable violence fueled by hatred,” the statement says. “While we are relieved that his killer has been held accountable, we must continue to stand against the rising tide of hate that led to this senseless act.”It goes on to add: “We must honor Wadee’s memory by continuing to fight against hate in all its forms and working toward a future where every child is safe, valued, and free from violence.”The trial featured detailed testimony from police officers, medical workers, Czuba’s ex-wife and Shaheen, who described how Czuba attacked her with a knife before going after her son in a different room. Prosecutors say that the child had been stabbed 26 times.Graphic photos of the murder, a knife-holder Czuba allegedly used that day, along with police video footage were central to the Will county prosecutors’ case. At times, video screens showing explicit footage were turned away from the public viewing audience where members of Wadee’s family sat during the trial.Czuba had pleaded not guilty. He faced murder, attempted murder, aggravated battery and hate-crime charges in an eight-count indictment.Defense attorneys insisted pieces of evidence tying Czuba to the crimes were missing. His ex-wife, testifying for the prosecution, could only describe one outburst during their 30 years of marriage and said he carried knives often because he was handy around the house.“Go beyond the emotions to carefully examine the evidence,” said Kylie Blatti, one of Czuba’s public defenders. “It is easy to get lost in the horror of those images.”One of the critical parts of the trial was Shaheen’s testimony and the 911 call she made to report the crime that happened just days after the war started. She said they had not previously had any issues in the two years they rented from the Czubas. They shared a kitchen and living room with the Czubas.After the start of the war, Czuba told her that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. Later, he attacked her and her son.“He told me: ‘You, as a Muslim, must die,” said Shaheen, who testified in English and Arabic though a translator.Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds.Police testified that officers found Czuba outside the house sitting on the ground with blood on his body and hands.Separately, civil lawsuits have been filed over the boy’s death, including by his father, Oday Al-Fayoume, who is divorced from Shaheen and was not living with them at the house.The case, which generated headlines around the world, comes amid rising hostility against Muslims and Palestinians in the US since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing roughly 1,200 Israelis, and Israel’s attack on Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians. The US Department of Justice also launched a federal hate-crimes investigation.The Council on American-Islamic Relations released astatement on Xfollowing the ruling, saying that the organization “welcomes the conviction of Joseph Czuba”.“This horrific crime is the worst of many violent attacks on American Muslims, Palestinians, and other supporters of Palestinian human rights over the past year and a half,” the statement says. “It is time for our society to stop tolerating the anti-Palestinian racism and anti-Muslim bigotry that have led to hate crimes here at home and a genocide in Gaza.”The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee also welcomed the guilty verdict ina statement.“Today’s verdict delivers a measure of justice for Wadee AlFayoumi’s family and sends a clear message that hate-fueled violence has no place here,” the statement says. “We will never accept nor forget that a six-year-old child lost his life because of dangerous anti-Palestinian rhetoric.”Explore more on these topicsUS crimeIllinoisIsrael-Gaza warLaw (US)RacenewsShareReuse this content"

Separately, so did Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, the leader of another cartel. Carrillo is accused of arranging kidnappings and killings inMexicobut not accused of involvement in the death of the DEA agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena.Caro Quintero, Carrillo Fuentes and 27 other Mexican prisoners weresenton Thursday to eight US cities, a move that came as Mexico sought to stave off theDonald Trumpadministration’s threat of imposing 25% tariffs on all Mexican imports next week.Mexico releases 29 high-level organized crime operatives into US custodyRead moreFor Camarena’s family, the arraignments marked a long-awaited moment.“For 14,631 days, we held on to hope – hope that this moment would come. Hope that we would live to see accountability. And now, that hope has finally turned into reality,” the family said in a statement thanking Trump and everyone who has worked on the case over the years.The White House, in a statement Friday ahead of the arraignments, called Caro Quintero “one of the most evil cartel bosses in the world”.In exchange for delaying tariffs, Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on cartels, illegal immigration and fentanyl production.But members of Mexico’s security cabinet on Friday framed the transfer of the 29 prisoners as a national security decision.“It is not a commitment to the United States. It is a commitment to ourselves,” said Mexican attorney general Alejandro Gertz Manero. “The problem of drug trafficking and organized crime has been a true tragedy for our country.”Mexican security secretary Omar García Harfuch said the people sent into US custody were “generators of violence” in Mexico and represented a security threat to both countries.Caro Quintero had long been one of America’s top Mexican targets for extradition.He was one of the founders of a Guadalajara-based cartel and one of the primary suppliers of heroin, cocaine and marijuana to the US in the late 1970s and 1980s.Caro Quintero had Camarena kidnapped, tortured and killed in 1985 because he blamed the agent for a raid on a huge marijuana plantation the year prior, authorities said. Camarena’s killing marked a low point in US-Mexico relations and was dramatized in the popular Netflix series Narcos: Mexico.Caro Quintero had been 28 years into a 40-year sentence in Mexico when an appeals court overturned his verdict in 2013.After his release, he returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until he was arrested by Mexican forces in 2022, authorities said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was a drug trafficker 23 years ago, and now I’m not, and I won’t ever be again.”The US, which had added Caro Quintero to the FBI’s 10 most wanted list in 2018 with a $20m reward, sought his extradition immediately after his 2022 arrest. It happened days after the Mexican and US presidents at the time, Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Joe Biden respectively, met at the White House.But the request remained in limbo as López Obrador severely curtailed his country’s cooperation with the US to protest undercover American law enforcement operations targeting Mexican political and military officials.Then, in January, a non-profit group representing the Camarena family sent a letter to the newTrump administrationurging it to renew the extradition request.Carrillo Fuentes is the brother of the drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as “The Lord of The Skies”, who died in a botched plastic surgery in 1997. Carrillo Fuentes, who was known as “The Viceroy”, continued his brother’s business of smuggling drugs over the border until his arrest in 2014.He was sentenced in 2021 to 28 years in prison for organized crime, money laundering and weapons violations.Among the others extradited are leading members of Mexican organized crime groups recently designated by the Republican administration as “foreign terrorist organizations”.They include cartel leaders, security chiefs from both factions of the Sinaloa cartel, cartel finance operatives and a man wanted in connection with the killing of a North Carolina sheriff’s deputy in 2022.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeMexicoAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

It could also prove useful for biomedical research or even, the team suggests, for “virtual food adventures”.“Potential applications include immersive gaming, online shopping, remote education, weight management, sensory testing, physical rehabilitation and others,” the researchers write.However, the team notes the system requires further development, not least as there are taste sensations the device cannot reproduce, such as spiciness and fattiness.While it is now possible share images, sounds and even physical sensations with others remotely, sharing smells or tastes has proved more challenging.Despite previous attemptsby some researchers, the team behind the new study notes that there are numerous hurdles, not least that directly stimulating the tongue electronically or with warmth only enables a few tastes to be evoked; the use of chemicals can pose problems for reliability; and the arrangement of tastebuds on the tongue means it is necessary to target particular areas to create particular sensations.Writing in the journal Science Advances, the US-based scientists report how their e-Taste device has two key components. The first is a sensing platform – or “electronic tongue” – that captures data about the concentration of five different taste chemicals in a liquidised sample ofa food or drink and sends the information wirelessly to the second component. This device uses small electromagnetic pumps to push liquids through a layer of gel containing five edible taste chemicals, allowing their delivery to an outlet, placed in a recipient’s mouth, to be controlled.The five taste chemicals, which can be mixed before delivery, correspond to those detected in the original consumable item: glucose, which creates a sweet sensation; citric acid, which produces a sour taste; sodium chloride, which generates a salty flavour; magnesium chloride, a bitter taste; and glutamate, which elicits the savoury taste known as umami.The team adds that the system also allows flavours to be delivered to specific regions of the tongue – something they say could be used to investigate human taste perception.“People will get something like a straw in their mouth, and thus placing it to specific locations when needed,” said Yizhen Jia, a co-author of the study from Ohio State University.The team then conducted a number of tests. Among them, 10 volunteers were asked to sample different sour intensities in the liquids generated by the system, with the results revealing they were able to do so with an overall accuracy rate of 70%.In another test six volunteers were asked to sample different combinations of liquids containing the flavour chemicals, with the combinations designed to represent five different edible items – lemonade, cake, fried egg, coffee, and fish soup. They were then asked to taste a liquid generated by the system and select the foods they thought it represented. Overall they completed the task with accuracy rate of almost 87% – although spiciness is yet to be cracked.Marianna Obrist, a professor of multisensory interfaces at University College London, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the study.“Taste stimulation is a particularly challenging area, yet the authors seem to present a compelling integration of taste sensations to enrich digital experiences,” she said.Explore more on these topicsScienceVirtual realityFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

She noted that was the sentence jurors at his 1994 trial had recommended. A judge overruled that recommendation and imposed a death sentence, a maneuver that has since been outlawed in Alabama, according to the human rights advocacy organizationAmnesty International.The decision came after ongoing questions about the case that included a lack of physical evidence at the crime scene tying him to the 1991 murder of Ludie Mae Tucker in Decatur,Alabama. Myers had long maintained he was innocent, and a juror at his 1994 trial supported the push for clemency.View image in fullscreenRobin ‘Rocky’ Myers.Photograph: AP“In short, I am not convinced that Mr Myers is innocent, but I am not so convinced of his guilt as to approve of his execution,” Ivey said in a statement. “I therefore must respect both the jury’s decision to convict him and its recommendation that he be sentenced to life without parole.”Ivey, a Republican who has never previously stopped an execution, called it “one of the most difficult decisions I’ve had to make as governor”.“But it pales in comparison to the pain and suffering Ludie Mae Tucker and Marie Dutton endured on the night of [4 October 1991] – and to the many hardships the Tucker family has endured at the hands of our imperfect justice system,” Ivey said.“I pray that the Tucker family may, in some way, find closure and peace knowing this case is closed, and Mr Myers will spend the rest of his life in prison.”The Alabama supreme court earlier in February authorized Myers’ execution bynitrogen hypoxia. The next step was for the governor to set the execution date.Explore more on these topicsAlabamaUS justice systemCapital punishmentUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

He has worked for the foreign ministry since 1992 and held a senior post at the embassy in Washington earlier in his career.In a statement published on Russia’s foreign ministry website, Moscow said it had proposed restoring direct flights between the two countries during the talks in Istanbul.Following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukraine’s allies – including the US, the UK and the EU – banned Russian planes from their airspace.On Friday, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said officials in Istanbul “agreed on joint steps to ensure the uninterrupted financing of diplomatic missions in both countries and to create appropriate conditions for diplomats to carry out their duties effectively”.Over the past decade, Russia and the US have repeatedly expelled each other’s diplomats, significantly reducing their embassy staffing levels.The talks in Istanbul marked the second consecutive week of meetings between Washington and Moscow, after last week’sdiscussions in Saudi Arabiawhere the two country’s vowed to improve economic relations that had been cut by the imposition of western sanctions.The series of meetings, first set in motion by a call between Donald Trump andVladimir Putinearlier this month, signal a dramatic shift in relations.The Russian president on Thursday applauded the new US administration for “pragmatism, a realistic worldview” and described initial contacts with the Trump administration as “inspiring a certain degree of hope”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The drills are a big part of Taiwan’s defensive preparations to deter or one day resist an attack by China, which has vowed to annex the territory.“It is a serious miscalculation of the situation, the public opinion and the comparison of strength,”said Wu. “Overreaching itself in such a way is extremely dangerous. We warn the DPP [Democratic Progressive party] authorities that holding back the tide with a broom will only end up in self-destruction. We will come and get you, sooner or later.”View image in fullscreenWu Qian: ‘We warn the DPP authorities that holding back the tide with a broom will only end up in self-destruction.’Photograph: Yew Lun Tian/ReutersOn Chinese social media, the remarks quickly drew parallels with the blockbuster children’s movie. Ne Zha 2, an animation about ayoung boy battling demons based on Chinese mythology, includes a scene where he admonishes a groundhog, saying: “I will come back and get you.”Ne Zha 2 has been hugely popular in China, generating massive coverage in state media after it became the highest-grossing film in China, andthen the world, overtaking the revenue of Inside Out 2. Its success has driven a surge of patriotism in China, with people reportedly viewing it numerous times, and cheering it on againstCaptain America: Brave New World, released in China around the same time but with lacklustre attendance.Ne Zha 2 has not been released in Taiwan.In response to Wu’s comments and in further criticism ofrecent Chinese military drills held off Taiwan’s south-west coast, the Taiwan defence ministry accused China of becoming the biggest “troublemaker” in the international community.5:03How China uses ‘salami-slicing’ tactics to exert pressure on Taiwan - video“This year marks the 80th anniversary of (the end of) world war two, and history has proven that any form of aggression and expansion will end in failure,” it said in a statement. “The actions of the communist military in recent years are repeating the mistakes of the invaders and pushing China towards defeat.”China’s military is pushing on with modernisation efforts, designed to reach capability of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Last week, it amended regulations to emphasise that the military’s top responsibility should be “winning battles”, and ordered the military to “focus on preparation and readiness for combat”.Bill Bishop, a China expert behind the Sinocism newsletter, said on Friday that Beijing’s language towards Taiwan “appears to be getting harsher”. The readout of this year’s Taiwan affairs work conference, held earlier this week, did not include a goal to “promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations”, which had been part of the 2023 and 2024 readouts.Taiwan is boosting its defences but remainsvastly outgunned by China. Its greatest backer has historically been the US, but that has come into question under the second presidency of Donald Trump.This week, Trump refused to say if the US would come to Taiwan’s defence militarily in the event of a Chinese attack. The stance is in line with the US’s longstanding doctrine of strategic ambiguity, but is a departure from his predecessor, Joe Biden, who repeatedly suggested the US would defend Taiwan under his leadership.Trump’s stance, taken with previous comments questioning the worth of supporting Taiwan and accusing it of “stealing” USsemiconductor business, hasraised alarm in Taipei.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

A group of prominent writers including Salman Rushdie, Annie Ernaux, Wole Soyinka and Leïla Slimanisigned a statementcalling for his release.Macron has spoken out about Sansal’s detention before, telling French ambassadors in January thatAlgeriawas “dishonouring itself” by holding the writer.His latest comments came on Friday during a speech in Porto, Portugal, in which he said that Sansal’s imprisonment was among the issues that needed settling before confidence between France and Algeria could be fully restored,according to Reuters.Relations betweenFranceand its former colony have become increasingly hostile in recent months over immigration and a sovereignty dispute over Western Sahara, which Algeria has long said should be independent. Last summer, Macron sparked anger in Algiers when he backed Morocco’s plan for the territory to come under Moroccan control.Sansal’s arrest was linked to comments the writer had made to the far-right French outlet Frontières in which he backed the argument that Morocco’s land was truncated by colonial France in the 19th century to the benefit of what would become Algeria.Sansal was once an Algerian civil servant, but was driven to become a writer during the Algerian civil war of the 1990s. His books include An Unfinished Business, his first to be translated into English, and 2084, for which he won the Grand Prix du Roman.Sansal has in recent years become popular with rightwing figures for his position on Islam, with Marine Le Pen calling him a “courageous opponent of Islamism” after his arrest. Sandrine Rousseau – a member of the green party Europe Écologie Les Verts,denounced his imprisonment, but called his views a “form of supremacism”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I glimpsed him once, in November 1972, when he bounded upstairs to the offices of American Zoetrope in San Francisco, but I didn’t recognise him until he told the receptionist that he was here to see Mona Skager.Francis Ford Coppola’s filmThe Conversationwas about to start shooting in two weeks, and Mona was Francis’s associate producer. I was to be the film’s editor. That brief and solitary glimpse of Gene in real life was counterbalanced by 16 months of daily screen contact with Harry Caul, the character brought to life by Hackman.This was my first job as editor of a feature film, and I was in alternating states of excitement and terror. Previously, I had edited some commercials, a couple of short documentaries and one educational film. I had also done the sound design for The Rain People andThe Godfather, Coppola’s two previous feature films, as well as the sound design for George Lucas’s feature THX 1138.But editing The Conversation was a big turn up the spiral for me, which explained the excitement. The terror was induced by the fact that this was the next film by the director who had just transfixed the world with The Godfather. If The Conversation failed, for whatever reason, much of the blame would fall on the shoulders of this young and inexperienced editor.The relationship between actors and film editors is a classic case of asymmetry: editors stare at actors 10 to 12 hours a day, sometimes more, and we microscopically study their every move, flinch, blink, gesture and inflection. We become actor-anthropologists, students of this strange tribe, and we inhale their rhythms which become second nature to us, and then translate them into the editing style and pacing of the film.View image in fullscreen‘I was hit hard by the news of Gene’s death’ … Walter Murch, pictured last year.Photograph: Amanda Edwards/Getty ImagesIn a certain sense, we know this narrow spectrum of an actor better than anyone – perhaps in some cases better than the actors themselves. If we later meet them in person, this asymmetry really makes itself felt; they frequently have no idea who we are, other than appendages of the director, but we have all that secret and microscopic knowledge: how they prefer to turn left rather than right, their characteristic way of hesitating before opening a door, how often they blink …The integrity of Hackman’s performance provided the metronomic spine which supported and guided meThere were many times, often at 3am in the morning, when Harry would push a button on his tape recorder, stopping it, and so closely did I identify with him that I would be amazed to find my KEM editing machine still running, having not obeyed Harry’s command.During one session, another all-nighter, I finally noticed that very close to where I would decide to make a cut, Harry would blink. Was I controlling Harry, or was he controlling me? This confusion was ultimately resolved: the cut is a blink, and this realisation, triggered by Gene’s performance, became one of the foundational ideas of my book on film editing, In the Blink of an Eye, first published in 1992.The Conversation review – Gene Hackman is unforgettable in Coppola’s paranoid classicRead moreSo in a very real sense, the integrity of Hackman’s performance provided the metronomic spine which supported and guided me, often without my knowing it, to find the correct pacing for each scene, and then the right structure of the collection of those scenes in the finished film. I shudder to think what would have happened if Harry had been performed by someone else.So I was hit hard by the news of Gene’s death for all kinds of reasons – I am a huge fan of his work across five decades of American cinema – but particularly because of the guidance and inspiration he gave me implicitly during the editing of The Conversation. I never had the opportunity to thank him personally for helping me to become the film-maker that I am today. So I do that now: ‘Thank you, Gene.’Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanFrancis Ford  CoppolaThe ConversationThe GodfatherFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My sincere thanks to all my brilliant colleagues who joined me to make our work of art, MEGALOPOLIS, and let us remind ourselves us that box-office is only about money, and like war, stupidity and politics has no true place in our future.”In interviews for the film, Coppola sought to define his movie as just the latest in a series of classics that went unrecognised as such by contemporary critics.A trailer for Megalopolis took a similar tack, quoting well-known critics’ disparaging verdicts of Coppola classics such as Apocalypse Now, The Conversation and the Godfather. However, the trailer was taken down after it emerged that all the quotes were made up.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryFrancis Ford  CoppolaMegalopolisAdam DriverAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also up for song of the year at this weekend’s Brit awards, where Smith is also nominated for best new artist and best pop act, having already won this year’s Brits Rising Star award. Ed Sheeran is an admirer and confidant, and has booked him as support on a stadium tour, and Smith is no one-hit-wonder either: in January, the jauntyNice to Meet Youbecame his second Top 10 hit.But the weirdest moment for him, he says, was when he recently rang up a utilities company to sort a new wifi deal. “They put me on hold, and it was Stargazing playing. Those are the types of things that still seem absolutely bizarre.”At the Brits, he is up against big names such as Charli xcx and Dua Lipa in the pop category, but his music skews very differently, towards material relatively rarely explored by Black British pop artists. Animated acoustic guitars and banjos mean that it cleaves to the trend for pop-leaning country music as well as the barn-dancing “stomp-clap” style of Mumford & Sons and the Lumineers. But with pianos, ethereal production touches and Smith’s open-hearted yet bruised vocal style – plus plenty of whoa-oh-ohs – the likes of Sheeran, Coldplay and Hozier are clearly touchstones too, and even dance music fans will be endeared to his insistent beats and big breakdowns.With abundant emotional intelligence as well as a keener political acumen than most pop singers his age, the 26-year-old Smith is sharp and engaging company on a video call as he tours the UK. Born and raised in Luton, he casts himself as a small-town oddball. “I grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, in a Jamaican family – so my interest in rock and screamo, and not being able to play football and rugby, instantly put me in a different category to my peers,” he says. “In all walks of life I’ve felt a little bit different.”His parents’ marriage fell apart when Smith was between the ages of nine and 13, “a critical period in anyone’s life when they’re forming relationships,” he says. Introducing a song to his 1.6m TikTok followers recently, he wryly said: “Anyone else’s parents divorce and then your dad leaves and then your whole perception of love and relationships is completely screwed up and you don’t know how to trust anyone in your adult life?”“A lot of my personal development has been off the back of that [divorce] experience,” he says now. “I definitely had trust issues for a while.” He has had therapy – “such a beautiful tool” – to come to terms with it. “At the time [as a child] you’re never really aware – most of the learning comes when you’re an adult and you start to unpack the ways you think and feel. There’s a weird beauty to it – while it is painful and traumatic, and having to relive so many experiences is difficult, it also gives you this key to unlock a whole new side to yourself, when you do understand yourself better. And I’ve got a lot of [the trauma] to thank for being a good songwriter!”Smith left Luton for the University of Nottingham to study sociology, and founded his own fast-growing business management company after graduating. But he’d been playing pub gigs since the age of 11, and decided to pivot to music, “knowing that if it all went wrong I could reactivate my LinkedIn and get back into the working world,” he laughs. “But those initial months were petrifying, stepping from a stable income to absolute uncertainty.” He started posting songs to TikTok in 2022, where his manager discovered him, and was signed to a major label deal with Sony the following year.View image in fullscreen‘I never want to put a false sense of myself into the world, where I am this saviour. I push air – that’s my job’ … Smith performing in Dublin in February.Photograph: Debbie Hickey/Getty ImagesBut I can hear the sociology student still coming through when he discusses the systemic issues that can hold people like him back in the music industry. “For anyone from a working-class town, the opportunities to get into music are few and far between,” he says. “There’s a huge disadvantage when it comes to access to musical equipment, and even music lessons, at state school level.”Smith benefited from Building Schools for the Future, an investment scheme brought in by Labour in 2005, then shuttered in 2010 by Michael Gove – who later regretted doing so – as the Tories’ austerity programme began. “I had access to GarageBand, iMacs, musical equipment,” Smith remembers. “And though the costing could be questioned, [the scheme] was very quickly pushed out the window. We’ve now seen years and years of austerity, and it’s not just the arts that have taken a hit – it’s anything that sits on the periphery of the mainstream route to work. There do need to be questions asked about how we’re valuing the arts in this country.”Exacerbating the problem are the hardships faced by grassroots venues, which have been knocked hard by the Covid lockdowns and then the cost of living crisis. “Suddenly the gap between music being a hobby and being a career is wider than ever. In order to pay for a first show an artist might need to sell 500 tickets [at a medium-sized venue]. Whereas the bands and shows I used to see when I was younger was someone down the pub playing to 20 people, but those don’t exist any more.” And he sees a “dual burden” for people of colour, who as well as being statistically more likely to be working class, “are also not being seen for the amazing cultural value that they bring to this country, and what they add to one of our biggest cultural exports” – namely the arts. “More work needs to be done both on a class basisanda race basis.”His music tends to be much less political, and is written in a way that allows listeners to map their own troubles and breakthroughs on to his songs. They frequently contact him to tell him so, and on social media, Smith recently reminded them: “It wasn’t my music that saved you – it was you.”“A lot of people – and I really do appreciate it – will message me when they’re going through troublesome times,” he explains. “They’re dealing with mental health issues – or much further. I could take it as an ego lift: ‘Wow, I’m saving lives!’ But the reality is that those people are doing the hard work to really understand themselves. As an artist, I never want to put a false sense of myself into the world, where I am this saviour. I push air – that’s my job.”As he hones his craft, Smith says he’s mindful to “take breaks from writing for a few months at a time, so I can go out and experience life, otherwise I’ll have nothing to say,” and also avoiding “external [musical] influence – I’m trying to find whoIam, whatI’mtrying to say.” But time with Sheeran has been useful, seeing how “he has full confidence over his initial ideas. For me and many other songwriters, you can get stuck going over one line for 45 minutes. But he’s of the mindset that if it’s good, it’s good – why are we wasting time?”After theBrit awards, Smyth has 37 gigs to play across Europe, the US and Australia – all before the end of May, when he starts 29 European stadium shows with Sheeran. It sounds exhausting, but he is clearly exhilarated. “I wrote a song recently about simply feeling good,” he says. “On the surface that could seem super cliched. But it’s taken a long time to just feel great, and not feel burdened with anything. That’s a byproduct of doing the thing that I love. Feeling good – that’s something I’ve been feeling recently!”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockBrit awardsAwards and prizesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Very long. Backside-numbingly long. Which is as you might expect of a decades-spanning tale of a Holocaust survivor architect’s bruising encounter with the American dream. Still, that three-and-a-half hour run time seems to have been presented as Exhibit A in the case against Brady Corbet’s film; that it’s too grand, too ambitious, too full of itself. It’s got a bloody interval, for Christ’s sake! Who does this Corbet fella think he is?Which seems strange, because a lot of what the film has been criticised for is usually seen as an asset. For good or ill, American cinema’s high-water marks, from Citizen Kane to The Godfather and beyond, tend to be big, muscular movies that believe they have something profound to say about the country of their making. And The Brutalist certainly has things to say, however you feel about how it goes about saying them: about art and patronage, the US’s relationship with Europe, and the relentless churn of capitalism. With so many weighty ideas to pack in, that run time starts to look, if anything, a little stingy.That such a swing for the fences film could be made at all is all the more impressive. We’re in an era of retreat for indie cinema, when many films fail to ever find their way on to the big screen, instead heading straight to streaming and getting lost in the wash of “content”, at a time when horizons have shrunk, along with budgets. The Brutalist’s own budget is small too by modern standards, at less than $10m. But within those strictures, Corbet and his team have managed to construct an uncompromising American epic – and somehowturned a profit. It took a fair bit of sacrifice – Corbet and his partner, the film’s screenwriter Mona Fastvold, have had to cut their cloth accordingly (“swapping champagne for sparkling wine,” is how he puts it), and the director claimsnot to have made a pennyfrom his latest film. But that is the cost of making something entirely on your own terms, of sheer creative bloody-mindedness.It’s a characteristic that, as plenty have spotted, is shared by the character at the centre of the film, the fictional Hungarian architect László Tóth, played brilliantly by Adrien Brody. Bauhaus trained, Tóth has built a name for himself in Europe with his austere, clean-lined constructions, but his livelihood – and far more besides – has been disturbed by Hitler’s rise. Separated from his wife and niece, he has survived the Holocaust, but arrives in the US without reputation or money, though still feeling the same sting of antisemitism he experienced in Europe. Tóth soon falls into the orbit of Guy Pearce’s stiff-jawed industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, whose crass son Harry (Joe Alwyn) has recruited him to renovate his father’s library as a surprise while he is away on business. At first Van Buren hates Tóth’s dramatic update, with its focus on light and space, but attention from the architectural community eventually convinces him of its brilliance. This cycle of adulation and rejection between patron and client will recur throughout the film, sometimes violently.Soon Van Buren has commissioned Tóth for a grander project: a vast community centre in honour of his late mother. Its construction will span decades, hampered by the changing financial fortunes of its patron as well as Tóth’s own flinty perfectionism (only the finest Tuscan marble will do, after all). Complicating things further is the arrival in the film’s second half of his wife, Erzsébet (Felicity Jones), fiercely protective of her husband, and clear-eyed about the person he has gotten into bed with.It’s that back half – and one particularly shocking scene that completely unravels the relationship between Tóth and Van Buren– that has most divided critics. Certainly, The Brutalist’s big animating moment isn’t subtle – but then subtle gestures wouldn’t really suit the film. Everything about it, like the movement it takes its name from, is designed to be imposing, from Lol Crawley’s stark, wide-angled cinematography to Daniel Blumberg’s relentless, abrasive score. But this is also a film intent on holding your attention once it grabs it, directly plotted and propulsively paced. Assisted by the film’s much maligned but ultimately palate-cleansing interval, that three-and a half-hours-plus run time sails by.The Brutalist review – epic Adrien Brody postwar architectural drama stuns and electrifiesRead moreIt helps that the performances are as good as they are. This is an impressive return to leading man prominence for Brody, whose career seemed to have been reduced to that of starry bit-parter – popping up entertainingly in Succession or Wes Anderson’s films, but rarely provided with anything to really chew on. That is certainly not the case here: Tóth is both a figure of immense sympathy, but also at times really dislikable – stubborn, resentful, bad-tempered – and Brody is able to bring out his sharp edges. Just as impressive, is Pearce’s performance as Van Buren, a character who could so easily slip into booming-voiced, blue-blooded caricature. But his Van Buren also nurses one hell of an inferiority complex, towards the European aesthete who has drifted into his life, one that he tries to overpower with money and American force of character.That tension, feels timely as both the US and Europe re-evaluate their relationship with each another. It’s one of the many reasons why, despite its period setting, The Brutalist feels of the moment. This a film that seeks to awe you into submission with its giant images and ideas. When it comes to this year’s best picture, the Academy should think big.Explore more on these topicsFilmBest picture Oscar hustingsOscarsThe BrutalistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the mountain backdrop and the cosy interiors are convincing, and it only took 45 seconds to make after the text prompt was entered. The technology will also improve.In order to access Sora users need to have a paid-for package with ChatGPT, but it is an indication of where video-generating technology is heading in the rapidly evolving AI market. It also underlines why the row over copyright has reached red-hot levels on both sides of the Atlantic.It is obvious that video generation tools such as Sora, Kling and Runway have the potential to transform the film, TV and advertising industries. One of the UK digital artists who has experimented with the tool, Josephine Miller, told the Guardian it has expanded opportunities for “younger creatives” and she is already using it to pitch advertising concepts to brands.OpenAI says creatives and studios in locations where Sora is already available, such as in the US, have been using it to produce film and advertising concepts and pitches.David Jones, the chief executive of Brandtech Group, an advertising startup using generative AI to create marketing campaigns, says there is going to be “tectonic disruption” of the advertising and marketing industries due to tools such as Sora.Jones says this is a “Kodak moment” for his industry, referring to the analogue camera film company thatsuccumbed to the digital revolution.Big advertisers are already embracing AI-made video. Coca-Cola produced an entirelyAI-generated Christmas adlast year and the technology’s implications were outlined in a pointed tweet from Alex Hirsch, the creator of the Disney-animated series Gravity Falls.“FUN FACT: @CocaCola is ‘red’ because it’s made from the blood of out-of-work artists!” he wrote.The problem of artists losing out to AI has become a key battleground in development of the technology on multiple levels, not least with regard to copyright. AI systems such as Sora and ChatGPT are powered by models that are trained on vast amounts of data culled from the internet. ChatGPT, which was also developed by OpenAI, is the subject of lawsuits claiming the use of artists’ work without permission is a breach of copyright.The row deepened in the UK this week over government plans to allow AI firms to use copyrighted work without permission. The creative sector hit back with the release ofa silent protest album by 1,000 musiciansand an open letter from leading creative figures including Dua Lipa, Sir Tom Stoppard and Sir Paul McCartney warning that the government was on the verge of agreeing a “wholesale giveaway of rights and income from the UK creative sectors to big tech”.Sora and its peers are not at the forefront of that row, but they clearly represent a competitive threat to artists who want recompense if their work has been used to create these tools – and their content. YouTube’s chief executive warned last year that it would be a breach of the platform’s terms of service if OpenAI had used YouTube content to train Sora’s model. Reports have already pointed to Sora’sapparent familiarity with gaming content.Beeban Kidron, an award-winning film-maker and crossbench peer whohas spoken out against the UK government’s plans, has told the Guardian that Sora’s arrival adds “another layer of urgency” to the debate.Tyler Perry is not the only creative who is concerned.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIComputingAdvertisingFilm industryTelevision industryTyler PerryanalysisShareReuse this content"

Yet health and environmental concerns about non-stick coatings and “forever chemicals” are making it increasingly complicated to pick the perfect pan.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Manufacturers of non-stick coatings insist they’re perfectly safe, but a growing number of companies are advertising their products as PFOA- or PFOS-free, all the same. So what are these controversial chemicals, and what’s the alternative if you don’t want your food to stick?What are forever chemicals, or PFAS?For the uninitiated, per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of chemicals that have been added to various consumer products, including cookware, since the 1950s. There are thousands of these chemicals, and they’re extremely useful, allowing dirt, grease – and eggs – to slide off surfaces. But once thrown away, it can take hundreds or even thousands of years for PFAS to degrade, which is why they are often referred to as “forever chemicals”. They can also leach out of landfill to contaminate soil and water, and accumulate in the tissues of living things over time. That can “threaten the wellbeing of species already struggling under mounting environmental pressures,” says Hannah Evans, a project manager at the environmental charityFidra.PFAS increase likelihood of death by cardiovascular disease, study showsRead moreA handful of PFAS that have been researched in depth have been linked to health issues such as cancer, immune system disorders and fertility problems. ThisEPA reportis a reputable source and provides a good overview of the knowns and unknowns.However, most of these chemicals are understudied, meaning their health and environmental impact is unknown. Some may be perfectly safe, including the PTFE- or Teflon-based coatings that are often sprayed on to pans to make them non-stick – although additionalPFASmay have been used to manufacture them.There are questions about their toxicity. For example, tetrafluoroethylene is used to make PTFE and theUS National Institutes of Healthlists it as “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen”. GenX is another chemical used to make Teflon and other types of PTFE. TheUS Environment Protection Agencyhas concluded that it may also be carcinogenic, based on animal studies.Because we can be exposed to PFAS in so many ways, and it is difficult to identify specific “causes and effects” for individual chemicals, many campaigners believe it is better to be safe than sorry – particularly when PFAS-free alternatives exist. Fidra and others are calling for agroup-based restrictionon all non-essential uses of PFAS in the UK, including frying pans. The good news is that alternative non-stick coatings are available, as are other types of frying pans that have no coatings at all, such as stainless steel or cast iron pans.Here’s our roundup of the best PFAS-free crepe pans and all-purpose frying pans for Pancake Day and beyond.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mint Images/Getty Images/Mint Images RFThe best PFAS-free crepe pansBest carbon steel crepe pan:De Buyer Mineral B crepe panView image in fullscreen£58.78 at Nisbets£58.87 at AmazonCrafted in France from carbon steel, which heats up quickly and conducts heat well, fans of the De Buyer Mineral B crepe pan say it helps make an authentic French-style crepe with crispy edges. Like cast iron, it can withstand high temperatures, but it’s lighter, making it easier to toss pancakes. It can also be used for cooking dosas, injera and searing vegetables. The pan is oven safe for up to 10 minutes at 200C.Carbon steel needs regular seasoning with oil, and this pan needs to be pre-seasoned before its first use. It should be cleaned only with a damp cloth and must be thoroughly dried and oiled before storage. Follow these instructions, and you’ll be rewarded with a crepe pan that builds up a dark patina and becomes more non-stick with time. This pan comes with a two-year guarantee.Best non-stick crepe pan:GreenPan Copenhagen pancake panView image in fullscreen£54.40 at GreenPan£68 at John LewisThis specialist crepe pan is light and shallow and helps create delightfully flippable pancakes that slide off the surface with ease. It features GreenPan’s Thermolon non-stick coating, and it is suitable for all hob types.GreenPan is verified PFAS-free by Fidra, and the key material in its non-stick cookware is silicon dioxide – which is also found in natural sand. The brand claims its non-stick coating is heat-resistant up to 450C (850F), oven-safe up to 220C (425F) and dishwasher-safe. Even so, it recommends using its pan on a low to medium heat, using a small amount of oil – butnot olive oil– or butter rather than cooking sprays, hand-washing with a soft cloth, and avoiding metal utensils to help preserve the coating.If you’re after a low-maintenance crepe pan, GreenPan’s is a great alternative to a carbon steel one.Best cast-iron crepe pan:Le Creuset small cast iron crepe panView image in fullscreen£139 at Le Creuset£139 at AmazonWhile owners of conventional cast iron pans may be wary of cooking pancakes in them, this classic-looking Le Creuset pan has a PFAS-free enamel coating, which users describe as a gamechanger – provided it is heated up slowly and a smear of oil or butter added before the batter. The pan is a little heavy for tossing but pancakes can be easily flipped using the wooden spatula provided. It can also be used for frying french toast, chapatis, naan bread, or grilling meat and vegetables (the pan is grill- and oven-safe).Provided the pan is used in normal, domestic conditions and the care and use instructions are followed, Le Creuset offers a lifetime guarantee covering faulty workmanship and materials.The bestall-purpose PFAS-free frying pansBest non-stick frying pan:GreenPan Barcelona ProView image in fullscreen£76 at GreenPan£76 at Harts of SturWith its deep, sloped sides, and elegant styling, this frying pan is perfect for cooking eggs, fish and vegetables with minimal oil, or simmering sauces such as bolognese, although it is a little too deep for pancakes. It features the same non-stick coating asGreenPan’s Copenhagen pancake panand if used following the instructions, is covered by a two-year warranty for manufacturing and material defects.Best small non-stick frying pan:Earth Pan ceramic non-stick frying panView image in fullscreen£43 at Prestige£43 at TescoThe Earth Pan range is made without PFAS and uses a lead- and cadmium-free non-stick coating. Its handle – made from recycled plastics – is designed to stay cool to the touch throughout cooking. It also comes with a five-year guarantee, provided it’s used following the manufacturer’s instructions.This 20cm frying pan has gently sloping sides, making it ideal for cooking omelettes and other small to medium-sized meals. However, it’s not oven-safe, so it’s not as versatile as some other non-stick pans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Supporting up to 10 cooking methods – including roasting and steaming – one of the few things this pan is poorly equipped to handle is pancakes, due to its deep sides.Our Place claims its pan’s ceramic coating is heat- and oven-resistant up to 230C (446F), which should make it fine for low to medium heats. Some users have complained that the coating can becomeless slippery with time, though, so it’s worth paying close attention to the manufacturer’s instructions.Best budget non-stick pan:MasterClass ceramic coated frying panView image in fullscreen£19.96 at Harts of Stur£21.99 at AmazonFor chefs who prefer a light and shallow non-stick pan, the MasterClass ceramic induction-ready pan is a good choice, although some caution that the coating gradually becomes less non-stick if used on high heat settings. So, as with other PFAS-free non-stick pans, it’s worth reading the manufacturer’s instructions and accepting that this pan may need replacing after a few years – although it is guaranteed for 15 years.This frying pan weighs 750g, is equipped with a ceramic handle to avoid it getting hot, and has gently sloping sides, making it good for pancake tossing.Best stainless-steel frying pan:ProCook Elite tri-ply frying panView image in fullscreen£69 at ProCookProfessional chefs often opt for stainless-steel cookware, due to its durability, resistance to scratches and corrosion, good heat conductivity, and ability to handle high temperatures. These pans are excellent for most cooking, from searing meat to frying. There’s no non-stick coating to wear off, so such pans should have a long lifespan – ProCook’s Elite tri-ply pan comes with a 25-year guarantee. Its construction comprises a stainless-steel exterior, aluminium core and stainless-steel interior, which ensures even cooking without hotspots. It’s also oven-safe to 260C and dishwasher-safe, although cleaning is best done in hot soapy water with a non-wire scouring pad.The lack of non-stick coating means chefs should add a glug of oil or smear of butter to the pan before cooking to prevent food from sticking. To cook pancakes in a stainless-steel pan, ProCook’s food expert Steven Carter-Bailey recommends preheating it over low to medium heat and testing if it’s ready by sprinkling a few drops of water on to the surface: “If they dance and sizzle, you’re good to go.” You should then add a thin layer of oil, butter or ghee before pouring in the batter. Between batches, lightly reapply oil and adjust the heat, if necessary, to prevent burning.Best cast iron frying pan:Solidteknicsiron skilletView image in fullscreen£110 at SolidteknicsCast iron pans are renowned for their durability, excellent heat retention and ability to withstand high temperatures, which means you can use them to sear steaks, cook or fry things slowly, create oven-baked dishes, or even cook over an open fire. However, they’re heavy and require regular seasoning to prevent rust.Wrought from a single sheet of iron, Solidteknics’ pan is half the weight of a conventional cast iron pan and comes pre-seasoned with rice bran oil, although it might be worth doing an additional season yourself to improve the pan’s non-stick qualities.The secret to preventing sticking in an iron pan is to preheat it for several minutes on a low to medium heat (if the pan gets too hot, this can also cause food to stick to its surface and burn) and add oil or butter before any food.With no coatings or joins to wear out or fail, this pan comes with a “multi-century warranty” for all defects related to materials or manufacturing that occur during normal cooking. The company suggests cleaning it only with hot water and a soft sponge, never placing it in a dishwasher, thoroughly drying it before storage, and regularly seasoning it with a thin layer of cooking oil.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: GMVozd/Getty ImagesHowdo you identify a PFAS-free pan?For now, it is up to consumers to decide whether to buy a conventional non-stick pan or a PFAS-free alternative. However, choosing the latter isn’t as straightforward as it may seem. Many pans are labelled “PFOA-free” or “PFOS-free”, referencing two PFAS with proven health concerns, but these chemicals are already banned under a global treaty called the Stockholm Convention. “Neither do these labels necessarily mean the pan is free from all PFAS, only those specific named PFAS,” says Eleanor Hawke, a campaigner for the environmental charity Chem Trust.Many highly rated non-stick pans that made it on to our longlist were rejected after closer inspection revealed that they contained PTFE or Teflon. This was also true of some “ceramic” coated pans, which also contained PTFE. Teflon and other types of PTFE are considered inert below about 260C, but there are concerns that they may release harmful chemicals when heated to high temperatures. And as mentioned above, the PFAS chemicals used to manufacture these substances can get into rivers and drinking water, accumulating in the plants and animals we eat, and so on. There are also worries about what happens to PTFE when it is thrown away and begins to degrade over the coming centuries. For these reasons, I have avoided reviewing pans coated with PTFE or Teflon.“To know whether the pan is PFAS-free, we would recommend consumers ask the retailer,” Hawke says. However, because manufacturers are not required to disclose if PFAS is contained in their products, retailers may not know. Evans of Fidra recommends checking product labels for mention of PFAS, as well as PFOA or PFOS, but a PFOA/PFOS label is largely meaningless: a PFAS-free label is more helpful as this covers PTFE.What are the alternatives?A growing number of companies are applying PFAS-free non-stick coatings to their cookware.Fidra lists some of these on its website, including some non-UK-based companies, but this is “by no means an exhaustive list”, Evans says.An alternative is to avoid non-stick coatings altogether, especially as these will eventually wear off, and opt for a stainless steel, iron or carbon steel pan instead. The latter two require a little more upkeep, including regular “seasoning”, which involves rubbing a small amount of cooking oil into their surface. And these pans require more oil or butter to be added before cooking to prevent food from sticking. But if they’re well cared for, they can last a lifetime.Linda Geddes is a former Guardian science correspondentExplore more on these topicsPFASThe FilterFoodHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ll break that down for you. “Robot”, as in the food is prepared by our new mechanical overlords. “Yakitori” is, essentially, meat grilled on small skewers – think tiny Japanese kebabs dipped in sauces. And then, of course, “restaurant”, as in that place where humans once had jobs before the robots took over. Bleeding robots, eh, clanking in here, taking our jobs?In fact, Yari Club’s “robot” sits in the window of the shop, seemingly to taunt passing Michelin-starred chefs who believe the world will cease to spin if these culinary gods are not up by 5am to source fennel pollen and beech sap. Real chefs can be a huge pain: pricey, sulky and fickle. But there are no such problems with the chef at Yari Club, because it’s a big stainless-steel box filled with hot oil. Despite that jaw-dropping, futuristic aspect being trumpetedloudlyin all the marketing, this particular robot is, at first glance, hugely disappointing. Less robotic than I’d imagined (or hoped for) and more simply a deeply unattractive kitchen gadget. Skewers of chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, chicken wings and every other imaginable bits of a chicken are loaded on to a pulley, dragged through hot oil for a robotically precise number of minutes to make them succulent, then dipped into a special, sweet, soy-based sauce to finish.View image in fullscreen‘Undeniably delicious’:tebaandtorinikuyakitori skewers at Yari Club, London WC2.What was I expecting? One of the 1980s mime duoTik + Tokwearing an apron and beckoning me inside to eat microchips in a repurposed spacecraft? No, but neither did I expect the robot to be simply a no-frills deep-fat fryer, or – and this is the kicker – for it to rely so heavily on humans to do its job. On the lunchtime I visited, Yari Club was almost empty, while Berwick Street market just up the road in Soho was absolutely heaving with lunch-hour workers queueing at its plethora of food trucks, or at the newish pizza spotBreadstall, where artisan slices of cheesy carbs are cooked and served by human hand. Oddly, there seems to be something about the big, spitty, oil-stained Yari Club robot that isn’t drawing the crowds.View image in fullscreenOne of Yari Club’s ‘whopping’ bento boxes – the Kyoto bento.At first glance, Yari Club’s menu might seem a little limited, especially if you’re not in the mood for autopsied chicken on a stick, or to eat it in an unlovable, brown “cafe” space that’s about as cosy as the waiting room in a regional minicab office. In actual fact, however, there’s a lot to love about the food at Yari Club, although it will take a good 10 minutes to work that out, even with the help of a wonderful front-of-house person who pointed out the bento boxes, the katsu curries and the very moreish corn ball options, which turned out to be deep-fried clusters of spicy, crunchy sweetcorn, and completely irresistible. It took another server to point out thetsukunechicken meatball skewers, the mulled sake, the winter specials menu, the padrón peppers and the vegetable tempura.In fact, all the Yari Club’s robot experience does is underline quite how brilliant humans are, what with their opposable thumbs, patience and empathy, and how much hospitality needs them to survive. The Yari Club robot owes a great debt to real-life hospitality staff, because it can’t, for a start, process orders, load up its own skewers or put them on plates. It also can’t cater for vegans, it seems: one potential diner walked in, asked if the tofu scallion option could be cooked without touching chicken fat, was met with bemused looks and flounced out. In a normal restaurant, someone would have bargained with that customer, but robot yakitori not care about the flounce.View image in fullscreenYari Club’s spiced sake has the potential to be ‘a migraine in a paper cup’.All that said, the food at Yari Club is really rather good and, at about £3.80 for two skewers, very reasonably priced, too. Themomochicken thigh skewer, the classicnegimachicken, the teba chicken wings and the prawn tempura are all undeniably delicious: crisp, juicy, tender, smoky when they need to be, and soft and sweet in other places. For all of £13.80, you can build a whopping bento box featuring six skewers, rice or salad, coleslaw, pickles, nori and more of the special-blend, umami flavour bomb that is Yari’s dipping sauce. The mulled sake, meanwhile, has all the whack of sake combined with the synthetic aspect of supermarket mulled wine mix; a migraine in a paper cup. They have Coedo Shikkoko black lager and oolong tea in cans, too, as well lots of nice Japanese teas.I’d go back to Yari Club for a snack, but it’s not really worth travelling out of your way for. There are more impressive robots at the Asda self-checkout.

Take the gelatinous success of Instagram accounts such as70s Dinner Partyor the unfathomable cool-ification of devilled eggs. Another thing that’s deserving of a prance back into popularity is Babycham. It’s kitsch in a bottle. Liquid, postwar optimism. And it’s potentially up for a modern revival. Or at least I want it to be, so I’m writing a column about it. It’s called manifesting.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For those who didn’t live through its heyday, Babycham is a sparkling perry, which is like cider, except made from pears. Originally named Champagne de la Poire, Babycham was created by the Showering cider family from pears they saw going to waste when they were buying from local apple orchards. In a postwar world, Herbert Showering saw the changes in drinking habits among women, and an opportunity to create a drink targeted specifically at them.And so Babycham sparkling perry was born. Dinky glasses, handsome men and extremely flammable dresses painted a picture of glamorous, feminine and moderated drinking. Back then, it was an aspirational picture for an emerging middle class; today, however, the obvious attempt to market to women by men feels dated and cynical. If you’d like some further reading on this, drinks writer Rachel Hendry wrote a sparkling deep-diveon Babychamas a precautionary tale about heavily gendered marketing and the part it had to play in the drink falling out of favour with a 21st-century audience.But a modern Babycham is more than deserving of a revival. In 2021, some 70 years after its launch, the sons of the original Showering brothers bought back the brand from Accolade Wines, with the aspiration to “modernise” it to “new and familiar customers” (if they’re looking for a new Babycham girl, my DMs are open). At 6% ABV and with a sweet, fruity palate, it makes a lot of sense in the current market, where low-alcohol and storied drinks are favoured among a younger generation. If you like the sweet, soft fruitiness of prosecco, for example, you’ll probably like Babycham.Other than drinking it straight, try treating it as you would sparkling wine in a cocktail. Anywhere you’d pop prosecco, use Babycham. Mix it into asgroppino. Pour it into abellini.

This led to an argument, withthem saying they never want to watch something that will make them feel sadness again. I encouragedthem to sit with sadness; they went to bed.We have been together forsix years, and it feelsas if they are wanting to shut themselves off from vulnerable emotions. It has been this way since we got together, and I am trying to support them as well as support my own emotional wellbeing.I believe it is important to remind ourselves of the tragedy and beauty in the world, and not close ourselves off from sadness; I seeit as valuable. My partner believes they have experienced too much pain and they want to keep that door closed.A decade has passed since their fatherdied, and I fully support my partner and understandthey must be feeling emotional pain. But I worry that without finding some peace and the ability to take on difficult emotions, it will affect their, and our, future.I don’t know how to tread. Itfeelsas if I have to sacrifice my own interests and emotional availability to preserve their needs a lot of the time.I want to support them, but I don’t know what to do.It’s a very common response to turn away from “negative” or hard-to-handle emotions. But what I learned early on in this job is that humans are not like fuse boxes – you can’t isolate one switch: if you numb one emotion, you dampen all of them. Also to even begin to process things we really need to face them.I went to psychotherapist John-Paul Davies, not least because he taught me that “human beings aren’t built for happiness, they’re built for survival – happiness has to be worked at”. Indeed, if we only pursued happiness, we’d be dead as a species. But in order to experience happiness, we also need to be able to experience sadness.“One of the repeating themes I see as a therapist,” he said after reading your letter, “is people disconnecting from their sadness and grief and, in turn, one of nature’s greatest gifts to help us move through these emotions: tears.”Sadness and grief are in the same emotional room as love, and turning against them hinders our capacity for emotional intimacyAlthough you haven’t commented on whether your partner is afraid to cry, a lot of people are, even though tears can have soothing properties. While I understand your partner’s fears and their desire not to experience more sadness, Davies explained that “by keeping the door closed in this way, their pain can’t move, it stays frozen in time and is experienced, in one way or another, for ever. A person is then often left only with fear and anger [because the pain is omnipresent] or experiencing nothing much at all emotionally. This is because sadness and grief are in the same emotional room as love, and turning against them hinders our capacity for emotional intimacy and vulnerability, and therefore to really love and be loved.”Davies wondered if your partner was only like this with others, or if they allow themselves to feel sadness on their own? Some people find it very hard to show such a vulnerable emotion in the company of others.How to move forward? “It’s important to remember,” said Davies, “that these are often deep-rooted patterns and change can therefore take time. When we learn to live with something early on, it can take time to unlearn living with it, and time to develop and establish a different way of doing things.” I would add that your partner probably sees their way of doing things as protective and having “worked for them so far”, even if it actually doesn’t work for them in the long term or isn’t healthy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A woman was talking about donating her womb to a stranger. She explained why she’d decided to give someone the chance to experience pregnancy. As a mother of two, I was blown away.At lunch I was glued to my phone, reading everything I could about the procedure: how the first successful uterus transplant had taken place in Sweden in 2013, and how the operation had been carried out in the US since 2016. How it was helping women who had lost their uteri due to cancer, or never developed one because of the congenital condition Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH).I was 39, hadn’t experienced infertility, and had never considered organ donation before. But something about it touched me deeply. When I read that Penn Medicine hospital, just 40 minutes from our home in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, had a uterus transplant programme, it sealed the deal.I told my husband, Brian, about my plans, and applied the next day. For 12 weeks, I was evaluated by a surgical team, an infectious disease doctor and a psychiatrist. They needed to know that I was strong enough to deal with the procedures and the possibility that it might not work.The risks were set out: after surgery, I could face problems with my bowel and bladder. It was a major operation. It was also made clear that, if it was successful, I wouldn’t know who had received my uterus. I had to agree that I would not try to search for her.I was accepted on the programme, and they started looking for a match. Then, in January, I got the call that they’d found someone. I got chills.As we approached the surgery date in February 2020, I thought about the recipient constantly. Our children, Ava, then 10, and Aidan, nine, were amazing. They understood that I was doing it to help another woman become a mum.Experience: I gave birth to my granddaughterRead moreSitting in the waiting room was the wildest feeling. They kept me and my recipient in different wings of the hospital, so we couldn’t accidentally meet. But I couldn’t help looking at every woman who walked past. Could this be her?As I lay down for surgery, I felt my heart thumping – but it was more from anticipation than nerves.Waking up, my only thought was: did it work? When I heard it had, I cried, overwhelmed with joy. My recovery was tough. I needed a second surgery. But I didn’t regret my decision.Afterwards, I kept wondering about the recipient. Was it the woman behind me in the coffee shop or on the school run? A few months later, with the help of social workers, we were allowed to send each other screened messages. They were vague, but just hearing that she was well was incredible.It was clear that we both wanted to communicate openly, and our social workers allowed it. Her first email said, “How wonderful to know the name of the woman who so generously gave me the opportunity of creating life.” I cried.Her name was Chelsea, and she’d discovered at 15 that she had MRKH. Desperate to become a mother, she’d almost lost hope. Surrogacy hadn’t worked. Then she discovered uterus donation. She and her husband had moved 1,900 miles from Montana to join the programme. It had worked. She was expecting a baby.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Turning the corner, I saw her holding her pregnant belly. We ran into each other’s arms.Hearing that her son, Telden, had been born shortly after our meeting was joyful. It felt like another member of our family had arrived. When I held him for the first time, I was speechless.In the years since, my bond with Chelsea has grown. We speak every week and visit as often as we can. I was so happy when she had her second son, Stetson, in October 2022. My kids adore her kids – seeing them all together makes me so happy. They share a unique bond: they were grown in the same uterus, but in different bodies.I look at them and feel grateful: to the news story that changed my life, to the miracle of science that allowed this, and to Chelsea, a former stranger who will for ever be my soul sister.As told to Kate GrahamDo you have an experience to share?

You decide who has cause for alarmFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorGeorgina LawtonFri 28 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 08.40 ESTShareThe prosecution: ReggieI hate talking to anyone for the first two hours of my day. I think that should be respectedLiving with an early riser when you’re not one yourself can drastically decrease your quality of life. I should know, I live with Kevin.I like the fact he is an organised flatmate. He always makes enough food for two and he’s very tidy. But he gets up so early and makes a lot of noise, which really winds me up.Every Sunday, while I’m still in bed, Kevin stomps around in the kitchen at 8am, making a smoothie before the gym. I’ll drift back to sleep, but then he comes back two hours later and makes breakfast, clattering pans and playing music loudly.I’m glad he’s so happy and I don’t want to control when he gets up, but I’d love it if he could keep the noise down.Kevin says he physically can’t sleep in. That’s fine. But why should I suffer just because he’s an early bird? Sometimes Kevin jokes that I’m lazy, but we just have different body clocks.When I hear Kevin stomping around in his work shoes on our wooden floors, or opening and closing the fridge, it’s jarringI get up around midday on the weekend. I don’t feel bad about it. During the week, our schedules work a bit better: Kevin is up at 6.45am, showers and makes breakfast before I rise at 9am for work.But sometimes, when I hear Kevin stomping around in his work shoes on our wooden floors, or opening and closing the fridge, it’s jarring. Even more so than at the weekends, because sleep before work is precious.On the other hand, Kevin has been my personal alarm clock on occasions. He says I should be grateful for the noise in the week because I’ve been known to be late starting work when I’ve accidentally slept in. But generally, I’m not a morning person and I hate talking to anyone for the first two hours of my day. I think that should be respected.Kevin says I should try getting up earlier as it would make everything easier, but why should I? Late sleepers always get a bad rep, but I’m actually just as productive as Kevin.I would really appreciate it if he stopped pressuring me to become an early riser and simply worked on being quieter. I don’t think I need to change.The defence: KevinReggie is a night owl. I can hear him after midnight sometimes, but I don’t say anythingThe early bird catches the worm. It’s a well-worn adage for a reason. Early risers are known to have better sleep, better moods and are even at a lower risk of certain cancers.I like getting up early and starting my day with purpose. I don’t use the snooze button and I don’t feel groggy in the mornings: I hop out of bed. I think Reggie wishes he could be like me, but because he isn’t one of those people who gets up with the lark, he wants to control my schedule and noise output.I don’t deliberately try to wake him up, but if I need to go to work or the gym, that involves walking along the hall in our flat and making breakfast. Sometimes, I’ll come back from the gym at midday and Reggie is still in bed. If he wants me to be quieter, he needs to have a reasonable cut-off time for making noise in the mornings, particularly at the weekend.There have also been times I’ve woken Reggie up and he’s been gratefulDuring the week, for example, we both agreed that noise after 11pm isn’t acceptable. But Reggie is a night owl, and when I’m in bed I sometimes hear him shuffling around, playing music or eating. I don’t often say anything, even if it goes on until midnight. But I don’t think he affords me the same privilege in the mornings.It’s less acceptable to ask me not to make noise at midday on a Saturday. It’s the weekend! By midday, the day is half gone. The world is awake and Reggie should be too. He’s 32, not a child. I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect me to make food silently, or tiptoe around because he’s still asleep.There have also been times I’ve woken Reggie up and he’s been grateful. He slept in after a night out once, and I had to wake him up for work. If both of us were night owls, the flat would be chaos.I can try to be a bit more considerate with noise in the mornings, but it would be easier for us both if Reggie got up at a reasonable time on the weekends – around 10am – so I don’t have to worry about making breakfast after the gym.The jury of Guardian readersShould Kevin pipe down in the morning?I’m for Kevin’s seize-the-day approach. Life is short and Reggie is missing out by spending half the day in bed. Be grateful, Reggie, that you have a human alarm clock to remind you the day is ticking away.Jo, 37The solution for more harmonious cohabitation is obvious: Kevin lingers in bed for another hour at weekends while Reggie goes to bed a bit earlier. But Kevin should also make less noise by not preparing the loudest breakfast possible and stomping around in work shoes on a wooden floor early doors.Frederico, 48This is a tough one to call as it must be really difficult for a night owl and an early bird to live in the same nest easily. Earplugs for both of them would help, but if I must choose then I’m with Kevin: the world can’t tiptoe around you just because you don’t like mornings, Reggie.Dervla, 30Reggie is embarrassing himself. Why should Kevin make a big effort to be silent just so Reggie can sleep even longer? Kevin has every right to make a smoothie and have breakfast in the flat before going to work. Deal with it Reggie!Simeon, 28Sharing a flat means being tolerant and willing to compromise. Having different body clocks is normal but when Reggie says: “I don’t think I need to change”, what incentive is he offering Kevin to change? So not guilty for me.Dalilah, 51Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who you think is in the wrong?The poll closes on Thursday 6 March at 10am GMTLast week’s resultsYou decided whetherBrody should invite his cheating friend to his birthdaywhen the friend’s ex will also be there.62%of you said yes –Brody is guilty38%of you said no –Brody is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every three months, as the UK enters a new season, we ask you to send us an article written by a child aged 8-14.The article needs to be about arecent encounter they’ve had with nature– whether it’s a field of early spring flowers, a nest-building bird or a pond full of frogspawn.Crucially, it doesn’t matter if the child is a nature expert or has never picked up a pair of binoculars. We are especially keen to reach teachers who might like to get their class outside and noticing nature.The deadline for submissions is noon on Monday 31 March.Six winning entries will be chosen. These will be published in the Guardian newspaper and online – two in March, two in April and a final two in May. Then on 1 June the form will reopen again below, for articles about summer.Note that if you send your piece in early enough, you stand a chance of being published on 22 March.How your child can take partFirst of all, we’re looking for children age 8 to 14, so we will need your permission, as parent or guardian. Then here’s what the child needs to do:Step 1– Go out one day to where there is some nature. It could be their local woods or beach, their garden, a farm, or simply the nearest park.Step 2– Write an article of200-250 wordstelling uswhat they saw and what happened.Step 3– Send the article to us using the form below. We ask that you fill in the form yourself rather than the child.Photos/drawings– These are helpful (especially landscape rather than portrait) but they are not a condition of entry. If you have some, please tell us in the “more information” field, as there’s no way to attach them to the form.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PhotoAlto/Eric Audras/Getty ImagesHints and tips for any budding YCD writersIf the child gets stuck and doesn’t know what to write about, here are a few pointers:Good nature writing starts with the senses – so what did you see and hear? What about smell and touch? Take notes when you’re out and about so you don’t forgetHow would you describe what happened? Did it remind you of anything?It’s great to look up some extra information about what you saw, and tell us about that too. For example, if you find an interesting-looking bug, see if you can find out what type of butterfly it was, how long they live – any juicy titbits!You can think big, and describe the whole scene – the sky, the horizon, the landscape. Or you can think small, and tell us some details about the butterfly’s wings or the beetle’s markings.What did your encounter with nature make you think about? How did it make you feel?The deadline for entry is noon onMonday 31 March. Anyone can enter their child who isaged between 8 and 14 and based in the UK. You the parent/guardian will be contacted if your child’s piece is selected for publication, and you will be paid on behalf of the child.For further inspiration, here are a few recent Young Country Diaries:Tilly, 12, on starlingsPolly, 9, on a noise in the winter woodsEsther, 11, on ivy taking overGood luck, everyone!Paul Fleckney, editor of Young Country Diary and Country DiaryWe ask that the parent/guardian fills in the form below, rather than your child.

In her opening remarks, Lia Finocchiaro acknowledged veterans and the families of those who survived – but not the Larrakia people, on whose land the event was held.She latertold local radiothat such gestures, widely made at public gatherings to show respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, had become “tokenistic” and “divisive”.“I’m about unifying Territorians,” Finocchiaro said. “When I speak as chief minister, it’s for everyone.”It is commonplace across Australia to pay respect to the traditional owners of the land on which a public gathering takes place through a welcome to country or an acknowledgment of country.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAs a federal election approaches, conservative politicians have taken aim at the ritual, saying people feel like it is being“rammed down their throats”.A welcome is given by an authorised traditional owner and can include a speech, song, dance or smoking ceremony. An acknowledgment is typically a brief statement recognising traditional owners that anyone can make.Sometimes events will open with a welcome to country followed by a brief acknowledgment from each speaker. This was the case with all eight dignitaries at the Darwin event, except the chief minister – who said that while welcomes have their place, too much repetition can make the gesture seem insincere.Finocchiaro’s federal colleague, the newly appointed shadow minister for government efficiency and Warlpiri woman, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, haspledged to redirect spendingfrom welcome to country ceremonies – which cost $550,000 in the past two years – to initiatives that “actually improve” the lives of Indigenous people.More than 10,000 First Nations people killed in Australia’s frontier wars, final massacre map showsRead moreThe minister forIndigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, dismissed the move as “another attempt to use culture war tactics to distract from the Coalition’s lack of a plan for Indigenous Australians”.The co-chair of Reconciliation Australia, Kirstie Parker, says much of the furore was underpinned by a fundamental misunderstanding of the intention behind the custom.“This is not a political matter,” she says. “It’s a matter of the heart.”Parker says a common complaint from critics,“I don’t need to be welcomed to my own country,”underlines this misunderstanding.Indigenous groups, she says, are not welcoming people to the Australian nation, but rather on to the land within their cultural boundaries which they have cared for, and lived on, for millennia.The Yuwaalaraay woman fears the tone of political debate in Australia has shifted in the two years since theoverwhelming no votein the referendum to introduce an Indigenous voice to parliament.The Coalition campaigned on a no vote. In December 2024, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, refused to stand in front of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags because it was“dividing” the country. In January the party began campaigning against welcome to country ceremonies.“Post the referendum, there have been attempts by some Australians to cancel all things Aboriginal,” says Parker. “It’s sad, and it’s really disappointing.”‘Ugly politicking’Under traditional protocols,Reconciliation Australia says, when one group entered the land of another Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander nation, they would ask permission. The hosting group would welcome the visitors and offer them “safe passage and protection of their spiritual being during the journey”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Event organisers will often pay a fee for an authorised traditional owner to give a Welcome to Country.Nathan Moran is the head of the Sydney Metro Local Aboriginal Land Council, the city’s largest organisation representing Aboriginal people. It facilitates an average of 30 welcome to country ceremonies a week.View image in fullscreenMoran is ‘bemused’ by the objections to welcome to country ceremonies, given the problems faced by Indigenous Australians.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/The GuardianThe fee for the service is negotiated depending on the request. It maybe free for small charity-run meetings,$200 for a standard event or up to $800 for longer events outside regular working hours.The proceeds are evenly split between the person giving the welcome and community programs that provide financial support for funerals, social housing and student scholarships.Moran is “bemused” that conservative politicians have targeted a symbolic gesture that stimulates the Indigenous economy. Disproportionate rates of incarceration, suicide and preventable disease among Indigenous people are a better target for public outrage, he says.“It’s just ugly politicking,” he says. “It’s beating up on a small group of people to try and create an issue so you can get political gain.”‘I knew those things couldn’t sit in a box’: Lowitja O’Donoghue’s niece sheds new light on her extraordinary lifeRead moreSome Indigenous groups, however, believe the current practice of Welcomes to Country have become commercialised and strayed from their original purpose.The Juru people in north Queenslandbanned the ceremonieson their land because they were being done by people without proper cultural authority for excessive fees.Wally Bell, a Ngunnawal elder based in Canberra, now refuses to do a Welcome to Country. “Our ceremony is quite traditional and meaningful and a lot of that essence … has gone by the wayside,” he says.He will instead conduct a “rite of passage” whereby he explains the ancient custom of seeking permission to enter another group’s land, without “putting on a show”.Parker says while local Indigenous communities are entitled to have a nuanced discussion about the practice, it’s important not to conflate that with sweeping calls from the wider public to reform or cease giving welcomes or acknowledgments nationwide.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansIndigenous affairs reportingJacinta Nampijinpa PriceNorthern TerritoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am worried about my girls. It is like I feel apologetic to them. But I think by now I am just as effective dead as alive. I think the campaign for his release will go on if I die. It is strong enough that it will continue after I have gone, and so I will have not died in vain.”Her son knows she is in hospital, but has not been able to communicate with her.She has lost a third of her weight, her blood sugar reading has dropped and her face in the past fortnight has become noticeably thinner, the lines on her face even deeper than before. Flowers from the Foreign Office and a book on the Palestinians lie by her bedside, which ironically overlooks the House of Commons.At her bedside are her two daughters, Mona and Sanaa, and other family and friends, many of them Egyptian intellectuals. She insists that once this glucose has been taken, there will be no other infusion until she is unconscious. The doctors, caught in a moral dilemma, have agreed to respect her wishes, including her continued refusal to eat food.The drip was only agreed after her doctor gave her the stern warning that her organs, in particular her heart and brain, are likely to become permanently damaged. They wrote: “We advise intravenous glucose or controlled refeeding immediately to reduce the risk to herself. The longer the duration of her fasting, the higher the risk of death during the refeeding process, should she cease fasting.”She said: “I will continue until there is some positive response from the Egyptian government, whether it is allowing my son to have a consular visit or his release.”There is a faint hope that with the Egyptian state traditionally willing to grant pardons at Ramadan, a new push by the British government might lead to a breakthrough.But the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, by Thursday had not made a phone call to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to seek his release. He wrote two letters at the turn of the year. On 14 February he met the family to explain what the government had been doing to secure her son’s release. The family in turn brought a copy of his collection of essays, You Have Not Been Defeated.At prime minister’s questions this week, before travelling to Washington, Starmer promised he would make the call if necessary, and said there was a feeling in the family: “If not now, when?”The family feel Sisi is immunised by his advisers from bad news, and it may take an external figure such as Starmer to tell him leniency would be in Egypt’s national interest. But such are the secret wheels of diplomacy, and the bigger Middle East issues at stake, that it may be that Sisi has been refusing to take a call from Starmer.The family have also had numerous meetings with the Foreign Office, but fear the lack of an all-government effort focused on Sisi rather than the Egyptian foreign ministry has made the lobbying ineffective.Sanaa Soueif said:“When we met Keir Starmer he asked us for more time and promised that he would do all he could to free my brother and reunite him with his son in Brighton. My sister and I have convinced my mother to take one dose of glucose drip, to try to stop her from dying of hunger today.“Nothing is guaranteed, but we hope that this gives us a few more days with our mother, and that Keir Starmer keeps his promise.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEgyptLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Hamas video showed them sitting in a minivan watching thepropaganda-laden handover ceremony, and then turning to the cameras to plead with Benjamin Netanyahu to agree asecond phase in the current ceasefire, which would allow the release of all the remaining 59 hostages (only a minority of whom are thought to be still alive).The majority of Israelis and international public opinion, the Trump administration included, want a second phase but, as conceived in the original truce agreement in January, that would involve elements including a complete Israeli withdrawal fromGaza, which could bring down Netanyahu’s rightwing coalition.An Israeli delegation attalks in Cairo on Fridayis reported to have called for a six-week extension to the first phase of the ceasefire. According to Egyptian media, it would involve further hostage releases in exchange for hundreds more Palestinians held in Israeli jails, but it would postpone military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Hamas is said to have rejected the proposal.For Ilay David, Evyatar’s older brother, the video was confirmation of an emotional certainty that the family had held on for the 16 months since the outbreak of war: he was alive.“It was the first ever sign of life,” Ilay said. “We had this feeling that he’s OK and he’s surviving. I had no doubt, but seeing it was amazing. For me, it was like oxygen.”For his family, the joy of seeing Evyatar alive was marred by his appearance, and the intense suffering it implied.View image in fullscreenIlay David watches the Hamas video showing his brother, Evyatar David, and Guy Gilboa-Dalal who are both Israeli hostages.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“He looks half the man he was. He looks starved. He looks exhausted,” Ilay said. He has talked to released hostages who were held with Evyatar for months and heard about the conditions in narrow, airless tunnels, with starvation rations – “a pitta a day and two spoonfuls of cheese”.On the other hand, it was a comfort to see Evyatar with his childhood friend, Gilboa-Dalal, with whom he had gone to the music festival, and to know he was not completely alone.Hamas knew very well what it was doing with the video. Seeing these two young men pleading for peace and their release has underlined the human costs Israel will suffer if it goes back to war.Ilay was already spending most of his time campaigning for the ceasefire but said the video had brought even greater urgency to his family’s mission.“It only drives us to do more, to speak with more people, to keep lobbying, to make him more visible – as visible as we can make him,” he said.He recently returned from a lobbying trip to Washington where he met senators, state department officials and, most importantly, Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East who has publicly insisted that the ceasefire continue until all the hostages are free and the bodies of the dead handed over.“He will try with all of his might to bring back all the hostages, whether it’s second phase or another phase or another kind of deal,” Ilay said. “He’s a warm person, very decent, very honest, and Trump relies on him.”All of that does not necessarily mean that Netanyahu will follow Witkoff’s guidance, especially if it could break his coalition apart and result in early elections. The Israel Defense Forces are due to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border eight days into the second phase of the ceasefire. It is a strip of land that Netanyahu has previously deemed to be vital to Israeli security, and abandoning it could well cause a coalition crisis.“The IDF retreat from Philadelphi – that’s a big deal. It’s a big asset to Israel, so I don’t know what will happen,” Ilay said. “We understand that these are critical moments. Decisions are being made right now.”As for Netanyahu, he said: “I count on him to bring the hostages back and I think he understands that to bring them back is … something which goes to the core of the Jewish nation and the ethos of the Israeli state – solidarity and leaving no one behind.”As well as visiting the Trump administration, Ilay has been touring the West Bank, visiting militant settlers, the constituency most adamantly opposed to the ceasefire, seeking to engage anyone who will talk to him.“We are right now in this weird moment where a lot depends on the pressure that the families can put on the government but also on the public,” he said. “We try to do whatever we can to speak to politicians and with public leaders and military veterans – anyone who has any influence.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

She scurried over to Casa Santa Marta, in a building adjacent to St Peter’s Basilica, and asked a Swiss guard if she could bring some ice-cream for the pontiff.“The Swiss guard said yes, and that whatever she brings to the pope he will gladly receive it. So we brought him 4kg of ice-cream.”It was 2018, and ice-cream orders from Pope Francis and other high-rankingVaticanofficials became regular, marking the start of a friendship between the Padrón family and the pontiff, whose favourite flavour isdulce de leche, a typical Argentinian caramel dessert, although he also likes lemon and mango.View image in fullscreenPope’s favourite: a dulce de leche flavored ice-cream.Photograph: Victor Sokolowicz/The GuardianBut Padrón really captured the pope’s heart in 2020, after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased, by sending him a home-made empanada, the Argentinian equivalent of a Cornish pasty.Again, it was Silvia’s intervention that did the trick. “She wrote a message on the empanada saying: ‘It’s about time we met’,” said Padrón. “Francis then called me and invited the family to Casa Santa Marta. I was so nervous but he made us feel completely relaxed. He’s a very kind, simple person.”Francis, who has been in hospital with pneumonia for two weeks, was a regular visitor to the Italian capital before becoming pope in 2013, making friends with several shopkeepers, including keeping up visits to the premises of some despite his movements in public being limited, before his current bout of illness.Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 14 February after struggling to breathe and was subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in both lungs. His condition has been touch and go but there has been a slight improvement in recent days. However, as of Thursday, medics still gave a “guarded” prognosis, meaning he was not yet out of danger.View image in fullscreenSebastian Padrón and family with Pope Francis at the Vatican in 2020.Photograph: Victor Sokolowicz/The GuardianThe mood among well-wishers in Rome has been one of apprehension. “We hope that he continues to get better, but I’m a little worried,” said Cristina who was in St Peter’s Square with her husband, Mario. “He was very much for ordinary people. We live in Rome … we’ve never met him but he feels more like a parish priest than a pope, such is his humility.”His relationships with local shopkeepers are seen by many as a testament to the humility of the pope, although some traders initially feared when he took up the papacy that his frugal approach might not favour them.“[When Francis became pope] he immediately started working to simplify things,” said Raniero Mancinelli, a tailor who owns Mancinelli Clero, a historic shop in Borgo Pio, next to the Vatican, that produces ecclesiastical robes and jewellery. “We were a little concerned that this would mean cutting out a bit of luxury. But in the end we carried on working as usual.”Mancinelli, who has fitted out garments for Francis and met him personally, added: “One might say he’s stubborn, but I disagree. Yes, he’s someone who is direct and likes to get things done. We are really rooting for him to pull through and want to see him back at St Peter’s. Francis – the people are waiting for you.”Among the pope’s other shopkeeper friends in Rome are Alessandro Spieza, an optician on Via del Babuino in the city’s historic centre. The pope has occasionally turned up at the shop unannounced, arriving in his modest Fiat 500 or Ford Focus.In 2022, Francis, a lover of classical music, slipped out of the Vatican one evening to visit old friends at Stereosound, a music shop next to the Pantheon. He was there to bless the shop’s new renovations and left with a gift box containing vinyls. Neither Spieza nor the owner of Stereosound wanted to recount their experiences to journalists, out of respect for the pope and his health.Nightly prayers vigils for the pope’s health are being held at St Peter’s basilica and in towns and cities acrossItalyand abroad, especially in his home city of Buenos Aires.“May our prayer be the breath of air that Pope Francis’s lungs need. Do not slow down. We need you very much,” Jorge Ignacio García Cuerva, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, said this week.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisItalyCatholicismChristianityReligionEuropeThe papacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I wanted to move away from American companies,” he said. “Canadians know Americans pretty well, and we don’t always agree with the choices that they make. A lot of us are disappointed, to put it mildly.”Making the switch has not been the easiest task: the two countries’ economies have been tightly bound through a longstanding free trade agreement since the late 1980s.But years of cross-border trade and investment has blurred the lines on country of origin: in the car manufacturing industry, for example, a vehicle passes the border an average of seven times during the manufacturing process.View image in fullscreenGraham Palmateer uses flour made with Ontario grain and cheese from Canadian suppliers.Photograph: Graham Palmateer/Gram’s PizzaThose attempting to impose a full boycott of consumer goods havebeen caught off-guardat grocery stores where “Made In Canada” products might contain some US ingredients.And while Canada’s political leaders have at times appeared to be flailing in their response to Trump’s threat,ordinary Canadians have decided to get their retaliation in early, and boycott American goods.A poll this month by the Angus Reid Institute published found that since Trump revived his threat of tariffs,four in five Canadians have been buying more Canadian products.Some grocery stores have even labeled which items are made by Canadian producers. Bar Sazerac in Hamilton, about an hour west of Toronto, is no longer using American alcohol in its menu.Palmateer said his transition to Canadian ingredients had some bumps initially. He had trouble sourcing Canadian diet soda, while some items, like mushrooms, are more expensive to source locally. Instead of Californian tomatoes, he opted for canned ones from Italy.But he has since gotten into the swing of things. He uses a Quebec-based company to source pepperoni, the flour he uses is made with Ontario grain and cheese is easy to source from Canadian suppliers.View image in fullscreenInstead of Californian tomatoes, Graham Palmateer uses canned ones from Italy and a Quebec-based company to source pepperoni.Photograph: Graham Palmateer/Gram’s PizzaThe cost of operating has increased slightly, “but by and large, I haven’t had to change pricing”, he said.Kenneth Wong, an associate professor at the business school at Queen’s University in Ontario, said he had been surprised by an apparently organic response among Canadian consumers: on a visit to his local grocery store, homegrown apples were sold out, while next to them, a bin of US apples appeared to be untouched.“Canadians are bearing down in ways I never thought they would,” he said.After appearing to relent on the tariff threat, Trump on Thursday repeated his intention to apply the levy on imports fromCanadaon Mexico from 4 March.The continuing uncertainty has prompted Canadian provinces to lift some internal trade barriers – a move which Wong said could somewhat reduce Canada’s strong reliance on the US.“And once that fully happens, tastes will change and habits will form. I’m not saying you can’t win back your consumer if you’re a US firm, but I am saying it’s going to be a lot more expensive to do so,” he said.Palmateer said his customer base seemed to be happy with his choice to shun American products. “It’s pretty much been positive. ‘Good for you’ kind of comments,” he said.One customer was upset they could no longer drink a Sprite with their Pizza. But Palmateer has since found Canadian soda brands like Sap Sucker which he hopes will fit the bill. Either way, he says he will not go back to using US ingredients.“This boycott … is my way of voting with my dollar,” he says. “If it encourages someone else to also do the same thing and divest, that’s a good step.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What their captors did not know – even after the young women’s daring escape together – was that they were cousins.Both had grown up around Mucojo, a small coastal town 130 miles (210km) south of the Tanzanian border, from where they had been abducted in separate raids in 2020 byAhlu Sunnah Wa-Jamaamilitants, an Islamic State-affiliated group known locally as al-Shabaab (though it has no links with the Islamist militants of the same name in Somalia).The group has been kidnapping and killing girls and women as itfights government and African Union forcesin the country’s northernmost province of Cabo Delgado since the conflict began in 2017. More than 1 million people are reported to have beendisplaced by fighting in the region.All we did was remember what our lives had been like … and dream about the futureAnchaBefore their abduction, Ancha and Fatima had not known each other well and lived in separate villages, but all that changed when Fatima arrived at their captor’s house. From that moment, the two women formed a close friendship that has endured.“At first [when she arrived], I felt very sad. But then I thought, finally, I had someone to lean on. I went from being isolated and alone to having someone to share my time with,” says Ancha.For three years, the two cousins were forced to live with insurgents in separate homes, enduring constant sexual violence. Ancha has two children as a result, both aged under three.How did a ‘cocktail of violence’ engulf Mozambique’s gemstone El Dorado?Read moreFatima, who has a three-year-old, says she was mostly kept locked inside as the man she had to live with feared she would try to escape. “Sometimes, I was allowed to go to a garden nearby, but never far.”Despite the abuse they suffered, the two women spent most of their time together talking about the past. “All we did was remember what our lives had been like before and dream about the future,” says Ancha.“We helped each other with everything. If one of us was forced to fetch food, the other would watch over the children,” says Ancha.Fatima adds: “We ate together, checked in on each other. It was a great source of support for me.”Having each other nearby also comforted them in another way, says Ancha: if one of them had died, the other could one day inform their family.View image in fullscreenGraffiti proclaiming Islamic State on a house in Quissanga, in Mozambique’s mineral-rich northern province of Cabo Delgado.Photograph: Juan Luis RodTheir family links were kept a secret. “We decided not to tell anyone we were cousins because they might separate us” says Ancha.“In that place, more than two women gathering was not allowed, so we kept it a secret to keep seeing each other.”Eventually, last September, says Fatima, they hatched a plan to escape together. “We couldn’t live like that any more,” she recalls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We decided we had to take the risk and leave.”The plan involved fleeing through the forest to the coast, where a small boat would be awaiting them, ready to sail to freedom. The boat was arranged by some men from the camp who decided to escape with them. Ancha says the men had previously been prisoners too before being forced to join the militants during their years in captivity.“During those days in the forest, we [Ancha and Fatima] helped each other, encouraging one another to keep going. When Ancha lagged behind, exhausted, I pushed her forward, and she did the same for me. We also helped carry each other’s babies,” says Fatima.‘I ran, my heart was broken’: inside Mozambique’s evolving Cabo Delgado conflictRead moreAfter reaching the beach, they were taken by a small wooden boat northwards towards Mocímboa da Praia, Cabo Delgado’s second-largest city.There they were intercepted by soldiers of the Rwanda Defence Forces, which maintains two military bases in the city and hasdeployed about 5,000 troopsto support the Mozambican government since 2021.The two women were then transferred back to where they grew up after relatives recognised their names on a list of people awaiting reunification with their families, and are now both living in a camp for displaced people with them in the town of Macomia.“The bond we formed can never be broken.

Trump’s body language looked completely untaught, because nobody could teach this. The man has always been incredibly idiosyncratic.He has his hands pointed downwards in what experts of non-verbal communication call “the steeple”, for obvious reasons. Yet, as Joe Navarro, the former FBI agent and author of (most recently) The Dictionary of Body Language, told me: “This is not uncommon, Elon Musk does it, Angela Merkel did it – but they tend to put them very high, utterly confident. Here you have the president’s, which is a modified steeple, where he loses its strength by pointing it downward.” It’s a gesture he often makes with world leaders – exactly the same image exists with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, except the Ukrainian president looks more annoyed – and it’s far from the only cue that he’s unsure or uncomfortable.But how does that work? Because Trump, famously, loves trying to dominate with his body language.Images abound of him and Macron practically wrestling, in their efforts to outgrip each other. “We saw this in the first term,” Navarro continues, “when he was shaking hands with the [Shinzo Abe], the tight handshake, the pulling behavioursTrump has some awkward exchanges with the Japanese prime minister.Macron and Trump’s two tense handshake battlesGuardian“It reminds me of some of the garbage that was being peddled about establishing dominance in the 1980s. You’ll be superior if you squeeze tight, or if your hand is on top, or if you bring them closer to your chest. There is nothing either empirical or scientific that says that playing hand jiu-jitsu makes the other person respect you more. What it does do, particularly in cultures that are context rich, it makes you look amateurish.”The two world leaders engaged in a 19-second handshake that didn’t appear to end well.Trump also has a repertoire of disdainful or disgusted facial gestures – he purses his lips tightly if he hears anything he dislikes, his commissure (the side of the mouth) pinches dramatically, which is usually a look of contempt. “He immediately reflects with his face exactly what he feels,” Navarro says, “And that’s quite a New York style – Brooklyn or Queens. You wouldn’t see that in middle America, people are more reserved in their expression.”Other gestures that have played badly in a context-rich environment includeholding Theresa May’s handandwalking ahead of the Queen– “That’s not a little faux pas, that’s a major faux pas,” Navarro says, but interprets those as “klutzy” rather than calculated to dominate.Donald Trump and Theresa May awkwardly hold hands at White HouseGuardianThe president has a number of contradictorily vulnerable behaviours. “In pictures in the White House, or when he’s surrounded by people, he crosses his arms very tight around himself, and that is a comforting behaviour. It’s literally a self-hug. And yet when wesee him on The Apprentice, he never did that. You normally don’t expect leaders to be self-hugging. You expect them to have expansive behaviours,” Navarro says.All of which pales in significance besides a picture of Trump and the Russian president. “Look at the arm swing on Putin versus the very stoic, demure, arms at the side, head low behaviours of Trump,” Navarro says. “I could hardly believe my eyes. It matters. We are primates. We evolved from primates. You don’t have to be told who the leader is. If you’re the silverback, you stand proud, you stand tall, you have the behaviours of confidence. That is nowhere to be seen with Trump.”Dr Nicholas Newton-Fisher, a primate behavioural ecologist at the University of Kent, counsels that we should not only see our evolutionary similarity to chimps in terms of power play, they also “do a lot of subtle touching but these gestures tend to be affiliative or reassuring, or seeking reassurance, and you see commonalities here with humans”.In the press conference with Starmer, a reporter asked the US president if British troops were attacked by Russian forces while in Ukraine, Starmer could count on the US’s support. Trump replied that the British were incredible fighters and could take care of themselves, relenting in a generalised way that he would “always stand with the British”, accompanied by a little spontaneous hand-hold, coming from underneath, that took Starmer by surprise.It was not dominant but nor was it what you’d call reassuring.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpPsychologyKeir StarmeranalysisShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Abby WaislerAfter dodging toxic fans, ‘nepo baby’ jibes and her own projectile vomit, the 25-year-old has just spent eight weeks at UK No 1. She explains why she’s now writing about our dark, uncertain futureByAlexis PetridisFri 28 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareOn a video call from a hotel room in Hamburg,Gracie Abramsis expounding on the virtues of decoupling yourself from social media and living a life offline. “You can literally do so much when you’re not scrolling!” she enthuses. “You can retain more information; everything gets lighter. You have a greater capacity to be more present, to be there for the people in your life, to read a book that’s going to inspire your next album, or go on a hike and breathe air instead of sitting in a dark room on fucking Instagram. I’m doing lots of, like, tactile stuff, staying off social media,” she adds. “Needlepoint and shit like that. I’m just trying to make things … to have some tangible evidence of having lived this year.”Of course, this is nothing the world hasn’t heard before: we’re well used to being told about the benefits of a digital detox. Still, it feels like an intriguing statement coming from Gracie Abrams. For one thing, her single That’s So True spent most of January at No 1 in the UK: it spent most of November and December there as well, took a brief Christmas holiday, then reappeared to beat Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga et al once more. Her album The Secret of Us also reached No 1, and is now enjoying its 18th consecutive week in the Top 20, the kind of longevity only afforded to those artists who have broken through into the upper echelons of pop stardom.It’s the same story back home in the US, where The Secret of Us has spent 35 weeks on the charts: her previous album managed two. Abrams is calling from Hamburg because it’s the latest stop on a global tour that’s been filling vast arenas for months and is scheduled to keep doing so until August. You see what she means about needlepoint, but you do wonder how much tangible evidence of having lived this year a person might need.Even by latterday pop standards, her rise seems particularly bound up with social media. She first broke through in 2020, withI Miss You, I’m Sorry: a viral lockdown hit with its cheerfully amateurish, bedroom-bound video and lyrics that seemed to fit the prevalent mood (“Do you remember happy together? I do, don’t you?”). She already had a major label deal, but was initially famed for directly interacting with her audience online: responding to their comments on SoundCloud and Instagram, sending them DMs, referring to them not as her fans but her “friends” (“more friends than anyone has ever had ever!” she told an interviewer in 2021); becoming the first non-Korean artist to useWeverse, the K-pop platform designed to offer “a deeper level” of artist-fan interaction than that of traditional social media.It’s a smart way to build a committed fanbase, and it played into a pervasive idea of Abrams as what one writer called “gen Z’s most unfiltered storyteller”: a singer-songwriter whose work was essentially private diary entries set to music, and who whispered her lyrics as if personally confiding in the listener.But it’s clearly not an approach one can maintain after the kind of success garnered by The Secret of Us, an album noticeably brighter and less introverted than her previous work (the result, she says, of both “a crush that I had felt way more significantly than in previous years” and a new writing partnership with her best friend and roommate, Audrey Hobert). When you’re packing out the Alsterdorfer Sportshalle and Madison Square Garden, not everyone online wants to be your friend.View image in fullscreenUnfiltered … Abrams performing in Washington DC in December.Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for iHeartRadio“It’s definitely not halted full stop,” she says. “There are moments where I do feel really thrilled to interact directly; whether it’s through a DM or a comment, I feel tapped into their lives still.” But, she says, it’s “less frequent, because, honestly, mentally I don’t benefit from engaging heavily in the way I used to. The way the algorithm works, if you spend five extra seconds reading a comment and there’s a keyword with your name in it, that’s what it starts to feed you. So I’d open my phone in the morning and there would be lots of unsolicited opinions that were starting to make me feel sore, and then I would notice myself carrying that feeling. But if you don’t engage with it, you don’t feel so sick.”Being tapped into your audiences’ lives seems risky in an era when we hear a lot about toxic fandoms, when artists such as Chappell Roan feel compelled to call out fans for “creepy behaviour” and “harassment”.“The very large majority of the time I have been lucky, my interactions with fans out in the world haven’t been ones that make me go ‘oh shit’,” she says. “But I’ve definitely had moments like that. I’m walking with my headphones in, or my back is turned, or my head is down and a stranger comes in with a hug before anything else … that’s really not a good feeling. As an animal, you’re just like, ‘Oh fuck, what’s that?’ Ninety per cent of the time it’s really sweet introductions, or no crossing any lines with physical touch. But if you experience it even once, your guard can go up, because it feels unnatural. You want to walk a fine line between being attuned to what your audience feels and letting your own conviction guide you.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve been lucky the majority of the time with my interractions with fans’ … at Paris fashion week last year.Photograph: Foc Kan/WireImageThe occasional over-familiar fan aside, Abrams’ rise appears to have been remarkably smooth. Big names have flocked to work with her: The Secret of Us, like its predecessor Good Riddance, was made with the National’sAaron Dessner, best-known as Taylor Swift’s chief latterday collaborator;Brian Enounexpectedly cropped up on one track from Good Riddance. She has enjoyed a succession of profile-boosting celebrity co-signs. No sooner had I Miss You, I’m Sorry appeared than Olivia Rodrigo announced that her forthcoming single was inspired by it – the forthcoming single turned out to be themulti-bn streaming Drivers License – while Taylor Swift selected her as the support act on two sizeable chunks of the record-breaking Eras tour and appears as a guest and co-writer on The Secret of Us. Abrams recentlyposted a photoof herself embracing her idol, Joni Mitchell, who was apparently unfazed even when Abrams showed her a tattoo she has featuring Mitchell’s handwritten lyrics.She has pulled off the enviable trick of establishing a fanbase who feel her songs confide her innermost secrets to them, while also drawing a veil over her private life, only ever discussing it publicly in the vaguest terms (she is presumed to be in a relationship with actor Paul Mescal, but has never confirmed it to the wider world). “Sharing versus not sharing,” she nods. “I’m lucky to have this avenue, where, in my songs, I talk very openly about how I feel. It’s like when I’m writing, I’m talking to myself. Talking to strangers, there are naturally things you hope to protect a bit more. Some things feel sacred.”She seems smart, thoughtful and level-headed: at 25, she appears to be navigating the choppy waters of celebrity with admirable ease. This might have something to do with her background: her father is the Hollywood director/producerJJ Abrams. On the one hand, that means her success has played out to a constant background hum of sniping in which the phrase “nepo baby” figures heavily, but there are presumably worse preparations for fame than growing up in a celebrity-adjacent Hollywood family.View image in fullscreen‘What I loved about sharing music online was you could hide behind a profile’ … performing on The Graham Norton Show earlier this month.Photograph: PAQuite the opposite, she says: she was so introverted as a teenager that she thought a “public-facing career” was out of the question. “I knew that it would involve performing, and that was the part that felt so horrifying to me. I wrote songs because it was easier than talking about my feelings. I wasn’t interested in anybody hearing me. I was so turned off by the idea of confronting people face-to-face. That was what I loved about sharing music online – you could hide behind a profile.”As her major label courted her, she kept her fears hidden. “I remember signing my deal and feeling really nauseous about it.” So what changed? “Well, I see a therapist. And it hasn’t been some overnight thing. The first shows I ever played were over Zoom during the pandemic, so that was like a baby step versus truly facing my fear head-on. Then I played the tiniest rooms” – which, it should be noted, didn’t stop her “projectile vomiting” before going onstage – “so it’s almost like these tiny moments of exposure therapy.”Trump has already done everything in his power to make us feel powerless and hopelessClearly it worked: you don’t see much evidence of introversion in the fan videos of her onstage, belting out I Miss You, I’m Sorry from a set designed to look like the bedroom in which she recorded the song’s original video, or lecturing audiences in a pre-election US about the necessity of voting when “democracy is hanging by a thread”. She was an ardent Harris supporter, and performed at one of her campaign rallies in Wisconsin.In the wake of the US election result, one theory that did the rounds was that the sheer wattage of celebrity endorsements Harris received was counterproductive – that they reinforced the notion that the Harris campaign was out of touch with ordinary voters’ concerns in a difficult economic climate. “I don’t think it was counterproductive,” Abrams frowns. “The issues were so much deeper, more systemic. How I feel about having played a tiny role in one of her many rallies that she crushed flawlessly every single time is that I’m proud to have been there and proud to have felt that energy in the room. That was so tangible and so real, and it’s something I’ve held on to since the results of the election.View image in fullscreenAbrams: ‘I started writing long letters to myself about dreams.’Photograph: Gabriella Hughes“Trump has only been in office for a month and has already done everything in his power to make every marginalised community feel smaller, to make everybody more at risk, to overwhelm us with information, or disinformation, so that we feel powerless and hopeless. And what I felt at that rally in Wisconsin that day was the opposite of hopelessness: I felt real strength in gathering. That’s the antidote right now. Obviously, there’s got to be so much more we do when we gather in that way. But I feel really lucky to have witnessed in person what that kind of light feels like, especially now in the face of this quality of darkness. It’s unprecedented, it’s global.”She was so crushed by Trump’s victory that she wondered about going on tour at all. “Right before going off, I was just like: how are we not all dedicating all of our time to fighting this … thing?” She decided that “if me, Gracie, in the position I’m in in this world – like the luckiest ever – is feeling this way, then everybody is feeling this fucking way. I can give people who are coming to these shows two hours to feel everything they’re feeling at an extreme, and be able to express it, or just distract themselves for two hours and recharge their battery. We’re going to have to work out how to do that every single day, not just for the next four years, because obviously the impact of the next four years is going to be long-lasting.”She says she spent a week at Dessner’s studio before departing for Europe to work on new material, and found herself writing noticeably different kinds of songs than she expected. “I was just like: shit, I don’t even know how to articulate the degree to which I feel sick inside about everything. Most of those songs from that week arenotabout relationships. They’re about the fact that LA just burned down, about the fact that I don’t understand how we’re supposed to really carry on. Of course those subjects will show up, it’s life, but they’re … different themes than I anticipated.”‘Fame is like going through puberty’: Chappell Roan on sexuality, superstardom and the joy of dragRead moreBut then, as she points out, nothing has turned out like she expected. “After signing and starting to release music in a more real way, and after playing my first shows and realising I was wrong about how I felt about playing live because of the kindness of the people in the room, I started writing long letters to myself about dreams,” she says. “One of the things I wrote after my first show was ‘One day I want to open for Taylor Swift’. That was never going to happen, obviously. What’s been so lucky is that the goalposts keep kind of moving and my imagination has expanded and I feel excited about being out of my comfort zone.“Being proved wrong about what was the scariest thing in the world to me at the time has made me really excited to be wrong about everything else.” She laughs, before heading off to another packed arena.Gracie Abrams’ UK and Ireland tour begins Monday 3 March at Nottingham Motorpoint Arena.

We need to address that system.”For the past 40 years, the researcher and activist has been advocating that violence against women be treated as a men’s issue. He works across the US in universities, schools and the military to encourage men to speak up when they encounter misogynistic behaviour in their peer groups. Katz believes that it is only through boys and men holding themselves accountable for their behaviour that violence against women can end. Sincethe re-election of Donald Trump, he believes his work has become more urgent than ever.“The election has been a complete catastrophe – it was a huge setback for the prevention of domestic abuse and violence,” Katz, 60, says from the book-lined study of his home in Massachusetts. “Seventy-seven million Americans voted for Trump after he was foundliable for sexual abusein Manhattan and ordered to pay millions of dollars in damages. The jury’s verdict is undeniable. By voting for someone with that history, it has a normalising effect on his behaviour. It’s unleashed a firehose of misogyny.”The consequences have includedfunding cuts for gender-based workand an attack on the mandate set out in the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. “Trump and Elon Musk’s Doge [Department of Government Efficiency] team is freezing funding for swathes of non-profits, including many of those that should be protected by the Violence Against Women Act,” he says. “They’re getting rid of DEI[diversity, equality and inclusion] initiatives andanything with the keyword ‘woman’is coming under scrutiny. People who work in the area are stunned and despairing. This isn’t a normal moment – it is medieval and a huge rollback of progress.”It’s our moral, ethical and human duty to help women in this struggle togetherKatz has also witnessed a louder and more forceful chorus of young men promoting misogynistic ideals; online, he is often called a “virtue-signalling cuck” or a “beta male”. “There’s an assumption that young people are more left-leaning, but we are seeing the opposite right now and it’s very worrying,” he says, referencing the fact that56% of 18- to 29-year-old male voterssupported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared with 40% of women in that bracket.“We’re witnessing a global backlash against women’s progress, since the past 50 years have seen unbelievable challenges to patriarchal norms. Trumpism and rightwing populism isn’t a revolt against the ‘elites’; it’s a reaction to men being de-centred and a backlash against feminism. Trump has been marketing himself with the men’s movement and it’s fuelled the manosphere from being an abusive men’s rights subculture to becoming the mainstream. We on the other side need a bigger microphone to get into the conversation – we each need to stand up and say ‘not in my name’, since people likeAndrew Tateand Jordan Peterson [who has argued that‘the masculine spirit is under assault’and that the patriarchy ‘might be predicated on competence’] have platforms with millions of followers being indoctrinated.”Driven by that mission to reach a wider audience, Katz has written a book, Every Man: Why Violence Against Women Is a Men’s Issue, which outlines the ways that men can and should involve themselves in the fight against gender-based violence. He believes it may be the first time a major commercial publisher has released a book about men’s violence against women that has been written by a man. “It’s shocking to me, because you can go as far back as John Stuart Mill writinga critique of marital rape in 1869to see how men have been talking about the issue,” Katz says. “We have been doing this work for a long time and the book is a toolkit for other men to get themselves involved. It’s our moral, ethical and human duty to help women in this struggle together.”Katz was born in a small town north of Boston in 1960. He says he was brought up in a “jockocracy”, where social life and status revolved around American football and basketball. His biological father was a second world war medic and medical sociology professor who died while Katz’s mother was pregnant with Katz. Her second husband, the man Katz grew up with, was a blue-collar factory worker and truck driver: “A very tough, old-school guy who wasn’t very communicative,” Katz says.In high school, Katz became a star football player and was celebrated in his parochial, male-dominated culture. He describes witnessing “generalised misogyny” as a teenager, but it wasn’t until he went to college at the University ofMassachusettsAmherst that he began to learn the extent and pervasiveness of the problems faced by women and marginalised people.View image in fullscreen‘Challenge your peer groups and educate each other.’Photograph: Chris McIntosh/The Guardian“It was the 70s and my mind was expanding on issues of racism, sexual assault and the women’s movement. I found it all so interesting,” he says. “I started seeing how gender was one of the primary organisers of our society and, as I developed an interest in changing the world around me, it felt like the issues with gender needed to be addressed first. I was enjoying such freedom as a young man, walking home drunk late at night and not worrying about myself while my female hallmates were always thinking of their safety.”Katz’s columns for the student newspaper became increasingly concerned with sexism and the Reclaim the Night protests that were occurring across campus. “I was inspired by these women who were standing up for their rights and safety,” he says. “That’s when I decided to speak out, too. It was as simple as that.”Katz signed up for gender studies classes and eventually became the first man in the history of his college to minor in women’s studies. After graduating, he began working in grassroots gender campaigning, founding the anti-sexist men’s group Real Men in 1988.Was it really simply attending college classes and protests that turned Katz from his working-class, sports-dominated male culture towards feminist campaigning? “I get asked all the time if something has happened to me to set me on this path. I have women close to me who have been assaulted by men, but it’s not just a personal experience,” he says.“I took those classes because I wanted to learn how to have better relationships with the people around me and in the process I realised how gender-based violence affects everyone. Violence begets violence and the same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse men. I came from a position of influence as a straight, white man and sportsperson, so I felt I had to speak up to try to break the cycle.”What did his peers think about his shift into activism? “Mainly people thought I was a little weird,” he says, laughing. “But they couldn’t write me off, because I had been part of their culture and that was the key. They knew me, so in some way they had to listen.”Attempting to change the culture from within became a tenet of Katz’s work with Real Men and, later, with his Mentors in Violence Prevention programme. Enlisting role models from professional sports and the military, Katz began running workshops and training programmes to encourage changes in behaviour from the top down in male-dominated organisations.“I’ve long been convinced that lots of men are uncomfortable about their peers’ behaviour, but are scared of speaking out because of losing social status or facing retribution,” he says. “By getting role models talking about it, especially people like male athletes, who have a higher status, we can make other men feel comfortable to speak out when they see or hear something sexist, as well as bring these ideas to men who might never have considered their role in gender-based violence before.”If we think about how we might be perpetuating a culture that produces rapists, it forces a level of introspection that makes people very uncomfortableGaining the ability and confidence to interrupt sexist behaviour from men is the main purpose of Katz’s book. Written in a conversational, largely jargon-free tone, it is intended as a practical toolkit for men to think about ways in which they can challenge difficult behaviour, with each chapter ending with a section on “how you can make a difference” that outlines lines of argument and conversation. Katz covers the history of men’s work in this space from the 1970s onwards, arguments against victim-blaming and men’s defensiveness when it comes to taking responsibility; he advocates against watching pornography, an industry that he says “legitimises misogynist abuse by normalising sexualised brutality”. He ends by analysing the “manosphere” and online groups that areinfluencing schoolchildrento support outspoken misogynists such as Tate.A “how to” book tackling an issue as entrenched and systematic as gender-based violence may seem a futile response, but amid the guidance Katz lays out a strong argument often accompanied by shocking statistics. He refers to the World Health Organization statistic thatalmost one-third of girls and women aged 15 to 49have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner, whileone in seven childrenhave lived with domestic abuse.“It’s much more comforting to see the people committing these acts as monsters. We can dissociate ourselves from them, then we don’t have to be introspective,” Katz says. “It’s easier if rape is a pathological behaviour, but if we think about how we might be perpetuating a culture that produces rapists, it forces a level of introspection that makes people very uncomfortable. That introspection leads to action and choices about how we can change our lives.”One method that Katz has helped pioneer in his career is the bystander approach – initially employed as a tactic against school bullying, where peers are encouraged to step in and support the bullied child, rather than leaving the onus of responsibility solely on their shoulders.Katz began running workshop scenarios where men would think through their ethical obligations when faced with sexist or potentially abusive behaviour by one of their group. “Men would walk in with their arms folded, saying they didn’t need to be there because they weren’t abusers, so I would say: ‘You don’t abuse girls or women, but what are you doing to help others who are abusing them?’” Katz says.View image in fullscreenKatz’s says his book may be the first about men’s violence against women from a major publisher that has been written by a man.Photograph: Chris McIntosh/The Guardian“It’s leadership training, since it takes nothing to be one of the boys, but it takes courage to stand up for what is right. It can be scary, relationally and physically, to challenge someone, and people push back when you upend the status quo, but your silence is telling them that it’s OK. Those men would walk out with their minds changed. I want it to be required training across the board, from schools to colleges, sports teams, workplaces and beyond.”Since there arealmost 400 million gunsin circulation in the US, Katz emphasises that his approach is not to engage in potentially dangerous public interventions, but rather to focus on “known peer cultures” like friends, teammates and co-workers. “People don’t speak in those situations, because of social fear, but by framing the guy who speaks up as a strong man, or a good friend, you’re making it positive and aspirational, which has more likelihood of success,” he says. “The most important aspect is making sure those in positions of power speak up the loudest and that our leaders are confronting the issues, too, as that is where widespread change can happen.”With the most powerful political leader in the world in the process of opposing much of what Katz advocates, he emphasises the need for persistence and bravery from bystanding men – a show of leadership in the absence of a leader. “We can’t tell boys that bullying is bad and then equally reward bullies like Trump in power,” Katz says. “There’s a lot of fear in the face of a rightwing populist government, but we need men to loudly oppose him, otherwise real people will be harmed. We’re living in a different world now and it’s urgent.”As the father of a grownup son, Katz says his main responsibility is to be a role model for young people and to provide a platform for their voices. “We owe it to the next generation of boys and girls, who haven’t chosen to be born into this patriarchal society,” he says. “Challenge your peer groups, educate each other and make sure your voice is louder than those spreading abusive norms. It takes courage, but it will only cause more tragedy if we don’t show it.”Every Man: Why Violence Against Women Is a Men’s Issue (Penguin, £10.99) is out now.

But old enmities and fears about what comes next haunt the country.Michael SafireportsAfter more than a decade of war, and half a century of repressive rule underBashar al-Assadand his father, Syrians have a new ruler and a new future.Michael Safispent a week travelling around the country, speaking to people about their surging hopes and joy – but also their fears of how fragile this peace could prove to be.Driving from Lebanon to Damascus with a family, he heard about the painful toll the years of war and repression had taken on them: a father killed, a brother disappeared, a sister jailed. But they also told him how optimistic they still were for this moment of history.In Damascus, he discovered normal life had begun creeping back – but that global jihadists were still manning checkpoints. And he spoke to an aid worker who said his British citizenship had been revoked and who could soon be a new Syrian national.Outside the city, however, Michael found that the Alawites, Assad’s religious sect, were already facing bloody reprisals. But although many worry about what the new government of former jihadists might do, as one civil society activist told him: “Before the regime fell, we didn’t have space to move. Everything was really dark. Now we have much to do in our country and I’m seeing a space to move.”Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersExplore more on these topicsSyriaToday in FocusBashar al-Assad"

To me this is more than a job, it’s a vocation – and I plan to continue to do so as long as I am able.Community Fund projects like ours are paid for by the national lottery. Our aim is to reduce loneliness and isolation by engaging with hard to reach people who might otherwise not be aware of the help and support we have to offer.Covid really made us look deeper as a charity into the way we connect with our clients. From shopping to supporting with general information about the pandemic, we were there at the end of the phone – our volunteers really stepped up.We soon realised that the level of fear and loss was overwhelming for some, and what they really needed was to talk it out. Some lost life partners in such circumstances where they were unable to meet family or friends, which meant they were unable to process the grief. Bereavement services were overwhelmed, leaving people to wait for months for someone to talk to. Out of this situation, we developed a service to provide low-level mental health and welfare support.View image in fullscreenThe Time for Tea eventView image in fullscreenJames, a widower, likes to dance at the Time for Tea eventAs soon as it was safe to do so, our Time for Teas programme was rolled out across the district meaning for the first time since lockdown we could offer people the opportunity to meet up in a socially distanced way. The relief among our clients was palpable. A common feeling was they would rather risk dying of Covid than spend any more time alone. Advanced age meant they felt it was better to enjoy what life they had left than to prolong the inevitable staying at home.View image in fullscreenMary at a Time for tea eventMany of our clients feel their needs should not be spoken of – they don’t want to cause a fuss. I often wonder if this is the last generation that will be accepting of what they are given, be that money, time or healthcare. There is a sense of pride, sometimes stubbornness, which makes them accept what little is offered. Having lived through rationing, some of them during the second world war, many have the mindset of not asking for more.So many people say to us, “I don’t know what I would have done without you” or “you saved my life”. We have to catch as many as possible of those who fall through the net.Molly Fox, 86View image in fullscreenMolly Fox enjoys a cup of tea wrapped in a blanketMolly lives alone – her family are on the other side of the world – which means she’s often lonely even though she has FaceTime calls with them regularly. She manages to get out on her mobility scooter and is well known around her home town. Molly, like many others, struggles to keep warm while keeping her bills affordable. Fear of debt means she wears a coat over her clothes, gloves, scarf and a hot-water bottle, and has hot drinks to keep warm in her lounge when she is alone. Pride and the habit of “living within your means” drives Molly to save money wherever she can.Tom Owen, 91View image in fullscreenTom is a veteran who we came into contact with about three years ago. He would attend our events with Marion, his wife, who was living with dementia. They were self-sufficient, not asking for any help.But Marion recently died and now Tom is totally bereft after looking after his wife of almost 70 years. The love they shared shone through. Now, filling each day becomes a struggle; he can still hear her voice calling out in the night.View image in fullscreenTom Owen in his roomI visit him and his face lights up.

A group of prominent writers including Salman Rushdie, Annie Ernaux, Wole Soyinka and Leïla Slimanisigned a statementcalling for his release.Macron has spoken out about Sansal’s detention before, telling French ambassadors in January thatAlgeriawas “dishonouring itself” by holding the writer.His latest comments came on Friday during a speech in Porto, Portugal, in which he said that Sansal’s imprisonment was among the issues that needed settling before confidence between France and Algeria could be fully restored,according to Reuters.Relations betweenFranceand its former colony have become increasingly hostile in recent months over immigration and a sovereignty dispute over Western Sahara, which Algeria has long said should be independent. Last summer, Macron sparked anger in Algiers when he backed Morocco’s plan for the territory to come under Moroccan control.Sansal’s arrest was linked to comments the writer had made to the far-right French outlet Frontières in which he backed the argument that Morocco’s land was truncated by colonial France in the 19th century to the benefit of what would become Algeria.Sansal was once an Algerian civil servant, but was driven to become a writer during the Algerian civil war of the 1990s. His books include An Unfinished Business, his first to be translated into English, and 2084, for which he won the Grand Prix du Roman.Sansal has in recent years become popular with rightwing figures for his position on Islam, with Marine Le Pen calling him a “courageous opponent of Islamism” after his arrest. Sandrine Rousseau – a member of the green party Europe Écologie Les Verts,denounced his imprisonment, but called his views a “form of supremacism”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The figure includes more than 10,000 HIV-positive pregnant women, who must continue taking antiretroviral drugs to avoid passing the disease on to their babies.Dr Lynne Mofenson, a senior adviser at the foundation, said the decision was “a death sentence for mothers and children”.View image in fullscreenA protest in Washington against the Trump administration’s cuts to aid HIV/Aids spending through USAid and Pepfar.Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APMany projects had beenforced to stop workin late January after the Trump administration announced a 90-day review of foreign aid. A few were then granted temporary waivers to continue on the grounds that they provided life-saving services, before receiving notices on Thursday instructing them to close their doors permanently.Projects funded by the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), founded by George W Bush in 2003, appear to be particularly affected. In South Africa it funds 17% of the HIV response; in other countries the figure is much higher.Prof Linda-Gail Bekker, director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town, said: “It is not hyperbole to say that I predict a huge disaster.”Bekker has worked on modelling suggesting a complete loss of Pepfar funding in South Africa would lead tomore than 500,000 extra HIV deathsover a decade.It comes at a time when scientific breakthroughs, such as the introduction of long-acting injectable prevention drugs, meant many working in the HIV field had hoped an end to the disease might be in sight.Now, said Bekker, it was likely things would go backwards. South Africa has about 8 million people living with HIV, the highest number globally.She said she had initially expected the US to target programmes working with key groups of people such as the LGBT+ community, because of the Trump administration’sattacks on diversity initiatives, “but in fact, this has been across the board.“This is children, this is orphans, vulnerable children, young women and girl programmes. It is generic and across the board.”It also halts ongoing research, including trials into potential HIV vaccines and new prevention drugs, Bekker said.US funding had allowed projects to fill gaps in government provision, such as clinics where transgender people or sex workers can seek care without stigma or legal concerns, Bekker said.How will Trump and Musk’s freeze on USAid affect millions around the world?Read moreKholi Buthelezi, national coordinator at Sisonke, a sex workers’ organisation, said: “I’ve been having sleepless nights. This blow, it reminded us of back when there was no cure for HIV.”At a press briefing on the cuts, she and others working on HIV in South Africa called on their government to “step up” and fill the gaps left by the US’s withdrawal.Pepfar funding has been distributed viaUSAidand the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Programmes with funding from the CDC have not yet been forced to shut, said Dr Kate Rees, a public health medicine specialist at the AnovaHealthInstitute, but said it was too early to conclude that those programmes were safe.There had already been plans to shift programmes reliant on donors to government funding over the next five years, Rees said, but “now, instead of a careful handover, we’re being pushed over a cliff edge”.US funding had been embedded in the health system, she said, and so the withdrawal would “be felt by everyone who uses or works in health services”.Anova has received a termination notice. “Tomorrow we are letting go more than 2,800 people,” Rees said. “That’s counsellors, data capturers, healthcare workers – and these people are not going to find other jobs very easily.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthSouth AfricaUSAidAidAids and HIVAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Severe Tropical Cyclone Alfred formed on 20 February in the Coral Sea to the north-east of Australia, reaching an intensity equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on Thursday with sustained winds of 105mph (170km/h) and gusts at about 140mph.Alfred is tracking south, moving roughly parallel to theQueenslandcoast, and warnings have been issued for strong winds and rough seas. Though Alfred is not expected to make landfall, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology is monitoring the cyclone as it remains uncertain how close it will pass by the coast.Farther east in the south-west Pacific, there were two shorter-lived storms, Rae and Seru, which reached a maximum intensity equivalent to a category 2 hurricane. Tropical Cyclone Rae developed just north of Fiji on 22 February before travelling south across the island. Tropical Cyclone Seru formed on 24 February over the southernmostSolomon Islands, travelling southwards and passing to the east of Vanuatu and New Caledonia.While Seru remained offshore, Rae caused significant damage to some Fijian islands, owing to a combination of flood waters from heavy rain, gusts of about 100mph, and huge waves.Severe Tropical Cyclone Bianca, which formed in the Timor Sea to the north-west of Australia, was active between 18 and 27 February in the south-east Indian Ocean, during which time it travelled west before veering south, allowing it to curve around the continent without making landfall. This cyclone had a peak intensity equivalent to a category 3 hurricane.And in the south-west Indian Ocean, two more cyclones are bracketingMadagascar, both of which developed on Monday. The category 3-equivalent Intense Tropical Cyclone Garance formed to the north-east of Madagascar and travelled south. After passing to the west of Mauritius, Garance will affect the French island of Réunion on Friday, with 120mph gusts and up to 600mm of rain.Meanwhile, the category 1-equivalent Severe Tropical Storm Honde formed in theMozambiquechannel and travelled south-east, where it is skirting the southern tip of Madagascar.Though infrequent, it is far from unusual for this many named storms to exist concurrently. A far rarer occurrence is for this many to occur within a single ocean basin.The Pacific Ocean has recorded six simultaneous named storms on just one occasion, in August 1974, while the Atlantic record is five, set in September 1971.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsWeather trackerQueenslandMadagascarPacific islandsSolomon IslandsMozambiqueAfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Hope that we would live to see accountability. And now, that hope has finally turned into reality,” the family said in a statement thanking Trump and everyone who has worked on the case over the years.The White House, in a statement Friday ahead of the arraignments, called Caro Quintero “one of the most evil cartel bosses in the world”.In exchange for delaying tariffs, Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on cartels, illegal immigration and fentanyl production.But members of Mexico’s security cabinet on Friday framed the transfer of the 29 prisoners as a national security decision.“It is not a commitment to the United States. It is a commitment to ourselves,” said Mexican attorney general Alejandro Gertz Manero. “The problem of drug trafficking and organized crime has been a true tragedy for our country.”Mexican security secretary Omar García Harfuch said the people sent into US custody were “generators of violence” in Mexico and represented a security threat to both countries.Caro Quintero had long been one of America’s top Mexican targets for extradition.He was one of the founders of a Guadalajara-based cartel and one of the primary suppliers of heroin, cocaine and marijuana to the US in the late 1970s and 1980s.Caro Quintero had Camarena kidnapped, tortured and killed in 1985 because he blamed the agent for a raid on a huge marijuana plantation the year prior, authorities said. Camarena’s killing marked a low point in US-Mexico relations and was dramatized in the popular Netflix series Narcos: Mexico.Caro Quintero had been 28 years into a 40-year sentence in Mexico when an appeals court overturned his verdict in 2013.After his release, he returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until he was arrested by Mexican forces in 2022, authorities said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was a drug trafficker 23 years ago, and now I’m not, and I won’t ever be again.”The US, which had added Caro Quintero to the FBI’s 10 most wanted list in 2018 with a $20m reward, sought his extradition immediately after his 2022 arrest. It happened days after the Mexican and US presidents at the time, Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Joe Biden respectively, met at the White House.But the request remained in limbo as López Obrador severely curtailed his country’s cooperation with the US to protest undercover American law enforcement operations targeting Mexican political and military officials.Then, in January, a non-profit group representing the Camarena family sent a letter to the newTrump administrationurging it to renew the extradition request.Carrillo Fuentes is the brother of the drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as “The Lord of The Skies”, who died in a botched plastic surgery in 1997. Carrillo Fuentes, who was known as “The Viceroy”, continued his brother’s business of smuggling drugs over the border until his arrest in 2014.He was sentenced in 2021 to 28 years in prison for organized crime, money laundering and weapons violations.Among the others extradited are leading members of Mexican organized crime groups recently designated by the Republican administration as “foreign terrorist organizations”.They include cartel leaders, security chiefs from both factions of the Sinaloa cartel, cartel finance operatives and a man wanted in connection with the killing of a North Carolina sheriff’s deputy in 2022.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeMexicoAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

Chinahit back swiftlywhen Trump imposed a 10% tariff on its exports earlier this month.TheTrump administrationhas repeatedly raised the threat of tariffs, vowing to rebalance the global economic order in the US’s favor. A string of announced measures have yet to be introduced, however, as economists and businesses urge officials to reconsider.The duties on imports from Canada and Mexico have beenrepeatedly delayed;modified levies on steel and aluminumwill not be enforced until next month, and a wave of “reciprocal” tariffs, trailed earlier this month, will not kick in before April.This week, the US presidentvowed to slap 25% tariffs on the EU, claiming the bloc was “formed to screw the United States”, although details remain sparse. Duties will be applied “generally”, Trump said, “on cars and all other things”.The prospect of escalating tariffs has already thrown the global economy into turmoil – with consumers expressing fears about inflation worsening and the auto sector possibly suffering if the US’s two largest trading partners in Canada andMexicoare slapped with taxes.The prospect of higher prices and slower growth could create political blowback for Trump.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsCanadaMexicoChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Ontario, a major manufacturing region exporting to the US, would be especially affected.Ford called an election more than a year early, seeking astronger mandate to fight Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs against Canada, though he already had a majority government in the provincial legislature. Calling the election was Ford’s bet to win another majority, said Laura Stephenson, a Western University politics professor.Ford’s rivals struggled to focus voter attention on scandals facing the Progressive Conservative leader and challenges facing the province. Canada’s most populous province, with 35% of the national population, is struggling to provide its more than 14 million residents with adequate healthcare. About 2.5 million Ontarians lack a primary care provider, up from 1.8 million in 2020.It is unusual for Ontario to hold a winter election, and on election day much of the province was still digging out from recent snowstorms. According to Elections Ontario, just after 10pm local time the voter turnout was at 42.62%.Anti-Trump sentiment drives dramatic upturn in fortunes for Canada’s LiberalsRead moreTrump has said he could use economic force to make Canada the 51st state. The US president is dominating Canadian politics at provincial and national levels. A Canadian federal election is also expected this year.Ford took to sporting a “Canada is not for sale” hat and made two trips to Washington DC during the election campaign to make his case against US tariffs.Ontario’s election results mightbode well for the Liberal partythat governs in Ottawa, said University of Toronto politics professor Semra Sevi. These results “show how external factors – like Trump’s tariffs – can significantly shape the political climate and voter priorities,” Sevi said, nothing the “recent resurgence of the federal Liberals after a period of decline”.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The drills are a big part of Taiwan’s defensive preparations to deter or one day resist an attack by China, which has vowed to annex the territory.“It is a serious miscalculation of the situation, the public opinion and the comparison of strength,”said Wu. “Overreaching itself in such a way is extremely dangerous. We warn the DPP [Democratic Progressive party] authorities that holding back the tide with a broom will only end up in self-destruction. We will come and get you, sooner or later.”View image in fullscreenWu Qian: ‘We warn the DPP authorities that holding back the tide with a broom will only end up in self-destruction.’Photograph: Yew Lun Tian/ReutersOn Chinese social media, the remarks quickly drew parallels with the blockbuster children’s movie. Ne Zha 2, an animation about ayoung boy battling demons based on Chinese mythology, includes a scene where he admonishes a groundhog, saying: “I will come back and get you.”Ne Zha 2 has been hugely popular in China, generating massive coverage in state media after it became the highest-grossing film in China, andthen the world, overtaking the revenue of Inside Out 2. Its success has driven a surge of patriotism in China, with people reportedly viewing it numerous times, and cheering it on againstCaptain America: Brave New World, released in China around the same time but with lacklustre attendance.Ne Zha 2 has not been released in Taiwan.In response to Wu’s comments and in further criticism ofrecent Chinese military drills held off Taiwan’s south-west coast, the Taiwan defence ministry accused China of becoming the biggest “troublemaker” in the international community.5:03How China uses ‘salami-slicing’ tactics to exert pressure on Taiwan - video“This year marks the 80th anniversary of (the end of) world war two, and history has proven that any form of aggression and expansion will end in failure,” it said in a statement. “The actions of the communist military in recent years are repeating the mistakes of the invaders and pushing China towards defeat.”China’s military is pushing on with modernisation efforts, designed to reach capability of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Last week, it amended regulations to emphasise that the military’s top responsibility should be “winning battles”, and ordered the military to “focus on preparation and readiness for combat”.Bill Bishop, a China expert behind the Sinocism newsletter, said on Friday that Beijing’s language towards Taiwan “appears to be getting harsher”. The readout of this year’s Taiwan affairs work conference, held earlier this week, did not include a goal to “promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations”, which had been part of the 2023 and 2024 readouts.Taiwan is boosting its defences but remainsvastly outgunned by China. Its greatest backer has historically been the US, but that has come into question under the second presidency of Donald Trump.This week, Trump refused to say if the US would come to Taiwan’s defence militarily in the event of a Chinese attack. The stance is in line with the US’s longstanding doctrine of strategic ambiguity, but is a departure from his predecessor, Joe Biden, who repeatedly suggested the US would defend Taiwan under his leadership.Trump’s stance, taken with previous comments questioning the worth of supporting Taiwan and accusing it of “stealing” USsemiconductor business, hasraised alarm in Taipei.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

China has always regarded Australia as an important partner, and there is no need for Australia to feel concerned about the actions of the Chinese fleet.”Australian defence officials told Senate estimates this week the first that Australia learned of the live-fire exercises, which took place 340 nautical miles off the NSW south coast, was when they were notified via a civilian pilot flying a Virgin commercial passenger jet near the Chinese naval vessels.2:33Wong shares details about 'unsafe and unprofessional' Chinese firing exercises – videoThe pilot heard a warning broadcast by the ships themselves that they were undertaking live-fire. That warning was relayed back to Australia, coming some time before a similar notification from a New Zealand navy vessel that was shadowing the flotilla. After the warning came through, commercial flights were re-routed mid-flight around the drills.On Friday morning, the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the vessels were now 593km south-west of Adelaide, “just outside, near the border of our exclusive economic zone”.A murky picture has emerged over China’s live-fire drills. Who knew what when?Read more“They are being shadowed by the Anzac frigate, HMAS Stuart: these Chinese vessels have been monitored and shadowed by Australian or New Zealand the entire time they have been off the coast,” he told reporters. The New Zealand defence force said it has maintained its frigate HMNZS Te Kaha “in the region”.Albanese said his government disagreed with China on the warnings given before the drills.“We believe it was appropriate to have been given more notice and we made that clear last Friday,” he said.He acknowledged that they were acting within international law, but added “we’ve made it very clear that we expect more notice to have been given and we have protested”.Xiao, in his interview, insisted there had been appropriate notice given before the live-fire drills on Friday and Saturday, and rejected Australia’s assertion that there was inadequate notice.“Different countries have a different practice and, based on the nature of the drill, size of the drill and the scope of the drill, my view is that the Chinese naval certification advice was appropriate.”He said international law was silent about the precise timing and nature of advance warning on naval exercises.“I don’t see there’s any reason why the Chinese side should feel sorry about that, or even to think about to apologise for that,” he said.But previously unreported communications between air traffic controllers and pilots show confusion around the live-fire drills.Air traffic control started sending hazard alerts to nearby aircraft Friday morning, including a Singapore Airlines flight from Christchurch to Singapore and an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Melbourne about 11.30 am, according to text messages.At about midday, Air New Zealand pilots told controllers on the ground: “Hi, lots of chatter on 121.5 including Chinese navy. Same pos and ht/radius as you advised. Cheers.”An airline dispatcher later told the Air New Zealand pilots there was “unannounced live firing in Tasman to the nth of you by Chinese military”.“Below is all we know. Broadcast on 121.5... just FYI we have been notified of a Chinese live firing exercise as follows. Posn. 37S 15702E. Radius 40nm. SFC-45000. Until 0300Z.

Have not seen or heard any of that,” an airline dispatcher told two American Airlines flights approaching Sydney and Brisbane from the US at 3.37 am and 3.39 am on Saturday morning.Both China and Australia confirmed this week that the Chinese naval drills were conducted in international waters and in accordance with international law.1:45ADF did not know of Chinese warships live-fire drill until 30 minutes after it started – videoA three-ship flotilla – comprising the Jiangkai-class frigate Hengyang, the Renhai-class cruiser Zunyiand theFuchi-class replenishment vessel Weishanhu – sailed from Australia’s north down the east coast – reportedly sailing as close as 150 nautical miles from Sydney – before undertaking live-fire drills in the Tasman Sea on Friday and Saturday.The ships – which are possibly accompanied by an undetected nuclear submarine, Australia’s defence chief has said – have since sailed farther south and west and entered the Great Australian Bight.Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, has urged calm, saying “it’s really important that we take a deep breath here”. He emphasised the Chinese ships’ adherence to international law, and pointed out the frequency of Australian navy ships sailing close to China’s shores – including through the contested South China Sea.“There is actually a greater frequency of Australian naval vessels closer to China than there are Chinese vessels close to Australia,” he said.Xiao insisted China did not “pose a threat to Australia”, saying the countries were, and would remain, “comprehensive strategic partners”.In the interview readout posted online, the Chinese ambassador rejected any link between the naval flotilla sailing down Australia’s east coast and an incident between Australian and Chinese aircraft over the South China Sea earlier this month.On 11 February, a Chinese PLA-AF J-16 fighter aircraft released flares near an Australian P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft as it was flying what Australia has said was a “routine maritime surveillance patrol in the South China Sea”.Australia described it as “an unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre”.Xiao said the air and sea matters were “entirely different in nature”, and blamed Australia for the air incident.“TheAustralian militaryaircraft intruded into China’s airspace, which is a serious violation of international law and undermines China’s national security. However, the Chinese naval exercise took place in high seas far from Australia’s coastline and aligns with international law.”– With ReutersExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyChinaAsia PacificAustralian militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Its fees are largely attributed toinstrument tuition.More than six in 10 of its students (65%) are in the top quarter of socio-educational advantage nationwide.When I was an undergraduate, student life was on campus. A lot is being lost in the shift to online learning | Judith BrettRead moreThe Queensland academy for health sciences and the Queensland academy for science mathematics and technology, both selective schools, ranked third and fourth respectively, with parents contributing an average of more than $3,700 a year.Also in the top 10 was Paradise primary school in South Australia ($3,701); selective boys school Melbourne high ($3,627); the Queensland academy for creative industries ($3,602), also a selective school; the Western Australian college of agriculture in Cunderdin ($3,443); and Mitchelton state high school in Queensland ($3,299).Nineteen of the top 50 schools were in Victoria, and of those, 17 in Melbourne, including the affluent areas of Albert Park, Elwood and Brighton.Thirteen were in South Australia and nine were in New South Wales, including eight selective schools in Sydney. Queensland and Western Australia had five schools each in the top 50.Compared with other states, NSW has the highest proportion of selective institutions, with42 fully and partially selective high schoolsfor “high potential and gifted students”.Its education department website notes selective schools, except for agricultural campuses, don’t charge attendance fees but schools may ask parents to pay for “curriculum-related resources”, such as textbooks and materials, or to cover the costs of school excursions or sports.The fees at many of the schools in the top 50 rival some Catholic schools and independent institutions. The Catholic schools Parramatta diocese, for instance – which represents 80 schools across fast-growing areas in Western Sydney and the Blue Mountains – charges $2,445 for year 7 and 8 students, ranging up to a maximum of $3,459 for Year 11 and 12 students.And while the average tuition fee for independent schools in NSW is about $15,000, according toresearch published in the Conversation, 12% of schools charged less than $5,000 a student in 2024.chartAssociate professor in education at Deakin University, Emma Rowe, said there had been a “privatisation creep” into public schools that was normalising parents paying for supposedly free education.“It’s such a problem on so many different levels,” she said. “Public education should be free and high quality but funding is so stretched, it relies on private forms of funding from parents, which causes a huge amount of inequity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it means we have highly segregated public schools that cater to a very small proportion of population.”The Greens spokesperson on primary and secondary education, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, said public school “should be free”, but families were having to “dig deeper and deeper” as fees increased.“Decades of underfunding means that 98% of public schools don’t have their bare minimum resources. This is driving up competition and costs within the public system,” she said.On average, the total amount parents were paying in public school fees and contributions nationally jumped from $409 in 2022 to $465 in 2023, representing a 14% increase, or $1.2bn in total, the Acara data showed.This followed a 20.5% increase from 2021 to 2022, with an average of $337 paid in 2021.Finnish education expert Pasi Sahlberg said public schools’ websites where schools described parent payment arrangements showed financial contributions that were often explained in a way that “may make some parents think that if they don’t pay these contributions, their kids might have lower quality teaching and learning in that school”.In contrast, it is against the law for public schools in Finland to ask for any funding from parents, including for school trips or similar activities.“In real public education environments in Australia, all schools should have what they need to give every student the best possible quality education,” Sahlberg said.“As long public schools’ funding depends on what parents contribute to their annual budgets, we will continue to see inequities inAustralian educationsystems.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian educationSchoolsAustralian GreensAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

New study identifies four types of romantic loverAustralian research is ‘first to empirically show that we don’t all love the same’, lead author saysGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastTory ShepherdFri 28 Feb 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 18.02 ESTShareNew research has identified four types of romantic lover, including one that has sex up to 20 times a week.The research, published in the journalPersonality and Individual Differences, categorised lovers as mild romantic, moderate romantic, intense romantic, and libidinous romantic.Lead author, Australian National University PhD candidate in biological anthropology Adam Bode, defined romantic love as “a motivational state typically associated with a desire for long-term mating with a particular individual” – and one “that arose some time during the recent evolutionary history of humans”.“It occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive, emotional, behavioural, social, genetic, neural, and endocrine activity in both sexes. Throughout much of the life course, it serves mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding functions.”Men say ‘I love you’ first – but are they really more romantic than women?Read moreBode said that definition was “not perfect” but was “the scientifically most useful and most precise”. He plans to update it to include the age of the onset of romantic love, to note that it “doesn’t have all its features until puberty”, and that it is associated with the early stages of a romantic relationship.According to the study, the romantic love stage can be measured through changes inhormones and blood neurotransmitter levelsand is thought to last up to two years, after which it transitions to “companionate love”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIn some cases it persists longer.Bode said this was “the first paper to empirically show that we don’t all love the same”.“That seems pretty obvious, but science just hasn’t shown it before,” he said.The researchers, including experts from the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia as well as ANU, used theRomantic Love Survey 2022of 1,556 people, the world’s largest dataset of people in love.This longitudinal study across 33 countries selected 809 people aged 18 to 25, who self-reported being in love. And among them, Bode’s team identified four major “clusters”.Mild:About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by “the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex”. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was “definitely” in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%.Moderate:About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as “fairly stock-standard” – or in the words of the journal article, “entirely unremarkable”. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had “relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex”.Intense:This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as “crazy in-love” types. They were characterised by “the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex”. About six in 10 people in this group were female.Libidinous:About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as “relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex”. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.Love story: Australian researchers becoming world leaders in the study of romantic loveRead moreThe team’s research measured people’s romantic intensity, obsessive thinking, commitment and sexual frequency to come up with the categories. Bode noted other interesting associations, including that libidinous lovers were also more likely to want to smoke cigarettes, travel and spend more money.The study measured the intensity of romantic love by the Passionate Love Scale (or PLS), a “robust measure of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural characteristics of romantic love” used cross-culturally,developed in 1986.The research noted that obsessive thinking about a loved one has been recognised in theories about the understanding and mechanisms of romantic love. It cited previous research positing that obsessive thinking helps with bonding and faithfulness, that commitment plays a role in forming bonds, and that sex is a function of romantic love (the 2022 survey participants were told to define sex by “whatever they thought it meant”).The authors of the new study suggested it might “be fruitful” to further explore variables of sex, gender and sexual orientation, as well as the impact on mood of romantic love, and its effect on relationships over time. They also recommended future research focus on cultural or ethnic variations in the expression of romantic love, as well as the role of gender inequality.The study noted that the survey at its heart was limited to young, English speaking adults, many of them from Weird (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) countries.“Romantic love is under-researched given its importance in family and romantic relationship formation, its influence on culture, and its proposed universality and we want to help world researchers understand it,” Bode said.“These findings have implications for the evolution of romantic love.“Humans may still be evolving in terms of how they express [it].”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsPsychologyBiologyAnthropologynewsShareReuse this content"

We urge anyone who feels unwell or needs medical assistance to attend one of the medical tents on-site.”Once inside the drug checking service – attached to the festival’s medical tent – users will be presented with health and safety issues with illicit drugs from non-government peer workers.Amnesty bins will also be present.Up to six patrons at a time can have their drugs checked, with analysis taking about 10 minutes followed by further discussion.“Depending on what has been found, they can be educated further on the risks or be alerted to ‘this is actually a dangerous substance’,”festival co-founder Ben Tillmantold ABC Radio Sydney.Some results may led to broader warnings to attendees or feed into intelligence for peer workers and medical staff on the ground, the state’s chief health officer said.Health, police and liquor regulators are overseeing the implementation of the $1m trial.Drug checking is available in at least 28 countries, according to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation.Queensland’s new conservative government this week reiterated plans to shut down community drug checking services in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesDrugsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They also have a right to feel safe in their own workplace.“I will be establishing an urgent independent inquiry.”The exact nature of the allegations is unclear.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“The children’s guardian has agreed to step aside for the duration of the inquiry, which is appropriate,” Washington said.Kinmond told Guardian Australia that he welcomed the inquiry but was not aware what serious allegations had been directed at him.He said Washington raised an issue with him earlier this week “but the nexus between the issues she raised and my conduct are not known to me”.“I know about a particular matter that was raised, I don’t know what particular inferences have been drawn from that conduct about my individual behaviour,” he said.“I don’t wish to in any way minimise the concerns that have been raised … but I need further and better particulars before I can make further comment.”He said Washington told him the investigation would be conducted by “someone external who is well qualified to examine the matter”.“The public has a right to know there’s rigour in this process,” Kinmond said.“All I can say is from where I sit I’m very supportive of there being an inquiry.“I’m very keen to be acting in the public interest … and I support the minister’s right to make that decision.”Kinmond was appointed in 2022 after the former Perrottet government sidelined an independent recruitment process.Guardian Australia reportedhe had not even formally applied for the $400,000-a-year position before he was appointed.He is the former chief executive of the Association of Children’s Welfare Agencies and has also served as a NSW deputy ombudsman.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

We stand by Ukraine. We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor.“Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”Addressing Zelenskyy directly, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, wrote: “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone.”She added: “We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.”8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – videoThe British prime minister, Keir Starmer, who just a day beforehad visited Trump at the White House, called Zelenskyy to express his support, a No 10 spokesperson said.Starmer – who failed in his effort to convince Trump to commit US support for a European-led peacekeeping force in Ukraine – told Zelenskyy that “he retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace, based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine”, the official said.Two days after his own meeting with Trump in Washington the French president, Emmanuel Macron, responded indirectly to the US president’s baseless claims that Zelenskyy was responsible for the war, telling reporters: “Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people … These are simple things, but they’re good to remember at times like these.”European leaders had already been shaken byVance’s speech to the Munich security conferencetwo weeks ago in which he lectured them about the state of their democracy.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, called for an emergency meeting between the US, Europe and Ukraine.“A summit without delay is needed between the United States, European states and their allies to talk frankly about how we intend to tackle today’s major challenges, starting with Ukraine, which together we have defended in recent years,” Meloni said in a statement.Jonas Gahr Støre, Norway’s prime minister, described the episode as “serious and disheartening”.“That Trump accuses Zelenskyy of gambling with world war three is deeply unreasonable and a statement I distance myself from,” he said.The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said his country would stand by Ukraine after the row.Sánchez, a staunch backer of Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion who pledged €1bn of aid in a visit to Kyiv earlier this week, wrote on X: “Ukraine, Spain stands with you.”Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, was among the first to show his support for Zelenskyy and Ukraine on social media, telling them: “You are not alone.”The outgoing German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, Luxembourg’s prime minister, Luc Frieden, and Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, also professed their support for Ukraine, along with other leaders from Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Sweden.Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ukraine’s fight against Russia is a defense of democracy.“Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine. For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all,” he posted on X.“Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine,” Trudeau added.Some world leaders, however, sided with Trump.Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, wrote on X: “Strong men make peace, weak men make war.“Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!”Orbán, an outspoken critic of western aid to Ukraine,has been at odds with other Nato countriesover Orbán’s continued cultivation of close ties to Russia.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

What do you mean?Vance: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.Zelenskyy: Yes, but if you …Vance: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the frontlines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president.Zelenskyy: Have you ever been toUkraineto see the problems we have?Vance: I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President.Do you disagree that you’ve had problems with bringing people in your military, and do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?Zelenskyy: First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. You have nice solutions and don’t feel [it] now, but you will feel it in the future.Trump: You don’t know that. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.Zelenskyy: I am not telling you, I am answering …Ukraine ‘gambling with world war three’, Trump tells Zelenskyy in fiery meetingRead moreVance: That’s exactly what you’re doing …Trump, raising his voice: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.Zelenskyy tries to speak.Trump: You right now are not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having the cards.You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.Vance: Have you said thank you once?Zelenskyy: A lot of times.Vance: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.Zelenskyy: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …Trump: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble. No, no, you’ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.Zelenskyy: I know, I know.Trump: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.Zelenskyy: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. Your men are brave, but they had our military. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.Zelenskyy: I heard it from Putin in three days.Trump: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.Vance: Just say thank you.Zelenskyy: I said it a lot of times.Vance: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. We know that you’re wrong.Trump: You’re buried there. Your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. No, listen … And then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a ceasefire. I don’t want a ceasefire. I want to go and I want this.’Trump: You’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing.All right, I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? Great television. I will say that.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeJD VanceexplainersShareReuse this content"

The Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said the hour-long discussion showed “strong bipartisan support in the Senate for Ukraine’s freedom and democracy”.Klobuchar later addressed Vance directly in a social mediapostsaying that Zelenskyy had thanked the US “over and over again” both privately and publicly.“Our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest ofEurope,” she wrote. “Shame on you,” she said, referring to Vance.Tina Smith, another Democratic senator from Minnesota,calledon her Republican colleagues to “speak out” in the name of “patriotism”. “Once, we fought tyrants. Today Trump and Vance are bending America’s knee,” she said.But Republican senators rushed to defend Trump, describing the president’s exchange with Zelenskyy as evidence that he was “putting America first”.Mike Lee, a Utah Republican senator,thankedTrump and Vance “for standing up to our country and putting America first”. The Indiana Republican senator Jim Banks also thanked Trump for “standing up for America”.“[Zelenskyy] ungratefully expects us to bankroll and escalate another forever war–all while disrespecting the President,” Bankswroteon X. “The entitlement is insulting to working Americans.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS politicsUkraineUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

But the experiment was abandoned after a few trials in northern Gaza.It has been revived by Cogat at a time whenIsrael is negotiating the potential start of a second phase of the January ceasefire agreement, which is supposed to include the full withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from the Gaza Strip. The Cogat plan instead involves a tightening of Israel’s grip on day-to-day life in the Palestinian territory.According to aid sources briefed on the plan, the “humanitarian hubs” themselves could be secured by private security contractors, but they would be located in areas “under full IDF control”.The only entrance toGazathrough which aid would be allowed under the plan would be the Kerem Shalom crossing, controlled by Israel. The Rafah crossing, between Egypt and Gaza, would be permanently closed.Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) allowed to operate in Gaza would have to be registered in Israel, and all staff working for them or for UN agencies would have to be vetted.As aid would only be allowed through an Israeli crossing and not through Rafah, it would make operating in Gaza all but impossible for the UN relief agency for Palestinian Refugees (Unrwa) – by far the biggest aid organisation in Gaza – which has been banned by Israel.Aid officials familiar with the Cogat briefing said the plan was presented as an established fact, with Israeli officials claiming it already had full US support and would therefore be hard for the UN to resist.The scheme envisages a Gaza in which basic necessities are distributed to approved Palestinians at limited distribution points under tight Israeli control. It makes no mention ofDonald Trump’s planfor the US to take ownership of the Gaza Strip and for the territory to be emptied of its Palestinian inhabitants.Cogat did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Its presentation of the scheme comes as Arab governments discuss their own plan for Gaza’s future. A meeting in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, of representatives from Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf states on 21 February endorsedan Egyptian-designed $53bn reconstruction planlasting three to five years, starting with the establishment of safe zones of tents and mobile homes for people to live in during reconstruction.The proposal is due to be presented to an emergency summit of the Arab League on Tuesday in Cairo.“The Cogat plan is meant to be a spoiler, an alternative to the Arab plan,” an aid worker in Jerusalem said.In January 2024, theIDF carried out trialsof “humanitarian bubbles” in three areas of northern Gaza. Selected Palestinians such as community elders were to administer the distribution of food and other basic supplies, but the plan never got off the ground. It was hard to find local volunteers prepared to work with the Israelis and Hamas killed some of the local people who were co-opted into the experiment.“The bubble approach, which was rejected from the beginning of the war, has all kinds of serious implications since the Israelis will control each single supply coming in,” Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, said.Shawa said it would be an extension of the restrictive aid regime currently overseen by the IDF. Under the ceasefire, the flow of humanitarian assistance entering Gaza has reverted to its prewar level of 400 to 600 trucks a day, but Shawa says Israel has not delivered the number of tents promised, when children have been freezing to death.Unrwa reported that six infants died from exposure to cold on Monday and Tuesday this week in the Gaza Strip.Shawa said the IDF was also preventing water tankers from entering, as well as notebooks and crayons intended for the improvised school classes being taught under canvas, on the grounds that such materials were “dual use”.“They want to control the ABC of the lives of Palestinians,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

There were body parts of the injured and the dead all around me.”Another migrant talked of sustaining shrapnel wounds to his leg and back. A third alleged witnessing the rape of three Ethiopian women by men in Saudi border guard uniforms. Others described beatings and sexual assault.Another man, who attempted to cross in January 2023, said: “The journey was particularly horrifying. Along the way, we encountered many decomposing bodies that had been eaten by animals. The border guards continued to fire at us as we walked through treacherous terrain.”View image in fullscreenEthiopian migrants journey on foot through Yemen in July 2019, headed to Saudi Arabia where they hope to find work.Photograph: Susan SchulmanBullets hit two young women, he said. “One was struck in the chest, and the other was struck in the back of her neck. Both the girls died instantly. Many migrants fell off a cliff while trying to escape. Others were captured or injured by gunfire. We have no idea what happened to them. We don’t know whether the two girls were ever buried.”The testimonies reflect the findings of aHuman Rights Watch (HRW) report published in August 2023, which found that Saudi border guards killed “hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers” on the southern border with Yemen from March 2022 to June 2023 “in a pattern that is widespread and systematic” using guns and explosive weaponry. The group concluded that these actions may amount to crimes against humanity.HRW documented one incident when Saudi border guards shot an Ethiopian man who refused to rape two girls after their group survived an explosive weapons attack. They then forced a teenage boy to rape the girls, according to HRW. In another, Saudi border guards asked Ethiopian migrants to choose in which part of their body they preferred to be shot before shooting them at close range.View image in fullscreenSatellite imagery from 2023 vshows new graves in the main burial site of Al Raqw migrant camp. Human Rights Watch counted at least 12 graves on 9 February 2022 and at least 72 graves by 23 June 2023.Photograph: Maxar/HRW“There is a complete culture of impunity and unaccountability at the border,” said Nadia Hardman, who authored the HRW report. “It’s impossible to know the true scale of the killings. No one has independent access to these areas. They are basically off limits.”A spokesperson for the Saudi Arabian government and the Saudi embassy in Ethiopia have been contacted for comment on the allegations.Saudi Arabia hosts about 750,000 Ethiopian migrants.More than half are believed to have entered illegally. These irregular migrantsendure perilous desert treks and sea crossingsand rampant abuses by people smugglers, armed gangs and Yemeni rebel groups before they even reach the Saudi border. Those who make it find low-paid work in construction, on farms and as domestic servants.A map showing the routes of migration and return between Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia.In recent years, Saudi authorities have launched security operations to detain tens of thousands of illegal migrants and deported them back to Ethiopia. Ahead ofhosting the football World Cup in 2034and building 11 new stadiums, Saudi Arabia is coming under increased scrutiny overmigrant workers’s conditions.The Ethiopians travelling illegally via Yemen in search of work are from areas affected by civil conflict, poverty and the climate crisis. Between 2022 and 2023, the number of Ethiopians making this dangerous journeysurged by 32% to reach 96,670, according to the UN. A smaller number of Somalis also take the route.There is no sign Saudia Arabia has stopped using deadly force to thwart irregular crossings. One Ethiopian migrant, who tried to reach the country from a Yemeni settlement called Al Raqw in December 2024, described Saudi border forces targeting him and 10 other Ethiopians with machine guns and artillery to push them back intoYemen, wounding one.View image in fullscreenEthiopian migrants at waterpoint just outside Obock, Djibouti. From here, many migrants travel in small boats across the Gulf of Aden, to Yemen, then on to Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Fred Harter“Saudi Arabia has thrown its money around to get into the diplomatic fold,” said Hardman from HRW. “It doesn’t really matter what it does, the world just moves on. Unless states dealing with Saudi Arabia send a message saying they will not tolerate abuses, they will sadly continue.”Lonely graves, scattered bones: the stark reality of one of the most overlooked and fastest-growing migration routesRead moreOne man travelled to Yemen in the hope of reaching Saudi Arabia after serving for nearly two years as a rebel fighter in the war that gripped Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region in 2020-2022. Although a ceasefire ended the bloodshed, it did not entice back enough tourists for him to resume work as a guide.When he arrived in Yemen, he said he was held and tortured by traffickers until his family paid a ransom. After his release, in early 2024, he worked for other smugglers in Al Raqw to pay off the debt, running hidden market cigarettes and other items into Saudi Arabia on trails used by migrants.“I saw many dead bodies along the way,” he said. “Every trip there would be dead bodies: five in one place, two or three in another. This was normal. There were fresh bodies who had been killed recently. There were bodies that had been there for a while, badly decomposing. Some were skeletons.”He said he saw cameras on the border, which he believes Saudi guards used to detect migrant movements. He was detained and forcibly deported back to Ethiopia where he spoke to the Guardian at a coffee shop in his home town of Wukro, whose buildings bear the bullet marks of the Tigray war, and which has a long history of migration to the Gulf.View image in fullscreenThis man, interviewed in Wukro, Ethiopia, attempted the journey to Saudi Arabia. He says he experienced imprisonment and torture at the hands of traffickers and saw ‘many dead bodies’ on migrant trails.Photograph: Fred HarterAnother man from Wukro spoke from inside Saudi Arabia. He described trying to cross the border four times from 2021 to 2023 and being fired upon and, in May 2023, his group – mostly women – was detained at a border post. He says guards raped three of the women in a building. “After the rapes, the border guards pushed us back, forcing us to return [to Yemen].”His fourth attempt was successful and he now scrapes a living as a goatherd in the kingdom, earning 800 Saudi riyals (about £170 a month) and sending the bulk of his earnings to family in Ethiopia.He lives in constant fear. “I can’t say I’m truly living because, at any moment, the Saudi authorities could come and arrest me or even kill me. I can’t sleep peacefully. I always fear they will show up. I can truly say, life here in Saudi is hell on earth.”The Guardian was unable to obtain comment from the Saudi authorities about these allegations.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentHuman rightsMigrationEthiopiaSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaYemennewsShareReuse this content"

In a cabinet meeting, several spoke of the risk of unintended consequences.David Lammy, the foreign secretary,said earlier this monththat the US’s plan to cut aid funding could be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence. Starmer has been accused of pandering to the US president.Dodds, the MP for Oxford East, said she was told about the decision by Starmer only on Monday, but delayed resigning so as not to overshadow the prime minister’s trip to Washington to make the case to Trump for security guarantees for Ukraine.Starmer made his surprise announcement in the Commons, telling MPs that Britain would “fight for peace in Europe” with a generational increase in defence spending.The announcement, two days before the prime minister was due to meet Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was following the US’s lead and promptedfury from aid groups, who said it could cost lives in countries that relied on UK support.Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army, said thedecision to cut foreign aid was a “strategic mistake”that would ultimately add to the burden on Britain’s armed forces, and risked making the UK “weaker not stronger”.Dodds, in her letter to the prime minister, wrote: “Undoubtedly the postwar global order has come crashing down. I believe that we must increase spending on defence as a result; and know that there are no easy paths to doing so.“I stood ready to work with you to deliver that increased spending, knowing some might well have had to come from overseas development assistance [ODA]. I also expected we would collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, as other nations are doing.“Even 3% may only be the start, and it will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, when strategic decisions for the sake of our country’s security cannot be ducked.”Labour’s aid cuts are morally wrong. Here’s why they make no economic sense either | Larry ElliottRead moreDodds, who was also a minister for women, was sceptical about Starmer’s promise to maintain aid funding for Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, as well as for vaccination, climate and rules-based systems.Officials have said that the portion of the development budget going on asylum-seeker accommodation – which stands at almost a third – would eventually be freed up for aid.But Dodds wrote: “It will be impossible to maintain these priorities given the depth of the cut; the effect will be far greater than presented, even if assumptions made about reducing asylum costs hold true.”She cautioned about the effect on Britain’s national security and global influence as hostile countries moved into the breach.“The cut will also likely lead to a UK pullout from numerous African, Caribbean and western Balkan nations at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence,” she said. “All this while China is seeking to rewrite global rules, and when the climate crisis is the biggest security threat of them all.“Ultimately, these cuts will remove food and healthcare from desperate people – deeply harming the UK’s reputation. I know you have been clear that you are not ideologically opposed to international development. But the reality is that this decision is already being portrayed as following in President Trump’s slipstream of cuts to USAid.”In reply, Starmer wrote: “Overseas development is vitally important, and I am proud of what we have done. The UK will still be providing significant humanitarian and development support, and we will continue to protect vital programmes – including in the world’s worst conflict zones of Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.“The decision I have taken on ODA was a difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly. We will do everything we can to return to a world where that is not the case and to rebuild a capability on development.“However, protecting our national security must always be the first duty of any government and I will always act in the best interests of the British people.”Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the Commons international development committee, posted on X: “What else could she do? She knows these cuts are unworkable. Honourable as always, she’s done right by her department and right by the PM by not resigning before DC visit. Deep shame for development where she was respected.”The Conservative former aid secretary Andrew Mitchell said Dodds had “done the right thing” by resigning, adding: “Labour’s disgraceful and cynical actions demean the Labour party’s reputation as they balance the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world. Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle.”Romilly Greenhill, the chief executive of Bond, the umbrella organisation for aid charities, said: “This will be a huge loss. It is clear from the devastating UK aid cuts announced this week, which must be reversed, that the government is trying to step back from its development ambitions.”Explore more on these topicsAnneliese DoddsAidKeir StarmerLabourDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

It has been a tormentous time and all I want now is to readjust to what has been such an ordeal.”Explore more on these topicsDerbyEnglandTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

A fog alarm at Longships Lighthouse, just off the Cornish headland, has been going off every 13 seconds for the past week.Local people have been advised to invest in a set of earplugs while visitors heading to the tourist destination said they feared being kept awake at night.The National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) Gwennap Head, a maritime charity, said on social media that the horn had been sounding “all day, all night” and “a set of earplugs might be a good investment”.In a statement, it said: “Anyone living in the area may have noticed that, for the past six days, the Longships Lighthouse has been sounding its foghorn every 13 seconds … all day and all night.“Our watchkeeper has reported this ‘interesting’ occurrence to HM Coastguard Falmouth and they, in turn, have reported it to Trinity House. It has been fed back to us that Trinity House are aware of the problem; apparently, there is a fault in the fog sensing mechanism and they are awaiting delivery of a part to fix it.“Of course, once the part has arrived, the maintenance crew will still have to wait for calm enough weather conditions to allow them to get out to the lighthouse and install it. In the meantime, a set of earplugs might be a good investment.”Trinity House, which manages more than 60 lighthouses across the UK, said there was an issue with the “audible hazard warning signal” on Longships, whichit planned to fix.It told the BBC: “It will likely be an issue with the visibility sensor not functioning as expected. The hazard warning signal indicates diminished visibility in the area, such as fog.”David Hocking, of Land’s End Landmark, said the continuous beeping was “a bit of a talking point and conversation starter” in the area.A tourist visiting the spot told the BBC it was “the noisiest sunset I’ve seen so far”. Another said she hoped the alarm would have been “silenced” overnight. “It’s been going for a week I think. This is not normal forCornwall.”Another visitor said the alarm was “noisy”, adding that it would “probably keep me awake”, but a visitor staying nearby said they could not hear the noise from their room.The high-pitched electronic beep, which is usually only heard during foggy conditions, has gone off despite the skies having been fog free this week. The alarm can be heard most clearly at Land’s End, but residents in nearby villages including Sennen and Cape Cornwall have reported hearing it too.Longships Lighthouse was built in 1875. It is 115ft (35 metres) tall and is located about 1.25 miles (2km) off Land’s End. It was crewed by resident lighthouse-keepers until 1987, when it became automated. Since then it has been monitored and controlled by Trinity House from the company’s planning centre in Harwich, Essex.Explore more on these topicsCornwallnewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister had just landed in Washington DC and been driven straight to a glitzy reception at the UK ambassador’s opulent Edwin Lutyens-designed residence.Under the sparkling crystal chandeliers and among the grand marble columns, his euphoric host, Peter Mandelson, introduced Starmer to guests including the new FBI director, Kush Patel. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham and the New York-based editor Tina Brown were also present.“I’ve only just arrived but already I can feel there’s real buzz around Washington right now,” Starmer told the gathering. “You can sense that there’s a new leader. He’s a true one-off, a pioneer in business, in politics. Many people love him. Others love to hate him. But to us, he’s just … Peter.”But alongside the levity there was also apprehension among the prime minister’s most senior advisers at what might unfold the next day, which held probably the most consequential meeting of Starmer’s premiership, and also the most unpredictable.“We’re well prepared but also aware that absolutely anything could happen. Trump is so mercurial,” a second official said. “So it’s rather fraught.”The groundwork for the visit had been going on for some time. In May last year, David Lammy made his sixth visit to Washington since becoming shadow foreign secretary, spending several days in the US capital meeting the Democrat and Republican campaign teams.When he got back to the UK, he wrote a memo for Starmer, then leader of the opposition, sharing how impressed he had been by the professionalism and focus of the Trump campaign. At the top of the page were the words: “The Democrats are in trouble.”Since then, Starmer and his senior team have been preparing for a Trump presidency, putting personal relationships at the heart of their strategy. In September, by now prime minister, Starmer dined at Trump Tower in New York.Three months later his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, travelled to the US for talks with his Trump counterpart, Susie Wiles. Others have been out to Washington in recent days, leaving nothing to chance.“If Donald Trump likes somebody he’s doing business with, it makes all the difference,” one senior government official said. “He likes that Keir is down to earth. It’s important because it means it’s possible for him to raise difficult issues without risk.”During their meetings, Trump’s warmth towards Starmer was apparent, describing him as a “special man”, lauding the “incredible” and “unprecedented” offer from King Charles of a second state visit, and even lavishing praise on the prime minister’s “beautiful” Surrey accent.1:25Starmer gives Trump invitation from King Charles for UK state visit – videoThey had not got there by accident. The government’s strategy has been threefold: flatter Trump’s not insubstantial ego; characterise the UK’s “asks” through the prism of how they might benefit America; but also stand up for the British national interest.As part of the first, there was a conscious decision to “dial down the volume” in public about Trump’s more outrageous public outbursts, whether that was falsely labelling Volodymyr Zelenskyya dictator, suggesting making Canada the51st US state, or sharing anAI videoof “Trump Gaza”.Starmer brought personal gifts with him from the UK. The president’s included a golf cap in his family tartan and some Downing Street golf balls, while his wife, Melania, received a Liberty scarf and No 10 candle. In return, Trump gave the football-mad prime minister a US jersey with his name and the number 10 on the back.The second part of the UK strategy involved presenting a deal on theChagos Islandsas a national security issue, suggesting a tech-focusedtrade dealwould be an economic boon for the US, and encouraging Americansecurity guaranteesfor Ukraine so that any peace treaty is durable.The Downing Street team was also aware that to truly earn Trump’s respect, Starmer would have to – in the words of one adviser – “show some balls”, demonstrating that he was willing to stand up for the UK’s national interest.He did so repeatedly, reminding Trump that Vladimir Putin was the aggressor in Ukraine, challenging JD Vance on free speech in the UK and arguing the case against tariffs. “He tried,” Trump joked with reporters at a press conference later in the opulent east room of the White House when asked about tariffs. “He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.”1:13Trump praises Starmer’s negotiating as he suggests UK will be exempt from US tariffs – videoWhile No 10 will have been relieved that the White House visit went without any obvious hitch, in the longer term, was the prime minister’s strategy successful? “I think we’ll have two deals. A deal on ending the war, and I think we’re going to end up with a great trade deal,” Trump concluded.Starmer left the White House with positive noises on tariffs, although Trump did not rule out imposing them entirely; also the prospect of a tech trade deal, although officials admitted there would have to be policy and regulatory compromises ahead. And the president hinted he could accept the Chagos Islands deal – although some in his administration are vehemently against.When the prime minister came to the back of the plane on the flight back to London to chat briefly to journalists, he confirmed he was “happy” with how the day had gone, giving a Trump-style thumbs up.But the prime minister and his senior team know there is a danger that any endorsement from Trump may prove short-lived, and there is always the risk the president could very publicly change his mind. Also, Zelenskyy was due to arrive in Washington on Friday, so the situation in Ukraine could change extremely quickly in either direction.One Starmer aide said: “I wouldn’t put too much stress on one meeting, what’s important is the process. We’re at the very beginning of that and there are very basic things not yet agreed or defined.”Chief among those is Starmer’s push for a US military “backstop” to support any European peacekeeping forces that may end up in Ukraine if a peace deal is reached. Trump repeatedly resisted making any sort of commitment. Instead, he suggested that an economic backstop of US civilians working in Ukraine on a multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal would be enough to deter Putin, perhaps also hoping that the vagueness of his position might prevent another Russian attack.Starmer is trying to keep his eye on the ultimate prize. “When there’s a Trump presidency, the rhetoric is always very destabilising, so we try to zoom out,” an aide said. “The president has been very clear he wants to end the war. That’s all that matters, and we want to help him get there.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

I am worried about my girls. It is like I feel apologetic to them. But I think by now I am just as effective dead as alive. I think the campaign for his release will go on if I die. It is strong enough that it will continue after I have gone, and so I will have not died in vain.”Her son knows she is in hospital, but has not been able to communicate with her.She has lost a third of her weight, her blood sugar reading has dropped and her face in the past fortnight has become noticeably thinner, the lines on her face even deeper than before. Flowers from the Foreign Office and a book on the Palestinians lie by her bedside, which ironically overlooks the House of Commons.At her bedside are her two daughters, Mona and Sanaa, and other family and friends, many of them Egyptian intellectuals. She insists that once this glucose has been taken, there will be no other infusion until she is unconscious. The doctors, caught in a moral dilemma, have agreed to respect her wishes, including her continued refusal to eat food.The drip was only agreed after her doctor gave her the stern warning that her organs, in particular her heart and brain, are likely to become permanently damaged. They wrote: “We advise intravenous glucose or controlled refeeding immediately to reduce the risk to herself. The longer the duration of her fasting, the higher the risk of death during the refeeding process, should she cease fasting.”She said: “I will continue until there is some positive response from the Egyptian government, whether it is allowing my son to have a consular visit or his release.”There is a faint hope that with the Egyptian state traditionally willing to grant pardons at Ramadan, a new push by the British government might lead to a breakthrough.But the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, by Thursday had not made a phone call to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to seek his release. He wrote two letters at the turn of the year. On 14 February he met the family to explain what the government had been doing to secure her son’s release. The family in turn brought a copy of his collection of essays, You Have Not Been Defeated.At prime minister’s questions this week, before travelling to Washington, Starmer promised he would make the call if necessary, and said there was a feeling in the family: “If not now, when?”The family feel Sisi is immunised by his advisers from bad news, and it may take an external figure such as Starmer to tell him leniency would be in Egypt’s national interest. But such are the secret wheels of diplomacy, and the bigger Middle East issues at stake, that it may be that Sisi has been refusing to take a call from Starmer.The family have also had numerous meetings with the Foreign Office, but fear the lack of an all-government effort focused on Sisi rather than the Egyptian foreign ministry has made the lobbying ineffective.Sanaa Soueif said:“When we met Keir Starmer he asked us for more time and promised that he would do all he could to free my brother and reunite him with his son in Brighton. My sister and I have convinced my mother to take one dose of glucose drip, to try to stop her from dying of hunger today.“Nothing is guaranteed, but we hope that this gives us a few more days with our mother, and that Keir Starmer keeps his promise.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEgyptLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

They have been updated and will be supported by a family liaison officer. I’d also like to thank the officers and paramedics who attended … and tried to save her life. Support is in place for them.“A full investigation is now well under way to establish the full circumstances of the events that led to her death.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Mendoza said it was a “good assumption” that was the last day of the actor’s life.Officials had said earlier on Friday that initial autopsies had found that the actor and his wife suffered no external trauma.That means the mystery over the couple’s deaths remains unanswered.The Oscar-winning actor, who graced the silver screen for more than 60 years, and his classical pianist wife werefound deadat their home undersuspicious circumstances. Maintenance workers found the couple’s bodies at their home on Wednesday, along with one of their three German shepherd dogs, who was also found dead.Mummification: what is it and how can it occur?Read moreOfficials have cautioned that the full results of autopsies may only come in weeks.The suddenly discovered deaths have stunned movie fans around the world and sent shock waves through Hollywood and New Mexico, where the couple lived for decades.The Santa Fe International film festival organization said it was “deeply saddened”.“Not only was Gene one of the greatest actors of his generation but he and Betsy were members of our community here in Santa Fe,” a statement said.New Mexico’s state senate held a moment of silence at the state capitol in the historic city, with one lawmaker stating: “We were lucky to call him a New Mexican.”In downtown Santa Fe there were no signs of any immediate tributes visible among the traditional adobe buildings of the area, hailing or mourning the famous residents, and the streets were quiet on Friday morning under characteristic brilliant blue skies and bright sunshine.Meanwhile, the sheriff of Santa Fe county, Adan Mendoza, had also revealed that the couple had been dead for “quite a while” before they were found. The two maintenance workers who made the grim discovery said the last time they had been in touch with Hackman and Arakawa was two weeks previously.Early on Friday Mendoza told the Today Show on NBC TV that it was difficult to put a timeline on how long the couple had been dead. But he added: “It appears, several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks.”The possibility that several days might have passed before the couple’s bodies were discovered chimes with an affidavit in which a sheriff disclosed that Arakawa’s body “showed obvious signs of death, body decomposition, bloating in her face and mummification in both hands and feet”. Mummification occurs when dead tissue dries and hardens over time.The sheriff’s office has reported that when the deceased were found the front door was open, although there were no signs of foul play, and no obvious evidence of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning. But the scene was strange enough that the sheriff’s office sought a search warrant on Wednesday evening.View image in fullscreenGene Hackman with his wife Betsy Arakawa at the Golden Globes in 2003.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APHackman, 95, appeared to have fallen in an entryway, a deputy said, and a cane was found nearby. Arakawa, 65, was found in an upstairs bathroom with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on a nearby countertop. The dead German shepherd was found in a bathroom closet.“There was no indication of a struggle,” Mendoza said. “There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed … you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.”Hackman and Arakawa appeared to have suddenly fallen to the floor and neither showed signs of blunt force trauma, an affidavit said. Mendoza said two other dogs were found alive, and that those dogs were not in a crate and were able to move freely in and out of the house by a pet door.Authorities were contacted after a worker performing pest control came across their open door but was unable to get in touch with the couple and dispatched security in the area to check on them.“I think we just found two or one deceased person[s] inside a house for purchase here,” a caller told 911. “I’m not inside the house. It’s closed. It’s locked. I can’t go in. But I see them. She’s lying face down on the floor from the window.”The caller can be heard saying: “Damn, damn, damn.”Hackman, a former marine known for his raspy voice, appeared in more than 80 films, as well as on television and the stage during a lengthy career that started in the early 1960s.View image in fullscreenThe house owned by actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa.Photograph: Roberto E Rosales/APHe earned his first Oscar nomination for his breakout role as the brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow in 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde. He was also nominated for best supporting actor in 1970 for I Never Sang for My Father.His role as Popeye Doyle, the rumpled New York detective chasing international drug dealers in director William Friedkin’s thriller The French Connection, brought him stardom and a best actor Academy Award.He also won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1992 for his role as a mean sheriff in the Clint Eastwood western Unforgiven, and was nominated for an Academy Award for his turn as an FBI agent in the 1988 historical drama Mississippi Burning.Since the 1980s, Hackman had lived near Santa Fe, a charming arts town – in 2005 it was recognized as a Unesco “creative city” with a thriving tourism industry. It has become well-known in part due to the famed artists and writers that have called it home, including George RR Martin and Cormac McCarthy.Hackman became well-established in the community, and for many decades could be seen making his way around town. Between 1997 and 2004, he served on the board of trustees for the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum. Speaking at the grand opening of the museum, hesaid: “In the 10 years I’ve lived here, I’ve been taken with the excitement and indomitable spirit of this place.”The couple lived in a gated community just outside Santa Fe.“He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,” his daughters and granddaughter said in a statement on Thursday.“We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.”Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

She was 113.She died on Monday in New York, according to theClaims Conference, a New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.“She just was a terrific lady,” her daughter, Reha Benicassa, said by phone on Friday. “Nothing was too hard. She wasn’t fearful. She was an adventurous person. She did well.”Girone was born on 13 January 1912 in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was six, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Adolf Hitler, she said that he “came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody”.Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.“Rose was an example of fortitude but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,” Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice-president, said in a statement on Thursday. “The lessons of theHolocaustmust not die with those who endured the suffering.”Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.“This passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,” Schneider said. “The Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today’s world, to be forgotten.”Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.She was nine months pregnant living in Breslau, which is now Wrocław, Poland, when Nazis arrived to take Mannheim to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Their family had two cars, so she asked her husband to leave his keys.She said she remembers one Nazi saying: “Take that woman also.”The other Nazi responded: “She’s pregnant, leave her alone.”The next morning her father-in-law was also taken, and she was left alone with their housekeeper.After her daughter Reha was born in 1938, Girone was able to secure Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband’s release.In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only six months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bedbugs crawled through their belongings.Her father-in-law came just before the second world war started, but fell ill and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself “King of the Jews”.“They did really horrible things to people,” Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. “One of our friends got killed because he wouldn’t move fast enough.”Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors as British radios were not allowed.When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone’s mother, grandmother and other relatives in the US. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.They arrived inNew YorkCity in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.“Her theories were always, ‘Don’t sweat the small stuff,’ and ‘anything you can fix with money is not a problem,’” her daughter said. “She just had a great head on her shoulders.”Also in New York, Girone was reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his US citizenship by joining the army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was her first time seeing him in 17 years.Girone later divorced Mannheim. In 1968, she met Jack Girone, the same day her granddaughter was born. By the next year they were married. He died in 1990.When asked in 1996 for the message she would like to leave for her daughter and granddaughter, she said: “Nothing is so very bad that something good shouldn’t come out of it. No matter what it is.”Explore more on these topicsHolocaustNew YorkSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

She noted that was the sentence jurors at his 1994 trial had recommended. A judge overruled that recommendation and imposed a death sentence, a maneuver that has since been outlawed in Alabama, according to the human rights advocacy organizationAmnesty International.The decision came after ongoing questions about the case that included a lack of physical evidence at the crime scene tying him to the 1991 murder of Ludie Mae Tucker in Decatur,Alabama. Myers had long maintained he was innocent, and a juror at his 1994 trial supported the push for clemency.View image in fullscreenRobin ‘Rocky’ Myers.Photograph: AP“In short, I am not convinced that Mr Myers is innocent, but I am not so convinced of his guilt as to approve of his execution,” Ivey said in a statement. “I therefore must respect both the jury’s decision to convict him and its recommendation that he be sentenced to life without parole.”Ivey, a Republican who has never previously stopped an execution, called it “one of the most difficult decisions I’ve had to make as governor”.“But it pales in comparison to the pain and suffering Ludie Mae Tucker and Marie Dutton endured on the night of [4 October 1991] – and to the many hardships the Tucker family has endured at the hands of our imperfect justice system,” Ivey said.“I pray that the Tucker family may, in some way, find closure and peace knowing this case is closed, and Mr Myers will spend the rest of his life in prison.”The Alabama supreme court earlier in February authorized Myers’ execution bynitrogen hypoxia. The next step was for the governor to set the execution date.Explore more on these topicsAlabamaUS justice systemCapital punishmentUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

But with the buyout offer, they would only receive the lesser amount. They provided the Guardian a copy of their benefits, which notes their current severance amount and eligibility.Another Department of Education employee confirmed this claim, adding “if you take it thinking you’ll get $25,000 but your severance is $15,000, you’ll get the $15,000”.The agreement also includes a stipulation that the employee would have to pay back the buyout if they are employed or contracted with the federal government in the next five years, according to a copy of the voluntary separation incentive payment.“Under a reduction in force, you have more rights to re-employment and unemployment,” the second employee noted.The application also affirms “My decision is entirely voluntary. I have not been coerced.”The Department of Education and White House were contacted for comment.Reportssurfaced earlier this month that the White House had been preparing an executive order to abolish the US Department of Education.Dozens of employees at the Department of Education wereplacedon administrative leave in response to Donald Trump’s anti-DEI orders earlier this month. At least 39 probationary employees were alsofiredand $900m in research funding at the department was cancelled by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”.Trump’s nominee for secretary of education, Linda McMahon,saidshe “wholeheartedly” agreed with Trump’s plan to dismantle the department, with her final Senate confirmation votescheduledfor Monday.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationUS educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Participants are asked not to spend any money, and if they need to, it is recommended that they shop at a local, small business and pay in cash.“February 28 is a symbolic start to economic resistance, a day where we show corporations and politicians that we control the economy,” reads the organization’s website. “The date itself is not tied to any historical event, it is the beginning of something bigger.”Spurred by anger about companies rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, in response to large-scale government cuts byDonald TrumpandElon Musk’s so-called“department of government efficiency” (Doge), some consumers are attempting to show their discontent with their wallets.Hundreds of people from across the countryresponded to a Guardian questionnairein which they detailed their decisions to stop shopping at stores like Target or Walmart and to stop using companies like Amazon, Meta and X (formerly Twitter), even if it is inconvenient.Eric Butcher, a support group leader for the Alpha-1 Foundation, an organization that supports and provides resources for people with Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, said that he decided to participate in the boycott because it is “the only way that we can make folks understand that their decisions are affecting everyone.“These billionaires likeElon Musk, Jeff Bezos – they have an unprecedented amount of access to the government, to the president, to the congressional members,” said Butcher, who is from Bakersfield, California. “All the dark and powerful money has always been in our politics, but now it’s unprecedented. It’s so public and in your face. The only thing that they understand is money. So we have to hit them where it hurts.”Butcher participated in the campaign because it was Rare Disease Day, he said, and has both Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Addison’s disease.“With all the cuts to federal funding for healthcare, NIH, CDC, the impending cuts for Medicaid, Ssnap, the suggested cuts for social security, Medicare – this is gonna kill people. It’s gonna kill people that are my friends,” he said. “It could kill me.”Lisa Rayner, a small business owner in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said that participating in the boycott was “no decision”. She receives social security disability income, and said that she was “horrified about what Elon Musk and Trump are doing together to destroy the US government”. The economic boycott is not Rayner’s first time using her wallet to show her values.“I’ve always participated in economic boycotts, like Buy Nothing Day, which goes back more than 25 years,” she said. “Even though I am disabled and I shop at Amazon for some items, I made a decision last year after the election to stock up on a few essential items that I really needed and to spend as little as possible to do so. I’ve already cut down on expenses.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They see participation as a way to show that people can come together and organize in solidarity.“[I hope] people learn that they can live without these big corporations,” she said. “Maybe it gives them time to reflect on how to live their lives differently as citizens rather than consumers and to feel like, yes, we can do it. We can cooperate, and we can beat them.”Friday’s boycott is occurring simultaneously with other economic protests: We Are Somebody, a labor advocacy group, launched a boycott of Target that started on 1 February, to coincide with Black History Month, in response to Target’s decision to roll back DEI initiatives. Starting on 5 March, the first day of Lent, some Black faith leaders are calling on Christians to participate in a40-day boycott of the company.TheLatino Freeze movement, a nonpartisan grassroots effort that supports immigrant and Latino communities, keeps a targeted boycott list and is also asking people to stop spending at certain companies “until they show us they care about our minority and immigrant populations of the United States”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskEconomicsProtestUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The catalyst wasDonald Trump’sinauguration. Many more Americans are planning to make similar decisionsthis Friday.Three billionaires: America’s oligarchy is now fully exposed | Robert ReichRead moreBedson made her move after seeing photos of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, sitting with other tech moguls and billionaires, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai, just rows behind Trump athis inauguration.“I just couldn’t stand to see them so cowardly,” Bedson, of Camas, Washington, told the Guardian. “I lived in Seattle for over a decade. I was a fan ofAmazonfor a long time, I think they have a good product. But I’m just so disgusted. I don’t want to give these billionaire oligarchs any more of my money.”It’s a sentiment that many Americans have been feeling since Trump entered the White House. Companies and business leaders who were once passive or vocally critical of Trump are now trying to cozy up to him, leading consumers to question the values of the brands they used to trust. A recentHarris pollfound that a quarter of American consumers have stopped shopping at their favorite stores because of shifting political stances.Many are being inspired by calls to boycott coming from social media.One boycotthas gone viral over the last few weeks: a “blackout” of companies that dropped some of their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals, including Target, Amazon and Walmart, is planned for 28 February with protesters planning to halt all spending at these corporations for the day.View image in fullscreenLauren Bedson canceled her Amazon Prime membership: ‘I don’t want to give these billionaire oligarchs any more of my money.’Photograph: Lauren BedsonBut people are also making the decision to boycott at their kitchen tables, trying to figure out how to resist Trump, and perhaps corporate capitalism at large, within their own communities.The Guardian asked readers how their shopping habits have changed over the last few months, as the political climate started to shift after Trump’s win. Hundreds from across the country said that they have stopped shopping at stores such as Walmart and Target that publicly announced the end of DEI goals. Dozens like Bedson had cancelled long held Prime accounts. Others have shut down theirFacebookand Instagram accounts in protest of Meta.“I’m just trying to do little things that make me feel a little bit empowered, to stake my claim against what’s happening and how companies are acting in ways that are opposed to my values,” said Kim Wohlenhaus, of St Louis, Missouri, who cancelled her Prime membership, deleted herMetaaccounts and has stopped shopping at Target. “It feels good to be able to do something.”Erica Bradley, of Reno, Nevada, said she stopped shopping at Target because of their changing DEI policies.“I don’t plan on going there ever again, just because I feel like they’ve shown that they’re not really committed to these things,” Bradley said. “They’ve lost my trust.”View image in fullscreenErica Bradley stopped shopping at Target: ‘I think we all have become very complacent or complicit … .’Photograph: Erica BradleyFor many consumers, the shift away from the big companies has revealed how much they have come to rely on them. As of last spring, 75% of American consumers had Amazon Prime memberships, a total of 180m Prime accounts, according toBloomberg.Bedson said cancelling her account made her aware of a culture of consumerism in American where “in some ways, it feels like we don’t have a choice”.“Amazon is so convenient,” she said. “I think we all have become very complacent or complicit, and it’s hard to make these changes. But on the other hand, what else can we do?”It’s been a year since Bradley cancelled her Prime account, after she saw Amazon’s union busting. She recalls a transition period as she was adjusting to life without Prime, but it ultimately led her to spend less overall.“I just decided I don’t really need a lot of these things. Like I don’t need more clothes, I don’t really need more house decorations, which are things I used to spend a lot of money on,” Bradley said. “It’s not retail therapy anymore.”The Harris poll found that a third of Americans are similarly trying to “opt out” of the economy, cutting down on overall spending as the political stances of corporations have become murky.View image in fullscreenKim Wohlenhaus deleted her Meta accounts: ‘We don’t care about your products as much as we care about values that we cherish.’Photograph: Kim Wohlenhaus“It’s like a Whac-a-Mole now,” Wohlenhaus said. “You could really look in any direction and find something you dislike about the way corporations are caving to this administration.”Wohlenhaus said she has started to prioritize shopping at local businesses. She kept her Costco membership, since the company affirmed its DEI policies.During Joe Biden’s presidency, many of the boycotts against companies actually came from conservatives who felt corporations were caving to a “woke” mob. But boycotts didn’t amount to any serious consequences – with two exceptions. Bud Light saw adrop in salesafter it sponsored a post by a transgender influencer and Target removed some of its Pride merchandise after conservative backlash.It’s unclear what the consequences of the current backlash will be. But Wohlenhaus and others voiced optimism that consumers are thinking critically about the choices they’re making at checkout.“Hopefully if thousands of other families are doing what we’re doing, I think they’ll start to feel it,” she said. “We don’t care about your products as much as we care about those values that we cherish.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsAmazonUS politicsWalmartRetail industryMetaFacebookfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No funds left the bank.The bank disclosed the “near miss” to the US Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.A transaction of $81tn (£64tn) would be so huge that it would be unlikely to go through any bank’s systems. It would have certainly gone down as one of the biggest ever fat finger errors, in which the wrong number is entered in a computer system.The sum would be more than enough to buy the entire US stock market, including all of the big tech companies, at a healthy premium. The US stock market wasvalued at $62tnat the end of 2024, according to the Current Market Valuation website.The amount would be also be enough to buy all of the assets of Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, more than 200 times over. His fortune is valued at $343bn, according to Bloomberg’s billionaires index.The total stock of global wealth was estimated at about $450tn by UBS last year. The total wealth of the UK wasestimatedat $16tn in 2022.A Citi spokesperson said: “Despite the fact that a payment of this size could not actually have been executed, our detective controls promptly identified the inputting error between two Citi ledger accounts and we reversed the entry. Our preventative controls would have also stopped any funds leaving the bank.“While there was no impact to the bank or our client, the episode underscores our continued efforts to continue eliminating manual processes and automating controls through our transformation.”It was not the first fat finger error for Citi, which has previously faced criticisms of its internal systems. In 2020 it accidentally sent $900m to creditors of the cosmetics company Revlon. It took two years of legal battles for the bank to recover much of the money from several hedge funds, and the saga contributed to the departure of the Citigroup chief executive, Michael Corbat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wanted to move away from American companies,” he said. “Canadians know Americans pretty well, and we don’t always agree with the choices that they make. A lot of us are disappointed, to put it mildly.”Making the switch has not been the easiest task: the two countries’ economies have been tightly bound through a longstanding free trade agreement since the late 1980s.But years of cross-border trade and investment has blurred the lines on country of origin: in the car manufacturing industry, for example, a vehicle passes the border an average of seven times during the manufacturing process.View image in fullscreenGraham Palmateer uses flour made with Ontario grain and cheese from Canadian suppliers.Photograph: Graham Palmateer/Gram’s PizzaThose attempting to impose a full boycott of consumer goods havebeen caught off-guardat grocery stores where “Made In Canada” products might contain some US ingredients.And while Canada’s political leaders have at times appeared to be flailing in their response to Trump’s threat,ordinary Canadians have decided to get their retaliation in early, and boycott American goods.A poll this month by the Angus Reid Institute published found that since Trump revived his threat of tariffs,four in five Canadians have been buying more Canadian products.Some grocery stores have even labeled which items are made by Canadian producers. Bar Sazerac in Hamilton, about an hour west of Toronto, is no longer using American alcohol in its menu.Palmateer said his transition to Canadian ingredients had some bumps initially. He had trouble sourcing Canadian diet soda, while some items, like mushrooms, are more expensive to source locally. Instead of Californian tomatoes, he opted for canned ones from Italy.But he has since gotten into the swing of things. He uses a Quebec-based company to source pepperoni, the flour he uses is made with Ontario grain and cheese is easy to source from Canadian suppliers.View image in fullscreenInstead of Californian tomatoes, Graham Palmateer uses canned ones from Italy and a Quebec-based company to source pepperoni.Photograph: Graham Palmateer/Gram’s PizzaThe cost of operating has increased slightly, “but by and large, I haven’t had to change pricing”, he said.Kenneth Wong, an associate professor at the business school at Queen’s University in Ontario, said he had been surprised by an apparently organic response among Canadian consumers: on a visit to his local grocery store, homegrown apples were sold out, while next to them, a bin of US apples appeared to be untouched.“Canadians are bearing down in ways I never thought they would,” he said.After appearing to relent on the tariff threat, Trump on Thursday repeated his intention to apply the levy on imports fromCanadaon Mexico from 4 March.The continuing uncertainty has prompted Canadian provinces to lift some internal trade barriers – a move which Wong said could somewhat reduce Canada’s strong reliance on the US.“And once that fully happens, tastes will change and habits will form. I’m not saying you can’t win back your consumer if you’re a US firm, but I am saying it’s going to be a lot more expensive to do so,” he said.Palmateer said his customer base seemed to be happy with his choice to shun American products. “It’s pretty much been positive. ‘Good for you’ kind of comments,” he said.One customer was upset they could no longer drink a Sprite with their Pizza. But Palmateer has since found Canadian soda brands like Sap Sucker which he hopes will fit the bill. Either way, he says he will not go back to using US ingredients.“This boycott … is my way of voting with my dollar,” he says. “If it encourages someone else to also do the same thing and divest, that’s a good step.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chinahit back swiftlywhen Trump imposed a 10% tariff on its exports earlier this month.TheTrump administrationhas repeatedly raised the threat of tariffs, vowing to rebalance the global economic order in the US’s favor. A string of announced measures have yet to be introduced, however, as economists and businesses urge officials to reconsider.The duties on imports from Canada and Mexico have beenrepeatedly delayed;modified levies on steel and aluminumwill not be enforced until next month, and a wave of “reciprocal” tariffs, trailed earlier this month, will not kick in before April.This week, the US presidentvowed to slap 25% tariffs on the EU, claiming the bloc was “formed to screw the United States”, although details remain sparse. Duties will be applied “generally”, Trump said, “on cars and all other things”.The prospect of escalating tariffs has already thrown the global economy into turmoil – with consumers expressing fears about inflation worsening and the auto sector possibly suffering if the US’s two largest trading partners in Canada andMexicoare slapped with taxes.The prospect of higher prices and slower growth could create political blowback for Trump.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsCanadaMexicoChinanewsShareReuse this content"

But the 76ers said there will be no more games for the star center in 2024-25.“The Philadelphia 76ers and Joel Embiid have been consulting with top specialists regarding ongoing issues with his left knee. After further evaluation, it has been determined that he is medically unable to play and will miss the remainder of the season to focus on treatment and rehabilitation,” the team said in a statement.The Trade™, three weeks on: Dončić, Davis and the art of the NBA breakupRead more“We are working with medical experts to determine the exact treatment plan and will update media when we have more information. The team and specialists will continue working with Joel to ensure the best path forward for his long-term health and performance.”One of the preseason favorites to contend for anNBAtitle, the Sixers take a nine-game losing streak into Saturday’s game against the Warriors. Even with the heavy slide, the Sixers were just two and a half games out of a spot in the play-in tournament entering Friday’s games.Embiid will miss his third straight game overall and hasn’t played since he was benched for ineffectiveness in the fourth quarter of a loss last Saturday to Brooklyn.The 76ers are 8-11 with Embiid this season; 12-27 without him.A two-time NBA scoring champion, Embiid has been hobbled by injuries all season, and served a three-game suspension for shoving a member of the media. He’s averaged 23.8 points – he averaged at least 30 and won two scoring titles the last three seasons – and scored only 29 points combined in his last two games.Embiid acknowledged earlier this month he may have to undergo another surgery on the left knee.“I think the straightforward answer is that when you’ve got something that’s inconsistent, at some point, you’ve got to do something about it,” Embiid said. “We don’t know what it is. We’re looking into every option.”He played just 39 games last season due to a torn meniscus in his left knee. The 76ers announced in early February of that season that he had undergone surgery. Embiid came back in early April, was part of the 76ers’ playoff run, and thenwon a gold medal with the US Olympic teamlast year at the Paris Games.Embiid said after the 76ers lost to Milwaukee on 9 February that he didn’t have enough time to recover after undergoing surgery last year.Embiid has played only 58 regular-season games and seven play-in tournament/playoff games since he earned NBA MVP honors in the 2022-23 season.The 76ers’ first-round pick is top-six protected or else it goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, one reason there was speculation the Sixers might shut down Embiid and cut their losses on the season.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia 76ersNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

But will Tank Davis ever put it on the line?The mercurial boxing savant returns to Brooklyn on Saturday with another big payday and signature knockout expected. But the real question is what comes nextBryan Armen Grahamin BrooklynFri 28 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 16.25 ESTShareGervonta Davis leaned back from the microphone, a slow grin creeping onto his face, brimming with the earned confidence of a man who’s seen this all before. “You know what I come to do, man,” the World Boxing Association’s lightweight champion said. “You know why I’m here. I don’t want to say too much. [His mother] is over there in the corner. Got to keep it polite, but y’all know:fireworks.”It was the same styling of laconic menace he’s dispensed at nearly every press conference before his fights, and yet it still sent a quiet ripple through the Barclays Center atrium on Thursday afternoon. Because when Davis says it, history has shown he’s standing on business. Thirty bouts, 30 wins, 28 knockouts. World titles at 130lb, 135lb and 140lb while selling out arenas from coast to coast. There’s a reason why the squat Baltimore southpaw nicknamed Tank has become the face of American boxing and one of its vanishingly few dependable box-office attractions. People don’t just pay to see him win. They tune in to see how he finishes the show.Ryan Garcia to headline Saudi-backed boxing card in New York’s Times SquareRead moreAnd once more Davis has promised them something worth watching. On Saturday night in Brooklyn, he will look to add another victim to the list when he defends his lightweight strap against Lamont Roach Jr, a super featherweight belt-holder moving up a division for a shot at a seismic upset. Granted special permission to retain his 130lb title while taking on Davis at 135, Roach has seized on the opportunity to turn the industry on its ear. “I’m here to boogie,” he said Thursday. “I got a big tool bag and I’m coming with everything in it.”The 29-year-old challenger from Washington DC is a capable operator with above-average hand speed and technical ability borne from a deep amateur background. He’s won six on the trot since his lone professional defeat to Jamel Herring in 2019, includingan upset by split decisionover Héctor Luis García to become a first-time world champion in 2023. But the steps up in weight and class he’ll make on Saturday have left most onlookers terribly pessimistic about his chances. Not least the oddsmakers, who have priced Davis as a vertiginous 1-20 favorite.The reality is that for Davis, this fight is just another showcase. Another sellout crowd, another headline event, another lucrative payday on Amazon Prime’s young pay-per-view platform. The $79.95 price tag won’t keep the fans away. Barclays will be packed, buzzing, waiting for the moment Tank finds his shot and shuts off the lights. That’s the expectation. The real question is what comes next.View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis, left, and Lamont Roach Jr pose for the cameras at Thursday’s final press conference ahead of their WBA lightweight championship fight in Brooklyn on Saturday night.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEven as the cheerier-than-normal Davis engaged in the typical pre-fight back-and-forth on Thursday with Roach, the conversation among boxing’s chattering class remained fixated on when he will finally take on one of the big names at or around the 135lb division, among them Devin Haney, Vasiliy Lomachenko and Shakur Stevenson. That question, or some version of it, has hung over Davis’ career for years with no resolution in sight. When Stevenson called him out directly over the weekend, urging Davis to make “the biggest fight in boxing” after hisclear but underwhelming winover Yorkshire electrician Josh Padley in Riyadh, Davis’ response to the three-weight champion wasopen ridicule.Still, even Tank’s most hardcore supporters are getting restless, more so as he’s started droppingincreasinglyfrequenthints at retirement. Davis’s résumé is filled with spectacular knockouts, but has he had the defining fight? The one that silences what doubters remain? The one that etches his name among the all-time greats? A high-profile stoppageof a weight-drained Ryan Garciatwo years ago was the closest thing to it. But none of Davis’ other 12 opponents in the eight years since he became a world champion have been considered serious threats by the sportsbooks.This weekend’s fight against Roach is expected to be another star vehicle. The chances that we’ll learn something about Gervonta Davis that we didn’t already know are minimal. No one will remember Tank years from now for how he handled another overmatched foe. They’ll remember him for the fight he hasn’t taken yet.And that’s what makes Saturday night feel like a stepping stone. A sold-out arena, a four-fight pay-per-view card stacked with title fights – Jose Valenzuela defending his WBA junior welterweight title against Gary Antuanne Russell, Alberto Puello putting his WBC 140lb belt on the line against Sandor Martín – but the whole night, every result, every highlight will just build toward the question Tank can’t escape.Davis has been here before. This will be his fourth time fighting at Barclays, but the first in nearly three years. The last time, in 2022, he knocked out Rolly Romero in six rounds, breaking the venue’s live gate record before a celebrity-flecked crowd including Madonna at ringside. The first, back in 2017, he won his first world title, stopping Jose Pedraza in seven. It’s a building that’s been good to him – he described it as a “second home” on Thursday – where so much of his professional story has been written.View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis has stopped all but two of his 30 professional opponents inside the distance.Photograph: Al Bello/Getty ImagesNow aged 30 and seemingly at the peak of his powers, Davis insists he’s looking to be more active in 2025. He was limited to one fight last year after a delicious unification bout with Lomachenko failed to materialize, but his plan is to fight three times this year – something he hasn’t done since 2019. That would be a welcome shift, but volume won’t replace legacy. If he wants to be remembered as an all-time great, he’ll have to take a fight that means more than just another knockout on his record.So far Davis’s shimmering brilliance inside the ropes has been enough to relegate a disturbing pattern of allegations and criminal charges – includingaccusations of domestic violence, multiple assault arrests, ahit-and-run crash in November 2020that left four people hospitalized including a pregnant woman, and an arrest just days before a major fight for allegedly striking a woman who was heard in a 911 call pleading for her life – to the margins of his narrative. He remains America’s problematic fave: the conservative back-of-the-napkin math suggests he’s amassed more than $65m in career earnings. Crucially, that financial security has made him one of the only A-list boxers in a position to resist the courtship of Turki al-Sheikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority, whose bottomless coffers have turned Riyadh into the sport’s epicenter in two short years.Someone asked Roach on Thursday if there was a chance his confidence in springing the upset was misplaced. “What am I supposed to say when they ask me questions?” he said, emotions rising. “What am I supposed to say? Oh, he’s going to [knock me out]? I’m going to say what I got to say. I know what I can do.”Davis just smiled, before interrupting the sound bite to infantilize his opponent. “You bring your mother,” he said, breaking a derisive grin.Maybe Roach will prove him wrong. Maybe Saturday night will be tougher than anyone expects and Ms Roach will get the last laugh. But the real fight isn’t this weekend. It’s the one waiting in the distance, whenever Davis decides to take it.Explore more on these topicsGervonta DavisBoxingUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The current incumbent has identified exactly where he can boost himself the mostAndrew LawrenceFri 28 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 04.02 ESTShareDonald Trump’s appearance at this year’s Daytona 500 was not subtle.Named the race’s grand marshal, the president buzzed the speedway from aboard Air Force One, dangling the world’s most advanced airliner above 150,000Nascarfans the way a parent humors an infant with a spoonful of baby food. Later, from the backseat of the presidential limousine, AKA The Beast, he paced the 41-car field around the oval track before the race. The sight of that 20,000lb machine sticking to the track’s banked lanes at 70 mph blew away the crowd all over again. “This is your favorite president,” he told the drivers via their in-car radio system. “I’m a really big fan of you people. You’re talented people and great people and great Americans.” The shock and awe spectacle couldn’t have been more fitting of a man who has been taking the country for a ride since he entered public life more than 50 years ago.Plenty of other US presidents have used sports to further their agendas. Football wouldn’t be America’s game without rabid sportsman Teddy Roosevelt stepping in tosave it from certain abolitionat the turn of the 20th century. Former Texas Rangers owner George W Bush put American resilience on display after 9/11 with hison-the-money first pitchto kick off Game 3 of the 2001 World Series at Yankee Stadium. For nine straight years Barack Obama – a basketball superfan – made a spring rite of picking his March Madness bracket live on ESPN, turning thoseBaracketology sessionsinto the hoops equivalent of FDR’s fireside chats.Trump at the Super Bowl: how the NFL’s culture war ended in surrenderRead moreWhile there’s no doubt that Trump is a genuine fan of some sports in the abstract, he doesn’t care as much about what sports can do for his country as he does what sports can do for him. Given his native New Yorker bona fides, you’d think he’d have staked out firm positions on the sports rivalries that dominate the city. But Trump’s only loyalty is to whoever’s running up front. After the Yankees won back-to-back World Series in the late 70s, Trump and team owner George Steinbrenner, baseball’s eternal autocrat, were inseparable. (Trump called “the Boss”his best friend.) When the Knicks became trendy in the 90s, Trump was courtside at Madison Square Garden betweenhis future second wife Marla Maples and actor Elliott Gould. Trump made himselfa fixture at the US Open for nearly four decades, less for the tennis than to be seen mingling with New York’s glitterati and Hollywood celebrities.The essence of fandom lies in the inevitable struggles in the path to glory. But Trump doesn’t do struggle or evenconcede defeat; that’s for the plebes, Jets and Mets junkies. He doesn’t indulge in true sports fandom. Heengages, in the cold, tech bro-y sense of the word – for the branding opportunity.He leaves the Super Bowl before the end of the game and bails on the Daytona 500 after11laps – 189 short of the full distance.His only struggle is with the concept of fair-weather fandom. He’s all about the sure thing. The attitude is about par for a golfer whose reputation asa shameless cheatputs him in league withKim Jong-iland other cult of personality authoritarians.Trump prefers nothing more than a “winner”. It’s why he touted quarterback Patrick Mahomes during the Kansas City Chiefs’three-peat run, and NFL owner Bob Kraft when his New England Patriots werethe league’s reigning dynasty; he praised Serena Williamsin similar termswhen she was at her most dominant on court. But you would be hard pressed to use the same word to describe Trump back when he was pursuing his own sports endeavors, before hopping on the politics bandwagon.In the 1980s and 90s Trump lured Mike Tyson and other heavyweights to his Atlantic City casino in a failed attempt to upstage the Las Vegas scene. His casinosultimately went bankrupt, andAtlantic City fell into economic ruin. In 1983 he bought a franchise in the upstart United States Football League expressly to force a merger with the NFLonly to wind up collapsing the younger league. In 2014, Trump came up a half-a-billion dollars shortof buying the NFL’s Buffalo Bills. He has said that if he owned the team, he likely never would have run for president. You can drive yourself mad thinking of the pain and distress a crowdfunding campaign might have spared the world.But Trump’s loser history was mostly forgotten once he achieved power and began flexing it. And his strongman image has only benefited from his associations with self-proclaimed tough guys like UFC president Dana White, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul and former NFL star Herschel Walker – whom Trump recentlyappointed ambassador to the Bahamas. The past two months have seen Trump steal focus from the college football championship and the Super Bowl, which he mostly used as an excuse totroll Taylor Swift.The more he makes sports his bully pulpit, the more the actual protagonists in the arena feel compelled to kiss the ring. Ten months ago McLaren F1 boss Zak Brown was the one falling over himself while guiding then-candidate Trump on aVIP tour of the Miami Grand Prix. Earlier this month PGA Tour commissioner Jay MonahanimploredTrump to moderate the merger negotiations between his circuit and the Saudi-backed LIV Golf, which wouldenrich the family business. “One doesn’t know if he is acting as president of the United States or simply as a businessman, in trying to promote this merger,” US representative Jamie Raskintold the Washington Post, nodding at the millions Trump has collected from both organizations through his golf properties.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s presidential limousine led the pace lap at this year’s Daytona 500.Photograph: Daniel Torok/White House/Planet Pix/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockMost recently, Team USA general manager Bill Guerin beseeched the president to attend the NHL’s 4 Nations final between the US and Canada amid rising tension between the countries over trade tariffs. “We have a room full of proud American players and coaches and staff,” Guerintold Fox News. “And listen, we’re just trying to represent our country the best way we can.”But there’s good reason why Team USA ultimately had to settle for a phone call from the president whereas the Daytona 500 crowd got the full presidential parade: Nascar is a more influential crowd for Republican presidents. In 1984 Ronald Reagan became the first of four sitting presidents to attend the Great American Race, and every one since has been a Republican. George W Bush, who attended 12 years after his father, owes his two terms in office in large part toNascar Dads trooping out to the polls. In 2006 vice-president Dick Cheney dida flyover in Air Force Twobefore taking a lap around the track in his motorcade, setting the template for Trump’s grand entrance this year.At the last Daytona 500 I coveredin 2017, weeks after Trump was sworn in for his first term, Trump-Pence campaign signs, bumper stickers and flags proliferated in the Daytona infield. Three years later he turned up for his first stint as race grand marshal. That’s a lot of attention by proximity for a sports league that’s fallen in popularity from its Bush-era peak. But you wonder if everyone inside Nascar corporate is totally comfortable with it.Nascar, after all, has spent the better part of the past 30 years trying to convince the public that it is adiverse, equitable and inclusive sportin spite of its homogeneous presentation and good ol’ boy heritage in the deep south. When Bubba Wallace, Nascar’s only Black Cup series driver, called on the sport’s governing bodyto ban displays of the confederate flag, he was inundated with abuse and death threats. But since Nascar acquiesced to his demand in 2020,over Trump’s forceful objections, the sport has kept pushing toward progress.Michael Jordan and Pitbull have joined Nascar as team owners. Kyle Larson, the sport’s only driver of Asian descent, cruised to the 2021 Cup championship in what was a victory for Drive for Diversity – the quarter-century old Nascar program tasked with bringing more women and minorities into the sport. (Never mind if Larson hadn’t exactly helped racial progress by getting suspended for most of the 2020 season after using the N-word on a live stream.) It’s not hard to imagine Trump taking aim at Drive for Diversity if he detects the slightest hint of disloyalty from Nascar. With Trump literally leading the bandwagon, what else can Nascar do but follow dutifully behind?But playing ball with Trump comes at a cost, especially now that he’s the president again – even if the leagues themselves don’t pick up the tab. The Super Bowl trip to New Orleans is estimated to have set taxpayers back at least $1m. His Daytona 500 drop-in could cost 10 times as much. Some X users, doing the quick math on Air Force One’shourly operation rate, reckon that $25,000 alone was burned on jet fuel when Air Force One buzzed the speedway. Between the lavish engagements at sporting events and themillions he pocketed from playing golf at his own courses, it’s a wonder anyone believes him when he talks about cracking down on government waste and fraud.Authenticity has always been a prime selling point of sports, but that’s not why Trump’s in the game. For him, sports are just another venue for his singular brand of ego stroking. Wherever the lights are brightest, you can bet Trump will find some way to make a spectacle of himself.Explore more on these topicsSportUS sportsNascarNFLMotor sportDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe don’t hold your breathTennis has been awash for nearly 60 years with stellar rivalries, especially on the men’s side. But it’s becoming clear the next great one might not be around the cornerTim JoyceFri 28 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 10.22 ESTShareThe Australian Open exists on its own in the tennis calendar at the start of the year – not really connected to what came before or what ensues immediately after; it’s nearly five months removed from both the US Open that precedes it and the French Open that follows it. For most followers of the sport, the real start of the calendar year tennis season, for both men and women, is the PNB Paribas event at Indian Wells, which starts on Wednesday. Long considered the sport’s “fifth slam”, the tournament starts a torrid nonstop stretch of seven months of intense competition. As this long winter slowly loses its grip on the country, fans will revel in watching the best men and women competing under the hot desert sun.But, unfortunately, the men’s side of the draw will be somewhat lacking because of the absence of Jannik Sinner, due tohis three-month ban from competitionfor his “inadvertent” doping. Sinner will be able to resume playing on 4 May, in time for the Italian Open and then Roland Garros.For such a high-profile event to lose the No 1 male player deprives the fans of a possible showdown between Sinner andCarlos Alcaraz. And while Alexander Zverev currently holds the second position in the rankings and is now viewed as the “best player to never win a slam”, there’s no question that the rivalry to watch in this current era in the sport will be between Sinner and Alcaraz – they are indisputably the two best players in the world. As it stands now Alcaraz leads their head-to-head meetings, six matches to four. Alcaraz also owns more slam titles (four) than Sinner (three).Tennis doesn’t have the luxury that team sports do when it comes to rivalries. When the Red Sox and Yankees play, for example, there’s always an extra jolt of energy no matter their respective places in the standings. They could be mired in the AL East cellar but the game would still have extra import due to their storied and fierce rivalry; the same is true with the Celtics and Lakers, or Eagles and Cowboys or any number of NHL, NBA, NFL or MLB rivalries.For better or worse, rivalries in tennis are solidified and defined by grand slam encounters. While Sinner and Alcaraz have met at major tournaments on several occasions, they’ve yet to contest a slam final – or, for that matter, even a Masters 1000 final.Tennis has been awash for nearly 60 years with stellar rivalries, especially on the men’s side. Since the open era commenced in 1968, there’s been a nearly uninterrupted run of rivalries: the Australians – Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe – until the early 70s; then the Jimmy Connors-Bjorn Borg-John McEnroe duels; followed by the oft-overlooked mid-to-late-80s period when Ivan Lendl, Mats Wilander, Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker routinely competed against each other for majors; then Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi’s rivalry defined the 90s. And finally, of course, there is the 20-year period that just ended, inarguably the greatest rivalry era in the history of the sport with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. To state the obvious, the tennis fan has been spoiled.One of many aspects that made the Federer-Nadal-Djokovic encounters so intriguing is that they contested so many slam finals on all surfaces. This was most certainly a rare thing. Consider how McEnroe and Connors never could consistently go deep at the French Open or how Lendl struggled mightily on grass and Sampras also never could master the red dirt.It’s too early to tell of course how the Alcaraz-Sinner rivalry will develop. At this point it would appear that Alcaraz has the clear edge since he is far more suited to all-surface play than is Sinner. With his astounding movement and ability to hit any shot from any location on the court, Alcaraz is the one player on tour who isn’t mowed down by the brute force of the Sinner forehand. It’s also worth noting that Djokovic has contested two slam finals with Alcaraz, including one of the best matches of recent memory, at the 2023 Wimbledon final. If it wasn’t for his inevitable and impending retirement, the Djokovic-Alcaraz rivalry was already more luminous than that of Alcaraz and Sinner.The question going forward: who will be that younger, key third player to challenge the supremacy of Alcaraz and Sinner? At this point no one has emerged in that position as the yawning gap between Alcaraz-Sinner and the rest of the field is only growing. American Ben Shelton, who is working on adding greater consistency off the ground to balance his serving prowess looks to be a prime candidate. Another player who many believe will be the next threat to the top is Joao Fonseca. While the 18 year-old Brazilian has only made the main draw of a slam once (2025 Australian Open), there appears to be consensus among the tennis cognoscenti that Fonseca and his preternaturally powerful groundstrokes will undoubtedly be the next big thing in the sport.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka, left, and Iga Świątek are the two best players in the world and have met 12 times. But, remarkably, only one of those encounters occurred at a slam.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesFor the women, the situation is entirely opposite of the men, as there hasn’t been a consistent, must-watch rivalry in nearly 30 years, since Steffi Graf and Monica Seles had their epic encounters. And prior to the Graf-Seles battles, there was the most storied women’s rivalry of all time: Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. The two played an unbelievable 80 times between 1973 and 1988 and, more incredibly, 60 of those matches were finals.Yes, Venus and Serena created drama whenever they played due to their outsized personalities and singularly extraordinary impact on the sport, but there was never a true rivalry since Serena utterly dominated Venus, claiming 18 out of their final 25 matches. And many of their tussles were one-sided.So many different women have won slam titles the last several years that if one were to ask a tennis journalist to name, say, all the women slam winners since 2020 I doubt any of them would be able to correctly answer that query. Is this parity proof that there are so many talented women players? Undoubtedly. But this parity has robbed the women of having more must-see matches.Part of this can be attributed to the overly similar style of play that predominates amongst women players. Varying styles of play is critical in enriching a rivalry in tennis, as the Evert-Navratilova pairing illustrates. Power has overtaken the women’s game just as much – if not more – than the men and there has been a paucity of players who can play an all-court style of play. There have been a few players over the last 20 years – Justine Henin and the recently retired Ash Barty spring to mind – that have bucked the trend and utilized finesse just as much as power. But for the most part the women’s game is about power: seeSabalenka, Aryna.Sabalenka and Iga Świątek are the two best players in the world and have met 12 times. But, remarkably, only one of those encounters occurred at a slam. That is partly due to the fact that Świątek, in the slams at least, dominates on clay, as her four French titles shows (she also owns a US Open title (2022) . Meanwhile, Sabalenka’s three slams have all come on hard courts.But the women do have a rivalry advantage over the men since there is clearly a third player in the mix: 2023 US Open winnerCoco Gauff. And each of the three possess different games. Świątek’s is built on footwork, patience and consistency; Sabalenka’s on pure power; and Gauff’s mental strength and competitive acumen is just as impressive as her backhand and foot speed. It would appear now that Gauff, who will turn 21 during Indian Wells, and Swiatek, 24, would be the two to start a compelling, slam-heavy rivalry since they’re both younger than Sabalenka (27 in May). And while Świątek holds a commanding 11-3 lead in their meetings, Gauff has taken their last two matches.Further, each of these three will be looking to overcome recent difficulties and return to their top form at Indian Wells: Swiatek, who is wanting to put the stress of her doping suspension behind her and play her best tennis again; Sabalenka is looking to rebound after her tough Australian Open final loss to American Madison Keys; and Gauff, who after winning the year-end WTA championships in November, has struggled tremendously since the Australian Open.With the absence of Sinner, there will be an opportunity for several men hoping to make a huge breakthrough at Indian Wells, proving that they can challenge Alcaraz at one of the biggest events and maybe become part of the conversation going forward at the majors. And for the women it looks to be an opportunity for a rivalry among the aforementioned top three players to crystallize into must-see viewing.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsCarlos AlcarazJannik SinnerIga SwiatekCoco GauffAryna SabalenkafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, four points off fifth place in the Premier League and with a last-16 tie with Club Brugge to relish on Tuesday, all ­feasible ­targets remain on the table.FA Cup fifth round: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreCardiff, six points above the ­relegation zone in the Championship, made Villa work hard for their win but Asensio, on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, was delighted to convert another assist from Marcus Rashford and one from Leon Bailey.Rashford remains in search of his first goal for Villa, and spurned a ­couple of very convertible ­opportunities here but, since he made his Villa debut after joining on loan from Manchester United, no ­Premier League player has created more than his 13 chances.“Marcus is a top player,” ­Asensio said. “We are together not so much but I know what he wants to do, where he passes and I am very happy to have Marcus and all of the teammates.”Emery revealed that part of gambit to entice Asensio to Villa was that he would play in his preferred position. “He’s adapting very well and has a very good opportunity with us here to play as a 10,” the Villa manager said. “He decided in the last window to join us because we planned for him to play in his best position. He’s ­showing us his qualities to link through him with our midfield, ­strikers and ­wingers and has the capacity to score goals too.”The game was preceded by a ­celebration in memory of Peter ­Whittingham, who died five years ago this March after a career in which he represented both these teams with distinction.The 6,500 Cardiff fans, in ­particular, were in fine voice for this rarified occasion. But with John McGinn and Youri Tielemans ­anchoring the Villa midfield, the game soon settled into attack versus defence mode. This made ­penetrating a low block ­challenging, and the ­Cardiff goalkeeper Ethan Horvath performed superbly throughout.Having only returned to the ­Cardiff team for their 1-0 win over Hull City on Tuesday, after the first-choice, Jak Alnwick, was ruled out for the ­season with a hamstring injury, the pick of the American goalkeeper’s saves came from Leon Bailey’s ­piledriver and Ollie Watkins’s point-blank ­volley in the first half and from Rashford’s powerful effort early in the second.“He was brilliant,” Omer Riza, the Cardiff manager, said. “He’s had to show real patience and a great ­character and application [and] had to wait for his chance because Jak’s had a real good season as well. He produced a great performance and deserves all the accolades he gets this evening.”Rashford, it has been reported, has made his mind up he wants to turn his loan from Manchester United into a permanent deal this summer. Although he has impressed to some degree with flashes of his outstanding talent in his first month at Villa Park, he will want to finesse his ­scoring technique if the admiration is to be as strongly mutual. When Bailey got to the byline and flashed over a cross to the far post, Rashford failed to set himself properly and wafted his ­volley over the bar from six yards out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Yousef Salech’s effort from Perry Ng’s cross had squirmed past Emiliano Martínez, the roof might have come off the visitors’ stand.Instead the Villa fans were ­celebrating moments later as ­Asensio gave the Premier League side the lead. Tielemans spotted ­Rashford’s run and lofted his pass into the left channel perfectly for the England striker to square a pass first time for his fellow loanee to half-volley home.The clinching goal arrived 10 ­minutes from time when Bailey pulled a cross back from the right byline and, after Watkins ­dummied, the former Real Madrid forward ­slotted the ball calmly into the ­bottom corner.Explore more on these topicsFA CupAston VillaCardiff Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As soon as he let it go, I said, ‘That’s in,’” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “I just felt it, and I thought that set the tone for the second half.”Curry then came back out and outscored the Magic 22-21 in the third quarter of his 1,000th regular-season start.“A lot of guys contributed to the win,” Curry said, “but it’s nice to have a flurry like that and have fun with it.”Curry scored 56 points in Golden State’s 121-115 victory over Orlando on Thursday night.It was Curry’s 14th game of 50 or more points and he moved past Patrick Ewing into 26th place on the NBA’s career scoring list with with 24,867 points. He hit 12 for 19 from three-point range, making 10 or more for the NBA-record 26th time in his career. The 56 points fell six short of his career high.“It never gets old watching it, I can tell you that,” Kerr said. “I think the fans here tonight, even the Magic fans, they know they’re witnessing the greatest shooter ever, and one of the greatest performers ever. It’s not just the shots going in, it’s the fluidity and the beauty of his motion, and the audacity, the shots he’s willing to take.”Including the 50-footer just before the break that gave the Warriors some sorely needed momentum going into the locker room.“In the first half we had nothing going and he just kind of kept us afloat,” Draymond Green said. “And he continued that in the third quarter, completely took the game over.”Curry fell one shy of his career high for three-pointers and added to his legacy of big performances on 27 February. He scored 54 points with 11 three-pointers against the Knicks in 2013 and 46 against the Thunder in 2016 with 12 threes.View image in fullscreenStephen Curry hit 12 for 19 shots from three-point range on Thursday night, making 10 or more for the NBA-record 26th time in his career.Photograph: Fernando Medina/NBAE/Getty Images“When you have nights like these, you get them in all different types of ways ... because you’re in the rhythm and the flow and the ball is finding you at the right time,” Curry said. “But you’ve got to have the footwork, the balance, the confidence to shoot it no matter what, no matter how they come, and be ready for your moment.“So I practice all of ’em, and on some nights it just flows.”He gave his jersey afterward to his mother who was sitting in the stands, an easy toss from just a few feet away.But this night was all about what Curry can do from deep.“I try pretty much every shot at some point, just to let your creativity kind of flow,” Curry said. “It’s a way to have fun and kind of test your range, to see the ball go in from all the places on the court.”Explore more on these topicsStephen CurryGolden State WarriorsOrlando MagicNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

On Friday, the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain, the seven-time champion doubled down against his detractors, saying the comments only encourage him to prove them wrong.Lewis Hamilton dismisses ‘older, white men’ criticising his move to FerrariRead more“In our sport criticism is something that everyone receives,” he said. “I have probably received a lot more of it perhaps throughout my career but I just keep my head down, doing what I’m doing. I know that I’m growing each day, I’m bound to make mistakes, I’m only human but one thing that I’m proud of is I have a drive, a focus.“I’m able to admit when I’m wrong and I know that tomorrow I will work to be better and it really doesn’t matter to me some of the comments that have come up over my career, it’s not just been these past 12 months or so. I use that as fuel.”The 40-year-old is entering his debut season withFerrariafter 12 years and six drivers’ titles at Mercedes, sparking unprecedented levels of interest but also attracting debate and criticism. Hamilton is comfortable with his decision, insisting he is motivated like never before, and relishing the challenge of adapting to a new team and the challenge of attempting to win a record-breaking eighth world championship.With the three days of testing concluding on Friday, he confirmed he had settled in well at Ferrari and that he felt the sort of confidence in the car he had not experienced in recent years.Since regulation changes in 2022, Mercedes failed repeatedly to get to grips with the new challenge consistently, while Red Bull were dominant and McLaren and Ferrari have been able to bring their cars into the fight. Hamilton has said previously he was able to tell if a car would be a handful from the opening outings, as was the case with some recent Mercedes iterations.His gut feeling about the Ferrari SF25 and how his new team are operating, however, was overwhelmingly enthusiastic. “I would say this is the most positive feeling that I’ve had in a long time,” he said of the car. “I feel like in this period of time we’ve built a really good foundation but everyone, you know these guys out there, look really, really quick, really competitive.“It looks very very close. We won’t know obviously until next week truly, exactly where we stand but we know that we’ve got work to do and everyone is just heads down and I’ve been really inspired and really encouraged by my colleagues.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the afternoon Hamilton had an issue with his car which curtailed his running while George Russell claimed the top spot with a late quick run for Mercedes, from Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, the Williams of Alex Albon and the McLaren of Oscar Piastri.It was the latter team that really caught the eye across the three days with McLaren appearing to have immense pace in race simulations and with a very strong, consistent platform with which to start the season. Early days still but the team may finally be quick out of the blocks when the first race of the season takes place in Melbourne on the weekend of 16 March.Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Maksym Talovierov, known as Maxi, is detailing the sobering reality of life sinceRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “It’s really hard because for three years every morning I wake up and I see a lot of notifications about rockets and missiles in every city, including Kyiv, where my parents are,” the Plymouth defender says. “I text them immediately to see how they’re doing. ‘Are you in the [underground] car park? Are you in the metro?’ Because when they [Russia] are bombing and it’s dangerous, that’s where they go because they are the closest things to safe zones.”The 24-year-old has not seen his mother, Maryna, and father, Vadym, a former professional footballer, for three and a half years. “Sometimes they might not have a connection or wifi and then it’s stressful because they don’t respond and you don’t know what’s going on. On the news it might say: ‘In this area of Kyiv, five rockets.’ But you never know exactly where.Miron Muslic: ‘Real life is a lot more difficult than playing a football game’Read more“Yeah,” Talovierov says, taking a breath, “it’s a really hard situation. Some of our soldiers are my friends, friends of friends, parents of international teammates. They joined the army to help our country and I appreciate it a lot.”There will be 7,800 Plymouth fans in the away end at Manchester City on Saturday evening keen to show Talovierov support in theFA Cupfifth round. He has already felt the love around the place he now calls home. He tells a story about a couple sparing him a wasted walk into the city centre to create a bank account. “About 50 metres before the bank I realised that I forgot my passport,” he says. “Some fans who recognised me and wanted to have a picture said: ‘If you need anything, we can always help you.’ So I said: ‘Guys, can you please drop me to my hotel and back because I forgot my passport?’ The man moved to the back seat: ‘Maxi, sit here in the front seat, my wife will drop you back.’ They shared a lot of stories about the history of the club and the city during these five minutes in the car.”The ponytailed centre-back, a £1.4m buy from the Austrian club Lask, has earned cult-hero status among Plymouth supporters in the 28 days since he became the Championship club’s record signing. He completed his medical at Home Park at midnight, signed his contract at 1am and returned for training hours later. His debut came the next day in a victory against West Brom. Before his man-of-the-match performance he limbered up by doing press-ups in the tunnel and during the game he toasted perfectly timed challenges with double fist-pumps. “This match will be in my head until my last days. The following evening I was just walking around the streets and fans were screaming at me: ‘Maxi! Maxi!’ I had a hat on so I don’t even know how they realised it was me.”View image in fullscreenMaksym Talovierov tackles Liverpool’s Luis Díaz in Plymouth’s famous FA Cup win.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersThere were more hulking celebrations after thwarting Luis Díaz and Kostas Tsimikas when Plymouthshocked Liverpool in the previous round. The council lit Smeaton’s Tower on Plymouth Hoe in a green hue to mark the occasion.“Sometimes I don’t remember doing it [celebrating] … then I see videos when scrolling TikTok or Instagram reels and I’m surprised: ‘Ooo, I don’t remember.’ I don’t even recognise that it’s me. I might remember the tackle but not the celebration. I really like that it comes from my soul. When the fans cheer, it just goes inside of me,” he says, slowly raising both hands towards his chest. “I don’t think about it before games: ‘When I defend, I will scream.’ No, I’m very emotional on the pitch. You never know when it will come to you.”Another Plymouth defender, Nikola Katic, lost one of his front teeth in the heat of battle against Liverpool, though the groundsman discovered it post-match. “But I think he was still happy … we were all laughing about it. Niko is a warrior; he doesn’t worry about these things. After the game I slept a few hours because I was so tired and then all night I couldn’t sleep because of this adrenaline in my head. I think we didn’t even have enough energy to celebrate much because we were so tired. Against teams like Liverpool you have to be concentrated, focused all the time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My parents lost their business in Donetsk because it was captured and moved to Kyiv to help me.”Now Vadym, who watched one of his son’sgames at Euro 2024from the safety of a Kyiv underground station while Russia bombed the city, works as Talovierov’s analyst. “He is preparing a lot of information about the [opposition] strikers, my strengths, my weaknesses, good and bad things. From the age of seven, he was at every training session, he would join in the training and then just watch, analyse and on the way home from the stadium he would highlight good moments, bad moments and the things I needed to improve. Sometimes I was really angry because when you’re a teenager listening to advice you think you’re always right. Now I understand how important it was.”A possible duel with Haaland awaits. “A few months ago I played on the PlayStation as Haaland and as them [City]. Last year I played Fifa more and I really loved him because I played a lot with him in my Ultimate Team.” For Talovierov, the ultimate inspiration is Virgil van Dijk, whom he played against whenLask faced Liverpoolin the Europa League in 2023-24. After Talovierov missed out on Van Dijk’s shirt in Austria, the Dutchman promised to give him his shirt at Anfield.Preston and Burnley’s FA Cup clash evokes memories of a golden ageRead moreVan Dijk stayed true to his word. “One of my teammates wanted to take the jersey from Virgil but Virgil said: ‘No, no, no, because I promised Maxi,’ and he pointed at me. I was really surprised because it was two months later and imagine how many players ask Virgil for his jersey. He showed me the person I want to be in a few years, and that if I promise something, I will do it.”Talovierov is one of several Ukraine internationals flying the flag for their country in England, including Illia Zabarnyi at Bournemouthand Oleksandr Zinchenko at Arsenal. He is good friends with Mykhailo Mudryk of Chelsea. “I know [Andriy] Shevchenko and Zinchenko created a charity match [Game4Ukraine] at Stamford Bridge. I know Mudryk helps a lot but you will not find it in newspapers. I don’t know one player who doesn’t want to help. Everyone does their maximum to help.”Talovierov is softly spoken but makes his point. “Of course, every day is so hard and sometimes you try to find a few things to make you smile a bit. It would be easy to be serious and think about the war all the time but then you can destroy yourself mentally. Hopefully it will finish as fast as possible and we will win. It will finish how we want. Hopefully.”Explore more on these topicsPlymouth ArgyleFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

OK then. That sounds, on balance, like astrong disapprove. Although to be fair the walk from New Cross can be a bit bleak at this time of year.The great days of anthropologically vital city-centre rumbles may be long gone, but there is unlikely to be a shortage of this kind of stuff any time soon.A search of the study archive Jstor reveals a tally of 316 academic papers containing the words “Millwall Football Club”, from Princeton Press to the Journal of Arts, from Joshua Sofaer’s Dramaturgies of Interference in Public Space, to Supporters et Hooligans en Grande-Bretagne Depuis 1871, to the University of New England pamphlet quoted above, which does, as pamphlets go, slightly take the fun out of shouting at people and waving your arms around on a foggy Tuesday night in Bermondsey.‘He treated us like idiots’: the crypto mogul and a bitter battle over Bedford’s football clubsRead moreBy way of comparison, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City, holders down the years of 49 league titles, have racked up a mere 304 papers between them. Millwall have barely disturbed the waters of elite competition during their 140-year existence, have never played in the Premier League or won a major cup, but there remains an undying fascination with the club’s identity.Above all with the urge to locate a unique and definitive kind of footballing darkness there. No one likes us. Apart, it seems, from social science academics looking for a little red meat to go with the dry stuff. As Millwall prepare to travel to Selhurst Park for Saturday’s Windrush Line derby, south London will no doubt be crawling once again with leather-satchelled seekers after truth. And to be fair this is a brilliantly well-matchedFA Cupfifth-round tie, for legitimate footballing reasons.View image in fullscreenA Millwall fan holding a scarf emblazoned with the club’s famous motto.Photograph: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty ImagesPalace are in buoyant form, solidly placed in the league and a potent presence in this side of the draw. Millwall are safely lodged in the Millwall Zone of the past few seasons, eternally six to eight points off the Championship playoffs. It seems fair to say Saturday’s Cup tie is the biggest event in the calendar for either of these teams as the season starts to narrow to its end point.Plus there is, of course, another hyper-specific London rivalry to be played out. For Millwall supporters enemy No 1 will always be West Ham. This makes cultural sense. The Dockers derby has its roots in wharf tensions on the River Thames, the days when those people from just across the river were literally taking money, work, loading contracts off your own kitchen table.Millwall have a more slow-burn relationship with their various south London neighbours. There is a famous scene to this effect in the reputationally disastrous 1977 Panorama film about football hooliganism, mention of which is likely to bring longsuffering groans from supporters of a certain age.View image in fullscreenFans on the pitch during the riot at the Den during the 1978 FA Cup quarter-final between Millwall and Ipswich.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesAt one point the mass of Millwall’s away support is shown travelling north for a game at Sunderland, while a minority of “faces” (“the real nutters, self-confessed loonies like Harry the Dog”) choose instead to infiltrate the nearest neutral ground for “a ruck”. This is a prelude to 12 undercover Millwall fans sparking a 2,000-person riot in the Tottenham away section, at least according to the blokes filmed talking about it afterwards in the pub, and gleefully parroted by the BBC narration.The hosts on that occasion were Charlton. But Selhurst Park, a few miles south, would have done just as well. There is a very specific kind of animosity between Millwall and Palace. Often football hatred has no real content. It is simply self-sustaining tribalism. This one is at least interesting for its almost imperceptible notions of class. These are both blue-collar London clubs. But from the Millwall perspective, or at least to the enduring Millwall sense of self as inner London, dock-based, authentic, Palace fans are Stripey Nigels from the Surrey borders, lower middle class, nasal, Croydon-not-London, a fanbase of Southgates.From the opposite end Millwall fans are, as ever, seen as feral teenagers in market stall jumpers, disenfranchised urban litter, primary school dropouts, avatars of amorality. How much of this is real? Almost none of it. These things exist only in cartoon form. Bermondsey, with its plastic new-build high rises, is no longer crammed with the descendants of dockers. The housing market has made sure of this. The diaspora often comes in from Kent and beyond now.With this in mind it is worth remembering that had things gone differently a few years back there is a chance Millwall’s first trip to Selhurst Park since 2012 (2-2 draw; 20-year-old Chris Wood in the Millwall team) would no longer even qualify as a derby.It is still extraordinary that the Battle for Millwall’s Car Park created such heat. It came from a compulsory purchase shemozzle involving Lewisham council that the club considered at one point might threaten its existence in the borough.At which point strange noises off began emerging. The chosen developer for the council’s housing project was owned by a mysterious Panama-based trust. Who actually owned the land or the company? Why was the previous mayor of Lewisham, Dave Sullivan, mixed up historically with a developer benefiting from decisions being made by the (then) current mayor of Lewisham, Steve Bullock?All allegations of impropriety were denied, and were never backed by any hard evidence. Still, wild rumours skirled, talk of nefarious involvement and outlandish connections.The story went around the worldbecause of Millwall’s brand, that compelling biggest-small-club-in-the-world energy, and the link with gentrification, misuse of power, land grabs.The whole thing collapsed in the end and then resurrected itself. A new plan with the developers was glossed. The ground will now be surrounded, but not displaced, by even taller plastic residential towers, extra space clawed out of the air not the land.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the club is safely moored now and there is a new kind of energy about the place. There was genuine sadness at the death in 2024 of John Berylson, a much-loved owner. His son has taken over the role.The most significant development for the club isthe granting of a new super-long leaseon its land by the council, a gamechanger for anyone with the will to redevelop, either now or after some oft-rumoured future sale.It isn’t hard to see why Millwall could be attractive to purchasers. This is one of the last remaining unmodernised, un-flushed-out corners of inner London. Bermondsey has been called many things down the years, from Biscuit Town (home of Peek Freans), to London’s Larder, to Target Area G in the Luftwaffe playbook. New Bermondsey, the latest version, has not yet taken shape. The Greggs still has a security guard outside. The magnificently craning rubbish incinerator is still dispersing its particulates.View image in fullscreenMillwall successfully fought off a compulsory purchase order from Lewisham council in 2017.Photograph: Ben Queenborough/BPI/ShutterstockBut money is already acting on neglected squares of land around the ground. Thrillingly uncluttered architects’ drawings have been circulating of a redeveloped version of the club’s site, as they have since the impossible dream of a Super Den (an Asda! A bowling alley!) in the 1970s.The club will at least be present while this happens and there is a sense of general renewal. Steve Kavanagh, the long-serving chief executive, was among those to leave last year. Steve Gallen has come in as an interventionist director of football. The new training ground has coincided with a sense of talent rising through the ranks.This is where Saturday’s opponents provide a kind of model. South London has become an obvious talent factory in the past 10 years, the concrete Catalonia, a three-million strong population stretching into the Croydon hinterlands of ambition, cage-ball and well-run academies. Palace have been efficient in channelling this. The academy building looms up like an alien hangar as south London merges into Kent south of Sydenham.There are some signs Millwall have begun to draw on that same pool. The academy is said to be flourishing. Romain Esse is the obvious point of interest before Saturday’s game, a homegrown club record sale to Palace in the last transfer window. Tellingly, there was no real sense of outrage when Esse made the switch. The money is good. This is how the club can grow and feed itself. Local kids in the team, a connection to its ownterroir. It is a happy model for a club that has at times in the past seemed a little isolated on its peninsula.It is to be hoped Saturday can pass off peacefully. There is always something in these games, not to mention an unusually large ratio of media observers present to report the details. The last couple of meetings have brought some moments of friction and a little performative teenage hooliganism.This time the spectacle itself should be quite enough. Millwall play a relatively fluent style of football under Alex Neil in front of the solid defensive heart of Jake Cooper and a flourishing Japhet Tanganga. Palace have won seven of their past nine and have Jean-Philippe Mateta on a run of seven goals in that time. For both these clubs there is a sense of life and regeneration in whatever form, as disappointing as that news might be for the Death Drive Freudian Masochism crowd.Explore more on these topicsMillwallCrystal PalaceFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The club represent a pretty village an hour’s drive south of Oslo, fielding teams from the under-14 age group down. Their goals are modest but of the kind that nourish an entire sport: to provide a safe and welcoming environment in which the community’s youngsters can play. There are hurdles to overcome, such as a need for up-to-date artificial pitches and the challenge of increasing participation among girls.On Saturday afternoon, though, Skoppum and Norway’s 1,700 grassroots clubs will be asked to make a decision that could cause shockwaves far beyond their country. They will gather online or at Oslo’s Ullevaal Stadion for the Norwegian Football Federation’s (NFF) annual general assembly and are entitled to vote on whether video assistant referees are scrapped in the highest division, Eliteserien. It will conclude a saga that has ripped at the domestic game’s fabric. The top two tiers have voted for the technology to be discontinued but, in the final stage of an outwardly democratic process that many believe has been the opposite, the clubs whose lives it barely touches are in effect tasked with the final say.Norway on verge of abolishing VAR from domestic leagues after club voteRead more“It surprises us that we’re being dragged into this,” the Skoppum chairman, Kenneth Laumb, says. “It’s something that only affects the top clubs in Norway. We appreciate that there’s a democracy in Norwegian football where clubs, even of our size, can help decide big issues but this isn’t one that we feel we should have been involved in. It feels like we’re being used as pawns in a power game.”Last month Norway’s top 32 clubs recommended, by a margin of 19 to 13, that VAR be scrapped. Each had held a meeting of its members to decide how to vote. The expectation was that the NFF, which had encouraged a vote after extensive protests inside stadiums and promised to give weight to its outcome, would mirror that recommendation but instead it proposed the technology be retained.The thoughts of clubs further down the pyramid will decide everything. Such is the level of discontent that, whereas grassroots outfits tend to side with the NFF’s proposals and as few as 10% traditionally turn up to the general assembly, all bets are off this time. Many local sides may mirror the stance of their nearest top-flight club, and Skoppum are far from the only ones disgruntled at being hauled in to the sharp end of an impassioned debate.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Vålerenga protest against VAR in August 2023.Photograph: Frode Arnesen/Alamy“We feel our involvement is pointless,” says Jørgen Grydeland, general manager of the suburban Oslo club Oppsal IF. “It did not require a democratic decision from the grassroots clubs when VAR was introduced. This was decided through a Teams meeting with the top clubs. If VAR had been introduced through a democratic process with grassroots clubs back then, it would have felt more natural to decide VAR’s future fate in 2025.“This is no longer about VAR itself; it’s about trust in the NFF, how they undermine democratic processes and create a distance between themselves, grassroots clubs and their supporters.”There is a sense the NFF and its president, Lise Klaveness, widely feted as a progressive figure for much of her tenure, simply refuse to lose the argument. They are hugely reluctant to diverge from a continent in which, with Sweden a notable exception, VAR has become a highly controversial staple. “It feels like the NFF has kept moving the goalposts whenever they see they’re losing the battle over VAR,” Laumb says.This week a pro-VAR interview with Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees’ committee, appeared on the website of domestic television rights holder TV2. It had been organised by the NFF. In advance of Saturday’s vote, leaders of the federation’s 18 district associations came out in favour of its continuation. They had seemingly been whipped into line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot of supporters believe they were lied to, that this has all been just for show and not a real process, and that everything was decided ahead of it.”Using the hashtag#BreddenMotVAR[grassroots against VAR], a number of grassroots clubs have been cohering their rebellion online. The hope is that it energises those who would not ordinarily engage with the vote. Skoppum have held a board meeting and confirmed that they want VAR to be discontinued. A similar process has driven Oppsal’s decision. “What I can say is that we will not vote for VAR,” Grydeland says. There are more relevant matters at play for Oppsal, who have more than 100 teams at various levels: they have tabled a proposal that involves removing transfer fees for youth and amateur players.Laumb and Grydeland fear a majority will land in favour of keeping VAR, although many other voices around Norwegian football believe the issue is delicately poised. Perhaps Norway will break ranks and, to the disquiet of governing bodies elsewhere, stoke appetites for other countries to follow suit.“Ignoring the majority now risks pushing more people away from the sport,” Laumb says. “We believe football is about joy, community and fairness, not technology that overcomplicates the game and silences the roar of the crowd. Let’s give the sport back to those who live for it.”The NFF was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsVideo assistant referees (VARs)European club footballFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Palace are through to the Women’s FA Cup quarter-finals, in which they travel to Chelsea on 9 March.In their inaugural WSL season the London club have won one game and drawn three but there had been a widespread feeling externally that the side had performed well in attempting to bridge the gap between the second and top tiers.PosTeamPGDPts1Chelsea Women1433402Man Utd Women1421333Arsenal Women1425304Man City Women1416285Brighton & Hove Albion Women14-5186Tottenham Hotspur Women14-12177Liverpool FC Women14-11158West Ham Women14-9149Everton Women14-101310Leicester Women14-101211Aston Villa Women14-121012Crystal Palace Women14-266Last term Bristol City were relegated straight back to the Championship with six points, a tally Palace equalled by drawing at Brighton on 2 February in their most recent WSL match. But they have not won in the league since 6 October and remain the favourites to be relegated.Parish said: “This has been an extremely difficult decision for the club to take. Laura has made a fantastic impact since arriving in the summer of 2023, getting the club promoted to the WSL for the first time in its history. Laura has given her all, on and off the pitch, and she leaves here with all of our thanks and best wishes for the future.”Kaminski’s exit follows WSL manager changes this season at Arsenal, Aston Villa and Liverpool. The Liverpool interim manager, Amber Whiteley, has said she will put her name forward to become their full-time manager. The former Liverpool academy coach, who was Beard’s assistant, said: “I’ll put my name in the hat.”As revealed by the Guardian, it is likely she will be in interim charge for the rest of this season. “That’s the indication I’ve been given,” Whiteley said, “but obviously that recruitment process has already started.“There are always mixed emotions when a manager leaves a club – it’s never an easy thing to go through.

Mourinho has received a four-match ban and a fine equivalent to £35,000 for his comments, although the club have said he has appealed.The former Chelsea and Galatasaray striker Didier Drogba was among the players to come to the defence of Mourinho after Galatasaray’s complaint, calling the Portuguese his “dad”. Fenerbahce issued their own statement on Tuesday, saying Mourinho’s comments were “taken completely out of context and deliberately distorted” and could “in no way be associated with racism”.Mourinho moved to Turkey from Roma last year. He was fined and suspended earlier in the season for a tirade against local officials and the league.Explore more on these topicsJosé MourinhoEuropean club footballGalatasarayFenerbahcenewsShareReuse this content"

The latter incident took place during the 2024 European Championship, where the 42-year-old was an official.Breaking down macho cultures? No, the Sun is simply monetising David Coote’s distress | Barney RonayRead morePGMOL said the official was in serious breach of his employment contract and his actions made his position “untenable”. European football’s control, ethics and disciplinary body met last week and also ruled Coote had violated the basic rules of decent conduct and brought football, and Uefa in particular, into disrepute. A statement said: “Mr David Coote Incidents and sanction: General principles of conduct, Art. 11(1) DR, Violating the basic rules of decent conduct, Art. 11(2)(b) DR, Bringing the sport of football, and Uefa in particular, into disrepute, Art. 11(2)(d) DR, Ban from exercising any Uefa refereeing activity until 30 June 2026.”Coote came out as gay in an interview with the Sun in January and said his struggle to hide his sexuality had contributed to his making bad choices, such as the video about Liverpool and his use of drugs. “I felt a deep sense of shame during my teenage years in particular. I didn’t come out to my parents until I was 21. I didn’t come out to my friends until I was 25,” he said. “I hid my emotions as a young ref and I hid my sexuality as well – a good quality as a referee but a terrible quality as a human being. And that’s led me to a whole course of behaviours.“I am truly sorry for any offence caused by my actions and for the negative spotlight it put on the game that I love. I hope people will understand that they were private moments taken during very low times in my life. They do not reflect who I am today or what I think.”Sources close to Coote, who also told the Sun about the mental strain created by the abuse he faced, which included death threats aimed at him and his mother, say he is keeping an open mind about what he may look to do next. He is ­understood to remain confident that a ­Football Association investigation into ­messages exchanged with a Leeds fan concerningshowing a yellow cardto one of their players in 2019 will clear him.Explore more on these topicsRefereesUefanewsShareReuse this content"

But as tensions rise between the US and a number of former allies, including their World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico, Infantino said he believes working with the president is essential.Lise Klaveness: ‘If Fifa followed their own reforms, it would be very good. But they didn’t’Read more“I think it is absolutely crucial for the success of a World Cup to have a close relationship with the president,” Infantino said. “We are organising a Club World Cup this year, the first everFifaClub World Cup, 32 teams in the United States of America. We’re organising a World Cup next year in the United States, Mexico and Canada. And let’s not forget that when the bidding happened for that World Cup, President Trump was already president of the United States.”On the Ukraine war, Infantino said Fifa was ready to play a role if a peace deal is agreed. “We all hope that peace talks will be successful, because I think it is important that we support it for the world, much more than for football, that we have peace.“If there is a little role that football can play, once peace is there, then of course, we’ll play our role, and we look forward that all countries in the world can play football.”Infantino said Trump had not asked him to consider readmitting Russian sides to the World Cup, with qualifying for 2026 to begin this spring. “No, I have not been asked,” he said. “I think there are more important topics to discuss when you discuss about peace than football. But we want to have all the countries playing.”On another controversial issue for the Fifa president, Infantino defended the decision to awardthe 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia. “There was a [Fifa] congress decision, uniting the entire world. I think it was a very positive step for football, bringing, in eight years, football all over the world, hosting everyone,” he said. “Football is the game of everyone. Everyone loves football.

It has sought legal advice from leading international law firm Pinsents, and insists any such move to bring back Wood would fall foul of its own constitution, as well as Sport England’s Code for Sports Governance.The RFL told clubs that the appointment of Wood or any individual currently in position at a competing club would amount to “multiple breaches” of the sport’s governance requirements and could lead to severe financial ramifications. They also allegeIt also claims that any attempt to appoint Wood would be “impossible” under the sport’s Articles of Association and such a move would immediately be revoked.But perhaps most tellingly, clubs were warned that, if such a move succeeded, it would lead to major financial implications for a sport already wrestling with a changing monetary landscape. Failure to adhere to Sport England’s code, according to the RFL, could put at risk the £3.4m funding rugby league currently receives every year, with talks ongoing on securing more funding over the next 12 months.And the RFL also stressed that it would potentially compromise the terms of a long-term loan arrangement with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport secured during the pandemic. The sport currently owes around £4.5m and if that money was liable to be repaid immediately, coupled with the loss of Sport England funding, it would result in a black hole of more than £7m, it claimed.The governing body told clubs: “This will potentially have catastrophic financial consequences for the RFL, its members and stakeholders.” It subsequently described the proposals as “unlawful” and “unreasonable” in the view of its legal counsel, and said it is under no obligation to put the planned proposals forward before members.Johnson’s immediate removal as chair is understood to have support, irrespective of whether or not the plans to bring back Wood succeed. A counter-proposal by the RFL suggesting Johnson will step down before the end of 2025 will be heard at the same meeting with the RFL agreeing to a strategic review of the sport: but only with the governing body’s input into the appointment of the relevant individuals.However, the clubs driving the proposals – led by Leigh’s Derek Beaumont and Leeds’s Gary Hetherington – want to be solely responsible for appointing any committee tasked with reviewing rugby league’s governance. Beaumont, in further emails seen by the Guardian, wrote to clubs on Thursday insisting the RFL was “trying to alarm” members by warning of grave financial consequences.In a statement, the RFL said it had shared supporting papers for its spring council meeting according to process, adding: “New papers include an explanation, from the RFL Board, of the submission of a board resolution to be considered before the four member resolutions, following legal advice on the potential impact of the member resolutions.“This paper explains why the board has submitted its own resolutions, which aim to demonstrate that the Board has listened to the concerns of blubs and is willing to enable discussion of changes, provided it is in accordance with good governance and ensures smooth and stable leadership.“The Board and Executive must always remain fully focused on strong governance and the future health of the sport and will continue to listen to and engage with members and stakeholders.”Leigh Leopards, Batley Bulldogs and Leeds Rhinos have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Already out of the match, the fast bowler is fearing the latest round of surgery in his injury-blighted career.There will be no official update until Wood has seen a specialist back in the UK next week. However, the “locking” the 35-year-old experienced in his left knee just four overs into Wednesday’seight-run defeat by Afghanistanis believed to relate to torn cartilage.The question now, with Wood having pushed through the pain barrier on the day to send down four more overs at reduced pace, is whether there is ligament damage also.Jos Buttler steps down as captain of England’s white-ball cricket teamRead moreIt rather summed up England’s woeful winter of white-ball cricket, withJos Buttler’s time as captain endingand the team now solely tasked with trying to avoid a seventh successive ODI defeat for the first time since 2006. England’s men have also never previously exited a global white-ball group stage without at least one victory.More pressing, however, is the long-term prognosis for Wood given the centrality of his 90mph-plus pace to their Ashes plans and a year that will define Brendon McCullum’s tenure as head coach. The same can be said for Brydon Carse, who flew home this week when a toe blister that originally required stitches suffered a further infection.Carse was replaced by Rehan Ahmed in the squad and the leg-spinner may even go straight into the XI. Though unused on the tour of India, Ahmed at least has happy memories of playing the recently refurbished National Stadium Karachi, having taken seven wicketson his Test debuthere in late 2022 when just 18 years old.There has been a focus on England’s batting but it is with the ball that they have arguably struggled the most. It is not just down to subcontinental conditions but also part of a wider trend, with their seamers having averaged 36.5 in ODI cricket since the start of 2022 – the worst figure of the 22 teams to have played the format in this time.Not only that, Heinrich Klaasen returns for South Africa on Saturday, with the player who arguably did mostto extinguish England’s white-ball aura– that incendiary 67-ball 109 during their failed World Cup campaign in 2023 – fit again after a recent elbow injury.“His skillset is right up there with the world’s best,” said Rob Walter, South Africa’s white-ball coach. “It’s great to have him in the team because you know how destructive he can be. We’re certainly hoping for a number of those knocks over the next 10 days or so.”Quick GuideEngland v South Africa: possible Champions Trophy teamsShowEnglandPhil Salt, Ben Duckett, Jamie Smith (wkt), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Saqib MahmoodSouth AfricaRyan Rickelton (wkt), Temba Bavuma (capt), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi NgidiWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As Walter added, this risks underselling a Proteas team that has developed into a short-form force in recent times, even if it is yet to translate into silverware. Temba Bavuma’s side, who brushed aside Afghanistan on this ground last week to the tune of 107 runs, is littered with quality and, in contrast to England, has clearly defined roles.The washout between Australia and Afghanistansees the former throughto the semi-finals. However, South Africa, in second place, can now top the group with a victory and also progress if a defeat is not a heavy one. Either way, England have their work cut out if they are to get something out of this sorry campaign.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamICC Champions TrophySouth Africa cricket teamDurhamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

According to statisticians, that is too early to use the recalculation formula to award a win, but even those with a far more basic grasp of mathematics could see that 109 was an awfully long way towards a target of 274, and one wicket down was not a factor. With Travis Head rampaging on 59 from 40 balls, Australia were going at 8.5 an over and needed 4.5 from there.England crash out of Champions Trophy after nail-biting defeat by AfghanistanRead moreStill, it was a shame not to at least see the possibility of a twist via Afghanistan’s spinners, with Rashid Khan not getting a bowl before the rain. There was extra frisson around this game given it was the first ODI between the sides since theMaxwell miracle at Mumbai in 2023, when the Australian all-rounder became the only player ever to make a double century in the second innings of a one-day game. This time around he wasn’t required to face a ball, though he contributed a very tidy 1 for 28 as a bowler in the first innings.Afghanistan had plenty riding on this match: a misplaced resentment around Australia’s refusal to play them bilaterally due to the Taliban’s misogynist regime, the chance of locking in their own semi-final appearance, the boost from last year of having knocked out Australia in the 20-over World Cup, and the boost from this week of having knocked England out of this competition. They had their chance against a second-tier Australian pace attack, and built a credible total with little input from their two best batters.Australia’s home-brand bowling still took down Afghanistan’s brand names at the top of the order. Spencer Johnson might be knock-off Mitchell Starc but he seemed just like the real thing with a left-arm inswinger that castled Rahmanullah Gurbaz in the first over for a duck. Then Ibrahim Zadran, perhaps not so fresh off his record-breaking 177 against England, pottered to 22 before cutting a simple catch from an Adam Zampa long hop.But their departure left room for Sediqullah Atal to step up: tall, young, new to the scene, having debuted in the format earlier this season and having already notched a century in Zimbabwe in his scant ODI appearances. The composure was there, taking 29 deliveries to hit his first boundary, then the range was there to make sure it wasn’t his last. His off-side driving was a feature, and he hit Australia’s spinners for three sixes on his way to 85.Jos Buttler steps down as captain of England’s white-ball cricket teamRead moreIt was a shame he couldn’t go on to a century – a smart low catch at cover from stand-in captain Steve Smith ended that hope – but at four down Sediqullah handed over to Azmatullah Omarzai. The all-rounder had burned with intensity in that 2023 contest, dismantling Australia’s top order with the ball and so nearly getting Maxwell before the miracle began. Here, he did a job with the bat, from the 32nd over into the 50th.As wickets fell regularly at the other end, he built his innings, increasingly tried to farm the strike, and warmed up into a late hitting spree, starting with sixes off the spinners but ending with three of them from late-innings pace specialist Nathan Ellis, who persisted in bowling length balls that got clattered. Ben Dwarshuis limited the damage by getting Azmatullah and last man Noor Ahmad in the final over to finish with three wickets, Afghanistan bowled out for 273.It looked a solid total, but Head can make short work of those: eight fours and a six in his first 33 balls as he took down the pace openers, whose short-ball approach backfired horribly, while his opening partner Matt Short took 14 from an Azmatullah over before getting out. An early dropped catch off Head might have suppressed the score, but would only have left Afghanistan more frustrated when the game was called off. Rain washed Australia out of the Champions Trophy in England in 2017, and ushered them through here.As it stood, perhaps that rain did Afghanistan a favour. Had they sent down another 7.1 overs and had a Duckworth Lewis Stern calculation, that loss would have ended their tournament for sure. Instead they nabbed one point from the no-result and avoided any damage to net run rate, meaning that they could still in theory qualify if England fire up and thrash South Africa after Jos Buttler quit the captaincy of atailspinning side. It’s a long shot, but the post-resignation bump is an observed phenomenon. For one more day at least, an Afghanistan-Australia grudge match final is still distantly on the cards.Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyAustralia cricket teamAfghanistan cricket teamAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The Rams apparently were reluctant to meet Stafford’s initial demands, even allowing the quarterback to get an assessment of his value to other teams in view of a possible trade.The Rams were concerned about a financial commitment that would impede their ability to build their depth, but the sides ultimately came to an agreement that will keep Stafford at the controls of coach Sean McVay’s offense in 2025. The Rams’ social media accounts went even farther, saying Stafford “is here to stay”.Stafford passed for 3,762 yards and 20 touchdowns last season for the Rams, who went 10-7 and won the NFC West before reaching the divisional round of the playoffs, where they lost a close road game to eventual champion Philadelphia.The Las Vegas Raiders and the New York Giants were among the teams widely reported to be interested in trading for Stafford, even discussing the framework of a potential new contract with Stafford’s agent. Raiders minority owner Tom Brady and Stafford made headlines when they ran into each other recently at a Montana ski resort, but Brady’s agent said the meeting was brief and accidental.Stafford has led the Rams to three playoff appearances in four seasons with the team following 12 mostly unsuccessful years with the Detroit Lions, who traded Stafford to Los Angeles in a deal for Jared Goff in early 2021. Stafford has passed for 14,700 yards – sixth-most in Rams history – with 95 touchdowns and 44 interceptions over those four years running McVay’s offense.Stafford needs just 191 more yards passing to become the 10th quarterback inNFLhistory with 60,000 yards.The Rams’ offense will get continuity at its most important position during what could be a busy offseason. Receiver Cooper Kupp announced three weeks ago that the Rams are trying to trade him, almost certainly ending the Super Bowl LVI MVP’s eight-year tenure with Los Angeles.Even if Kupp departs, McVay and the Rams still appear to provide Stafford’s best chance by far to contend for another Super Bowl ring among the choices available to him. Stafford and his wife also won’t have to move their four daughters from a comfortable family life in Los Angeles.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles RamsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

On Friday, Turki al-Sheikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority, which regulates the kingdom’s entertainment industry,announceda blockbuster fight card to be staged in Times Square on 2 May.The main event will feature Ryan Garcia (24-1-1 NC, 20 KO) against Rolando Romero (16-2, 13 KO). Garcia has not fought since his controversial bout with Devin Haney last May in New York, a fighthe initially won via unanimous decisionbut was lateroverturned following a failed drug test. Now back in the ring after a year-long suspension, Garcia is aiming to rebuild his reputation and set up a potential rematch with Haney later this year.He’s one of boxing’s biggest stars. But will Tank Davis ever put it on the line?Read moreThe co-feature bout will see former undisputed lightweight champion Haney (31-0, 1 NC, 15 KO) take on Jose Ramirez (29-2, 18 KO) in a welterweight contest. Haney, looking to solidify his standing in a new division, faces a dangerous opponent in Ramirez, a former WBC and WBO champion.Additionally, Teofimo Lopez (21-1, 13 KO), the reigning WBO junior welterweight champion, will defend his title against the undefeated Arnold Barboza Jr (32-0, 11 KO). Barboza is coming off a hard-fought split-decision victory over Lancashire’s Jack Catterall and now looks to dethrone Lopez on one of the biggest stages in boxing.A victory for Lopez, a native of Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood, could also set up a unification bout against IBF junior welterweight champion Richardson Hitchins (19-0, 7 KO), adding further intrigue to an already stacked division.The event will be available on pay-per-view, with further broadcast details to be announced. TheNew YorkState Athletic Commission, which oversees professional boxing in the state, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. The commission’s approval is particularly significant given Garcia’s suspension last year and the logistics of hosting a major boxing event in Times Square.View image in fullscreenTurki al-Sheikh and Oscar De La Hoya attend the Ring Magazine gala dinner event on 19 December 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Mark Robinson/Getty ImagesIn December, Al-Sheikh announced his purchase of The Ring magazine, an American boxing publication that has been around since 1922, and his intent to restore its print edition. The outlet had been owned by Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy Enterprises since 2007.Al-Sheikh has played a major role in bringing high-profile boxing events to Saudi Arabia, most notably the recent heavyweight clashes featuring Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk as part of the Riyadh Season series.The decision to bring Saudi-backed boxing to a destination known as the crossroads of the world represents an escalation of Al-Sheikh’s soft power strategy, aimed at cementing Saudi Arabia as a dominant force in global sports. By bringing a high-profile event to the heart of American entertainment and commerce, Saudi Arabia isn’t just hosting fights – it’s challenging the sport’s historic power centers.Al-Sheikh’s calculated mix ofsportswashing, influence-building and economic diversification has shifting boxing’s balance of power from Las Vegas and London to Riyadh in two short years. At the same time, it has appealed to Saudi Arabia’s young population – 70% of whom are under 35 – by showcasing the kingdom on the world stage as aspirational, glamorous and globally influential.Explore more on these topicsBoxingNew YorkUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The tool stunned film-makers when it was revealed last year, with the film and TV mogul Tyler Perrypausing an $800m (£634m) expansionof his Atlanta studio complex after saying the tool might make building sets or travelling to locations unnecessary. It was launched in the US publicly in December.Beeban Kidron joins calls against PM’s AI tsar over tech-firm interestsRead moreUsers are able to make videos on Sora bytyping in simple promptssuch as asking for a shot of people walking through a “beautiful, snowy Tokyo city” where “gorgeous sakura petals are flying through the wind along with snowflakes”. The tool is accessible on desktop onsora.com, where users who have not signed up to the ChatGPT Plus or Pro packages can view a compilation of AI-made videos on the front of the site.OpenAI announced the UK release as it released examples of Sora’s use by artists from across the UK and mainland Europe, where the tool is also being released on Friday. Josephine Miller, a 25-year-old British digital artist, created a two-minute video of models wearing bioluminescent fauna and said the tool would “open a lot more doors for younger creatives”.2:13'Biolume': Josephine Miller uses OpenAI's Sora to create stunning footage – videoKidron said the launch underlined the importance of the debate over copyright and AI in the UK, which centres ongovernment proposalsto let AI firms use copyrighted work to train their models – unless creative professionals opt out of the process.“Comments made byYouTubelast year make clear that if copyrighted material was taken without licence to help train Sora it would have breached their terms of service. Sora would not exist without its training data, which means it is built on stolen goods. At some point YouTube may want to take action on that,” she said.Last year, the head of the video platform said it would be a violation of its terms of service if YouTube content had been used to train Sora. However, asked if YouTube clips had been used in this way, Neal Mohan told Bloomberg: “I don’t know.” The chief executive added: “It does not allow for things like transcripts or video bits to be downloaded, and that is a clear violation of our terms of service.”The Guardianreported on Tuesdaythat UK ministers were considering offering concessions over copyright to certain creative sectors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others flagged footage of a man being dismembered by a helicopter and a video where “a guy put his face into boiling oil”. Several users posted videos of their Reels feeds dominated by “sensitive content” screens that are designed to shield users from graphic material.A list of violent content on one user’s feed,published by the tech news site 404, included: a man being set on fire; a man shooting a cashier at point-blank range; videos from an account called “PeopleDeadDaily”; and a pig being beaten with a wrench. The user in question had a biking-related Instagram account, 404 Media reported.Another Reddit user wrote: “For the past 24 hours, it feels like Instagram’s algorithm has gone rogue. My feed is absolutely packed with violent Reels – like, one after the other.“It’s like Instagram is now trying to make me question if I accidentally followed a ‘bloodshed and chaos’ account. I get that the platform’s all about ‘engagement’ and ‘trending,’ but did they really think this was the way to get people to scroll more?”A spokesperson forMeta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said: “We have fixed an error that caused some users to see content on their Instagram Reels feed that should not have been recommended. We apologise for the mistake.”The error followsrecent changes to Meta’s approach to content moderation. However, the company told 404 Media that the deluge of graphic videos was not related to theoverhaul of Meta’s content rules, which included removing factcheckers and “dramatically” reducing the amount of censorship on its platforms.Meta’scontent guidelinesstate the company will remove content that is “particularly violent or graphic” and that some imagery will be shielded by sensitive content screens. In the UK, the Online Safety Act requires social media platforms to take measures to prevent under-18s from seeing material that is harmful to them such as violent, hateful or abusive material, which will include configuring their algorithms to filter out such content.One internet safety campaign group demanded a “full explanation” of what had happened to Instagram’s algorithm.The Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the family of the UK teenager Molly Russell, who killed herself in 2017after viewing distressing content on Instagram, said questions needed to answered about why such graphic content was on the platform in the first place.“As Instagram rolls back content moderation this is likely to be a sign of things to come,” said Andy Burrows, the foundation’s chief executive. “Meta’s changes will mean this type of content is more freely available and will more often be recommended to appear in user’s feeds.”Explore more on these topicsMetaInstagramSocial mediaDigital mediaMark ZuckerbergInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The factory is forbidden from selling its EUV machines toChina.Below we explain how the chips are made, why they have become the focus of the US-China trade wars, howTaiwanwas drawn into the maelstrom, and what could come next. The answers take us from deep underground to outer space, from the dirtiest places in the world to the cleanest, from the hottest temperatures to the coldest, from man-made structures smaller than a virus to equipment so large it takes three planes to move, and finally, to a state in physics that is two opposites at the same time.How are they made?Chips are made up of layers of thin, flat pieces of silicon – called wafers – that hold electric circuits. These circuits are comprised of billions of switches called transistors. Highly complex, powerful chips containing these networks of transistors are commonly referred to as semiconductors.If you want to make semiconductors, you’ll need $380m. This is the cost of the latest EUV machine from Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML). Shipping is a nightmare: the machine is so large and so delicate that it requires 40 freight containers, three cargo planes and 20 trucks to transport it from the Dutch factory in Veldhoven. All this to create and focus light with wavelengths almost as short as X-rays, with enough energy to penetrate solid objects.Chipmakers strive to meet a prediction called Moore’s law: that capacity – or the number of transistors on a chip – tends to double every two years. If chips are to stay the same size, and ideally get smaller, this means that transistors must be ever finer.ASML’s machine carves the patterns into the silicon wafers that hold the transistors. The finer the patterns, the more computing power you can pack on to a chip. Marc Assinck, a company spokesperson, likens light wavelengths to the thickness of a pen stroke. The more detail you want on a page, the thinner your pen should be. EUV light has a wavelength so narrow that it is invisible to the human eye and passes right through most materials.The light is produced by firing a laser at microscopic balls of tin. The tin evaporates into plasma, and the plasma emits light, which is moved through the lithography machine, hitting specially made mirrors. The light is shone through a “mask”, which is the pattern of one layer of a chip, on to the wafer. The area exposed to light hardens and the area not exposed is dissolved in a chemical solution, leaving behind a 3D pattern.Think of a chip like a building with 100 floors. Each building takes four months to produce, and each floor has its own layout, only the features of this layout can be just 25 nanometres: smaller than particles of influenza viruses, which are about 100 nanometres. EUV and other lithography machines carve the patterns of these layers, one by one.The machines aren’t easy to make. Like chips themselves, they’re assembled in dust-free rooms, the cleanest spaces on earth. Chips function at the level of atoms: a single speck of dust can render them useless.View image in fullscreenIllustration showing semiconductor chip structure.Illustration: ASMLWhy is Taiwan so important?ASML makes the machines that make chips, but it doesn’t make the chips themselves. That is done, chiefly, by another remarkable company with another unremarkable name: TSMC, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which produces nine in every 10 of the world’s most advanced semiconductors – including those that power iPhones. Because Taiwan makes and supplies so many of the US’s semiconductor chips, the US has an added interest in protecting Taiwan amid concerns that China willinvade.How Taiwan secured semiconductor supremacy – and why it won’t give it upRead moreIn 2022, the US convinced the Dutch government to place export controls on ASML’s machines, restricting their sale to China. To date, ASML says, no EUV lithography machines have been shipped to China, which means that unless – or until – it invents its own EUV lithography machines, China will be working with technology a few years older, and less powerful, than that of western countries – deep ultraviolet lithography, for example, instead of extreme ultraviolet. These machines can still produce very complex chips at scale – just not as complex.Artificial intelligence, another technology in which the US and China are fiercely competing to advance, relies on among the world’s most complex and powerful semiconductor chips. The leading designer of these chips is an American company called Nvidia. Its chips are produced by TSMC on machines made by ASML.China’s lack of access to EUV lithography explains why the debut of the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek came as such a shock to markets. A Chinese company produced a product as powerful as Chat GPT with less advanced – cheaper – technology. DeepSeek claims that it cost just $6m to train, compared with thebillions of dollarsspent by US companies to do the same thing.“The US believes that AI will be a transformative technology, impacting nearly every sector of the economy,” says Chris Miller, the author of Chip War: the Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology. “So it doesn’t want China to gain an advantage.”It is also crucial for defence and intelligence. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army has made “significant progress” in its efforts to use AI in combat in recent years,according tothe Centre for Security and Emerging Technology.But not everyone believes that China’s access to ASML’s machines should be restricted, including ASML.Asked at a Bloomberg conference in October how much the restrictions were really about security threats, its CEO, Christophe Fouquet, said: “More and more people are asking themselves this exact question … Is it really about national security?”The debate might not need to continue for long: in 2024, Chinese company Shanghai Micro Electronics Company (SMIC) revealed that, a year earlier, it had filed a patent for an EUV lithography machine.Where do rare earths come in?China boasts other advantages over western countries in the race to produce chips. In addition to silicon, semiconductors require so-called “rare earths” – in particular, germanium and gallium. By 2030, Gallium demand is projected toincrease more than 350% from 2015levels. Germanium demand is expected to double over the same period. China produces 98% of the world’s raw gallium, and more than two-thirds of the world’s raw germanium.This is one reason why Donald Trump is pressuring Ukraine into handing over its rare earths in exchange for aid, and why, after Trump’s first meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, the pair announced they had agreed to launch “a recovery and processing initiative” for rare earths.View image in fullscreenA silicon wafer for semiconductor manufacturing.Photograph: Panther Media GmbH/AlamyWill quantum chips change everything?Then there are quantum chips. Quantum chips would, in theory, allow computers to solve problems much, much faster than the world’s current super computers. This is because instead of being the equivalent of on or off, or a zero or a one, quantum chips can be both states at once – and every state between. A common explanation is a maze: a normal computer would find the path through a maze by testing each option, one after the other. A quantum computer could test all of them at once.Microsoft unveils chip it says could bring quantum computing within yearsRead moreSo far, quantum computing has been achieved only in limited circumstances. But Microsoft announced this month that it had built a chipthat could mean quantum computers might be built within yearsrather than decades.Meanwhile, China’s public spending on quantum technology is four times that of the US,according tothe Mercator Institute of China Studies, a European thinktank. And the chips are not made with EUV machines. Instead, quantum chips are made by machines that carve patterns into chips using electrons. And China has these machines.China also has a resource often overlooked in the chip debates, says David Reilly, professor of physics and the head of the University of Sydney’s quantum programme.“The key to all of this is people,” he says. Breakthroughs happen because people see a need, and know what the existing ways to meet that need are, and can imagine what they might be.“There are a lot of smart people in China. They produce a lot of Stem graduates,” he says. And those graduates tend to do undergraduate or postgraduate degrees at the top US, Australian, European universities before returning.“I don’t want to say governments are sort of blind to that, but we do focus a lot on the transfer of tangible stuff,” he says. “Inventions don’t happen in a vacuum.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyChinaTaiwanArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingManufacturing sectorAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

But the platform has struggled to keep up with easier-to-use and more reliable rivals such as Zoom and Salesforce’s Slack in recent years, in part because Skype’s underlying technology grew less suited for the smartphone era.When the pandemic and work from home fueled the need for online business calls, Microsoft batted for Teams by aggressively integrating it with other Office apps to tap corporate users, once a major base for Skype.Online video communication was once the near exclusive purview of Skype before the likes of FaceTime, Zoom and Google Hangouts took over. Skype was an early example of a tech product that was so ubiquitous it was used as a verb. Users would “Skype” someone in much the same way they would Google something.When Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 for $8.5bn after outbidding Google and Facebook, its largest deal at the time, the service had about 150 million monthly users; by 2020, that number had fallen to roughly 23 million, despite a brief resurgence during the pandemic.Over the years, Microsoft struggled to integrate Skype into its suite of tools and could not meet the moment when the company began seeing competition from Apple’s FaceTime and Google’s various communications app attempts. And when Microsoft launched its collaboration product Teams in 2017that quickly took priority.“We are honored to have been part of the journey,” Microsoft said on Friday. “Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications.”To ease the transition from the platform, its users will be able to log into Teams for free on any supported device using their existing credentials, with chats and contacts migrating automatically.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Launching successful communication tools has been a challenge for many of the big tech firms including Google. Now Skype will be laid to rest in the graveyard of communication tools alongside Duo and AOL Instant Messenger.Microsoft declined to share the latest user figures for Skype and said there would be no job cuts due to the move. It added that Teams had about 320 million monthly active users.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMicrosoftSkypeInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

The catalyst wasDonald Trump’sinauguration. Many more Americans are planning to make similar decisionsthis Friday.Three billionaires: America’s oligarchy is now fully exposed | Robert ReichRead moreBedson made her move after seeing photos of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, sitting with other tech moguls and billionaires, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai, just rows behind Trump athis inauguration.“I just couldn’t stand to see them so cowardly,” Bedson, of Camas, Washington, told the Guardian. “I lived in Seattle for over a decade. I was a fan ofAmazonfor a long time, I think they have a good product. But I’m just so disgusted. I don’t want to give these billionaire oligarchs any more of my money.”It’s a sentiment that many Americans have been feeling since Trump entered the White House. Companies and business leaders who were once passive or vocally critical of Trump are now trying to cozy up to him, leading consumers to question the values of the brands they used to trust. A recentHarris pollfound that a quarter of American consumers have stopped shopping at their favorite stores because of shifting political stances.Many are being inspired by calls to boycott coming from social media.One boycotthas gone viral over the last few weeks: a “blackout” of companies that dropped some of their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals, including Target, Amazon and Walmart, is planned for 28 February with protesters planning to halt all spending at these corporations for the day.View image in fullscreenLauren Bedson canceled her Amazon Prime membership: ‘I don’t want to give these billionaire oligarchs any more of my money.’Photograph: Lauren BedsonBut people are also making the decision to boycott at their kitchen tables, trying to figure out how to resist Trump, and perhaps corporate capitalism at large, within their own communities.The Guardian asked readers how their shopping habits have changed over the last few months, as the political climate started to shift after Trump’s win. Hundreds from across the country said that they have stopped shopping at stores such as Walmart and Target that publicly announced the end of DEI goals. Dozens like Bedson had cancelled long held Prime accounts. Others have shut down theirFacebookand Instagram accounts in protest of Meta.“I’m just trying to do little things that make me feel a little bit empowered, to stake my claim against what’s happening and how companies are acting in ways that are opposed to my values,” said Kim Wohlenhaus, of St Louis, Missouri, who cancelled her Prime membership, deleted herMetaaccounts and has stopped shopping at Target. “It feels good to be able to do something.”Erica Bradley, of Reno, Nevada, said she stopped shopping at Target because of their changing DEI policies.“I don’t plan on going there ever again, just because I feel like they’ve shown that they’re not really committed to these things,” Bradley said. “They’ve lost my trust.”View image in fullscreenErica Bradley stopped shopping at Target: ‘I think we all have become very complacent or complicit … .’Photograph: Erica BradleyFor many consumers, the shift away from the big companies has revealed how much they have come to rely on them. As of last spring, 75% of American consumers had Amazon Prime memberships, a total of 180m Prime accounts, according toBloomberg.Bedson said cancelling her account made her aware of a culture of consumerism in American where “in some ways, it feels like we don’t have a choice”.“Amazon is so convenient,” she said. “I think we all have become very complacent or complicit, and it’s hard to make these changes. But on the other hand, what else can we do?”It’s been a year since Bradley cancelled her Prime account, after she saw Amazon’s union busting. She recalls a transition period as she was adjusting to life without Prime, but it ultimately led her to spend less overall.“I just decided I don’t really need a lot of these things. Like I don’t need more clothes, I don’t really need more house decorations, which are things I used to spend a lot of money on,” Bradley said. “It’s not retail therapy anymore.”The Harris poll found that a third of Americans are similarly trying to “opt out” of the economy, cutting down on overall spending as the political stances of corporations have become murky.View image in fullscreenKim Wohlenhaus deleted her Meta accounts: ‘We don’t care about your products as much as we care about values that we cherish.’Photograph: Kim Wohlenhaus“It’s like a Whac-a-Mole now,” Wohlenhaus said. “You could really look in any direction and find something you dislike about the way corporations are caving to this administration.”Wohlenhaus said she has started to prioritize shopping at local businesses. She kept her Costco membership, since the company affirmed its DEI policies.During Joe Biden’s presidency, many of the boycotts against companies actually came from conservatives who felt corporations were caving to a “woke” mob. But boycotts didn’t amount to any serious consequences – with two exceptions. Bud Light saw adrop in salesafter it sponsored a post by a transgender influencer and Target removed some of its Pride merchandise after conservative backlash.It’s unclear what the consequences of the current backlash will be. But Wohlenhaus and others voiced optimism that consumers are thinking critically about the choices they’re making at checkout.“Hopefully if thousands of other families are doing what we’re doing, I think they’ll start to feel it,” she said. “We don’t care about your products as much as we care about those values that we cherish.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsAmazonUS politicsWalmartRetail industryMetaFacebookfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the mountain backdrop and the cosy interiors are convincing, and it only took 45 seconds to make after the text prompt was entered. The technology will also improve.In order to access Sora users need to have a paid-for package with ChatGPT, but it is an indication of where video-generating technology is heading in the rapidly evolving AI market. It also underlines why the row over copyright has reached red-hot levels on both sides of the Atlantic.It is obvious that video generation tools such as Sora, Kling and Runway have the potential to transform the film, TV and advertising industries. One of the UK digital artists who has experimented with the tool, Josephine Miller, told the Guardian it has expanded opportunities for “younger creatives” and she is already using it to pitch advertising concepts to brands.OpenAI says creatives and studios in locations where Sora is already available, such as in the US, have been using it to produce film and advertising concepts and pitches.David Jones, the chief executive of Brandtech Group, an advertising startup using generative AI to create marketing campaigns, says there is going to be “tectonic disruption” of the advertising and marketing industries due to tools such as Sora.Jones says this is a “Kodak moment” for his industry, referring to the analogue camera film company thatsuccumbed to the digital revolution.Big advertisers are already embracing AI-made video. Coca-Cola produced an entirelyAI-generated Christmas adlast year and the technology’s implications were outlined in a pointed tweet from Alex Hirsch, the creator of the Disney-animated series Gravity Falls.“FUN FACT: @CocaCola is ‘red’ because it’s made from the blood of out-of-work artists!” he wrote.The problem of artists losing out to AI has become a key battleground in development of the technology on multiple levels, not least with regard to copyright. AI systems such as Sora and ChatGPT are powered by models that are trained on vast amounts of data culled from the internet. ChatGPT, which was also developed by OpenAI, is the subject of lawsuits claiming the use of artists’ work without permission is a breach of copyright.The row deepened in the UK this week over government plans to allow AI firms to use copyrighted work without permission. The creative sector hit back with the release ofa silent protest album by 1,000 musiciansand an open letter from leading creative figures including Dua Lipa, Sir Tom Stoppard and Sir Paul McCartney warning that the government was on the verge of agreeing a “wholesale giveaway of rights and income from the UK creative sectors to big tech”.Sora and its peers are not at the forefront of that row, but they clearly represent a competitive threat to artists who want recompense if their work has been used to create these tools – and their content. YouTube’s chief executive warned last year that it would be a breach of the platform’s terms of service if OpenAI had used YouTube content to train Sora’s model. Reports have already pointed to Sora’sapparent familiarity with gaming content.Beeban Kidron, an award-winning film-maker and crossbench peer whohas spoken out against the UK government’s plans, has told the Guardian that Sora’s arrival adds “another layer of urgency” to the debate.Tyler Perry is not the only creative who is concerned.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIComputingAdvertisingFilm industryTelevision industryTyler PerryanalysisShareReuse this content"

Their figures evolve in front of us, lines melting into curves, convex convulsing into concave. In beguiling, often quite balletic dance, you marvel at the absolute clarity of their forms – bodies revealed in minimal black underwear or translucent organza that appears to float.Floating is a thing. The title Deepstaria refers to a type of jellyfish, and there’s a sense of rippling through the weight of deep water. The show’s other USP is that the set is made with Vantablack, a super-black coating that absorbs 99.9% of light (normally used in telescopes and space technology). A large black square, a void, is at the centre of the stage. But rather than an all-enveloping darkness, there is a haze and streaks of milky light (and at one point a very cool lighting effect like a giant rain shower).View image in fullscreenStreaks of milky light … Jasiah Marshall and Jordan James Bridge.Photograph: Ettore SpezzaDeepstaria has a little more breathing space than some of McGregor’s work; the choreography is quieter, with a focus on solos and duos that invite us to watch intently. These dancers may be like otherworldly creatures, but there are also some very human moments: concordance and connection, fleeting antagonism, a fraught duet and an incredibly tender one for two men, which is a highlight.Not so quiet is the score, created by Nicolas Becker and Alex Dromgoole, AKA LEXX, who is the co-founder of Bronze AI, a tool that makes recorded music evolve as if it’s being played live. It’s a fascinating sound-world, a step up from your average rumbling atmospherics. It is also deliberately contrarian: anti-melody, hooks and regular rhythm, which is wearing after a while. The idea may be to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, alert, but in practice it can have the opposite, numbing effect. Of course, in the deepest sea, or outer space, we might first see the awe-inspiring beauty, but the reality is something much more dangerous – perhaps that’s what this enervating soundtrack is telling us.

What does Ukraine do now?Rajan MenonFor the Ukrainian leader, there’s no coming back from the debacle. His country’s best hope now lies with EuropeFri 28 Feb 2025 17.54 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 18.39 ESTShareNo matter their position on the Russia-Ukraine war, people who view thetelevised encounterbetweenDonald TrumpandVolodymyr Zelenskyyin the Oval Office will likely be shocked. It didn’t morph into a full-on screaming match, but it came close.The meeting might have gone sideways anyway, butJD Vance’s presence ensured thatit became ugly– and quickly. The vice-president spoke over Zelenskyy, accused him of ingratitude for the assistance provided by the United States (“Have you ever said thank you?”) and of disrespectingTrump, his host, and, for good measure, scolded him for litigating his country’s case in public. That raised the temperature – a lot.To be fair, the Ukrainian president shouldn’t have sprung the trap Vance set. He might have said that he had in fact expressed his gratitude in the past, wished to do so again, and was pleased to be in the United States to have a direct discussion with Trump, a man he regards as a strong leader.3:20'Make a deal or we are out': the worst of Trump and Zelenskyy’s clash – videoYuck, you might say: that would have been obsequious and undignified. True, but there are two rules for anyone meeting Trump, especially when the press corps is on hand: use flattery and avoid arguments.The formula works.Consider Keir Starmer’s Thursday meeting with Trump, in a similar public setting. The British prime minister played Trump like a violin. He nodded earnestly, smiled and delivered the coup de grace by whipping out of his pocket King Charles’s letter inviting Trump to visit the UK and underscoring how important a gesture it was. Trump, momentarily taken aback, beamed with pride and gushed over the UK and its monarch.Was Starmer genuflecting? Yes. Was it a bit queasy to watch him? Yes. Did his approach work? Absolutely. It was a masterly lesson in Trump-handling.It’s too late for Zelenskyy to try the Starmer method. He and Trump didn’t hold a press conference; a state dinner was scarcely possible after the Oval Office fiasco; the US-Ukraine mineral deal is likely dead – and Zelenskyy left.Where does Ukraine go from here?The video of what happened between Trump and Zelenskyy will course through the news cycle for a few days and make for dinnertime discussions – or quarrels – but it won’t elicit attention for long.Kyiv had best abandon all hopes of ensuring its postwar security through a place in the Atlantic AllianceYet for Zelenskyy, there’s no coming back from this debacle. Trump holds grudges, doesn’t forget slights and never forgives.Leave aside the mineral deal; Trump has slammed Nato’s door shut in Ukraine’s face. Kyiv had best abandon all hopes of ensuring its postwar security through a place in the Atlantic alliance, especially given that other members, such as Hungary and Slovakia, are already determined to lock it out.There’s more bad news for Ukraine. It might have hoped that a mineral accord worked out with the Trump administration could pave the way for American arms sales paid for by Ukraine with its mineral revenues. That is now all but impossible.So how can a Ukraine that’s been shut out of Nato and won’t get any sort of American security guarantee, or even US arms, ensure its postwar security? It must look toEurope.Ukraine ‘gambling with world war three’, Trump tells Zelenskyy in fiery meetingRead moreZelenskyy’s idea of a 200,000-strong “army of Europe” peacekeeping force won’t work. Europe can’t field a ready-for-battle army anywhere near that size. It’s not just a matter of insufficient troops. Having relied comfortably on American protection for over a generation, Europe had the luxury of neglecting its defenses. Consequently, it lacks the firepower (aircraft, armored personnel carriers, tanks and artillery) and logistical capabilities to field a force that can defend Ukraine if Russia attacks again.Yet Europe can help Ukraine build a well-trained army with top-flight weaponry – one that Russia will find an even tougher opponent than it does now.To be sure, the Russian army is scarcely facing defeat in Ukraine; nor are its economic problems so severe that it can’t fight for much longer. Yet the performance of Vladimir Putin’s forces in Ukraine has been far from stellar. Russia has just entered year four of a war with a far weaker country – one that just about every military expert thought would be overrun in weeks, even days.Europe, with its world-class defense industries and resources for training troops, can help build Ukraine’s future army so that Russia must reckon with a far more powerful adversary than the one it has fought since 2022. The purpose of that army wouldn’t be to defeat Russia’s but rather to deter it by raising the cost, in blood and treasure, that it would have to pay to prevail.Trump can abandon Ukraine without endangering American security. Europe can’t and therefore has a stake in Ukraine’s security. Both Ukraine and Europe now have a Trump problem. They should turn it into an opportunity for defense cooperation.Rajan Menon is Spitzer professor emeritus at City College of New York and a senior research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia UniversityExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpEuropeJD VanceNatoUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Zelenskyy was being forced to buy hope of  survival by people who have no care for our freedomFri 28 Feb 2025 14.07 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 19.27 ESTShareIt’s warming up in Kyiv. The temperature has risen from -5C to 4C. Sometimes, the sun peeps through breaks in the clouds, but Kyivites are not much cheered by the sunshine. They are not watching for signs of spring as they usually do at this time of year. The atmosphere in the city and in the country as a whole has been one of nervous expectation. This was not an expectation of an end to military action or the signing of a peace treaty with Russia – nothing so specific. Indeed, it was not at all clear what we were waiting for, but it was something connected withDonald Trumpand the change in US policy towards Ukraine.Clarity emerged at today’s macabre theatre at the White House: handshakes, a thumbs up and some fist pumps from the US president, before Trump sat side by side with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a minerals-for-war-support deal and to humiliate him. At the same time,air raid sirens were soundingin northern and eastern Ukraine. Soon the talks were off and Zelenskyy was gone.What proceeded, in front of TV cameras, was chilling, extraordinary. Zelenskyy grave, angry, desperate – as befits a leader being obliged to bargain away his nation’s birthright. Trump claiming to be the honest broker, saying: “I am not aligned with anybody. I am aligned with the world.” Be thankful, he tells a man who has seen his people murdered, his territory captured and besieged. “Make a deal or we’re out.”It got worse. Zelenskyy showed him photos of war atrocities. “I think President Trump is on our side,” he said, with no genuine hope and certainly no expectation that that was true. The vice-president, JD Vance, attacked Zelenskyy for being disrespectful. Both Trump and Vance verbally pummelled him for the cameras, for this is the art of the deal now: loaded, hectoring, callous, bloodless.But then Ukrainians’ belief in a concrete proposal from Trump to end the war had already been replaced by the conviction that the president had no such plan, but rather, many different ideas about US involvement in the region – ideas that often relate toUkraine, but sometimes conflict with each other and are never focused on supporting a country that is a victim of Russian aggression.During the past two weeks, we have watched as the issue of ending the Russian-Ukrainian war has transformed into the issue of rare earth metal mining in our country. As it turned out, in Saudi Arabia the participants in the Russian-US negotiations also discussed the extraction of rare earth metals, only they focused on resources in Russian territories and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. These rare earth metals have pushed the topic of the war and military aid to Ukraine out of the media space. That space is filled with dollars now.Older Ukrainians, who grew up in the Soviet Union, have recognised in this situation the US that was depicted by Soviet propaganda cartoons as a nation of greedy, irresponsible, grab-what-you-can capitalists, who spat on complex problems and had eyes only for dollar superprofits.8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – videoThis is an existential war, and a new reality. Trump says Zelenskyy is “not ready for peace”, but Ukraine has no choice but to fight on, whatever the cost. Aid that was previously given for nothing must now be bought. If there is no money, then it is necessary to pay with resources. After three years of full-scale Russian aggression, US geopolitical interests in Ukraine have been replaced by financial interests. Instead of the politician President Biden, the businessman President Trump has entered the arena.Note that the US proposal on the extraction of rare earth metals in Ukraine, if realised, would allow the US side to sign a similar agreement with Russia and start digging without waiting for the end of hostilities.The notionis an “investment fund”, managed by the US and Ukraine on “equal terms”, into which Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas “to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine”. Trump insists it is “very fair”.Would such an agreement encourage Russia to cease its aggression? No! Does it contain security guarantees for Ukraine? It seems not. Does Ukraine have any choice? Debatable.In this situation, Britain and the EU become much more important partners for Ukraine than before. While organising favourable access to Ukrainian resources for the US, Trump hopes to hand over toEuropeand Britain responsibility for Ukraine’s security in the event of a cessation of hostilities, and responsibility for further military assistance. Given this, it is by no means clear what advantage such an agreement on rare earth metals would give Ukraine.Trump’s claims that US mining on Ukrainian territory will be a sufficient guarantee of Ukraine’s security because Russia will not risk attacking US economic interests do not stand up to criticism. The Chinese state-owned COFCO corporation invested in a new grain and oil handling complex in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv port, but Chinese involvement did not protect the port from beingtargeted by Russian missiles. It has not been operational since March 2022 and the region islosing about 40%of its revenues.The fact that Trump has been so complimentary aboutVladimir Putin, and so hostile to Zelenskyy, says everything. “I think he will keep his word,” Trump assured the world. “I have known him for a long time.” Trump’s phrase that peace will be achieved “fairly soon or it won’t happen at all” indicates that he will not waste too much time on negotiations with Putin if they drag on, or if Putin puts forward conditions that are unacceptable to Ukraine. Some conditions have already been announced by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who reminded us that Russia still plans to seize the entirety of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.Zelenskyy was brave, but we are supplicants now. Trump and the Kremlin have made it abundantly clear that Ukraine’s participation in these negotiations between the US and Russia is not necessary or desirable. Like so much else, the principleannounced by Biden, “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”, has been trampled underfoot. Zelenskyy was called to the White House to sign, but not speak.Trump has had his way. He has transformed Ukraine from a subject into an object, and after this White House humiliation some Ukrainians are convinced that the extraction of rare earth metals on Trump’s terms would turn our country into a “colony” of the US. Still, many Ukrainians would prefer to live in a US colony than in a Russian one, if that’s the choice.Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and the author of Death and the PenguinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After the combined persuasion and flattery ofSir Keir Starmerand Emmanuel Macron brought out a somewhat tamer and more jovial version of the US president, there were modest hopes that the Ukrainian president’s visit to Washington might be more productive than feared – even if there was no sign that they had succeeded in tempting Mr Trump towards the security assurances so desperately needed.Instead, his Oval Office meeting withVolodymyr Zelenskyysoon exploded into acrimony, with the US president berating his guest for ingratitude. Mr Trump had earlier spoken of partnership with the Ukrainian president. But he and his vice-president, JD Vance, teamed up to deliver a public kicking. It would, the president added, be “great television”.8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – video“You are gambling with world war three,”Mr Trump accused him. He attacked Mr Zelenskyy’s “hatred” for Vladimir Putin, suggesting it was the obstacle to achieving peace – no mention of Russia’s invasion. So much for Mr Trump’s remark that “I’m in the middle, I’m for both Ukraine and Russia” – itself a shameful pronouncement. It is hard to see how the curtailed visit – Mr Trump said that Mr Zelenskyy “can come back when he is ready for peace” – could have gone worse. “President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Mr Trump wrote.Europe’s charm initiative was always a long shot. Like Mr Macron, Sir Keir enjoyed a jovial reception from Mr Trump. He had learned to speak his language. Havingarrived armed with an invitationfor a second state visit, he gushed that Donald Trump’s return to Britain would be “so incredible. It will be historic.” He also managed to speak the truth: he stressed that peace must not reward the aggressor and factchecked the president’s lie that European aid to Ukraine was merely loaned. Asked about Mr Trump’s vision for Gaza, he stated the need for Palestinians to return home and reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to the two-state solution.Mr Trump, in affable mode, suggested he would probably back the UK’s plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. He dangled the prospect of a bilateral trade deal, but its substance remains unclear – and likely skewed in America’s favour.It would have been folly for Sir Keir to burn bridges. But it was always clear that Mr Trump would be ready to set the torch to them himself whenever he saw fit. And so on Friday he put the boot into a democratically elected leader fighting to defend his country against invasion – “You don’t have the cards,” he told Mr Zelenskyy – yet has said he believes that Mr Putin can be trusted to keep promises. No one else does, which is why a security backstop from the US is needed.The mineralsdealthat Kyiv was set to sign with Washington smacks more of a shakedown than a partnership. Mr Trump’s suggestion that American workers mining those resources could be the backstop against further Russian aggression was both a reminder of his priorities and further confirmation that he will not offer anything more substantive. Then came his blistering attack on Mr Zelenskyy.Sunday’s defencesummitof European leaders in London is now more crucial than ever. “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader,” wrote the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, following the disastrous meeting. The extent of their erstwhile ally’s betrayal is now undeniable. Kyiv is the first but not the only victim. The extent to which European countries are able to formulate a plan for acting accordingly, and in unison, will be critical to Ukraine’s future, and to the continent’s.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionDonald TrumpUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEmmanuel MacronEuropean UnionJD VanceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Now it’s all about cutting ‘waste’ in the form of jobs and our already paltry social safety netFri 28 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 13.15 ESTShareDuring his presidential campaign, Donald Trump never missed an opportunity to harp on inflation, promising that“on day one”he would “end inflation” and lower the costs of groceries, cars and other common goods.Well, it’s day 40, and inflation saw itslargest increasein over a year. Blink and you might have missed that Trump and his fellow Republicans have largely abandoned their concerns about inflation to focus on government “waste”.While Trump hasn’t fulfilled his campaign promise, he is living up to his usual brand of politics: the blame game. And this blame, as usual, is rooted in generating anger against “undeserving” Americans.Trump pits immigrants against other working people. But we have a common enemy |  Alejandra Gomez and Greisa Martínez RosasRead moreThis time, the undeserving are federal workers and poor people who get nominal benefits from the federal government – like Snap, which administers food stamps, and Medicaid. To fix so-called waste, the president apparently has no choice but to crack down on spending (and enlist help fromElon Musk), an issue that barely registered in the public consciousness in thepast 10 yearsbut is somehow now a rampant problem, according to Trump.There are policy frameworks backing Trump and the GOP’s divisiveness, including the well-known Project 2025 and a lesser-known House proposal published in 2024,Fiscal Sanity to Save America,that centers government “waste” instead of corporate greed. And now, with Republicans controlling the House, Senate and presidency, Republicans have the power to act on cuts that will harm millions of Americans.Musk and Trump, of course, have already worked to cut thousands of federal workers’ jobs. And with the Trump-backed budget bill the House passed on Wednesday, including $800bn in likelycuts from Medicaid, Republicans are one step closer to bulldozing America’s already paltry social safety net.This isn’t just at the federal level.Republicanshave been floating proposals in state governments that would restrict healthcare, housing and food benefits instead of making it easier to afford things.The party of “freedom” is endorsing government home visits to surveil “fraud” in all US states (according to page 43 of the GOP’s “Fiscal Sanity” plan). The party of “family values” is also turning its attention to school lunch and breakfast programs, which it claims are subject to “widespread” fraud and abuse (page 46). The party that wants to “make America healthy again” is floating restrictions to Medicaid that would make recipients work at least 80 hours a month, a proposal that wastes government time and money to verify work requirements and which would probably justdeterpeople from getting healthcare, as a flailing GOP work requirement experiment inGeorgiahas shown.And as Trumptouts himselfas an anti-war president, his proposals belie the fact that much of these spending cuts will now be diverted to defense contracts and othermilitary and border spending, not on improving the economic lives of everyday workers to whom he made sweeping campaign promises.Meanwhile, straightforward proposals to simply give people more money (whichdoeshaveevidenceof working), such as universal basic income, would be outright banned at the federal level under the GOP plan. So as the cost of living is primed to increase, Republicans have ready-made excuses to justify cutting billions of dollars from these programs, an exceptional sort of cruelty.Focusing on extreme examples animates America’s propensity for divisiveness, giving Republicans wide latitude to wreck the lives of millionsOf course, no one wants to see public money being spent wastefully or fraudulently. But incessant focus on “waste” stems from faulty, selective evidence. According to reports from Musk’s own so-called “department of government efficiency”, nearly 40% of cancelled contracts to cut costs are expected to yieldno savings.It also stems from something else that does have proven results: the utility of public outrage.Focusing on extreme examples and “undeserving” government beneficiaries animates America’s existing propensity for divisiveness, giving Trump and his party wide latitude to wreck the lives of millions of people who don’t engage in fraud, waste or abuse. When Reagan wanted tax cuts for the rich, we saw the “welfare queen” trope. When neoliberal Democrats and Republicans wanted to cut public housing at the federal and local level, we saw extreme stories about thecriminalityof people who lived there. We cannot waste the money of hard-working Americans on these “others”. It’s a narrative – often hinging on racism and sexism – that has great outcomes for America’s capitalist class and the politicians who support them.So instead of protesting against the rising cost of living or making demands for universal healthcare, federal job guarantees, increased labor rights, or Snap benefits for all, or cutting the bloated defense budget and increasing taxes on the super-rich to pay for the nominal social welfare benefits that other industrial countries have normalized, working-class Americans are engaging in pettydebatesabout what kinds of groceries other working-class Americans should buy anddeputizingthemselves to root out “abuse” among other workers.Republicans redirecting blame towards people who are suffering in this economy under the guise of “waste” is a distraction. As inflation ispoisedto worsen under Trump, Americans would be wise to focus their anger more on the elected officials and billionaires who profit from their pain than on each other.Malaika Jabali is a 2024 New America fellow, journalist and author of It’s Not You, It’s Capitalism: Why It’s Time to Break Up and How to Move OnExplore more on these topicsUS domestic policyOpinionDonald TrumpInflationTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The world’s richest man and patron of far-right causes worldwide has taken on his bizarre and extra-constitutional role in theTrump administrationwith an unexpected enthusiasm, enlisting a small squadron ofcollege-aged boysto drasticallycut spendingacross vast swaths of the sprawling US bureaucracy. His efforts have led topublic healthandsafetycrises in America,humanitarian emergenciesabroad, economic devastation in families and communities thatdepend onfederal employment, and the end of large amounts of Americanscientific and medical research. He has helped cut off funding forcancer researchandEbola prevention; he has ended services fordisabled children,abused womenandvictims of consumer fraud.Musk has said that he aims tocut the federal budget by $2tn, though he hasdramatically overstatedthe amount of spending cuts that he has achieved thus far – and does not seem to understand that some of these expenditures, such as the ones that prevent mass injury or disease, may in factsavethe government money.Congress, for its part, is playing along. On Tuesday, HouseRepublicanspasseda budget resolution that dramatically cuts funding to Medicaid, the federal program that provides healthcare coverage to low-income Americans. But much of Musk’s slash-and-burn project to eliminate the functioning of the government comes from firing federal workers – which he seems to think he has the authority to do at will.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

The email, subject line “What did you do last week?”, asked every federal employee to list five “bullet points” describing their recent working accomplishments. Musk later stipulated on X, his social media platform, that anyone who did not respond by midnight on Monday night would be fired. With one missive, Musk appointed himself the manager of every single one of the federal government’s estimated 2.3 million employees. Report to him, they were told, or lose your jobs.Chaos ensued. Some employees said that responding to such an email would put them in legal danger, since they work on sensitive or classified material. Others were weary of auditioning for positions they already held, and submitting their work for the appraisal of an unelected billionaire whose claim to authority over their jobs has no legal basis. Supervisors were swamped with calls from their employees, asking what they should do about the email; they, in turn, tried to get clarity from upper management.At some agencies, work was derailed as teams spent time trying to figure out what to do with Musk’s demand; at others, employees who had gone home for the weekend had to come back into work because they could not access their work emails for instructions from their home computers. People were calling their bosses, their union reps, their colleagues, confused and panicked, wondering what would happen to them if they lost their health insurance or couldn’t make their car payment.The frightening speed with which the Trump administration has pursued its sadistic agenda can tend to obscure just how incompetent these people areIt did not help matters that different government departments responded to Musk’s ultimatum with different instructions for their employees. Some told workers to respond to the email; others told them not to. Ahastily assembled group of officialsfrom defense and intelligence agencies spent the weekend trying to figure out a coordinated response, with the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and the FBI head, Kash Patel, ultimatelytelling their staff to ignore it. Agencies including the Departments of State, Energy, Justice, and Defense also told their workers not to respond. But others, such as the Departments of Commerce, Education and Transportation, told their employees that they should comply. Things only got more confusing on Monday when the office of personnel management, the federal government’s HR body, through which Musk initially sent the mass email,tried to back offthe billionaire’s demand, telling the management of various government entities that it would be up to each to determine how to direct its employees to respond. But thenDonald Trumpappeared to reiterateMusk’s initial demand, saying in the Oval Office of federal workers who did not respond to Musk’s email: “If you don’t answer, like, you’re sort of semi-fired or you’re fired.”Who, exactly, is in charge here? The frightening speed with which the newTrump administrationhas pursued its sadistic agenda and frightening and unconstitutional expansion of executive powers can tend to obscure just how incompetent these people are. Two million federal workers now do not know whether their boss is the person above them on the org chart, or an erratic billionaire. Trying to figure it out required them to spend time in hectic and undignified scrambling, figuring out whether they would be obliged to grovel for their livelihoods or not. They spent time catering to the senseless and stupid demands of Musk’s ego, and because they had to spend their time that way, they could not spend it on their actual work.Three billionaires: America’s oligarchy is now fully exposed | Robert ReichRead moreNot to mention that Musk, in his demand to control all federal employees and to rewrite the budgets and missions of federal agencies at a whim, seems to be pissing some people off. Members of the Trump cabinet have been leaking their displeasure with Musk over the past week, trying to assert control over their agencies and defend their turf. They, after all, have the Senate confirmations; they, after all, have the mandate of being selected by the president. It is yet to be seen whether any of that will hold a candle to what Musk has: the money.So far, the future is not looking bright for agency independence. Musk, who is not a cabinet member, appeared on Tuesdayat a meetingof Trump’s cabinet and lectured the assembled agency heads just hours after the initial deadline had passed for their employees to report to him. Trump seemed to signal to the cabinet members that they should assume that an order from Musk was as good as an order from him. “Is anybody unhappy with Elon?” Trump asked, according tothe New York Times. The response? “Nervous laughter rippled around the table.”Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

People have long looked to our declaration of independence and constitution as blueprints for how to guarantee those human rights and freedoms.Tragically, all of that is changing. AsDonald Trumpmoves this country towards authoritarianism, he is aligning himself with dictators and despots who share his disdain for democracy and the rule of law.This week, in a radical departure from longstanding US policy, the Trump administration votedagainstaUnited Nationsresolution which clearly stated that Russia began the horrific war with Ukraine. That resolution also called on Russia to withdraw its forces from occupied Ukraine, in line with international law. The resolution was brought forward by our closest allies, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and dozens more democratic nations. And 93 countries voted “yes”.Rather than side with our longstanding allies to preserve democracy and uphold international law, the president voted with authoritarian countries such asRussia, North Korea, Iran and Belarus to oppose the resolution. Many of the other opponents of that resolution are undemocratic nations propped up by Russian military aid.Let’s be clear: this was not just another UN vote. This was the president of the United States turning his back on 250 years of our history and openly aligning himself with Russian dictatorVladimir Putin. This was the president of the United States undermining the independence of Ukraine.And let us not forget who Putin is. He is the man who crushed Russia’s movement towards democracy after the end of the cold war. He steals elections, murders political dissidents and crushes freedom of the press. He has maintained control in Russia by offering the oligarchs there a simple deal: if you give me absolute power, I will let you steal as much as you want from the Russian people. He sparked the bloodiest war inEuropesince the second world war.It has been three years since Russia’s brutal, unprovoked, full-scale invasion ofUkraine. More than 1 million people have been killed or injured because of Putin’s aggression. Every single day, Russia rains down hundreds of missiles and drones on Ukrainian cities. Putin’s forces have massacred civilians and kidnapped thousands of Ukrainian children, bringing them back to Russian “re-education” camps. These atrocities led the international criminal court to issue an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023 as a war criminal.Not only is Trump aligning himself with Putin’s Russia, he is prepared to extort Ukraine for its natural resources. While a proud nation desperately fights for its life, Trump is focused on helping his billionaire friends make a fortune excavating rare earths and other minerals.But Trump’s turn toward authoritarianism and rejection of international law goes well beyond Ukraine.The president sees the world’s dictators as his friends, our democratic allies as his enemies and the use of military force as the way to achieve his goals. Disgracefully, he wants topush 2.2 million Palestinians out of their homelandin order to build a billionaire’s playground in Gaza. He talks openly aboutannexing Greenlandfrom Denmark. He says the United States shouldtake back the Panama canal. And he ruptures our friendship with our Canadian neighbors bytelling themthey should become the 51st state in the union.The Guardian view on Trump’s realignment: the geopolitical plates are moving. Brace for further shocks | EditorialRead moreAlongside his fellow oligarchs in Russia, Saudi Arabia and around the globe, Trump wants a world ruled by authoritarians in which might makes right, and where democracy and moral values cease to exist.Just over a century ago, a handful of monarchs, emperors and tsars ruled most of the world. Sitting in extreme opulence, they claimed that absolute power was their “divine right”. But ordinary people disagreed.Slowly and painfully, in countries throughout the world, they clawed their way toward democracy and rejected colonialism.At our best, the US has played a key role in the movement toward freedom. From Gettysburg to Normandy, millions of Americans have fought – and many have died – to defend democracy, often alongside brave men and women from other nations.This is a turning point – a moment of enormous consequence in world history. Do we go forward toward a more democratic, just and humane world? Or do we retreat back into oligarchy, authoritarianism, colonialism and the rejection of international law?As Americans, we cannot stay quiet as Trump abandons centuries of our commitment to democracy. Together, we must fight for our long-held values and work with people around the world who share them.Bernie Sanders is a US senator and a ranking member of the health, education, labor and pensions committee.

Hunter Schafer, a 26-year-old actor best known for her roles on the HBO series Euphoria and in the Hunger Games film The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, appeared in an eight-minute video last Friday in which she revealed that due to aTrump administrationorder, she had been assigned a passport with the gender marker “male”.Schafer, who is trans, began living as a girl in her early teens; she has lived as a woman for her entire adult life. In her video, she says that her IDs have been marked “female” for just about as long as she has had them. But after her passport was stolen in a car break-in in Barcelona, she has been issued a government identity document that represents a fiction that she is a man. Every time she travels now, she will have to present this document, she will have to account for the discrepancy between what it says about her, and what she clearly is.In her video, Schafer stresses her own privilege: for her, the incorrect passport is not a matter of life and death. But the harm to dignity that the new document will impose on her will be repeated, intimate and needless. It is an exercise in cruelty that the Trump administration has declared that official documents, like passports, will no longer reflect these basic realities of trans people’s lives. It is also a brute assertion of the Trump administration’s claim to control over reality itself: a way for them to make a lie into an official truth.Schafer is right that many trans Americans will fare even worse than she will. In a flurry of executive actions in their first days in office, the Trump regime issued a rapid flurry of anti-trans executive orders. They banned trans servicemembers from the military; the Pentagon is nowmoving to firethem all. They barred trans women and girls from participating in sports, and theNCAA promptly complied, throwing athletes off their teams in a reversal of 15 years of policy. They ordered that trans people not be granted equal access to housing and shelters, and Trump’s Housing and Urban Development department promptly stopped enforcing civil rights rules.They issued an order banning transition-related care for young people – people like the teenager Schafer had been when she began transitioning – and a number ofhospitals and clinics canceled appointments, leaving often desperate patients with no way to get care. And this week, the Trump state department announced that it woulddeny visas for transgender athletescoming from abroad to compete in the United States before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics – a move that also seems designed to allow them to deny all visas to trans travelers. This rapid mobilization across vastly different sectors of the law will have immediate and far-reaching results. It will ruin lives.The Trump administration and the broader revanchist movement are targeting trans people because they are a tiny minority that they think can be bullied and dehumanized without great political pushback. They are targeting trans people because trans life represents the principles of dignity, self-determination and gender equality that they abhor. And they are targeting trans people because they are hateful, sadistic and cruel – because they want to make people suffer for the crime of being different from them, and because they do not have the courage to pick on anyone who is more capable of fighting back.But the anti-trans sadism of the new Trump administration should not only offend us because it is cruel. It should offend us because it demands that government departments, federally funded institutions, and the people who work for them participate in a lie: that trans people are not who they say they are.Trump singled me out for ruining women’s sport. This is my response to him |  Austin KillipsRead moreTransphobes like those in the Trump administration have long smugly declared themselves the arbiters of the “truth” about gender – that it is fixed, that there are two, that gender is merely a brute fact of the body that cannot be changed, and that nothing that happens to a person after their sex is assigned at birth has any bearing on the truth of what their gender is. They have declared this with immense self-satisfaction; they have declared themselves rational, and intelligent, and even brave for saying it.But the gender marker on Hunter Schafer’s passport is not true; it represents a lie, an assertion in total contradiction not only to how she sees herself, but to how everyone else sees her, to the reality of how she lives her life. Every trans person who is issued a wrong document is coerced into this same lie; every other person, cisgender or not, who has to work with these documents and in deference to these policies is coerced into a lie, too. We are told that what we see and feel and experience of trans people does not count, that we should not believe our lying eyes. We are told that no official body of the federal government will accept the plain and obvious truth.Anti-trans hysteria, then, should be understood as a function of the Trump administration’s epistemic violence, its mission to make lies into policy and to suppress truth. It is as much of a lie that Hunter Schafer is a man as it is thatDonald Trumpwon the 2020 election, or that vaccines cause autism, or that climate change isn’t real. There is a moral case to be made for resistance to these orders, but there is also an intellectual one. We do not have to be as stupid, in the face of trans existence, as the Trump administration demands that we be. We do not have to pretend not to know things that we do.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionTransgenderUS politicsDonald TrumpGendercommentShareReuse this content"

Australiansare the largest consumers of fast fashion in the world, and wedispose of our clotheswith an intensity that reflects this.The simplest antidote to fashion’s impacts is wearing clothes for longer. A2017 study foundextending the life of a garment by just nine months could reduce its carbon, waste and water footprints by up to 20%. With this in mind, here are eight ways to spot durable garments you’ll be able to keep, repair and wear for an extended time.1: MaterialsThe most significant determinant of a garment’s durability is what it’s made from. Start by rubbing the fabric between your fingers to get a sense of the hand – “how something feels when you touch it,” says Gareth Kershaw, a lecturer in fashion technology from RMIT University. Take into consideration things like softness, smoothness, fluff, elasticity, strength, drape and density.Next, according to sustainable design consultant Kristen Nuttall, you should check the label to see the fabric composition. “Is this a wool cashmere, or is it a viscose blend made to feel like cashmere?” she says.Natural fibres like cotton, linen, wool, cashmere and silk will generally be more durable when not blended with a synthetic like elastane, polyester or nylon. A telltale sign of high-quality cotton and wool is a smooth finish as this indicates longer, finer staple fibres. The density of a knit or weave is another sign of quality as it generally requires more fibres (which is more expensive) and reflects that advanced technology was used in production.2: ConstructionThe next step is to assess how a garment has been constructed, which means taking a look inside.A well-made garment will have thoughtfully constructed openings and closures that are reinforced at more than one point (like a button that does up inside the lapel or a tab inside the top of the fly on trousers). And they will move with you. When you try a jacket or shirt on, there should be no tension when you raise your arms. Similarly, trousers shouldn’t pull or gape when you sit down.In the context of construction, elastane is a red flag. It has a four-way stretch, which is necessary for swimwear and underwear, but in other garments, it does a lot of heavy lifting to make poorly constructed clothes fit. Plus, over time, it loses elasticity from repeated stretching and washing, which causes the material to sag.3: SeamsSomething else to pay attention to is how neat the seams are.French seams – folded over and sewn down along both edges – and those bound so the edges are covered are much stronger and more durable. These, Kershaw says, “give you more stability in the garment itself” compared with the widely used overlocked or lock stitch seams with a row of stitches running along a raw edge. Dodgy seams will also have larger stitches, which indicates that a garment was rushed through the machine quickly. This can lead to faults like puckering in the fabric.4: LiningSince it adds warmth, keeps the exterior of a garment from getting dirty and makes it more pleasant to get dressed, lining is another indicator of quality. But it’s important to be mindful of what it’s made from, as cheap polyester, nylon or acetate will disrupt any thermoregulating properties in the outer layer since they don’t breathe and make garments feel sticky and sweaty. Look for lining made from cupro, silk, cotton, modal or lyocell.5: PocketsWell-placed, deep pockets made from a thin but strong material are another indicator that a garment has been designed and manufactured by someone skilled and knowledgable.“Pockets can wear out quickly, so the quality of the fabric is important, as is the placement,” Kershaw says. Look for pockets that have been reinforced or tucked into the seams and are sitting appropriately on the body so when you put something inside them, it won’t fall out or upset the line of the garment.6: Effective hardwareThe weight and material of zippers, buttons, press studs and hook-and-eyes are also key. “There should be an elegance to opening and closing the zippers or snap buttons or whatever the fastening is,” Nuttall says. “If it’s difficult and they’re not functioning well, that’s a sign of a garment that wasn’t well considered.”7: Versatility and repairability“If something is well made, as you grow or shrink and change or your style changes, you should be able to adapt it,” says Nuttall.Look for garments that have extra fabric stored in the seams so they can be let out or taken in if your body changes. Or design features like ties or fastenings that mean they can be worn in a variety of ways.8: Emotional durabilityChoosing styles you love and want to keep wearing is perhaps the hardest thing to get right. It requires developing a strong sense of your own personal style – a good place to start is analysing what you already own and love to wear. It can help to view each new purchase as an investment, which might mean researching and saving up so you can find and afford the dress, trousers or coat with the most value embedded in it.Share your experiencePlease share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It was the January 1984 issue, with model and pop-rock singer Nick Kamen on the cover, in a ski cap. As a young kid, I bought magazines weekly, starting with Look-in, a preteen music and television magazine, followed by the brightly coloured teen bible Smash Hits and then the Face, the last two founded by Nick Logan. The Face was like a cool, older teenager who invited you into a sexy new world where fashion, music and design fused to create a revolutionary culture. As a young Black gay man, that invitation meant everything.This truly was the heyday of magazines, as I was reminded when visitingThe Face Magazine: Culture Shiftat the National Portrait Gallery last week. I was moved to see all of the magazine covers and spreads that I had collected and hung up on the walls in my youth. There was a particular image of the Kiss FM crew in their studio with Norman Jay, Gordon Mac and Paul “Trouble” Anderson, DJs whom I had loved and followed. When I was 16 and had left school, the Face opened a window into London’s arts, music, clubbing, queer and fashion scene, which took me out of my small world in south London and allowed me to aspire to something different. Beyond the capital’s walls, the magazine introduced me to the emerging house music scene in Chicago and New York, and foreign-language films.The 1980s and 90s are often described as something of a “monoculture”, a period in which there was a shared participation in cultural phenomena – people watching the same shows and consuming the same music. But the decades saw an explosion of youth subcultures, and the Face revealed and brought together different tribes that were previously siloed off – rockabillies, rude boys, skinheads, soul heads, goths. What was important to me as a young person was that the Face told you that you didn’t have to belong to one tribe; it could be cool for you to enjoy pop music and a bit of ska and a bit of soul.The Face also did not simply report on culture, it shaped it, and it helped me build a sense of style and identity. Images created by the Buffalo movement, a fashion collective headed up by the stylist Ray Petri and the photographer Jamie Morgan, often filled the pages and the cover. Buffalo had drawn on Jamaican culture, dancehall music and hip-hop, and embraced sports labels such as Lacoste, Fila and Sergio Tacchini. It also pioneered playing around with gender representation – putting men into leather skirts with combat boots; choosing steely, masculine depictions of women over glitter and elegance.View image in fullscreenMarc Thompson looking at a photo of Clinton McKenzie at The Face Magazine: Culture Shift exhibition.Photograph: Marc ThompsonThe Face also used a diverse range of models, and had Black men as cover stars at a time when you would not see them in fashion stories or magazines anywhere else. It featured young Black male models now lost to historysuch as Tony Felix, Simon de Montfort and Wade Tolero. In June 1985, a month before I came out as gay to my family, the boxer Clinton McKenzie was on the cover of the Face in a beret with his muscles bursting out of his shorts and tank top. It’s an image I still love now.That truly subversive, culture-defining era of magazines feels like a bygone era now. Perhaps I cannot claim, at age 55, to be completely tapped into the youth market, but the landscape of culture and the means of its dissemination are so much broader now. The decline of print magazines in the 2000s and 2010s was a consequence of the rise of the internet and social media, which spawned millions of cultural influencers and micro-trends. While magazines such as the Face weren’t gatekeepers of culture, they were published by a select few people who set the narrative. Trends now feel much less substantial and much less consequential for popular culture.I remember being heartbroken when the Face closed down in 2004. While I had stopped collecting the magazine in the mid-90s, moving on to the more sophisticated GQ and Vanity Fair, it felt like one sign that we were entering a new era. The Face was founded at the beginning of the Thatcher era, and carried on through to New Labour and the explosion of Britpop. By the time it closed, the optimism of New Labour was crumbling, the advent of technology was not bringing the innovation and productivity gains for which we had hoped, and soon enough a financial crisis would appear on the horizon. The death of this truly British youth style bible – a symbol of growth, cultural revolution and promise – was the canary in the coalmine.The Face Magazine: Culture Shift review – rebellious fashion photography with a raucous sense of funRead moreI have followed the Face from a distance since itsrelaunch in 2019and am pleased to see it back. Perhaps magazines cannot shape culture in the same way as they did in my youth. The pursuit of clicks means magazines, with their additional digital presence, are now doomed to follow trends rather than set them. However, the preservation of definitive print products feels vital when our culture is dominated by an online world in which our attention is infinitely split and an identity is hard to establish. Perhaps I’ll go out and buy a copy again, even if I won’t have the foggiest what anything in there means any more.Marc Thompson is a queer archivist and the lead commissioner of the London HIV Prevention ProgrammeAs told to Jason OkundayeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Labor has tried to discredit the opposition leader as out of touch with ordinary Australians. Meanwhile Dutton has accused Labor of powering up its “dirt unit”.Votersdon’t likethis brand of politicking because it alienates them in two ways.First, it reeks ofeconomic detachment. When everyday Australians are struggling to stay afloat, watching politicians fighting over the profits of the housing and share markets feels like salt in the wound.Second, it deepens political distrust. For young voters in particular, this spectacle confirms that politics is more theatre than substance.Dutton defends ‘astute’ share purchases and late property disclosures as Labor demands detailsRead moreHousing remains one of the biggest sore points for Australians, perhaps because it is so entrenched in our cultural identity. In times of rising interest rates and a cost-of-living crisis, politicians accumulating wealth – particularly through investment in real estate – understandably strikes a nerve.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThis is because the economic equation for many Australians feels broken: hard work no longer guarantees you a home, or even financial security.Dutton has defended his investment decisions and said he“didn’t grow up with a silver spoon”in his mouth. But this mindset ignores just how significantly the housing market, and therefore the distribution of wealth, has changed. As Greg Jericho points out, for anyoneborn before the mid-1970s, home ownership wasn’t about grit – it was about timing.Sadly for many Australians, a home is out of reach, and even surviving has become a challenge. The number of Australians experiencing long-term homelessness hassurged almost 25%in just five years.About 30%of Australians now find it difficult or very difficult to get by on their current income. And renters are drowning under a36% rent hikenationally since the pandemic, with even middle-income earners spending a third of their income just to keep a roof over their heads.But instead of serious policy discussions and solutions, politicians are turning to point scoring. In a time of economic hardship, this is especially unpalatable to voters.Trust in parliament and federal leadership has been insteady decline since 2022, and this has been driven in part by a rise in financial stress. Nearly four in 10 Australians are dissatisfied with the direction of the country, and a staggering 62% have little to no confidence in the federal government.Amid these figures, those struggling financially aremore likelyto be dissatisfied with the direction of the country and democracy, to be less trusting of politicians and key political institutions, and to feel shut out of the system. So negative campaigning – such as attacks on politicians’ wealth – can feel tone-deaf and entrench disillusionment even further.With a federal election campaign just weeks away, politicians need to give people solutions. Australians are heading to the polls with cost of living, housing and healthcare as theirtop concerns. They want to feel as though the people in charge are trying to make these issues better.The election will be atight race, but voters deserve more than point scoring. At this stage leadership remains uninspiring, with neither major party offering much in the way of healthy, respectful and meaningful debate that breaks down complex political issues for voters and then convinces them that their respective policy offers a better relief for those under stress.Without respectful dialogue, the risk of disengagement is real.If politicians keep playing the blame game, they shouldn’t be surprised when fewer people bother to listen.Dr Intifar Chowdhury is a youth researcher and a lecturer in government at Flinders UniversityExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionPeter DuttonHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

A parable for our timesJane MartinsonOf the many lessons arising from this week’s report into the presenter’s alleged bullying and misogyny, one is the corporate cynicism that sustained himFri 28 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 06.04 ESTShareMore than 30 years have passed since Tim Westwood joined the BBC, 12 since he left and three since Guardian and BBC journalistsreported on allegations of abuseby a man considered by the corporation to be the voice of hip hop. Then this week, some of the many concerns raised during his 19 years working therewere detailedin the latest edition of one of the BBC’s weightiest and longest-running series, Official Reports into Men We Employ Behaving Very Badly.Westwood’s career at the Beeb ended in 2013, amid a flurry of accusations and a sense of deja vu best summarised as “oh God, not another one”. But the 174-page report is well worth reading, not just for what it says about theBBCbut, as so often with the media, what it says about attitudes in Britain.First, there’s the heartbreaking testimony from so many young women, mainly young Black women – claims of abuse that they say left them feeling so awful they blamed themselves or ended up contemplating suicide. Many did not realise the alleged behaviour was wrong until they were much older and admitted they didn’t report it at the time as they feared they would not be believed or would be blamed. The worst allegations are redacted because of ongoing police investigations. Westwood has denied all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and says he has not had the opportunity to answer the allegations, partly because of the ongoing police investigation.Then there was the apparent blind-eye turning to let’s just call it dodgy behaviour by a man who was not only considered a star, but was one of just two BBC presenters in 1997 to have,according to BBC research“made an impact with young Black and Asian listeners”. Yes there are the many junior staff members who complained of bullying and harassment but ended up being moved instead of the main man, but there is also in this scandal the extra spice of the BBC’s patronising efforts to be not only down with the kids but down with Black and minority kids. Let’s call it the “Ali G factor”.Westwood, the public school-educated son of an Anglican bishop turned pirate radio DJ, joined BBC Radio 1 in 1994 to launch the UK’s first national hip-hop radio show. He was described as a “dominant force” in rap music, a genre popular among the young people, particularly Black ones, who didn’t listen to the BBC. Both of the BBC Radio 1 controllers in charge during Westwood’s tenure mentioned the need for the BBC to attract this demographic. The Radio 1 controller between 1998 and 2001 described Westwood as being “bilingual”, able to speak to BBC management in a language they understood and could also “authentically connect” with a young minority audience. Westwood’s bad language and sexualised commentary was, according to a BBC executivequoted in the report“a sort of swaggering hip hop cartoon character”. When asked in 2017 for the highlights of his time running the station, Matthew Bannister started with “Westwood’s rammed stage at the Notting Hill carnival”.So, in summary, the BBC hired the white, middle-class son of a vicar who affected the vulgar language of rappers (and once met the Notorious BIG and was, sort of, friends with Pharrell Williams) in an effort to increase cultural representation and appeal to Black and Asian listeners on the national broadcaster. Let that sink in. Could there be a greater example of the dangers of Auntie throwing all caution to the wind to be down with the kids, kids she feels are not her own, kids she doesn’t understand, kids she apparently made little genuine effort to understand?The report leads to many conclusions, but one that seems inescapable is how much the BBC still needs diversity among its staff. It must be obvious this does not mean middle-aged posh white boys pretending to be Black. It means more people of colour, some of them minority women.The problem of under-representation in the media is not unique to the BBC and at least the corporation has made strides to get better. In 2019 Lorna Clarke, a Black woman, became first, controller of pop and then director of music at the BBC. But despite a target of 20% minority ethnic staff, just17% of its staff are not white.The BBC response to this latest report shows that some things have been learned since the run of scandals going back to Savile in 2011. In a statement that outlined changed processes since and promised to do better, the BBC admitted that it had for too long “been too siloed [and] deferential to high profile individuals”. New processes for complaints to allow allegations to be looked at together rather than piecemeal are also in place. A review into its broader culture launched bySamir Shah, its first minority ethnic chair as well as a distinguished former journalist, will be produced by the end of this year.This review should consider the culture of silence around inappropriate behaviour by many powerful men, some of whom were moulded and feted by the BBC. But it should also address the lazy thinking that led to this scandal, this trauma – continuing for so many victims – while everyone looked the other way.The problem with saying “not again” is that we keep on having to say it.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If I listed all the structural acronyms throughout the decades, and the new staff starting new jobs with new brass nameplates, it would fill this page.This week, Wes Streeting accepted the resignation of NHS England’s chief executive,Amanda Pritchard, after ousting its chair,Richard Meddings, signalling an effective merger in all but name with Streeting’s own department. Whitehall says NHS England will have “a smaller, leaner role”, with thousands of duplicated jobs lost.Few people will regret the swallowing up of this remnant of the disastrous 2012 Lansley reforms, which fragmented everything in the NHS. Pritchard and Meddings recently suffered an unwarranted pasting by the Commons public accounts and health committees fortheir lack of “ideas”, but that was hardly fair. They had been barred from revealing the health department’s imminent 10-year plan. And there is a truth that the committees ignored that bears stating here: the NHS is on the turn for the better.Jim Mackey takes over NHS England, and even those who say Pritchard got the push unfairly tell me they welcome his arrival. Currently CEO of Newcastle hospitals foundation trust, he was head ofNHS Improvementwith a record of innovation until it was abolished by one of the three Tory health secretaries passing through in 2022. It’s also worth saying that Pritchard suffered six changes of health secretary in three and half years.I interviewed Mackey two years ago when he had returned to Northumbria healthcare trust, to start a pioneering scheme that others now copy. Failure to bind social care with the NHS leavesmore than 13,000 beds in Englandtaken up by old people waiting for a care package.Mackey set up a care system within his trust to relieve hospital bed shortages. His Northumbria Care is an NHS-owned domiciliary service that bids for social care contracts from local authorities that would usually be awarded to private providers, seamlessly integrating care within the health service. Here is a smooth transition without bottlenecks between the two sectors, with health and social care funded from the same budget, and every incentive to stop patients needing a hospital bed, and to get them home quicker.Heplanned to build care homesto take over residential contracts too, if he could raise the capital.The idea short-circuits the cumbersome introduction of 42 integrated care boards (ICBs). They were designed to bring local services together, but are largely regarded as failing. They lack the clout to knock local heads together so that GP and community services integrate with hospitals. They have no power over integrating local authority social care. Half the ICBs are in debt; they may yet be merged into half that number.Rarely has top talent moved from hospitals to run ICBs. Instead, many hospitals are forming groups, which may work better than ICBs. These are not big-bang changes and they slide under the radar, but the Mackey model has inspired other trusts to try similar schemes: expect more of that thinking from him.8:48‘Fix poverty, fix health’: A day in the life of a ‘failing’ NHSThe Darzi reportlaid bare the state of the NHS Labour inherited. Austerity cut everything, including medical training, with huge gaps in staff as the NHS struggled to cope with the effects of deprivation and a far sicker population.Streeting is rightly wary of boasting about any progress yet, given public outrage over the still appalling waiting lists (7.46 million cases,according to the British Medical Association), as well as ambulance delays, andailing A&EandGP services. The Treasury, meanwhile, seems happy to say that NHS productivity is lagging and that extra money ploughed in is failing to produce enough improvement. But that’s not the whole story, and the NHS should speak up. The Treasury traditionally sees the NHS as a bottomless pit, but its productivity is being badly misrepresented with faulty Office for National Statistics figures that are eagerly seized on by enemies of the NHS on the right.Anita Charlesworth, senior economist at theHealthFoundation thinktank, says ONS figures only count acute hospital activity, leaving out the 12,000 new virtual hospital-at-home beds. These are costly, but less expensive than actual hospital beds. The stats leave out GP care. Productivity there is rising fast now that GPs are paid to seek advice from specialists, instead of automatically referring patients to them directly: 1.5 million fewer patients have been referred, the department tells me. Instead, they are being cared for in surgeries under guidance. That GP productivity should be counted in.The concerted attack on assisted dying won’t stop the public supporting this bill | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThedepartment’s own figuresshow waiting lists falling and the 2m extra appointments promised within a year have been provided months early, with surgical hubs working evenings and weekends, as well as new diagnostic units.In his last month as chair, Meddings points to widespread improvements, a service “overwhelmed”, but not “broken”, he tells me. GP appointments are rising fast: 98% of surgeries have digital phones ensuring every call is answered, or called back promptly, with half the callers getting same-day appointments, and 70% face-to-face consultations. April’s year end figures will show “NHS productivity up 2.5%, more than any other public service”, Meddings said. He echoed the curious optimism you often hear throughout the NHS, even from those who describe near-impossible tasks undertaken to cope with rising need.Keep perspective. Trolleys line many A&E corridors, ambulance delays persist, waiting times are horrendous. I hear laments from managers and medics facing the prospect of 4% “efficiency savings” next year, to be achieved on top of already existing deficits, which must also be cleared. (Spoiler alert: they won’t be.)But there is hope. Times are tough and funding remains below the NHS historic average. But, as the Health Foundation’s Charlesworth says, this is not a repeat of the NHS austerity years.Statistics are just that, and what they represent cuts through very slowly, so it will take a long time before the public feels and believes in progress. But, for all the turmoil, green shoots are there.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionWes StreetingLabourHealth policyHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The message is clear: the new government must offer hope, not hatredFri 28 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 03.23 ESTShareGermany’s next government will be a coalition of the political centre led by the conservativeFriedrich Merz. That may sound like stability. Traditionally, a government made up of the two big centrist parties, the Social Democrats (SPD) and Merz’s Christian Democrats (CDU), has been called the grand coalition. But it is no longer grand and offers only an illusion of stability.The SPD achieved its worst result in a national election since the second world war, with 16.4% of the vote. The CDU scored its second-worst result, with 28.5%. If you include the Greens and the Liberals, the parties that occupy the political ground from centre-left to centre-right won just over 60% of the votes cast.At the same time, the fringes are getting stronger. However, the poles of the political spectrum are unequal in two respects. First, the far-right AfD achieved its strongest result ever (20.8%), while the Left party (Die Linke) is celebrating a comeback but, with 8.8% of the vote, it is not even half as strong as the AfD. The second difference: despite itsrejection of Natoand the supply offurther weaponsto Ukraine, the Left is not as extreme as the AfD.The AfD’s gains have come from all sides: it gainedmore than a millionconservative votes,720,000 from the SPDand 890,000 from the Liberals. In other words, the rise of the far right is an inglorious joint effort by the conservatives and the previous SPD-led government.The SPD in effect allowed the AfD to become the strongest party among workers for the first time:38% of German workersvoted for the far right, while only 12% voted for the SPD. And even though the AfD was significantly strongerin eastern Germany(36%) than in west Germany (18%) overall, there was an alignment between east and west among working-class voters.The AfD’sstrongholdsin the west are regions that are experiencing industrial structural change such as parts of the Ruhr area, Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. This transition affects, in a broad sense, all energy-intensive industries such as the old coal sector and the car and chemical industries. All of these sectors are being converted to climate neutrality. The German Economic Institute has identified aregional correlationbetween a strong AfD and industries undergoing transformation. The climate transition triggers immense economic fears, and the SPD (and the Greens) have so far failed to allay them with a hopeful agenda.The strengthening of the AfD by the conservatives, however, follows a familiar pattern: the CDU has hardened its rhetoric and position on migration, bringing it closer to the AfD’s policies. Merz lifted the AfD to the zenith of its influence in the run-up to the election by forming a parliamentary majority with it for the first time on asymbolic resolutionon migration.Without doubt, there is an urgent need for action on migration: several deadly attacks in which the suspects were asylum seekers demonstrated this in a horrific way shortly before the election. But the solutions do not lie in a rapprochement with the positions of the AfD, which are not only anti-European and likely to fall foul of Germany’s legal obligations, but would also stifle immigration needed to sustain Germany’s labour market. The AfD is strongest in regions where residents encounter the fewest foreigners. Migrants are scapegoats for most AfD voters, partly because of xenophobia, but partly because the party succeeds in turning economic fears into cultural anger.The radically hardened discourse on migration also helped the Left party to mobilise votes. However, it was ultimately the Greens that made this leftwing success possible. Robert Habeck, the Greens’ candidate for chancellor, presented his own migration plan containing measures unusually harsh for progressives. He was appealing to conservative voters, but they were hardly likely to vote Green. Instead, Habeck opened up a space to the left of his party.Yes, the Left also addressed bread-and-butter issues such as high rents and food prices, but it lacked any truly innovative proposals, which is why it is not really the new hope for the progressive camp. Nevertheless, the Leftdrew many voters awayfrom the Greens.The AfD is not unhappy with its new role as the biggest opposition party, because it is focused on its “Project 2029”. Unlike Project 2025, a 900-page blueprint fordismantling and disruptingthe US government by a rightwing thinktank, this is less a plan for a coup d’état from within, but a strategy for gaining power. The AfD’s calculation: in a coalition with the SPD, the CDU will have to make painful compromises, which should lead to even more conservative voters switching to the AfD. If this happens, it could become the strongest force in the next election, expected in 2029.Whether that switch actually occurs is entirely in the hands of the new government. Steady growth of the AfD is not a foregone conclusion. The new government must do a number of things: first, the CDU must abandon its attempt to weaken the AfD by speaking like the AfD. Instead, it must develop a modern conservative agenda for migration and the economy, as well as Europe’s defence and support for Ukraine.Second, the SPD and CDU must not slow down the drive to modernise industry through climate action. Instead, the social anxieties of the middle and working classes must be addressed by creating clear prospects for jobs and regions.Third, the new government must restore trust in mainstream politics by exemplifying a new culture of cooperation in the centre. According to the research institute Infratest dimap,70% of German votersdo not want the AfD to govern. This majority needs to be reassured; it needs to be addressed emotionally and empathetically.If the new government takes such principles to heart, the AfD’s plan could quickly turn out to be hubris. In fact, what is really needed after this election is a Project 2029 in the progressive camp. Compelling ideas for a fair and climate-neutral society in a strong Europe were missing in this election campaign.The SPD will hardly be able to achieve a substantial renewal while governing with the CDU. Progressive renewal in Germany must come now from the Greens, who have the freedom to do so in opposition. Their central task will be not to follow a rightwing mainstream, but to translate progressive positions into better solutions and make them mainstream.Johannes Hillje is a Berlin-based political consultant and a fellow at Das Progressive Zentrum, an independent thinktankDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I would have just turned 11 years old and Dan Andrews was on his way to a second-straight victory. The only man to watch for results? Antony Green.At this time I was still – of course – just gaining an interest in the news, politics and especially elections. I sat down on the couch with a notepad and wrote down all 88 seats in the lower house, then proceeded to colour-code each seat with one of those four-colour pens. The only place for me to get information that night was from watching the ABC’s broadcast and quickly scribbling down a new result every time the hosts went back to Green. I was still seated by the time he made his election call several hours later.Only adding to the thrill for 11-year-old me was the fact thatmy local MP, John Pesutto, was on the ABC’s panel as results for the seemingly safe Liberal seat of Hawthorn came in and he lost his seat on-air.ABC election guru Antony Green says it’s ‘time to retire’ as he prepares to leave on-air roleRead moreWatching Green solidified my interest in the news and five months later I launched the channel known today as 6 News Australia. That of course didn’t end my interest in Green’s broadcasts and it wasn’t long before I was watching him on federal election night in 2019 asthe Morrison miracleunfolded.What really kept me watching (and I imagine I’m not the only one feeling this way) was just seeing someone explaining results so clearly – a huge contrast to some of the spin that we see on election-night panels. But it also helped explain terms that are now part of my election-related lexicon – swings, two-party-preferred, donkey votes – all basic now, but not when I was 11.Green played a crucial role in shaping my understanding of Australian elections and I know for a fact that that applies to many other people my age as well. When heannounced his retirementthis week the first person I heard it from was a schoolmate. In a time when fewer and fewer young people are consuming traditional media Green has been a constant for Australians of all ages during election season.Although presenting on 6 News has remained my focus on election nights, I’m open in saying that I will have the ABC election broadcast showing on another monitor, and all our other journalists will be watching as well – waiting for that final call. I also wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the case with all other newsrooms across the country.Something I believe has been under-appreciated about Green’s work is the stuff that’s not on air. This extends to extensive local, state and federal election guides, seat profiles and results analysis. In an age of increasing misinformation and disinformation about how Australian elections work – something Green himself has dealt with daily in tweets – having him as one of several clear, trustworthy sources to debunk lies is unbelievably important. He will still be working behind-the-scenes on election-related projects, which is great news for everyone looking for accurate data about how we vote as a nation.While I won’t be old enough to vote at this year’s federal election, I feel confident in saying I’ll be able to go into the voting booth for the 2026 Victorian state election – eight years after I first tuned into one of Green’s election broadcasts – and be informed on my vote. I’ll still be presenting 6 News election coverage this year but I can’t say no to tuning into his final broadcast either. And I won’t be surprised if we see a federal “Division of Green” show up in the future.Leo Puglisi is chief anchor and managing director at 6 News AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian Broadcasting CorporationOpinionAustralian election 2025Australian politicsVictorian politicsVictoriaAustralian mediaYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Decades ago he went off to New Mexico, away from the bright lights of fame. And the dog went with him and his wife. Hackman was a firm man – you might say hard. He had been a marine, and seldom bowed to all the suck-up stuff about being lovable and a movie star. He was 95.Clint Eastwoodis 94, Robert Duvall the same. Jack Nicholson is only 87, still the kid.Dustin Hoffman is 87 too, Robert Redford 88, Warren Beatty 87. Harrison Ford is 82, and he seems older, or worried. We can’t expect these guys to go on for ever, just because they’re geezers, veterans and not forgotten.Not all of those fellows are as hard as Hackman was. None of them could summon up the nastiness he had in Unforgiven or the desperate isolation of Harry Caul in The Conversation. Hackman went off to Santa Fe and stopped working (on movies, anyway), while Eastwood directed a picture last year, Juror #2, which was not bad. I wonder if Eastwood has dogs.View image in fullscreenBy any means necessary … Gene Hackman as sheriff Little Bill Daggett and Clint Eastwood as gunslinger William ‘Bill’ Munny in the 1992 western Unforgiven, which Eastwood directed.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarPeople speak of these guys and their generation as real or tough movie stars. I get the point, and I know it’s meant kindly. But bear in mind that Hackman, Nicholson, Eastwood and the others came of age as an earlier wave was dying off – Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Gary Cooper, who was the godfather then. He was only 60, but he had looked anxious for years, and he would have thought of Douglas Fairbanks Jr, John Gilbert and even Rudolph Valentino as the real men.It’s not just that the generations come and go, and that in time a name such as Power sounds fond or quaint. It’s more that we put a load of affection and expectation on stars and it can wear them out.We shouldn’t make as much as we do of actors and stars when they are trying to represent usHackman’s generation seem like “the right stuff” now, good guys who had come up the hard way and had to struggle for attention. But Philip Kaufman’s wry picture The Right Stuff realises that the stuff can be like a slogan or ice-cream. The best of us understand that real hardness is having your Medicaid slashed in Oklahoma or Kentucky, even if you were befuddled enough to vote for the golden slasher. Hard was the 1930s when you might be a vagrant hitching a ride on the burning prairie, wondering if you’d end up a thief or worse.We shouldn’t make as much as we do of actors and stars when they are trying to represent us – no matter the money, the wives, the residuals and the magazine covers.View image in fullscreenHold up … Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Gene Hackman in Bonnie and Clyde, 1967.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarThe stars who were “men” once know that the new generation has to wrestle with CGI and social media.Gene Hackman: the star of every scene he was inRead moreThere are guys around – such as Brad Pitt, Robert Downey Jr and Ed Harris – who may look like worn rock soon, as well as top actors. Can you anticipate Mel Gibson at 90? That’s only 21 years away, and maybe that’s too long to wait. Most of these fellows still remember their lines, or make them up. They can do an acceptable smile. It’s having to run on camera that finds them out.Actors playing strong men often fret over their own weakness. That’s how close to us they are, and why Hackman knew, without resentment, that no one quite looked at his character Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde, when Clyde was played by Warren Beatty.Hackman was firm enough to have no faith in being likable – and that is rare among movie actors, who can be comically insecure. So in The French Connection he was a rowdy scumbag, as great a danger as the advertised rascals. In Crimson Tide he was a grim tyrant, a threat to the world, someone Denzel Washington had to take down. He let us hate him. And in that role, as Captain Frank Ramsey, even on the submarine, he had a dog.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanClint EastwoodFilm industrycommentShareReuse this content"

We meet the team behind a high-flying, dance-circus rejigLyndsey WinshipFri 28 Feb 2025 10.16 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 10.53 ESTShareAfter the Bible, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the world. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s short, sweet novella has spawned more than600 translationsand counting, the author’s great-nephew Olivier d’Agay tells me. And this surreal story of an aviator who crashes in the desert and meets a small princely boy who has travelled from his own tiny planet is still picking up fans globally. “In Brazil, China, the Middle East,” laughs d’Agay. “Even England.”The book was first published in 1943 in New York, pilot and writer Saint-Exupéry having fled occupied France. It may be “an ambassador for French culture” as d’Agay puts it, but the innocent wisdom of its central character clearly taps into something universal. Over the years, there have been countless adaptations and tie-ins worldwide – and the latest is a dance-circus show, by choreographer Anne Tournié, which has already toured to 18 cities, from Riyadh to Mumbai to Sydney to Sofia. Its now about to land in London.The book was partly a critique of consumerist culture in the US – and that’s where they got their only bad reviewIn every theatre, there has been a different response. Tournié was surprised how famous the book was in Bulgaria: “The room was packed,” she says. But the liveliest audiences were in Istanbul: “They were applauding before anything happened, warming up the room.” In Luxembourg, people were more restrained: “Heavier, like their sausages,” says composer Terry Truck. And in Saudi Arabia, people cheered at the scene when it rains in the desert.Co-director Chris Mouron appears on stage to narrate parts of the tale (speaking French, with local translation in surtitles) but the nature of the storytelling, through dance, acrobatics and aerialism, lends itself to crossing international borders. The characters the Little Prince meets along his journey through the universe are all spelled out in their movements: the beautiful Rose he loves is elegantly balletic; a drunkard is lopingly rubber-bodied (they were concerned about that one in non-drinking Saudi Arabia, where the character is cut from the book version, but people laughed); the king draws on courtly classical technique; the conceited man uses show-offy leaps and spins; and the acrobatic lamplighter climbs a Chinese pole suspended in the air.View image in fullscreenIn Saudi Arabia, people cheered when it rains in the desert … Dylan Barone with Aurélien Bednarek as the Aviator.Photograph: Viki VuchevaMarie Jumelin’s projections, meanwhile, conjure up multiple worlds where the prince, with his mop of blond hair and philosophical turn of phrase, meets these deluded characters often consumed by pride, greed or power (it’s a moralistic tale, without doubt), and Truck’s score draws on musical styles from around the globe.They first tried the show out in Marseille – apparently its audiences are the most brutally honest – and it passed that test. Perhaps that’s because the prince’s gnomic pronouncements (“It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye”) are part of the vernacular in France. They had rave reviews in Paris, but somewhat less enthusiastic ones on Broadway, where the show closed three months early.I tell Mouron that I read the New York Times review. “Very bad,” she laughs and shakes her head. “It’s funny – that’s the only bad critique we had.” She adds that the book was in part a critique of American consumerist culture. “I think Saint-Exupéry was inspired by the materialism he saw in New York.” Critics there found this production too whimsical. “Well, the story’s whimsical,” says Truck. “It’s not a big singing and dancing musical.”View image in fullscreenOut of this world … the Little Prince among volcanoes and planets.Photograph: Viki VuchevaTournié has made plenty of spectacular shows in the past. Her background is originally in ballet and she has worked with Robert Wilson and Robert Lepage, but recently she’s been creating vast extravaganzas in Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi and Macau, with stunts and acrobatics, big sets and lots of tech. This was a deliberate move away from that scale. “After 10 years of that, I wanted a simple show that was just human,” she says, because the story itself is about coming back to simple, human values.It’s tricky to capture the particular voice of the book on stage, and there’s a randomness to its strange world – it starts with some dancing sheep, for example. The mood is often melancholy and the show is strongest when it reaches for some emotional heart, themes of loneliness and friendship and our responsibilities to each other (and our planet, too). The message is about caring for the people and the environment around you, tending your own garden as it were, rather than trying to take ownership of the stars – as the “businessman” character does. Which all seems very pertinent for a story written eight decades ago.The odd bad review is certainly not going to sink The Little Prince. “It’s not a question of culture or generation, it’s just talking to the humanity in people,” says d’Agay of its endurance. “We still have the same questions, the same quest for meaning. Humanity has not changed.”The Little Prince is at theColiseum, London, 12 to 16 March. Lyndsey Winship’s trip was paid for by the producers, Broadway Entertainment Group.Explore more on these topicsStageCircusDanceTheatreAntoine de Saint-ExupéryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s also up for song of the year at this weekend’s Brit awards, where Smith is also nominated for best new artist and best pop act, having already won this year’s Brits Rising Star award. Ed Sheeran is an admirer and confidant, and has booked him as support on a stadium tour, and Smith is no one-hit-wonder either: in January, the jauntyNice to Meet Youbecame his second Top 10 hit.But the weirdest moment for him, he says, was when he recently rang up a utilities company to sort a new wifi deal. “They put me on hold, and it was Stargazing playing. Those are the types of things that still seem absolutely bizarre.”At the Brits, he is up against big names such as Charli xcx and Dua Lipa in the pop category, but his music skews very differently, towards material relatively rarely explored by Black British pop artists. Animated acoustic guitars and banjos mean that it cleaves to the trend for pop-leaning country music as well as the barn-dancing “stomp-clap” style of Mumford & Sons and the Lumineers. But with pianos, ethereal production touches and Smith’s open-hearted yet bruised vocal style – plus plenty of whoa-oh-ohs – the likes of Sheeran, Coldplay and Hozier are clearly touchstones too, and even dance music fans will be endeared to his insistent beats and big breakdowns.With abundant emotional intelligence as well as a keener political acumen than most pop singers his age, the 26-year-old Smith is sharp and engaging company on a video call as he tours the UK. Born and raised in Luton, he casts himself as a small-town oddball. “I grew up in a working-class neighbourhood, in a Jamaican family – so my interest in rock and screamo, and not being able to play football and rugby, instantly put me in a different category to my peers,” he says. “In all walks of life I’ve felt a little bit different.”His parents’ marriage fell apart when Smith was between the ages of nine and 13, “a critical period in anyone’s life when they’re forming relationships,” he says. Introducing a song to his 1.6m TikTok followers recently, he wryly said: “Anyone else’s parents divorce and then your dad leaves and then your whole perception of love and relationships is completely screwed up and you don’t know how to trust anyone in your adult life?”“A lot of my personal development has been off the back of that [divorce] experience,” he says now. “I definitely had trust issues for a while.” He has had therapy – “such a beautiful tool” – to come to terms with it. “At the time [as a child] you’re never really aware – most of the learning comes when you’re an adult and you start to unpack the ways you think and feel. There’s a weird beauty to it – while it is painful and traumatic, and having to relive so many experiences is difficult, it also gives you this key to unlock a whole new side to yourself, when you do understand yourself better. And I’ve got a lot of [the trauma] to thank for being a good songwriter!”Smith left Luton for the University of Nottingham to study sociology, and founded his own fast-growing business management company after graduating. But he’d been playing pub gigs since the age of 11, and decided to pivot to music, “knowing that if it all went wrong I could reactivate my LinkedIn and get back into the working world,” he laughs. “But those initial months were petrifying, stepping from a stable income to absolute uncertainty.” He started posting songs to TikTok in 2022, where his manager discovered him, and was signed to a major label deal with Sony the following year.View image in fullscreen‘I never want to put a false sense of myself into the world, where I am this saviour. I push air – that’s my job’ … Smith performing in Dublin in February.Photograph: Debbie Hickey/Getty ImagesBut I can hear the sociology student still coming through when he discusses the systemic issues that can hold people like him back in the music industry. “For anyone from a working-class town, the opportunities to get into music are few and far between,” he says. “There’s a huge disadvantage when it comes to access to musical equipment, and even music lessons, at state school level.”Smith benefited from Building Schools for the Future, an investment scheme brought in by Labour in 2005, then shuttered in 2010 by Michael Gove – who later regretted doing so – as the Tories’ austerity programme began. “I had access to GarageBand, iMacs, musical equipment,” Smith remembers. “And though the costing could be questioned, [the scheme] was very quickly pushed out the window. We’ve now seen years and years of austerity, and it’s not just the arts that have taken a hit – it’s anything that sits on the periphery of the mainstream route to work. There do need to be questions asked about how we’re valuing the arts in this country.”Exacerbating the problem are the hardships faced by grassroots venues, which have been knocked hard by the Covid lockdowns and then the cost of living crisis. “Suddenly the gap between music being a hobby and being a career is wider than ever. In order to pay for a first show an artist might need to sell 500 tickets [at a medium-sized venue]. Whereas the bands and shows I used to see when I was younger was someone down the pub playing to 20 people, but those don’t exist any more.” And he sees a “dual burden” for people of colour, who as well as being statistically more likely to be working class, “are also not being seen for the amazing cultural value that they bring to this country, and what they add to one of our biggest cultural exports” – namely the arts. “More work needs to be done both on a class basisanda race basis.”His music tends to be much less political, and is written in a way that allows listeners to map their own troubles and breakthroughs on to his songs. They frequently contact him to tell him so, and on social media, Smith recently reminded them: “It wasn’t my music that saved you – it was you.”“A lot of people – and I really do appreciate it – will message me when they’re going through troublesome times,” he explains. “They’re dealing with mental health issues – or much further. I could take it as an ego lift: ‘Wow, I’m saving lives!’ But the reality is that those people are doing the hard work to really understand themselves. As an artist, I never want to put a false sense of myself into the world, where I am this saviour. I push air – that’s my job.”As he hones his craft, Smith says he’s mindful to “take breaks from writing for a few months at a time, so I can go out and experience life, otherwise I’ll have nothing to say,” and also avoiding “external [musical] influence – I’m trying to find whoIam, whatI’mtrying to say.” But time with Sheeran has been useful, seeing how “he has full confidence over his initial ideas. For me and many other songwriters, you can get stuck going over one line for 45 minutes. But he’s of the mindset that if it’s good, it’s good – why are we wasting time?”After theBrit awards, Smyth has 37 gigs to play across Europe, the US and Australia – all before the end of May, when he starts 29 European stadium shows with Sheeran. It sounds exhausting, but he is clearly exhilarated. “I wrote a song recently about simply feeling good,” he says. “On the surface that could seem super cliched. But it’s taken a long time to just feel great, and not feel burdened with anything. That’s a byproduct of doing the thing that I love. Feeling good – that’s something I’ve been feeling recently!”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockBrit awardsAwards and prizesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Tentatively hopeful and giddily anxious, they settled their nerves with a drink before arriving at the venue, a trendy south-east London pizzeria. In the event, any excitement was unwarranted: Kemsley “dissociated” and went quiet, while Gledhill found herself in “corporate team-building mode”, using humour to grease the wheels of other people’s dates while disengaging on a personal level. The men weren’t perfect, either: one avoided all eye contact; another recognised Gledhill – who has become a familiar face since winning last year’s Edinburgh fringe prize – and started doing her own material at her. There was a promising development, though: one attender slid into Gledhill’s DMs later that evening – and she replied.How do I know all this? Because since October, Kemsley and Gledhill have been routinely spilling the beans about their love lives on their candid and hugely endearing podcastSingle Ladies in Your Area. The show sees the 37-year-olds grapple with modern dating, a premise that requires them to share their hopes, fears and deepest vulnerabilities. “We divulge too much,” says Kemsley, sitting in the offices of the podcast’s production company, fresh from another heart-on-sleeve recording. “And then we listen to it and go: ‘That’s fine, put it out!’” laughs Gledhill beside her.The pair came up with the concept at a comedy industry event: they had coincidentally both decided to reveal they were newly single during their respective standup sets. The audience was made up of peers and friends, many of whom didn’t yet know Gledhill had separated from her partner, nor that Kemsley had split from her husband and the father of her daughter, Canadian comic Bobby Mair. When the latter mentioned it, “there was a gasp. It’s horrible when you’re doing live comedy and people are whispering: is this true?! I felt really embarrassed.” Backstage, the pair joked that they should do a podcast on the subject – a joke that quickly morphed into a solid plan.The charm of Single Ladies in Your Area is rooted in Kemsley and Gledhill’s personalities: unjaded yet meticulously self-effacing; it’s impossible not to become overly invested in the ridiculously likable duo’s romantic (mis)fortunes. From the start, they knew their USP would be relatability – the opposite of “confident, empowered” influencers and their TikTok dating hacks. A recurring theme is their struggle to master the apps: on a recently recorded episode, comedian Stephen Bailey ripped their profiles “to shreds”, says Gledhill. “One of my pictures was actually in a graveyard, and he was like: ‘Get rid of that.’” Kemsley “had put that I like sloths in mine. He said: ‘That’s not how you’re going to meet your person.’” Sharing the content of their profiles on the show has been “so humiliating”, she continues. “You’re selling yourself and it’s such a weird, unnatural thing to do.”View image in fullscreenOn the fringe of society… Gledhill with (left to right) Joe Kent-Walters, Rob Copland and Richard Osman after winning her Edinburgh comedy award.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe dating landscape may be new to them, but Gledhill and Kemsley are seasoned pros when it comes to mining laughs from love. Gledhill’s latest show,Make Me Look Fit on the Poster, revisits the gobsmacking low points of various past relationships, while Kemsley’s current tour – Everything Always Works Out for Me – focuses on the aftermath of her divorce. It comes after a long period spent collaborating with Mair: in 2017, the couple made a “reality sitcom” about their nuptials for Vice; the following year they appeared on Roast Battle, throwing eye-watering insults at each other in the name of comedy (sample Kemsley line: “Some people say men marry their mother, but I don’t think that’s true because I’m not a dead prostitute”). She describes their work/life crossover as “volatile, but we know each other’s voices so well and you trust each other in those situations”. That said, “I think maybe I wouldn’t do a roast battle with my next husband.”Gledhill and Kemsley’s shared choice of career has also complicated their romantic prospects. For men, comedy is a surefire way to get girls; for women, it’s “the opposite”, says Gledhill. “There’s a huge chunk of men that don’t want a funny, outspoken partner.” Standup usually revolves round a performer riffing on their failures and flaws, something Gledhill thinks is very appealing to women because they “love a project.Womenlove to fix men. Whereas men go: ‘Oh, fuck that.’” “Yeah, but we’re not doing that any more!” interjects Kemsley. “We’re learning from the podcast that we don’t want to be fixer-uppers,” Gledhill confirms.Some men like to be close to female comedians in an unhealthy, creepy wayBar a few exceptions, the podcast’s guests tend to be the pair’s female comedian pals (Sophie Willan, Chloe Petts, Felicity Ward). It’s reflective of the new standup sisterhood: previously, the unofficial one-woman-per-show rule meant female comics rarely crossed paths, says Kemsley, but the gradual diversification of lineups over the past decade has given them the chance to bond. Nowadays, the scene is “so supportive”, says Gledhill. “There’s some really good friendship groups of just funny, funny women. And we have a fucking great time.”Solidarity is important in an industry that normalises a lack of personal safety. Some men “really like to be close to female comedians in an unhealthy creepy way”, says Gledhill. There are practical issues, too. In order to afford to attend the Edinburgh fringe one year, Gledhill slept in a cupboard in a flat occupied by 20 strangers. “I didn’t feel scared because I was young. I’d be fucking terrified now.”View image in fullscreenin bloom … Harriet Kemsley.Photograph: Matt CrockettWhile it has always been difficult to make ends meet when performing in Edinburgh – Gledhill once trained as a masseuse and gave massages to festivalgoers so she could pay her bills – rocketing prices have made it harder than ever. “It feels so unfair because you have to spend about £10,000. If it carries on like this, it’ll just be privileged kids. And working-class kids are funny!”On a personal level, Gledhill no longer has such concerns – in fact, she’s the reigning queen of the fringe. Despite having already been nominated twice as half of comedy double actthe Delightful Sausage, she was utterly flabbergasted at being awarded the main comedy prize last year. “When Richard Osman gives me the award I’m in such shock that I’m grimacing,” she says, hauntedly recalling the footage of the ceremony. “I look like I’ve just seen a horrific car accident.”Kemsley has had some characteristically chaotic Edinburgh experiences; her first fringe involved “accidentally doing a Christian message play. I found out because everyone joined hands and started praying backstage”. At that point the Kent native was attempting to become a “serious” actor “but people kept laughing”. Then her parents advised her to try standup: “They were like mad things always happen to you and you always have funny stories.” She took to it immediately. “I’d always been a bit shy, but doing standup I could say what I thought and people liked it.” Well, not always. The first out-there anecdote she deployed was about “the time I accidentally killed an owl, which sometimes would be too dark”.Gledhill’s career was sparked by her university boyfriend. “He was an open-mic comedian and he was terrible. And I’d watch him and go: ‘God, I could definitely do it at least as well as him.’” Both Gledhill – who had been a “creepy” classic sitcom obsessive as a child growing up in Hull – and Kemsley say they had never considered a career in standup as youngsters, partly due to the dearth of female comics in the 90s and 00s. “I rarely saw women doing it when I was growing up,” says Gledhill. “Only Jo Brand and maybe Jenny Eclair.”Times have changed, though. Nowadays, comedy is a more conceivable – and aspirational – career for women. A case in point is that the wall behind the sofa is adorned with huge, glossy posters promoting the pair’s tour shows: Gledhill’s diva-like get-up – voluminous perm and feather-trimmed top – is undercut by Wotsit dust-caked lips; Kemsley, meanwhile, is glam as can be in pink satin, save for the small fire working its way up her long, blond tresses.Despite their chronic self-deprecation and the apparently repellent nature of their profession, the posters have me wondering whether these two attractive, successful women will be on the market long enough to make the podcast a viable long-term prospect. “People were concerned about that, but it turns out we’re not in any trouble,” deadpans Kemsley.If they do, the show has already proven to be a strangely valuable communication tool. When a recent squeeze of Gledhill started listening, the effect was “kind of cool, because you’re giving someone an instruction manual on how you need to be loved; he knew my love of languages, that I have no boundaries, he knew everything!”The only problem was that it wasn’t “a two-way street. So I said to him: you need to domea podcast!” If exchanging personalised audio content turns out to be the next dating innovation, you heard it here first.Harriet Kemsley is touring the UK until 12 April. A new episode of Single Ladiesin Your Area is released every Friday on Spotify and Apple.Explore more on these topicsComedyPodcastsAmy GledhillRelationshipsPodcastingWomeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

She explains why she’s now writing about our dark, uncertain futureByAlexis PetridisFri 28 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareOn a video call from a hotel room in Hamburg,Gracie Abramsis expounding on the virtues of decoupling yourself from social media and living a life offline. “You can literally do so much when you’re not scrolling!” she enthuses. “You can retain more information; everything gets lighter. You have a greater capacity to be more present, to be there for the people in your life, to read a book that’s going to inspire your next album, or go on a hike and breathe air instead of sitting in a dark room on fucking Instagram. I’m doing lots of, like, tactile stuff, staying off social media,” she adds. “Needlepoint and shit like that. I’m just trying to make things … to have some tangible evidence of having lived this year.”Of course, this is nothing the world hasn’t heard before: we’re well used to being told about the benefits of a digital detox. Still, it feels like an intriguing statement coming from Gracie Abrams. For one thing, her single That’s So True spent most of January at No 1 in the UK: it spent most of November and December there as well, took a brief Christmas holiday, then reappeared to beat Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga et al once more. Her album The Secret of Us also reached No 1, and is now enjoying its 18th consecutive week in the Top 20, the kind of longevity only afforded to those artists who have broken through into the upper echelons of pop stardom.It’s the same story back home in the US, where The Secret of Us has spent 35 weeks on the charts: her previous album managed two. Abrams is calling from Hamburg because it’s the latest stop on a global tour that’s been filling vast arenas for months and is scheduled to keep doing so until August. You see what she means about needlepoint, but you do wonder how much tangible evidence of having lived this year a person might need.Even by latterday pop standards, her rise seems particularly bound up with social media. She first broke through in 2020, withI Miss You, I’m Sorry: a viral lockdown hit with its cheerfully amateurish, bedroom-bound video and lyrics that seemed to fit the prevalent mood (“Do you remember happy together? I do, don’t you?”). She already had a major label deal, but was initially famed for directly interacting with her audience online: responding to their comments on SoundCloud and Instagram, sending them DMs, referring to them not as her fans but her “friends” (“more friends than anyone has ever had ever!” she told an interviewer in 2021); becoming the first non-Korean artist to useWeverse, the K-pop platform designed to offer “a deeper level” of artist-fan interaction than that of traditional social media.It’s a smart way to build a committed fanbase, and it played into a pervasive idea of Abrams as what one writer called “gen Z’s most unfiltered storyteller”: a singer-songwriter whose work was essentially private diary entries set to music, and who whispered her lyrics as if personally confiding in the listener.But it’s clearly not an approach one can maintain after the kind of success garnered by The Secret of Us, an album noticeably brighter and less introverted than her previous work (the result, she says, of both “a crush that I had felt way more significantly than in previous years” and a new writing partnership with her best friend and roommate, Audrey Hobert). When you’re packing out the Alsterdorfer Sportshalle and Madison Square Garden, not everyone online wants to be your friend.View image in fullscreenUnfiltered … Abrams performing in Washington DC in December.Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for iHeartRadio“It’s definitely not halted full stop,” she says. “There are moments where I do feel really thrilled to interact directly; whether it’s through a DM or a comment, I feel tapped into their lives still.” But, she says, it’s “less frequent, because, honestly, mentally I don’t benefit from engaging heavily in the way I used to. The way the algorithm works, if you spend five extra seconds reading a comment and there’s a keyword with your name in it, that’s what it starts to feed you. So I’d open my phone in the morning and there would be lots of unsolicited opinions that were starting to make me feel sore, and then I would notice myself carrying that feeling. But if you don’t engage with it, you don’t feel so sick.”Being tapped into your audiences’ lives seems risky in an era when we hear a lot about toxic fandoms, when artists such as Chappell Roan feel compelled to call out fans for “creepy behaviour” and “harassment”.“The very large majority of the time I have been lucky, my interactions with fans out in the world haven’t been ones that make me go ‘oh shit’,” she says. “But I’ve definitely had moments like that. I’m walking with my headphones in, or my back is turned, or my head is down and a stranger comes in with a hug before anything else … that’s really not a good feeling. As an animal, you’re just like, ‘Oh fuck, what’s that?’ Ninety per cent of the time it’s really sweet introductions, or no crossing any lines with physical touch. But if you experience it even once, your guard can go up, because it feels unnatural. You want to walk a fine line between being attuned to what your audience feels and letting your own conviction guide you.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve been lucky the majority of the time with my interractions with fans’ … at Paris fashion week last year.Photograph: Foc Kan/WireImageThe occasional over-familiar fan aside, Abrams’ rise appears to have been remarkably smooth. Big names have flocked to work with her: The Secret of Us, like its predecessor Good Riddance, was made with the National’sAaron Dessner, best-known as Taylor Swift’s chief latterday collaborator;Brian Enounexpectedly cropped up on one track from Good Riddance. She has enjoyed a succession of profile-boosting celebrity co-signs. No sooner had I Miss You, I’m Sorry appeared than Olivia Rodrigo announced that her forthcoming single was inspired by it – the forthcoming single turned out to be themulti-bn streaming Drivers License – while Taylor Swift selected her as the support act on two sizeable chunks of the record-breaking Eras tour and appears as a guest and co-writer on The Secret of Us. Abrams recentlyposted a photoof herself embracing her idol, Joni Mitchell, who was apparently unfazed even when Abrams showed her a tattoo she has featuring Mitchell’s handwritten lyrics.She has pulled off the enviable trick of establishing a fanbase who feel her songs confide her innermost secrets to them, while also drawing a veil over her private life, only ever discussing it publicly in the vaguest terms (she is presumed to be in a relationship with actor Paul Mescal, but has never confirmed it to the wider world). “Sharing versus not sharing,” she nods. “I’m lucky to have this avenue, where, in my songs, I talk very openly about how I feel. It’s like when I’m writing, I’m talking to myself. Talking to strangers, there are naturally things you hope to protect a bit more. Some things feel sacred.”She seems smart, thoughtful and level-headed: at 25, she appears to be navigating the choppy waters of celebrity with admirable ease. This might have something to do with her background: her father is the Hollywood director/producerJJ Abrams. On the one hand, that means her success has played out to a constant background hum of sniping in which the phrase “nepo baby” figures heavily, but there are presumably worse preparations for fame than growing up in a celebrity-adjacent Hollywood family.View image in fullscreen‘What I loved about sharing music online was you could hide behind a profile’ … performing on The Graham Norton Show earlier this month.Photograph: PAQuite the opposite, she says: she was so introverted as a teenager that she thought a “public-facing career” was out of the question. “I knew that it would involve performing, and that was the part that felt so horrifying to me. I wrote songs because it was easier than talking about my feelings. I wasn’t interested in anybody hearing me. I was so turned off by the idea of confronting people face-to-face. That was what I loved about sharing music online – you could hide behind a profile.”As her major label courted her, she kept her fears hidden. “I remember signing my deal and feeling really nauseous about it.” So what changed? “Well, I see a therapist. And it hasn’t been some overnight thing. The first shows I ever played were over Zoom during the pandemic, so that was like a baby step versus truly facing my fear head-on. Then I played the tiniest rooms” – which, it should be noted, didn’t stop her “projectile vomiting” before going onstage – “so it’s almost like these tiny moments of exposure therapy.”Trump has already done everything in his power to make us feel powerless and hopelessClearly it worked: you don’t see much evidence of introversion in the fan videos of her onstage, belting out I Miss You, I’m Sorry from a set designed to look like the bedroom in which she recorded the song’s original video, or lecturing audiences in a pre-election US about the necessity of voting when “democracy is hanging by a thread”. She was an ardent Harris supporter, and performed at one of her campaign rallies in Wisconsin.In the wake of the US election result, one theory that did the rounds was that the sheer wattage of celebrity endorsements Harris received was counterproductive – that they reinforced the notion that the Harris campaign was out of touch with ordinary voters’ concerns in a difficult economic climate. “I don’t think it was counterproductive,” Abrams frowns. “The issues were so much deeper, more systemic. How I feel about having played a tiny role in one of her many rallies that she crushed flawlessly every single time is that I’m proud to have been there and proud to have felt that energy in the room. That was so tangible and so real, and it’s something I’ve held on to since the results of the election.View image in fullscreenAbrams: ‘I started writing long letters to myself about dreams.’Photograph: Gabriella Hughes“Trump has only been in office for a month and has already done everything in his power to make every marginalised community feel smaller, to make everybody more at risk, to overwhelm us with information, or disinformation, so that we feel powerless and hopeless. And what I felt at that rally in Wisconsin that day was the opposite of hopelessness: I felt real strength in gathering. That’s the antidote right now. Obviously, there’s got to be so much more we do when we gather in that way. But I feel really lucky to have witnessed in person what that kind of light feels like, especially now in the face of this quality of darkness. It’s unprecedented, it’s global.”She was so crushed by Trump’s victory that she wondered about going on tour at all. “Right before going off, I was just like: how are we not all dedicating all of our time to fighting this … thing?” She decided that “if me, Gracie, in the position I’m in in this world – like the luckiest ever – is feeling this way, then everybody is feeling this fucking way. I can give people who are coming to these shows two hours to feel everything they’re feeling at an extreme, and be able to express it, or just distract themselves for two hours and recharge their battery. We’re going to have to work out how to do that every single day, not just for the next four years, because obviously the impact of the next four years is going to be long-lasting.”She says she spent a week at Dessner’s studio before departing for Europe to work on new material, and found herself writing noticeably different kinds of songs than she expected. “I was just like: shit, I don’t even know how to articulate the degree to which I feel sick inside about everything. Most of those songs from that week arenotabout relationships. They’re about the fact that LA just burned down, about the fact that I don’t understand how we’re supposed to really carry on. Of course those subjects will show up, it’s life, but they’re … different themes than I anticipated.”‘Fame is like going through puberty’: Chappell Roan on sexuality, superstardom and the joy of dragRead moreBut then, as she points out, nothing has turned out like she expected. “After signing and starting to release music in a more real way, and after playing my first shows and realising I was wrong about how I felt about playing live because of the kindness of the people in the room, I started writing long letters to myself about dreams,” she says. “One of the things I wrote after my first show was ‘One day I want to open for Taylor Swift’. That was never going to happen, obviously. What’s been so lucky is that the goalposts keep kind of moving and my imagination has expanded and I feel excited about being out of my comfort zone.“Being proved wrong about what was the scariest thing in the world to me at the time has made me really excited to be wrong about everything else.” She laughs, before heading off to another packed arena.Gracie Abrams’ UK and Ireland tour begins Monday 3 March at Nottingham Motorpoint Arena.

But whether or not his performance asBob DylaninA Complete Unknownbeats out presumed frontrunner Adrien Brody – the current youngest best actor, at 29 years, 11 months and nine days in 2003 – Chalamet has already won arguably the most important prize of modern movie stardom: the hearts and minds of the internet.Oscars 2025: best picture nominees – reviews, awards and where to watchRead moreIf we’re in the business of giving out awards for deserving, boundary-pushing work, then Chalamet’s best actor campaign – unofficial and often unspoken efforts to sway awards voters and build public sentiment – deserves its own Oscar. For the past several months, ostensibly in support ofA Complete Unknownbut seemingly just as much for laughs, Chalamet has embarked on a rare press run of consistent wins that generated viral moments and appealed to the reference-averse, absurdist sensibilities of his generation, bucking the usually staid methods of Hollywood promotion. Whereas past best actor hopefuls have erred on the side of grateful, serious and dutiful to the self-importance of the boomer-skewing Academy, Chalamet has worn kitschy outfits to red carpet events, treated social media like an ironic art experiment and made the rounds with influencers. In other words, though Chalamet is technically a millennial (born in 1995), we are witnessing the first genZ Oscar campaign.Oscars 2025: best actor nominees – awards, interviews and what their chances areRead moreAnd what a delight it’s been. There is plenty to be cynical about when it comes to awards season – the repetition, the speeches written by consultants, the cloying campaign-ness of it all – but Chalametout-predicting professional sports analystson College Gameday (?!) is not one of them. The first sign that Chalamet would be up to something different – that he would be in on the joke – was back in October, two months before the domestic release of A Complete Unknown, when hecrasheda crowdsourced lookalike contest in New York’s Washington Square Park, temporarily causing gleeful pandemonium (until the cops showed up). He followed with a series of wacky, weird, surprisingpublic appearancesthat have deftly threaded a needle of sincere and unserious, fromdressing up as Bob Dylancirca 2003’s Sundance, blond bangs and all, to remixing Dylan deep cutson Saturday Night Liveas one of the few musical guests who isn’t a recording artist.A non-exhaustive list of highlights:riding a Lime bikeon to a red carpet (and later telling a French interviewer that he wasfined £65for illegal parking);giving podcast bro Theo Von a lessonon publicly subsidized housing (Chalamet grew up in Mitchell-Lama arts housing in Manhattan); fanboying over Kendrick Lamar in a ride-along“interview”for the Super Bowl; hosting abizarre Instagram livefrom an empty warehouse in which he smashed a guitar, writhed with confetti to the 2009 Black Eyed Peas track I Gotta Feeling, and appeared in front of a screen with intentionally misspelled messages like “congratulations timmothee”.A Complete Unknown review – Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan is an electric revelationRead moreFor every conventional, in-the-feels interview stop – a classic Serious ArtistRolling Stone cover, a60 Minutes interviewwith Anderson Cooper on honing his ambition, anApple Music interviewwith Zane Lowe on inhabiting Dylan’s music – there have been multiple ridiculous, internet-aiming victory laps. See:talking Bratwith oddball Canadian music journalistNardwuar, and an absurd and delightfulinterviewwith YouTuber Brittany Broski in which hedescribedhis lean aesthetic as “empowering the anemic”. And that’s not even getting into a series of lo-fi Instagram videos in which Chalamet sings along to various songs – the Dylan trackVisions of Johanna, a number from the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack – at various outdoor locations in a style I can best describe as “aspirational performing arts school project”.Saldaña squished and Chalamet chafing as Ariana and Cynthia bag the best seats: the 2025 Oscars class photoRead moreAll of this evinces a fact that many forget: being an actor and being a movie star are not the same thing. Timothée Chalamet is a phenomenally talented actor who, by his own admission, strives to be considered one of the greats. He said the quiet part out loud (unusual) in his Sag acceptance speech a week before the Oscars – his first major award after nearly two dozen nominations by the age of 30: “I’m really in pursuit of greatness,” he said, wearing a lime green shirt, leather suit and bolo tie in tribute toanother archival Dylan look. “I know people don’t usually talk like that but I want to be one of the greats.”But awards campaigns are never just about talent, and Chalamet is, crucially, great atbeing a celebrity.This entire press run has evinced his concurrent talent for holding attention in the ways he wants to, for not taking oneself too seriously while also maintaining deep reverence for the craft, for balancing the esoteric and the very dumb, with some clear YouTube research. And mostly, to laugh at oneself in a way that also benefits one’s appeal, a through-line from the lookalike contest to showing Cooper a video of his high schoolrap alter ego, Timmy Tim. Chalamet is the rare extremely famous person who seems to actually enjoy being famous – or, at the very least, is having some harmless fun with it. So here’s to Chalamet’s Oscar campaign, a breath of fresh air in a practice that tends to range from just moderately enjoyable to outright annoying. Especially this year, the Oscars season, and pop culture at large, needed it.Explore more on these topicsOscarsTimothée ChalametAwards and prizesA Complete UnknownfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Adolescence, the drama that will horrify all parentsStuart HeritageStephen Graham’s new show about a boy arrested for murder is utterly chilling. Its team talk rage, panic attacks and being bowled over by a 15-year-oldFri 28 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Feb 2025 12.02 ESTShareThe first few minutes of Netflix’s new drama Adolescence are among the most incredible you will ever see. Two police officers drive to a house, smash its doors in, sweep from room to room and apprehend a teenage boy suspected of murdering a female classmate. They load him into a van, drive to a police station then process him for arrest.On the surface this sounds like any workaday drama, but the incredible thing about Adolescence is this: the whole sequence is conducted in one take. From car to house to van to station, the camera never leaves the action. Even more incredibly, the entire series follows in kind. There are four episodes, each without a single edit.Adolescence is very much the baby of Stephen Graham, who not only stars as the boy’s father, but also co-created and co-wrote the series. “There had been a lot of cases of stabbings across the country,” explains Graham. “Some were incidents with young boys who were stabbing young girls.” These incidents started to meld with his love of the documentary series24 Hours in Police Custodyand his previous work in the one-shot filmBoiling Point, and Adolescence began to take root.But it was ambitious, and required a dream team. To build it out, Graham pulled from talent he’d worked with before. He cast his childhood friend Christine Tremarco to play his wife and, from his new Disney+ seriesA Thousand Blows,Erin Dohertyand Ashley Walters.View image in fullscreenLook back in anger … Erin Doherty and Owen Cooper in Adolescence.Photograph: Netflix“Steve was like: ‘You mightthinkyou’ve played this type of part before, but you will never have done anything like this,” says Walters, who stars as the lead detective. As much as he was excited by the challenges of the shoot, getting to work more with Graham was the real draw.“He’s just a nice person,” says Walters. “He’s dedicated to helping others. I don’t think there’s a person in the industry that he doesn’t know, and I don’t think there’s a person in the industry who doesn’t like him. This might be breaking the fourth wall, but most people are not spoken about like that.”Graham extended the same family attitude to the other creatives. The only choice to direct this was Boiling Point’s Philip Barantini. And as a writing partner, Graham chose his frequent collaboratorJack Thorne.“We’ve developed this wonderful little marriage, me and Jack,” grins Graham of the prolific playwright. “We are like a combined Frankenstein. I bring him body parts – a torso, a head, some legs, a few hands – and he miraculously injects a spirit.”“Steve’s starting point was not wanting to blame the parents,” says Thorne of his collaboration. “It was: ‘Let’s not make this about a kid who commits a crime because of an evil thing going on at home.’”“I didn’t want his dad to be a violent man,” confirms Graham. “I didn’t want Mum to be a drinker. I didn’t want our young boy to be molested by his uncle Tony. I wanted to remove all of those possibilities for us to go: ‘Oh, that’s why he did it.’”As a result, Adolescence takes us somewhere even more terrifying. Jamie, the show’s 13-year-old subject, is an outwardly normal, well-adjusted kid. But the conversations around him, at school and online, start to lean towards incels and the manosphere. Slowly, a picture builds about how this regular kid found himself radicalised without anyone even realising.“Stephen and I talked a lot about the last few years in that family, and the moment Jamie just disappeared,” says Thorne. “It just happens. He’s gone. He’s locked behind the door, and he’s in another world, and the parents think it’s fine.”“I also wanted it to be about how it’s affected everybody else around him,” says Graham. This was a smart, if grim, choice. Seeing a family uneasily try to put themselves back together after a moment of such unimaginable violence is nothing short of harrowing. If you have children of a certain age, on the precipice of getting their own phones, this will be particularly hard to watch.View image in fullscreenFather fissure … Cooper with Stephen Graham in Adolescence.Photograph: NetflixStill, as heavy as Adolescence is, it also stretches the capacity of what can be achieved with a single take. One sequence in the second episode, which I won’t spoil, is so technically audacious it made me gasp. Barantini confesses that the logistics kept him awake at night. Where Boiling Point only required Barantini and a cinematographer, the scale of Adolescence meant that the camera had to be continually passed from operator to operator, getting clipped in and out of different devices by various teams as necessary.He takes me through the show’s opening sequence. “When the episode starts, my cinematographer Matt is holding the camera,” he explains. “As we’re filming the actors in the car, the camera’s being attached to a crane. The car drives off, and the crane follows. While this is happening, Matt has gone in another car, driven ahead and jumped out so he can take the camera into the house. When we come back out of the house, the other camera operator Lee is sat in the custody van. Matt would pass Lee the camera, so now Lee’s got the camera while Matt drives ahead to the police station, so he’s ready to take the camera when we go inside.”Such visual flashiness might suggest that Adolescence is purely a technical experiment, but that couldn’t be further from the case. “I never want the one-take thing to be at the forefront,” says Barantini. “I wanted this to be seamless, but not a spectacle.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s no elaborate camerawork; the whole thing is largely confined to a single room. The only characters are the young suspect and Erin Doherty’s child psychologist – and it is absolutely bruising. “I said to Jack: ‘I just want you to write me your version of a David Mamet play,’” says Graham. “And he went: ‘Have you got any more notes?’ I went: ‘No, that’s it.’”The result is remarkable, not only for how unbearably stressful it is, but in the way that it comprehensively introduces 15-year-old Owen Cooper – a young man with no previous acting credits – as a force to be reckoned with. His performance might qualify as the highlight of the whole enterprise. To watch him is to see a top-tier talent emerge in real time.“This guy is hands down one of the best actors I’ve ever worked with,” marvels Doherty, grinning at Cooper. “Seriously, it blows my mind that this is your first job. It’s absolutely ridiculous.”View image in fullscreenOn the hunt … Ashley Walters as DI Bascombe in Adolescence.Photograph: Netflix“Erin was the first actor I’d ever worked with,” admits Cooper, who was hired after casting director Shaheen Baig looked at more than 500 boys for the part. I ask how he found his first audition. “I’d never had a job before, so I just sent a tape across, not expecting that much,” says Cooper, completely unfazed. “I got back from school and my mum told me I got the part.”Was Barantini nervous about handing something so meaty to a first-timer? Not at all, he says. “There’d be moments where Owen really had to be quite evil and nasty to Erin’s character,” he says. “In rehearsals, he was quite scared to go there, because he’d never been that angry before in real life. There was one moment where he had, maybe not a panic attack, but he got quite emotional, and he couldn’t get out of it. I took him outside, and we just sat on a wall and chatted. And I was like: ‘You’re smashing it, you’re incredible. But now that you’ve felt that emotion, you know what it feels like and how to bring yourself out of it.’ It felt like a real turning point.”With Adolescence now under his belt, Cooper’s career is starting to enter orbit. As well as one project he’s sworn to secrecy over (but will inevitably be enormous upon release) he has also filmed a new comedy with Aimee Lou Wood. “That was the first job I had where it wasn’t a one-shot,” he shrugs. “So I had to get used to that.”But despite all this – the camera wizardry and the sheer heft of the performances – it’s the themes of Adolescence that will stay with you. “I hope we don’t make the question of male rage an easy question,” says Thorne, before becoming emphatic. “And I certainly hope the conversation around the show doesn’t become about Andrew Tate.” The name of the self-styled “misogynist influencer” comes up a few times during Adolescence, but Thorne is keen to make an important distinction. “Jamie never talks about Andrew Tate once. When he’s mentioned, it’s only by adult characters who are trying to understand him.”After interrogating such a dark subject, I wonder if Thorne has located the secret of male rage. “I don’t think anyone would be interested if I did,” he says. “And it would be a bad drama if I did. I hope we pose the question well enough that there is conversation on sofas, and that parents have the chance to talk about this stuff with their children.” This seems inevitable. Adolescence is set to be a cultural touchpoint for young masculinity for years to come. What an astonishing thing these people have made.Adolescence is on Netflix on 13 March.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioStephen GrahamDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mendoza said it was a “good assumption” that was the last day of the actor’s life.Officials had said earlier on Friday that initial autopsies had found that the actor and his wife suffered no external trauma.That means the mystery over the couple’s deaths remains unanswered.The Oscar-winning actor, who graced the silver screen for more than 60 years, and his classical pianist wife werefound deadat their home undersuspicious circumstances. Maintenance workers found the couple’s bodies at their home on Wednesday, along with one of their three German shepherd dogs, who was also found dead.Mummification: what is it and how can it occur?Read moreOfficials have cautioned that the full results of autopsies may only come in weeks.The suddenly discovered deaths have stunned movie fans around the world and sent shock waves through Hollywood and New Mexico, where the couple lived for decades.The Santa Fe International film festival organization said it was “deeply saddened”.“Not only was Gene one of the greatest actors of his generation but he and Betsy were members of our community here in Santa Fe,” a statement said.New Mexico’s state senate held a moment of silence at the state capitol in the historic city, with one lawmaker stating: “We were lucky to call him a New Mexican.”In downtown Santa Fe there were no signs of any immediate tributes visible among the traditional adobe buildings of the area, hailing or mourning the famous residents, and the streets were quiet on Friday morning under characteristic brilliant blue skies and bright sunshine.Meanwhile, the sheriff of Santa Fe county, Adan Mendoza, had also revealed that the couple had been dead for “quite a while” before they were found. The two maintenance workers who made the grim discovery said the last time they had been in touch with Hackman and Arakawa was two weeks previously.Early on Friday Mendoza told the Today Show on NBC TV that it was difficult to put a timeline on how long the couple had been dead. But he added: “It appears, several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks.”The possibility that several days might have passed before the couple’s bodies were discovered chimes with an affidavit in which a sheriff disclosed that Arakawa’s body “showed obvious signs of death, body decomposition, bloating in her face and mummification in both hands and feet”. Mummification occurs when dead tissue dries and hardens over time.The sheriff’s office has reported that when the deceased were found the front door was open, although there were no signs of foul play, and no obvious evidence of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning. But the scene was strange enough that the sheriff’s office sought a search warrant on Wednesday evening.View image in fullscreenGene Hackman with his wife Betsy Arakawa at the Golden Globes in 2003.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APHackman, 95, appeared to have fallen in an entryway, a deputy said, and a cane was found nearby. Arakawa, 65, was found in an upstairs bathroom with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on a nearby countertop. The dead German shepherd was found in a bathroom closet.“There was no indication of a struggle,” Mendoza said. “There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed … you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.”Hackman and Arakawa appeared to have suddenly fallen to the floor and neither showed signs of blunt force trauma, an affidavit said. Mendoza said two other dogs were found alive, and that those dogs were not in a crate and were able to move freely in and out of the house by a pet door.Authorities were contacted after a worker performing pest control came across their open door but was unable to get in touch with the couple and dispatched security in the area to check on them.“I think we just found two or one deceased person[s] inside a house for purchase here,” a caller told 911. “I’m not inside the house. It’s closed. It’s locked. I can’t go in. But I see them. She’s lying face down on the floor from the window.”The caller can be heard saying: “Damn, damn, damn.”Hackman, a former marine known for his raspy voice, appeared in more than 80 films, as well as on television and the stage during a lengthy career that started in the early 1960s.View image in fullscreenThe house owned by actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa.Photograph: Roberto E Rosales/APHe earned his first Oscar nomination for his breakout role as the brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow in 1967’s Bonnie and Clyde. He was also nominated for best supporting actor in 1970 for I Never Sang for My Father.His role as Popeye Doyle, the rumpled New York detective chasing international drug dealers in director William Friedkin’s thriller The French Connection, brought him stardom and a best actor Academy Award.He also won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1992 for his role as a mean sheriff in the Clint Eastwood western Unforgiven, and was nominated for an Academy Award for his turn as an FBI agent in the 1988 historical drama Mississippi Burning.Since the 1980s, Hackman had lived near Santa Fe, a charming arts town – in 2005 it was recognized as a Unesco “creative city” with a thriving tourism industry. It has become well-known in part due to the famed artists and writers that have called it home, including George RR Martin and Cormac McCarthy.Hackman became well-established in the community, and for many decades could be seen making his way around town. Between 1997 and 2004, he served on the board of trustees for the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum. Speaking at the grand opening of the museum, hesaid: “In the 10 years I’ve lived here, I’ve been taken with the excitement and indomitable spirit of this place.”The couple lived in a gated community just outside Santa Fe.“He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,” his daughters and granddaughter said in a statement on Thursday.“We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.”Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Getting hold of the fifth most valuable franchise of all time was a major motivation for Amazon’s$8.5bn purchase of the Hollywood studio MGM, which jointly owned the rights alongside Eon Productions, in 2021, the year the last Bond film hit cinemas.View image in fullscreenUnder UK and European law, copyright to literary creations expires 70 years after the author’s death.Photograph: GeoPic/AlamyLast week, Amazon shelled out afurther $1bn-plus to wrest full control from Eon, in an effort to get 007 back on the big screen.It will need to move fast before Bond potentially faces his stiffest competition yet – himself. Under UK and European law, copyright to literary creations expires 70 years after the author’s death, at the start of the subsequent year. Given Fleming died in 1964, having penned 12 Bond novels and two anthologies,Amazonhas a short window of exclusivity.“There is a real opportunity for interested parties to make use of the fact that the rights in the James Bond books will soon lapse,” says Chris Froud, a partner and patent attorney at the European IP firm Withers and Rogers. “Companies can take advantage of this by reworking plots and characters and commercialising them for a second time.”However, any big-screen additions to the original books remain legally protected, such as the famous 007 gun-barrel logo, characters such as Jaws, flirtatious banter with Moneypenny and clever remarks when the super spy makes a narrow escape or sees off a henchman.From 1 January 2035, those bold enough to look to exploit “book Bond” would still be able to use the character and famous traits such as his “The name’s Bond, James Bond” motto, driving an Aston Martin, and ordering his martinis “shaken, not stirred”. But care would need to be taken not to have Bond drink Bollinger – 007’s go-to champagne in the films – as Fleming’s paper spy was a Taittinger man.While Bond’s boss M is also a staple of the books, it is debatable whether any would-be 007 copycat creation could show Q as a gadget supremo. And any depiction of Bond’s arguably most famous adversary in the film franchise, Blofeld, would have to see the super-villain appear with hair – and without signature white cat – as he was originally presented in the novels.“Companies will need to be cautious in how they go about exploiting Bond,” says Froud. “The James Bond films are so well known and embedded in popular psyche it would be difficult to separate this knowledge from any new works that creative companies might wish to develop based on the content of the books alone. Any mistakes could attract copyright infringement claims from the owners of the films.”View image in fullscreenWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood & Honey II is part of the new ‘Poohniverse’ featuring popular characters in slasher horrors.Photograph: Publicity imageRecent examples of the exploitation of the copyright of globally known characters suggest there are those who are willing to take such risks. When the Disney-controlled rights to AA Milne’s much-loved Winnie the Pooh entered the public domain on 1 January 2022, the Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds appeared a day later in a US parody ad featuring“Winnie-the-Screwed”– a bear who finds he has been overpaying for his phone bill.In March 2023 a UK-based production company, Jagged Edge, felt emboldened enough to release the controversial horror filmWinnie The Pooh: Blood and Honey. Shot over just five days, the story features Pooh and Piglet going on a murderous rampage after being abandoned by Christopher Robin.View image in fullscreen‘I want Batman so bad,’ says Scott Jeffrey, a film-maker. ‘It is something I feel you could do a lot with.’Photograph: Dominic Winter auctioneers/PAThe successful release – it made almost $8m on a budget of £20,000 – has spawned the so-called Twisted Childhood Universe, also known as the Poohniverse, to create slasher horror films based on well-known characters whose copyrights have expired. The slate of releases and upcoming films includes two Blood and Honey sequels, Peter Pan’s Neverland Nightmare, Bambi: The Reckoning and Pinocchio: Unstrung, and will culminate with an Avengers-style ensemble called Poohniverse: Monsters Assemble, coming out next year.Scott Jeffrey, the producer of the films and Jagged Edge’s founder, says he has never faced a legal challenge from Disney and would love to add Bond to his list of horror makeovers in the future.“When the first film blew up we worried if we had done it by the book, and luckily we had,” he says. “But we did a horror version to keep it as far removed as possible, we wouldn’t have gone near doing a kids’ film. Bond can join the queue. Flipping James Bond on his head would be so interesting, doing something different, twisted – making him the villain.”Even Walt Disney’s most famous creation, Mickey Mouse, has not been spared. On 1 January last year the copyright to Steamboat Willie, Mickey’s earliest persona from the 1928 movie of the same name,expired.Months later the horror film The Mouse Trap was released, while Screamboat – about a late-night boat ride in New York that becomes a struggle for survival when a “seemingly harmless mousetransforms into a dangerous monster” – is due to premiere this April.View image in fullscreenThe Mouse Trap was released months after the copyright to Mickey’s earliest persona expired.Photograph: Publicity imageThe producers repurposing Winnie and Mickey did so on the basis of American law, which protects intellectual property in the US for 95 years from the year of publication. Pooh was technically still under UK copyright for a few more years, but Jagged Edge struck a deal to allow the release.

Control of Superman and Lois Lane are set to end in 2034, Batman in 2035, the Joker in 2036 and Wonder Woman in 2037.Once again wannabe exploiters will have to at first stick to the original versions of the characters, which means no film additions such as the sidekick Robin and Kryptonite, and Superman only being able to leap great bounds, not fly.Hollywood has been preparing for the cliff edge with innovations – such as introducing characters from The Authority, a comic series that only launched in 1999, in the upcoming new Superman film.“I want Batman so bad,” says Jeffrey. “It is something I feel you could do a lot with. And Superman … I wish the bigger companies, the people with proper money, were doing a horror spin-off of their own characters, it would be interesting. You see the same types of films made over and over and it is boring.”Amazon, Eon Productions and Ian Fleming Publications were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsJames BondAmazonIntellectual propertyIan FlemingWalt Disney CompanynewsShareReuse this content"

America doesn’t stand for anything if it doesn’t stand for what it has historically stood for. It becomes a hollow idea, and I think they’re hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit.”The Titanic director has owned a large dairy farm in South Wairarapa since 2012 and has long voiced plans to permanently move to New Zealand,having made his Avatar films with Wellington’s Weta Digital, for which the visual effects studio won an Oscar.The Terminator at 40: did James Cameron see into the future?Read moreCameron acknowledged the global reach of US politics, telling Stuff: “I don’t know if I feel any safer here, but I certainly feel like I don’t have to read about it on the front page every single day. And it’s just sickening. There’s something nice about theNew Zealandoutlets – at least they’ll put it on page three … I just don’t want to see that guy’s face any more, on the front page of the paper. It’s inescapable there, it’s like watching a car crash over and over and over.”He said his New Zealand citizenship was “imminent” and that “it means a lot. It’s something I’ve worked toward, something I’ve had to sacrifice for. If you’re going to uproot your family and move somewhere, you have to invest, you have to be part of it, you have to earn standing. I just think you’ve got to earn your right to be in a place.”Cameron likened New Zealand to his birth country ofCanada, saying: “I grew up in Canada, and I see a lot of similarities here in the way people behave. I actually like it here a little better. There’s an innate respect and a demand for respect. Everybody has this kind of equal status in terms of personhood. And I love that – that’s what I wanted my kids to experience.”In 2023, Cameron expressed his intentions to recruit “some young blood” into New Zealand’s film industry. “I’m sort of speaking on behalf of a big international production, but I’m a resident here, I’ll be a citizen in a year and I plan on making all my films here in Wellington. I love working here. I love the people that I get to work with here,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJames CameronDonald TrumpNew ZealandCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

Subtitled Labyrinths of Life, it’s a typically colourful and occasionally brutal journey that wends its unbroken way through movements labelled Dark and Deep to attain an uneasy truce in a finale entitled Light.The Estonian composer’s second cello concerto, a Philharmonia co-commission, was here receiving its UK premiere with its original soloist Nicolas Altstaedt. Complex and densely scored, it demands a virtuoso technique as the harried cellist ranges from the instrument’s snarling lowest register to the most perilous of heights. Calling for a substantial orchestra, including a skilfully deployed battery of exotic percussion, the work is an intricately balanced marriage of equals.The Philharmonia, conducted with notable clarity by Tüür’s fellow countryman Paavo Järvi, was kept on its toes, fragmentary ideas ricocheting back and forth like musical bullets. Altstaedt’s sinewy tone was only occasionally lost in the orchestral swell. The cadenza, a physical tour de force, saw him striking and stroking the strings with bow and fingers, while slapping and tapping out a tattoo on the instrument’s body and neck.A slightly lopsided programme coupled the 30-minute concerto with Stravinsky’s equally substantial Petrushka, while the totality of the second half comprised the same composer’s 23-minute Firebird Suite. Järvi, an old hand at both, adopted a precise, undemonstrative approach, knowing instinctively when to intervene and when to give the orchestra its head.Petrushka, given here in the pared-back 1947 revision, was a little foursquare at first, but the orchestra soon loosened its stays, tossing off a string of whirling dances with ripely characterful solo contributions (the contrabassoon got an audible chuckle for a fabulously vulgar subterranean fart). Trumpet, bassoon and flute covered themselves in glory in flirtatious episodes between the Ballerina and the Moor.The second half saw Järvi teasing out some breathtaking pianissimos. Skittering variations for The Firebird were followed by a wistful rondo for the enchanted princesses. Helter-skelter syncopations threatened to derail the Infernal Dance, but the players recovered, tumbling exhausted into a gossamer lullaby before rebuilding to an ecstatic apotheosis.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicThe Philharmonia OrchestraSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Though there have been quote-unquote “singles” released in its run-up – the hypnotic, acoustic lullaby ofFlag, or the rolling pianos and rippling harps ofLuciférine–Luminescent Creaturesis an album to fall into; prescription-worthy aural blood pressure medication against a frenetic world.‘Fans say my concerts are safe spaces where they can forgive’: the cult of Ichiko AobaRead moreInspired by field research into Japan’s Ryukyu islands and Aoba’s resultant meditations on the vast powers of the ocean, there is a tactile, organic beauty to Coloratura’s twisting flutes and twinkling bells, or the underwater soundscape of instrumental interlude Cochlea. Though delicate and gentle – laced throughout with Aoba’s featherlight voice – there’s nothing cutesy aboutLuminescent Creatures.

Its Americanness may explain why the cover shows a raven straight out of Poe, but don’t be fooled – McCrae’s guide through hell is a big grey robot seagull called Law: “fucking shithead follow me”. As well as borrowings from Dante and his translators, McCrae’s eclectic mind recycles Kafka in a giant hundred-legged beetle with an orange belly, a different voice calling out of every leg: “look at me I’m a huge success you / Want to know how I got to be where / I am?” It’s refreshing to return to Dantean satire, and here the poet’s target is corporate America. God, whose squeaky voice sometimes comes out of the seagull’s belly, is “the boss”, and at the very heart of hell we meet a stream of bank executives, all queueing up to walk into a coffin where their bodies are, in a witty contrapasso, quite literally liquidated – POP! – each suit emerging with “a pink mush dripping quietly inside it”.View image in fullscreenThe New Carthaginiansby Nick Makoha (Penguin, £14.99)Like Dante entering hell through a rip in the universe, Makoha enters history, accompanied not by Virgil but by a Black Icarus with a microchip for a mouth, and the shade of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. As we follow them, channel surfing and scoffing pepperoni pizza, fragments of the past fly around us like swirling leaves in a tempest – a Bruce Willis film projected on to a skyscraper, African herders caught up in a conflict over water, Freud lecturing on the interpretation of dreams. It’s a dizzying experience, but anchoring it all is the recurrent theme of a 1976 hijacking: “Air France Flight 139 will depart from Tel Aviv … A German will ask for the freedom of forty Palestinians detained in Israel”. The plane is diverted to Uganda, triggering a train of events that will lead to the young Makoha’s flight from the country. Returning to this primal scene that has so radically altered his life, Makoha takes us inside the cockpit, where the pilot has a gun pressed against his head, as well as into the American embassy, where people fret about the disruption to international trade, and through meditations on flight and falling, from Icarus plunging towards the ocean to the fall of Rome. “I was ready to connect history to art,” he writes in one of his teasing footnotes, “the way moonlight connects the sky to the sea. Or maybe I was just hedging my bets.”View image in fullscreenFather’s Father’s Fatherby Dane Holt (Carcanet, £11.99)Holt is part of a feisty new generation of Northern Irish poets, and his stunning debut collection nods to Samuel Beckett with its injunction to fail. Ireland, for Holt, is a nation that needs to acknowledge its colonial history and the damage caused across generations, a subject that he interrogates and reimagines via parables at times reminiscent of Heaney. In The Amateurs he creates a surreal fable about paramilitaries and rough justice, where a couple are mysteriously visited in their home, and the narrator ends up being strung up as the Captain “intones ‘Upwards and upwards travel the escalators of fate …’ / Words so beautiful, so / so beautiful I began to weep there and then / suspended from my heels”. Elsewhere the corporatisation of violence is his theme, as in Can’t Pay? We’ll Take It Away! In these dazzling re-envisagings of a state at war with itself, Holt finds a way to talk directly about what other poets have only been able to allude to, and in doing so he offers us, through absurdist comedy, a fleeting glimpse of a way out of the mess.Hardly Warby Don Mee Choi (And Other Stories, £14.99)“We are just lending them a hand until they can stand on their own two feet. A novel idea. This is why it occurred to me that this particular war was hardly war, the hardliest of wars.” So says a GI in the poem Woe Are You? He’s talking about the Korean war. Armed with her photojournalist father’s images of children and tanks and carpet bombing, this is the great lie that Don Mee Choi sets out to unmask. She does so by juxtaposing the photographs with fragments of news items, memorabilia and propaganda. At one point she calmly describes the devastating effects of napalm. Elsewhere she uses surrealist tactics, her fellow Koreans metamorphosing into hydrangeas spouting baby talk: “I must point out a simple truth – / I’m without a bonnet”. This is not a retreat from reality, but a device to expose the colonialist infantilisation and othering that precedes conquest, war crime and genocide. This is a devastating UK debut, speaking its own faint history in its own faint language, and taking us inside a hidden war whose repercussions are still unfolding today.View image in fullscreenMinxby Karen Downs-Barton (Chatto & Windus, £12.99)This assured debut takes us into the heart of a precarious Anglo-Romany childhood on the edge of urban society, where casual bar work easily slips into casual sex work, and on to explore the perils of state care in the ominously named Home for Crying Children. It’s not just the Dickensian narrative that’s gripping, but the way it brings different forms to bear on its material, without the least sense of strain: from support workers’ multiple-choice questionnaires to shape poems in the style of Dylan Thomas, to desperate letters to an absent sister. Add a peppering of Romany – we quickly pick up “babbi” (baby), “drom” (roads) and “rawni” (lady) – and you have the makings of a heady mix.Philip Terry’s most recent collection is Dante’s Purgatorio (Carcanet).Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Where Twain had teenage Huck as his narrator,in James,Percival Everettreimagines the story from the perspective of his friend and fellow runaway Jim, an enslaved Black man who opens the book with the line: “Those little bastards were hiding out there in the tall grass.”The little bastards in question are Huck and his pal Tom Sawyer, who want to play a trick on Jim while he sleeps. He is alert to the boys’ games but plays along because, as he has learned from experience: “It always pays to give white folks what they want.” When our protagonist learns he is to be sold downriver and separated from his family, he hides on nearby Jackson Island while he comes up with a plan. There he is joined by Huck, who is trying to escape his abusive father.The actor Dominic Hoffman is the book’s narrator. His performance is terrific: variously wry, poignant and thoughtful as he imbues Jim with the humanity and agency denied to him by Twain. Where the original Jim was illiterate and talked in dubious dialect, Percival’s James is erudite and widely read, though he is careful not to let the white people know, speaking to them in “correct incorrect grammar” in order that they retain their sense of superiority. For James, “Jim” is a performance created to minimise danger.Further listeningDare I Say ItNaomi Watts, Penguin Audio, 6hr50minThe actor narrates her memoir on her experience of early menopause and dispenses advice for other women doing battle with their hormones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They cover her early life in St Louis, her adventures in Europe and eventual transformation into, as Sauvage puts it, an “actress and French citizen of worldwide renown”.Memoirs that span a lifetime can lack narrative drive. “Life, when you think about it later,” says Baker, “is a series of images … a film in your heart.” And yet Baker’s matchless character propels the reader. She exudes love and life on the page. And that voice! Her younger one, bright, witty, effervescent, and her older one, wiser, angrier, and still so funny.Her storytelling is writerly and precise, with satisfying arcs in a single sentence or a page. “My childhood was the type where you have no stockings. I was cold and I danced to keep warm.” Starting out in Paris, she is late for shows because she’s eating soup with the concierge. On tour in Europe, she throws photos to the crowd outside her window. “I have never seen so many squashed straw hats.” Or performing for allied soldiers in Berlin in January 1945: “They gave us piles, kilos, hundreds of kilos of German certificates for good conduct that they’d found in the basements of the Reichstag, under the rubble … Proof that we’d be Aryans, and good ones, for ever!”She relishes food and loves her superstitions. In my favourite chapter, she shares recipes and advice. “Ladies, sleep naked under your sheets,” dance, sweat, and don’t be shy with makeup. I wrote down her flan recipe, and, I admit, one for a rheumatism ointment (I mean, look at it): “Take a really fat rattlesnake. Then skin it –alive. Then peel off the fat in the same way … But the snake must be skinned alive, you hear. And it’s hard to find the right kind of snake in Europe.”Returning to America after years in Paris, she goes undercover as 'Miss Brown'Sauvage’s presence adds a cheerful, reflective quality. She’s talking to him, and to us. “Write that down, Monsieur Sauvage.” There is a cheeky sort of intimacy in their chats; I could go barely three pages without doing a spit-take. “We’ve been hiding our buttocks too much for too long,” she says. “Buttocks exist. I don’t know why we dislike them. There are also buttocks that are terribly silly, of course, terribly pretentious, terribly mediocre. All they are good for is sitting on, if that.” History, we can all agree, was on her side on that one.As it has been for so many things. In Europe, she’s stunned by the religious hypocrisy, hateful leaflets and speeches about her shows. “People think I’ve come straight out of the wilderness … folly of the flesh, chaos of the senses, frenzied animality … White imagination is something else when it comes to coloured folk.” Then she gets up on stage and sings “with all my heart, with my whole, trembling, beating heart. I sang Sleep, My Poor Baby, an old Negro spiritual from back in the slave times when Negroes were good for nothing but dying from exhaustion and despair after being beaten by their very Christian owners.”And I haven’t even gotten to the part where she spies for the French resistance! It’s a delightful, nourishing read, along with the rest of her remarkable life, but the most interesting chapter is written (not spoken) by Baker herself, published first in the newspaper France-Soir. Returning to America after years in Paris, she goes undercover as Miss Brown “to travel towards the south while doing everything that was forbidden for a ‘coloured woman’”.She gapes at the racism of the north (“American cities that pride themselves on being at the forefront of all progress”) and the outright violence of the Jim Crow south.In Harlem, she writes about the living conditions of black communities whose bosses and landlords were often Jewish, and her reactions to that are complex, raw, uncomfortable to read 70-odd years later. “Why, in an ironic twist of fate for both of them, must the poor coloured people of Harlem be a punching bag for the Jews, who’ve forgotten their forefathers’ story?” In her foreword, Oluo explains that without historical context Baker’s “blanket statements could cause harm and contribute to bigotry and antisemitism, which I do believe Baker would have opposed … power locks people into hierarchies of white supremacy and deputizes many oppressed people in the subjugation of those with whom they might otherwise stand in solidarity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She rages on behalf of the marginalised and the poor. “Are we just bugs to these good Americans?” She teaches us to dance, to make funny faces, that “money never made anyone shine”, that children and animals enrich our lives. “There is a youthfulness that is free, eternal and for ever, in spite of everything … that’s enough in itself,” she writes. “As for the future … I hope we’ll be able to live naked. There are only a few women, and very few men, who could live naked, show themselves naked. That’s all.”Fearless and Free by Josephine Baker is translated by Anam Zafar and Sophie Lewis and published by Vintage Classics (£18.99).

Fittingly, these nine tracks largely sound like deliciously diabolical spells. Some are scraped on eight-string harding fiddles, others plucked or picked on mouth-harps, microtonal mandolins and guitars, where extra frets help the musicians play the tones between semitones. All are sourced from early-to-mid 20th-century recordings, and range from feverish dances such as Hallingkule (where repeated cyclical patterns sound ferocious between the bow’s horsehair and the strings’ steel) and the uncanny shimmer of Vinjavalsen (played on the langeleik, a zither with one string for the melody and eight for drones).Åshild Vetrhus, whose specialism is funeral dirge singing, is a striking presence on several tracks – sometimes standing out, at other moments meshing into the mix, but always veering masterfully between styles. On the opening medley, she sounds plain, punchy and perfect; on Grønn Står Skogen (The Forest Is Green), a sense of yearning swells along with her breaths; on the last two tracks, both based on religious texts, she’s humble and heartfelt. Still, there are never any concessions to comfort, and Malmin wonder playfully on the liner notes how this set will fit into a world fixated by mood music. I’d say jarringly so, and all the better for it.Also out this monthLisa KnappandGerry Diver’s Hinterland (Ear to the Ground Music) is the first properly collaborative album between the real-life couple, beautifully ducking and diving between love songs, bird songs, spoken-word miniatures (Train Song) and John Barry-dusted murder ballads (Long Lankin). Knapp’s high vocals are also at their heartbreaking best on The Lass of Aughrim, the album’s stunning finale.Jim Ghedi’sWasteland (Basin Rock)is a full-throttle concept album of traditional songs, ballads and originals soundtracking a narrative of dystopian collapse, but the swaggering sonics often distract from the storytelling. The Seasons works best, where Ghedi’s falsetto-flecked, gravelly Sheffield burr is joined simply but very powerfully by Cinder Well’s Amelia Baker, Landless’ Ruth Clinton and Lankum’s Cormac MacDiarmada.The latter also features onA Collection of Slow Airs by Some Very Fine Fiddlers, from the always brilliant Irish label Nyahh Records – a great compilation of melancholy and meditative instrumentals.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicFolk album of the monthNorwayalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Seeking clarity through her pen, the soulful west Londoner is wrestling with growing pains and writer’s block – but then it all flows out. Over a honeyed mix of bossa nova, R&B and pop, and in her gorgeous, breathy voice, Tala ruminates on heartbreak, self-confidence, faith, family and friendship.The bright Lights Camera Action quotesMaya Angelouand has the serenity and sunshine of early Corinne Bailey Rae, but ends with a targeted shot at a fame-hungry sell-out. Survival reflects, eloquently, on her relationship to her father’s Jamaican roots, over shuffling, unsettled drums and harmonies befitting a 90s R&B girl group.View image in fullscreenHope Tala: Hope HandwrittenIt’s not Hope’s style to sensationalise – since her first single in 2018, her music has been earnest and grounded, never theatrical – but over 16 tracks, Hope Handwritten’s consistently mellow mood downplays the turbulence in her writing. It feels a missed opportunity that tracks about religion and mental health (Magic or Medicine) and knee-trembling, earth-shaking romances (Shiver) should share the same level-headed delivery, and that a mid-album trio of love songs blur too easily together.Bad Love God, the record’s odd-one-out, matches an ominous, sexy bassline to a flirty, conflicted dilemma. “I’ll try to repent,” Hope promises, before worshipping at the altar of a forbidden hook-up, “holy water” on her tongue. It shows just how fresh a switch-up can sound in the hands of this talented writer, even if it risks more growing pains.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

After an Israeli Supreme Court ruling, villagers faced expulsion and the systematic demolition of the homes they had lived in for generations, as the army appropriated the land for “training zones”. Local activist Basel Adra was joined by Jerusalem-based journalist Yuval Abraham to film this destruction – and we witness the fear and distress of the populace up close. From bulldozing a school to nighttime arrests and a fatal shooting by a settler, it’s a tough but necessary watch.Tuesday 4 March, 11.15pm, Channel 4The OutrunView image in fullscreenThe cleansing power of nature … Saoirse Ronan in The Outrun.Photograph: Publicity imageNora Fingscheidt’simmersive adaptationof Amy Liptrot’s feted addiction memoir keeps the book’s fractured narrative, switching between the renamed Rona (a superb Saoirse Ronan) falling apart in London and her tentative adjustment to the quiet life back home on Orkney. The cleansing power of nature is a big part of it – she gets a job with the RSPB, and there are many arresting images of windswept beaches and crashing waves – while her bipolar father (Stephen Dillane) and born-again Christian mother (Saskia Reeves) are both help and hindrance.Out now, NetflixMaXXXineView image in fullscreenRetro gorefest … Mia Goth in MaXXXine.Photograph: Justin LubinThere’s more than a touch of Brian De Palma to this gloriously febrile mix of sex and stardom, religion and death.

Paroled prisoner Lang (Eddie Peng) is hired to round up the area’s many stray dogs to prettify the place, but his sensitive personality leads him to hide one spirited canine in his own home. There’s some great doggy acting – and the monosyllabic Peng is pretty good too – as the duo realise they are kindred spirits. Despite the grim setting, it’s a surprisingly light-hearted drama.Sunday 2 March, 6.50am, 2.15pm, Sky Cinema Premiereskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This adaptation is suitably grand and sprawling – an explosion of summertime colour and a fine advertisement for rural Sicily. It tells the story of Don Fabrizio Corbera, a landed prince attempting to hold back the tides of change as Garibaldi’s revolutionary army threatens what he considers his family’s ancestral birthright. Netflix has its cake and eats it, paying lip service to history while leaning heavily into the plentiful sex, sun and scenery, delivering the goods as a lush, stylish costume drama.Netflix, from Wednesday5 MarchWith Love, MeghanView image in fullscreenAspirational … Meghan Markle and Mindy Kaling in With Love, Meghan.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/APAfter being delayed due to the LA wildfires,Meghan Markle’s long-awaited lifestyle series is with us at last – and what a tonic in troubled times. Expect a gushing glimpse of pastel-coloured domestic perfection offering proof that, from cooking to beekeeping, there’s almost no end of things that Markle can do. In fact, you’d probably call this parade of clinking glasses, humming hives and gently snoring dogs aspirational if it wasn’t underpinned by such vast wealth and status. As it is, it’ll probably confirm every viewer’s already established opinion of the woman on screen.Netflix, from Tuesday4 MarchFearView image in fullscreenDiscomfiting … Martin Compston and Anjli Mohindra in Fear.Photograph: Amazon MGM Studios“I like watching you.” As messages from new neighbours go, this isn’t a great start.

To me this is more than a job, it’s a vocation – and I plan to continue to do so as long as I am able.Community Fund projects like ours are paid for by the national lottery. Our aim is to reduce loneliness and isolation by engaging with hard to reach people who might otherwise not be aware of the help and support we have to offer.Covid really made us look deeper as a charity into the way we connect with our clients. From shopping to supporting with general information about the pandemic, we were there at the end of the phone – our volunteers really stepped up.We soon realised that the level of fear and loss was overwhelming for some, and what they really needed was to talk it out. Some lost life partners in such circumstances where they were unable to meet family or friends, which meant they were unable to process the grief. Bereavement services were overwhelmed, leaving people to wait for months for someone to talk to. Out of this situation, we developed a service to provide low-level mental health and welfare support.View image in fullscreenThe Time for Tea eventView image in fullscreenJames, a widower, likes to dance at the Time for Tea eventAs soon as it was safe to do so, our Time for Teas programme was rolled out across the district meaning for the first time since lockdown we could offer people the opportunity to meet up in a socially distanced way. The relief among our clients was palpable. A common feeling was they would rather risk dying of Covid than spend any more time alone. Advanced age meant they felt it was better to enjoy what life they had left than to prolong the inevitable staying at home.View image in fullscreenMary at a Time for tea eventMany of our clients feel their needs should not be spoken of – they don’t want to cause a fuss. I often wonder if this is the last generation that will be accepting of what they are given, be that money, time or healthcare. There is a sense of pride, sometimes stubbornness, which makes them accept what little is offered. Having lived through rationing, some of them during the second world war, many have the mindset of not asking for more.So many people say to us, “I don’t know what I would have done without you” or “you saved my life”. We have to catch as many as possible of those who fall through the net.Molly Fox, 86View image in fullscreenMolly Fox enjoys a cup of tea wrapped in a blanketMolly lives alone – her family are on the other side of the world – which means she’s often lonely even though she has FaceTime calls with them regularly. She manages to get out on her mobility scooter and is well known around her home town. Molly, like many others, struggles to keep warm while keeping her bills affordable. Fear of debt means she wears a coat over her clothes, gloves, scarf and a hot-water bottle, and has hot drinks to keep warm in her lounge when she is alone. Pride and the habit of “living within your means” drives Molly to save money wherever she can.Tom Owen, 91View image in fullscreenTom is a veteran who we came into contact with about three years ago. He would attend our events with Marion, his wife, who was living with dementia. They were self-sufficient, not asking for any help.But Marion recently died and now Tom is totally bereft after looking after his wife of almost 70 years. The love they shared shone through. Now, filling each day becomes a struggle; he can still hear her voice calling out in the night.View image in fullscreenTom Owen in his roomI visit him and his face lights up. As someone who knew Marion, he feels comfortable talking to me about her and how much he misses her. Loneliness is not always a visible condition, but it can have a dramatic impact on your wellbeing and your will to go on.Ellen Pickard, 92View image in fullscreenEllen Pickard with BrendaEllen is a lovely, feisty lady of 92. She doesn’t suffer fools gladly. I am left in no doubt about her opinion on all things.

That’s a shame, given that they are filled with Renaissance architecture, including a magnificent cathedral, and renowned as one of the homes of olive oil. Thanks to its historic position between Christian Castilla and Muslim Granada, the city is surrounded by castles. I recommend staying at the Parador de Jaén. It sits at the top of the hill of Santa Catalina next to the castle, and the views from its rooms towards the Sierra Morena mountains are unparalleled.FelixWalk Galicia’s ‘lighthouse way’View image in fullscreenFaro Touriñán is near the end of the Camiño dos Faros at Fisterra.Photograph: arCam/Getty ImagesA little further along from the Camino de Santiago is theCamiño dos Faros, a week-long 124-mile (200km) hike along the Galician coast. Designed by a group of friends who wanted to share the beauty of their region with more people, the Lighthouse Way follows the coastline through forests, across rivers, estuaries and secluded beaches. You can enjoy immense views from the cliffs and delicious seafood in the fishing villages.

Peña Ubiña, after which the national park is named, has views south to the Castilian plains, and north to the far busier Picos de Europa.

I’ll break that down for you. “Robot”, as in the food is prepared by our new mechanical overlords. “Yakitori” is, essentially, meat grilled on small skewers – think tiny Japanese kebabs dipped in sauces. And then, of course, “restaurant”, as in that place where humans once had jobs before the robots took over. Bleeding robots, eh, clanking in here, taking our jobs?In fact, Yari Club’s “robot” sits in the window of the shop, seemingly to taunt passing Michelin-starred chefs who believe the world will cease to spin if these culinary gods are not up by 5am to source fennel pollen and beech sap. Real chefs can be a huge pain: pricey, sulky and fickle. But there are no such problems with the chef at Yari Club, because it’s a big stainless-steel box filled with hot oil. Despite that jaw-dropping, futuristic aspect being trumpetedloudlyin all the marketing, this particular robot is, at first glance, hugely disappointing. Less robotic than I’d imagined (or hoped for) and more simply a deeply unattractive kitchen gadget. Skewers of chicken hearts, chicken gizzard, chicken wings and every other imaginable bits of a chicken are loaded on to a pulley, dragged through hot oil for a robotically precise number of minutes to make them succulent, then dipped into a special, sweet, soy-based sauce to finish.View image in fullscreen‘Undeniably delicious’:tebaandtorinikuyakitori skewers at Yari Club, London WC2.What was I expecting? One of the 1980s mime duoTik + Tokwearing an apron and beckoning me inside to eat microchips in a repurposed spacecraft? No, but neither did I expect the robot to be simply a no-frills deep-fat fryer, or – and this is the kicker – for it to rely so heavily on humans to do its job. On the lunchtime I visited, Yari Club was almost empty, while Berwick Street market just up the road in Soho was absolutely heaving with lunch-hour workers queueing at its plethora of food trucks, or at the newish pizza spotBreadstall, where artisan slices of cheesy carbs are cooked and served by human hand. Oddly, there seems to be something about the big, spitty, oil-stained Yari Club robot that isn’t drawing the crowds.View image in fullscreenOne of Yari Club’s ‘whopping’ bento boxes – the Kyoto bento.At first glance, Yari Club’s menu might seem a little limited, especially if you’re not in the mood for autopsied chicken on a stick, or to eat it in an unlovable, brown “cafe” space that’s about as cosy as the waiting room in a regional minicab office. In actual fact, however, there’s a lot to love about the food at Yari Club, although it will take a good 10 minutes to work that out, even with the help of a wonderful front-of-house person who pointed out the bento boxes, the katsu curries and the very moreish corn ball options, which turned out to be deep-fried clusters of spicy, crunchy sweetcorn, and completely irresistible. It took another server to point out thetsukunechicken meatball skewers, the mulled sake, the winter specials menu, the padrón peppers and the vegetable tempura.In fact, all the Yari Club’s robot experience does is underline quite how brilliant humans are, what with their opposable thumbs, patience and empathy, and how much hospitality needs them to survive. The Yari Club robot owes a great debt to real-life hospitality staff, because it can’t, for a start, process orders, load up its own skewers or put them on plates. It also can’t cater for vegans, it seems: one potential diner walked in, asked if the tofu scallion option could be cooked without touching chicken fat, was met with bemused looks and flounced out. In a normal restaurant, someone would have bargained with that customer, but robot yakitori not care about the flounce.View image in fullscreenYari Club’s spiced sake has the potential to be ‘a migraine in a paper cup’.All that said, the food at Yari Club is really rather good and, at about £3.80 for two skewers, very reasonably priced, too. Themomochicken thigh skewer, the classicnegimachicken, the teba chicken wings and the prawn tempura are all undeniably delicious: crisp, juicy, tender, smoky when they need to be, and soft and sweet in other places. For all of £13.80, you can build a whopping bento box featuring six skewers, rice or salad, coleslaw, pickles, nori and more of the special-blend, umami flavour bomb that is Yari’s dipping sauce. The mulled sake, meanwhile, has all the whack of sake combined with the synthetic aspect of supermarket mulled wine mix; a migraine in a paper cup. They have Coedo Shikkoko black lager and oolong tea in cans, too, as well lots of nice Japanese teas.I’d go back to Yari Club for a snack, but it’s not really worth travelling out of your way for. There are more impressive robots at the Asda self-checkout.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Although the past is rarely ever as simple or as delicious as we remember it, it seems that culinary nostalgia is very much in vogue. Take the gelatinous success of Instagram accounts such as70s Dinner Partyor the unfathomable cool-ification of devilled eggs. Another thing that’s deserving of a prance back into popularity is Babycham. It’s kitsch in a bottle. Liquid, postwar optimism. And it’s potentially up for a modern revival. Or at least I want it to be, so I’m writing a column about it. It’s called manifesting.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For those who didn’t live through its heyday, Babycham is a sparkling perry, which is like cider, except made from pears. Originally named Champagne de la Poire, Babycham was created by the Showering cider family from pears they saw going to waste when they were buying from local apple orchards. In a postwar world, Herbert Showering saw the changes in drinking habits among women, and an opportunity to create a drink targeted specifically at them.And so Babycham sparkling perry was born. Dinky glasses, handsome men and extremely flammable dresses painted a picture of glamorous, feminine and moderated drinking. Back then, it was an aspirational picture for an emerging middle class; today, however, the obvious attempt to market to women by men feels dated and cynical. If you’d like some further reading on this, drinks writer Rachel Hendry wrote a sparkling deep-diveon Babychamas a precautionary tale about heavily gendered marketing and the part it had to play in the drink falling out of favour with a 21st-century audience.But a modern Babycham is more than deserving of a revival. In 2021, some 70 years after its launch, the sons of the original Showering brothers bought back the brand from Accolade Wines, with the aspiration to “modernise” it to “new and familiar customers” (if they’re looking for a new Babycham girl, my DMs are open). At 6% ABV and with a sweet, fruity palate, it makes a lot of sense in the current market, where low-alcohol and storied drinks are favoured among a younger generation. If you like the sweet, soft fruitiness of prosecco, for example, you’ll probably like Babycham.Other than drinking it straight, try treating it as you would sparkling wine in a cocktail. Anywhere you’d pop prosecco, use Babycham. Mix it into asgroppino. Pour it into abellini. Serve it alongside apornstar martini.I even once had it at an underground bar mixed with eau de vie and raspberry syrup, though I don’t remember a great deal after that.Babycham, plus three things to mix it withBabycham Sparkling Perry£3.50(4 x 200ml)Tesco, 6%.
