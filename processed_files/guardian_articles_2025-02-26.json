Both leaders are expected at a defence summit in London on Sunday.But hanging over Starmer’s talks with Trump will be pressure to extract asecurity backstop. The prime minister is expected to spell out that any British boots on the ground would be contingent on the US providing support including air, logistics and communications.“The security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin from coming again, because my concern isif there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious for all to see,” he said on the flight to Washington.The decision to commitBritish troops to any peace-keeping force, which could put them on the frontline of a conflict with Russia, was “not taken lightly”, he said. “It’s a considered decision. We are still in discussions as to what that might look like.”Ahead of his own visit to Washington, President Zelenskyy confirmed that a deal to share some of Ukraine’s mineral wealth with the US had been agreed, although he added the initial agreement was more of a framework and that he also still needed American security guarantees.However, the US president appeared to immediatelyreject demands for a backstop. “I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. We’re going to have Europe do that, because we’re talking about Europe as the next-door neighbour,” he said.“But we’re going to make sure everything goes well. As you know, we’ll be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare earth. We very much need rare earth. They have great rare earth.”UK officials played down expectations of a breakthrough on the issue during the White House talks, stressing that this was just the beginning of a process with very little already agreed and talks set to continue for weeks.“When there’s a Trump presidency the rhetoric is always very destabilising, but if you zoom out you can see what’s going on. The president has been very clear he wants to end the war. We just need to focus on how,” one said.In recent weeks, Trump has upended the transatlantic alliance and the western consensus on Ukraine, alarming European nations by aligning the US with Moscow including at the United Nations. Yet Starmer is going into the talks with a clear message that Putin is the aggressor, after the US president falsely claimed Ukraine had started the war.“There’s one aggressor here and that’s Russia, in clear breach of the UN charter. Russia can end this conflict tomorrow by withdrawing and stopping their aggression,” Starmer told the Guardian.“All the discussion that follows about talks, about security guarantees, has to be seen in that context. They are the aggressor. They have invaded and occupied a sovereign country in Europe, and they bear full responsibility for the conflict.”However, despite some of Trump’s more far-fetched claims over Ukraine, Starmer said there was “no issue” between them on the approach to Putin. “Of course, the president has been very clear about the peace that he wants. He’s right about that. We all want peace. The question is, how do we make sure it’s a lasting peace? There’s no issue between us on this.” He was certain the US president could be trusted, he added.In a surprise speech on Tuesday, Starmer announced thebiggest increase in UK defence spendingsince the end of the cold war. The budget will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – three years earlier than planned – and with the ambition to reach 3%, paid for by cutting aid spending, a decision that has dismayed many Labour MPs.The prime minister, asked whether he could reassure the British people over the prospect of further conflict, said the government was taking the “necessary measures” to keep the country safe. “Because Putin has already caused insecurity in our country, in our waters, and air, in cyberspace,” he added.Starmer will be accompanied at the White House byDavid Lammy, the foreign secretary, Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, and Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff. The new UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, is also likely to be there.He is expected to urge Trump not to impose damaging trade tariffs on the UK, arguing that the two countries have balanced trade, which means Britain should be spared.“We’ve got a balanced book as it were, when it comes to trade,” he said. “We’ve got strong trade, millions and millions of pounds either way with the US. It’s pretty balanced in terms of surplus and deficit, and obviously I will act in our best economic interests.”He was expected to meet US business leaders who are investing in the UK on Wednesday, in an attempt to strengthen the bilateral trading relationship which is already worth about $400bn (£315bn).The deal for the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands is also likely to be discussed, with Lammy telling ITV’s Peston show that “if President Trump does not like the deal, the deal will not go forward”.Starmer is set to dangle the prospect of a second state visit to the UK for Trump. “He’s very fond of the royal family, as you know,” he said. A No 10 spokesperson added: “President Trump has a great and deep respect for the royal family and has met King Charles on several occasions. The prime minister would absolutely welcome a visit by President Trump to the UK in the future.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerDonald TrumpEuropeDefence policyRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

It’ll be 25%,” he said.The EU vowed to respond “firmly and immediately” to “unjustified” trade barriers, signaling that it stands ready to retaliate swiftly against new tariffs.The bloc is the US’s third largest trading partner alongside China. Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs on the US’s two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, next week.Trump did not give further details but mentioned carmakers and said the levies would be applied “generally”. “And that’ll be on cars and all other things,” he said.AEuropean Commissionspokesperson said: “The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies. The EU will always protect European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified tariffs.”Trump has made a series of announcements about imposing tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners but has repeatedlydelayedimposing the levies on Canada and Mexico.Earlier this week, Trump defended his tariff threats and said foreign cars, drugs and semiconductor chipswould be hitwithin weeks.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, met with Trump in Washington this week and had appeared confident that he had talked Trump out of a trade dispute with the EU and to concentrate instead on his dealings with China.“Come on, you cannot have a trade war with China and Europe at the same time. I hope I convinced him,” MacrontoldFox News after the meeting.According to Bloomberg, Trump’s tariffs could hit as much as $29.3bn (€28bn) of the bloc’s exports. The EU haspledged to retaliateimmediately if the US imposes tariffs on its member countries’ exports. “The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures,” the bloc’s executive body said earlier this month.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, has said the EU should do all it can to avoid “totally unnecessary and stupid tariff wars”.Many economists and even conservative publications, including theWall Street Journal, have warned that Trump’s plans risk hurting the US economy. On Wednesday, Trump took to Truth Social, his social media platform, to attack a Journal editorial that argued his tariffs on Canada and Mexico would backfire, hurting the US economy.Calling the argument “soooo wrong”, Trump wrote: “The tariffs will drive massive amounts of auto manufacturing to MICHIGAN, a State which I just easily one [sic] in the Presidential Election,” he wrote.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationEuropean UnionUS politicsEuropean CommissionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A separate proposal to move to a three-child limit has also been discussed, but is understood not to be under serious consideration.Ministers hope the plans will answer criticism that Labour is not doing enough to tackle child poverty. But their publication this spring could be another flashpoint in relations between the government and Labour backbenchers, many of whomwant the cap abolished completely.One person briefed on the discussions said: “Officials are keen to mitigate the impact of the cap, if not lift it entirely. They have been discussing a range of options to do so, but at the moment, helping parents of under-fives seems to be one of the most likely.”Another said: “Everything is on the table. The important thing is to have child poverty falling by the end of the parliament.”A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “We do not comment on speculation. Our ministerial taskforce is exploring all available levers across government to give every child the best start in life.”Ministers and officials are in regular talks with thinktanks and child poverty experts as they put the finishing touches to their strategy, and have asked several organisations to work up models for how many children they could lift out of poverty under various scenarios.The argument for lifting the cap for parents of very young children has been bolstered by a analysis from the Fabian Society, which shows 1.2 million children aged up to four are living in a household with less than 60% of the median income, after housing costs have been accounted for.Just under half of those are classified as living in “deep poverty”, on less than 40% of the median income, excluding housing. The figures come from a new analysis of the government’s Family Resources Survey.Ben Cooper, a research manager at the Fabian Society, said: “As the government prepares its child poverty strategy, they must focus relentlessly on lifting babies and toddlers out of poverty – and ensuring they have the support needed to thrive.“Over a third of very young children in England and Wales live in poverty. More than a million babies and toddlers risk having their life chances, health and wellbeing harmed as a result.“The government must show voters they can deliver change and turn the tide on child poverty in the early years.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would raise the number of children living below the poverty to an all-time high of 4.6 million.The thinktank added, however, that scrapping the child benefit cap and the overall welfare cap would lift 500,000 children out of poverty, albeit at a cost of £4.5bn.Adam Corlett, a principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “A government that is serious about reducing child poverty will need to undo some of the policies announced by previous governments, such as scrapping the two-child limit.”Explore more on these topicsChild benefitsCommunitiesChildrenBenefitsLabourWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

The man, who works in the Premier League but is protected by a court anonymity order, is being sued for damages by a woman for rape and sexual assault, which allegedly took place at his home in the 1990s when she was 15.His lawyers said he denied raping her but admitted initiating a “cash for sex” arrangement with her when she was “16 or just 17”.In court filings, first reported by the Athletic and seen by the PA news agency, lawyers for the woman claimed that the figure “was aware” that the woman was 15 at the time of the alleged rape, and that the “disgusting and traumatising” experience left her “inevitably humiliated and stigmatised”.They alleged the incident took place after she was dropped off at the man’s home by her parents and that afterwards he gave her “£150 in three £50 notes” which left her feeling “inevitably violated and ashamed”. They continued: “The claimant was fearful of disclosing the fact of the index sexual assaults at the time, as she was aware of the power that the defendant held.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They added: “She feared that she would suffer repercussions and also feared that she or her family may come to some harm if she disclosed what the defendant had done to her.”The filings stated that the woman suffered from “consequential psychological symptoms”, including “complex post-traumatic stress disorder” and “recurrent depressive disorder”. She reported the incident to the police in 2021 but was later told that no further action would be taken.The man has denied that the alleged rape took place, with his lawyers describing the claim as “wholly unfounded” and the accusations as “dishonest and malicious”. They admitted that the pair had a “cash for sex” arrangement while the woman was aged 16 or 17, but that she “continued to enjoy a friendship” with him for many years.The documents read: “The defendant had asked the claimant if she wanted to earn some cash for sex, to which she readily agreed. The defendant’s request was not made whilst the claimant was at his home, and having accepted the request, she then travelled to his home under her own steam.”They claimed that the pair had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse “up to about 15 occasions in total … for which he rewarded her with cash payments, in line with her expectations”.In a separate document, the woman admitted through her legal team that she had sexual intercourse with the man when she was 17, but “expressly denied” that she “readily agreed” to the cash-for-sex arrangement, and added that she believed he would “provide her with a career” if she “complied with his sexual demands”.In April last year, Judge Amanda Stevens ruled that the man should be anonymised in the civil proceedings, as it was “necessary to secure the proper administration of justice” and that “there is no sufficient countervailing public interest in disclosure”.A further hearing in the case is expected to be held at a later date.Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

If a British person from the time would have come to the site they would have known what they are doing in there.”They are waiting for the results of wood samples but the posts are most likely to have been made from oak. The team hopes to do genetic testing to see if there are any DNA connections between the site and the UK or other parts ofEurope.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkStonehengeArchaeologyHeritageSculptureEuropeArtnewsShareReuse this content"

But the generosity of the autocrat is always potentially lethal.”On Wednesday,Donald Trumpheld hisfirst full cabinet meeting. The mood was warm and convivial and, some might say, generous. Housing secretary Scott Turner offered a prayer that included: “Thank you, God, for President Trump.”Was it just an accident that the TV camera framed the scene as the antithesis of DEI? Viewers could see seven men in suits with Trump in the middle, then another row of seven men in suits sitting behind. Nearly all of them were white. (Yes, there were women and people of colour at the meeting – but not many.)The Vice-president,JD Vance, was in attendance but there was no doubt whom this emperor had appointed as consul. Trump invitedElon Musk, the tech billionaire running the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), to speak before any of his cabinet secretaries after claiming that everyone present was supportive.Outcry as White House starts dictating which journalists can access TrumpRead moreWearing a black “Make America great again” cap, Musk jokingly referred to himself as “humble tech support” – people laughed dutifully – and claimed that his haphazard efforts to take a chainsaw to the federal government can save a trillion dollars and dig the country out of debt. “It’s not an optional thing, it’s an essential thing,” he said. “If we don’t do this, America will go bankrupt.”It sounds fine in theory. But Doge,mostly consisting ofyoung male software engineers fuelled by pizza and Red Bull, has been a disaster. It fired the people who oversee the nuclear weapons stockpile then hastily tried to rehire them, only to find they were hard to contact because they could not access their work email accounts. It claimed to have saved $8bn on a terminated contract that was actually worth only $8m. Musk falsely stated that the US spent $50m on condoms for Gazans. And it emerged this week Doge quietlydeleted the top five itemsfrom its public ledger of alleged savings after they turned out to be nothing of the sort.Musk – who brought similar unholy chaos to Twitter when he bought it – admitted to the cabinet that Doge will make mistakes, but said it will fix them quickly. “So, for example, withUSAid, one of the things we accidentally canceled briefly was Ebola prevention. So we restored the Ebola prevention immediately, and there was no interruption.”Not reassuring.Then came the most autocratic episode of the meeting. Trump, both generous and lethal, asked his cabinet: “Is anybody unhappy with Elon? If you are, we’ll throw him out of here.”To the crocodiles? Or as his pal Vladimir Putin favours, from a high window? From this assembly of fawners, flatterers and flunkies, there was nervous laughter and applause.Triumphant, the president assured reporters: “They have a lot of respect for Elon, that he’s doing this, and some disagree a little bit but I will tell you for the most part I think everyone’s not only happy – they’re thrilled.”Game respects game. Musk, a fan boy of far-right movements all over Europe, showed an impressively instinctive feel for totalitarianism.He said: “President Trump has put together I think the best cabinet ever, literally, and I do not give false praise. This is an incredible group of people. I don’t think such a talented team has ever been assembled. I think it’s literally the best cabinet the country’s ever had … ”Then came a telling slip from the world’s richest man: “I think the company [sic] should be incredibly appreciative of the people in this room.”The cabinet on which Musk lavished such praise includesPete Hegseth, a former Fox News host accused of sexual assault and alcohol abuse, andRobert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine conspiracy theorist who once dumped a dead bear cub in New York’s Central Park. Less Marvel’s Avengers thanStar Wars cantina.Kennedy was asked by reporters about a measles outbreak in Texasin which a child reportedly died, the first measles fatality in the US for a decade. His lackluster response: “It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.”Canada’s American coach Marsch ‘ashamed’ of Trump’s 51st state commentsRead moreThe whole meeting was yet another sorry exercise in worshipping an authoritarian and normalising a bully. Musk tried to defend the emails he sent to government employees, asking what they did last week, as not a “performance review” but a “pulse check review” because some people on the government payroll are dead.Trump rounded off the meeting by observing: “The country’s got bloated and fat and disgusting and incompetently run.”Yet as Jon Stewartnoted this weekon Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, Doge will not touch the $3bn in subsidies given to oil and gas companies, a hedge fund loophole worth $1.3bn a year, or the $2tn given to defence contractors to build a fighter jet that will soon be obsolete. “This is where the real money is,” Stewart said.Not even a functioning democracy ever did much about those. So hopes for a country run by a wannabe Caesar and his oligarch pal are not high.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsThe US politics sketchTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskRobert F Kennedy JrPete HegsethnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s a death knellMargaret Sullivan‘I couldn’t be more sad and disgusted,’ says former top editor Martin BaronWed 26 Feb 2025 15.10 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 21.20 ESTShareOwners and publishers of news organizations often exert their will on opinion sections. It would be naive to think otherwise.But a draconian announcement this week by Jeff Bezos, theWashington Postowner, goes far beyond the norm.Thebillionaire declaredthat only opinions that support “personal liberties” and “free markets” will be welcome in the opinion pages of the Post.“Viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” he added.The paper’s top opinion editor, David Shipley, couldn’t get on board with those restrictions. He immediately – and appropriately – resigned.The ‘Gulf of America’ feud is about something bigger: Trump wants to control the media | Margaret SullivanRead moreEspecially in light of the billionaire’s other blatant efforts to cozy up to Donald Trump, Bezos’s move is more than a gut punch; it’s more like a death knell for the once-great news organization he bought in 2013.It’s unclear what will happen to such excellent left-of-center columnists as Catherine Rampell, Eugene Robinson and EJ Dionne. And it’s unclear to what extent this ruling eventually will affect the paper’s hard-news coverage, which so far has been unbowed in covering the chaotic rollout of the new Trump administration.Whatisclear is that Bezos no longer wants to own an independent news organization. He wants a megaphone and a political tool that will benefit his own commercial interests.It’s appalling. And, if you care about the role of the press in America’s democracy, it’s tragic.“What Bezos is doing today runs counter to what he said, and actually practiced, during my tenure at the Post,” Martin Baron, the paper’s executive editor until 2021 and the author of the 2023memoirCollision of Power: Trump, Bezos and the Washington Post, told me in an email Wednesday.“I have always been grateful for how he stood up for the Post and an independent press against Trump’s constant threats to his business interest,” Baron said. “Now, I couldn’t be more sad and disgusted.”Bezos is sacrificing the Post’s reputation and any hope for its financial stability on the altar of personal gain. Recall that the company lost some 300,000 subscribers a couple of months ago after Bezos forbid the publication, just before the presidential election, from publishing a planned editorial endorsing Trump’s Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.More recently, the Post refused to publish Ann Telnaes’s cartoon that showed American oligarchs, including Bezos, bowing to Trump; in protest, she resigned from the Post, where she had worked since 2008.This latest move certainly will mean more Post subscribers will flee, partly in protest and partly because the paper – at least on its opinion side – no longer does the job.Having worked at the Post myself as its media columnist for six years, until 2022, I know the paper’s readership well.Post subscribers are well-informed, smart and savvy; they know and appreciate the paper’s history, including the way it bravely stood up to presidential power during the Pentagon Papers and Watergate eras when the Graham family were the owners.These readers span the traditional political spectrum from liberal to old-school conservative. And they understand the sometimes adversarial relationship between government and the press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I foresee a mass subscriber defection from an outlet already deep in red ink; that must be something businessman Bezos is willing to live with.He must also be willing to live with hypocrisy.“Bezos argues for personal liberties. But his news organization now will forbid views other than his own in its opinion section,” Baron pointed out, recalling that it was only weeks ago when the Post described itself in an internal mission statement as intended for “all of America”.“Now,” Baron noted, “its opinion pages will be open to only some of America, those who think exactly as he does.”It’s all about getting on board with Trump, to whose inauguration Bezos – through Amazon, the company he co-founded – contributed a million dollars. That allowed him a prime seat, along with others of his oligarchical ilk.“There is no doubt in my mind that he is doing this out of fear of the consequences for his other business interests, Amazon [the source of his wealth] and Blue Origin, [which represents his lifelong passion for space exploration],” Baron said. Now, Baron added, he is prioritizing those interests and, in so doing, “betraying the Post’s long-standing principles to do so”.As a Post loyalist myself – drawn into my career by the courageous journalism I admired as a teenager in the 1970s, thrilled to join its ranks in 2016 – I’m crushed to see its precipitous decline.Bezos set out to save the Washington Post from financial ruin when he bought it, and, for a time, he did that and more.But the best thing he could do now would be to sell it to someone who understands the stewardship of a national treasure.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionWashington PostJeff BezosUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

The Fendis celebrated 100 years in fashion with a show that began with a cameo by Dardo and Tazio, seven-year-old great-great-grandsons of house founders Edoardo and Adele. The twins’ jewellery designer mother, Delfina, designed the snake chain bracelets and shimmering fountain earrings in the show; their grandmother, Silvia, artistic director of accessories and menswear, presided over the evening as master of ceremonies.Fendi is now owned by LVMH. “So I’m not here because I own it – I don’t,” said Silvia backstage before the show. “But nothing changed for me when we sold. This is still my home.”This night was both business – over 1,000 guests, more than 100 new outfits which will soon be on sale, a stellar cast including British models Yasmin Le Bon, 60, and Penelope Tree, 75 – and sentiment. The role of womenswear designer is now vacant, after the departure of Kim Jones last year. Recruitment for his successor has been on ice during the centenary to give the Fendi family their flowers as they celebrate their milestone.Silvia Venturini Fendi is no ordinary nepo baby. In 1997, three years after she joined the family business, she designed the Baguette handbag. So named because of a svelte profile that allowed it to be tucked under an arm like a French loaf being carried home from the boulangerie, the Baguette became Fendi’s foremost product, namechecked in Sex and the City. Sarah Jessica Parker was at this show in honour of that pop culture moment.View image in fullscreen‘Fendi-ness’: Silvia Venturini Fendi described the spirit behind the centennial collection as ‘something alchemic’.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APThe anniversary collection was steeped in the codes of the 1960s and 1970s, soundtracked to Barry White. The catwalk was carpeted in the brick-red shade that Silvia remembers from the Rome atelier where her mother, Anna, worked when she was little. “I went there a lot because my mother was working very long hours, and she didn’t have a driving licence, so I would go with my father in the car in the evening to pick her up.”“We call it the Fendi-ness,” was Silvia’s name for the spirit of the show. “ It’s something alchemic. An obsession with quality. Luxury, a bit of fun, and a lot of incredible women.”The clothes were steeped in fashion history to reflect a grand heritage. Edoardo and Adele started out selling handbags and fur stoles, and the house still sells fur. There were grand greatcoats and precious lingerie evening dresses, soft Chantilly lace and tiny fingernail sequins. Ribbed knit dresses dissolved into lettuce hems.Silvia Fendi said she wanted a collection rich in memories, not a forensic trawl through the archive. Invitations for the show came in the form of exquisite accordion-style leather-bound, saddle-stitched photo albums, with tiny black and white portraits showing a five-year-old Silvia and a 1960s snap of her mother, Anna, and her four sisters Paola, Franca, Carla and Alda, magnificently beehived in the Rome atelier.Explore more on these topicsMilan fashion weekFashion weeksItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Then you spot spring’s first flower ...Wed 26 Feb 2025 10.29 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareThere’s no such thing as gardener’s block, I once read. This from, I believe, a famous writer who was making the point that if you’ve got writer’s block, you should just go and do something else for a bit. Point taken. There is no such thing as gardener’s block because if you get stuck doing one job, even in the smallest garden, there are roughly 10m other jobs you can be cracking on with. Which is quite right. And this is what makes gardening either the worst thing for you if – like me – you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or possibly the best.I stride into the garden full of purpose and ambition, with a smile on my face. Invariably, several hours later, I stagger out of there, aching all over, scratched, bloodied, filthy and demoralised, having dug, scraped, cursed and carried myself to physical and mental exhaustion. The clarity of purpose I have at the outset vanishes very quickly, along with my secateurs. In its place, as things that need doing proliferate around me likeJapanese knotweed, there comes a confusion of purpose. Lots gets done a little bit, but nothing gets done properly. Nothing is finished. And it all looks a right bloody mess.Here’s how it unfolds. Having learned that just wandering into the garden and getting on with something is a recipe for instant chaos, I delay the chaos by deciding in advance which job I am to tackle. Clever, eh? So intense is my focus that if I have made the decision the night before, I will often dream about it. To be clear, we’re not talking about anything particularly ambitious here, some great landscaping endeavour that might make it on toGardeners’ World; far from it.Typically, I’ll undertake merely to tidy up one small corner of the garden, perhaps a little patch of ground the size of a modest dinner table. The dog, downbeat at the realisation that we have not come outside for a walk, sighs and slumps to the ground. He’ll watch me for hours, utterly without interest. I mutter an apology to him, fall to my knees over the planned patch of earth and commence tearing at weeds, stringy bits of old plants and so on.I pull at ivy and it keeps coming … Soon I am a magician at a kids’ party, pulling an endless string of handkerchiefs out of a pocketI soon realise that I haven’t got anything next to me in which to put what I’m tearing out. I get up and go in search of a bucket. Now, what did I do with all my big buckets and tubs? On my way to fetch something suitable, I spy a bit of ivy or honeysuckle somewhere I don’t want it. I start pulling and it keeps coming. And coming. Soon I am a magician at a kids’ party, pulling an apparently endless string of knotted handkerchiefs out of a trouser pocket. Except there are no squeals of delight and amusement at my efforts, just the blank stare of a disconsolate dog.It feels as if there’s no end to the ivy, honeysuckle and whatnot because, it turns out, there is indeed no end. The more fanatically I seek it and pull it, the more I add to the giant tangle at my feet. Eventually, I can take no more, admit failure and try to remember what I was originally doing. Oh yes, need a big bucket for the weeds. I’ll need a much bigger bucket for the bird’s nest I’ve just created, but that can wait.I return to the original patch of ground and start making real progress. This is more like it. But then I come across a root of something that won’t come out. I dig around it with the trowel I’ll inevitably soon lose, but it’s not shifting. Right, I’ll teach this bastard a lesson, I grunt, and go in search of a proper spade. In the unlikely event that I find one, I return to the root. I dig around it, flinging dirt everywhere, tug at it and find it’s not yielding, so I dig some more. The more stubborn it is, the more stubborn I get. Two can play at this game. Deeper and deeper I go until not much more than the soles of my boots are visible poking out the top of the hole. I look up to see the dog peering down at me, into the abyss. In a moment, surely, I’ll pull and the root will come out; I will have won. But it doesn’t and this madness, too, must stop.I reach for my big anvil lopper, poke it right down into the depths of the hole and sever the wretched root. But there’s no dressing it up; the moral victory isn’t mine. Root one, me nil. I fling it away in fury, only for the dog to fetch it. He thinks fun time has come. How very wrong he is.I’m so fed up with myself that I turn to something else, perhaps taking out my frustration on a tree or a bush that may or may not need attacking with the lopper I happen to have in my hand. More debris lies around me. I gather it all up and dump it somewhere I’ll chance upon when it’s semi-decomposed in many years’ time. I go back to the hole and fill it up so that I can begin forgetting my root failure, doubtless burying the trowel in the process.So where’s the upside for me? Well, not every gardening day is like the one above. Modern life, with smartphones and social media and stuff, is undoubtedly a vector for ADHD. But if you’ve got it, everything is potentially a vector for it. Even something as ageless as a garden. So, recognising this, I have a word with myself and try to see it as a metaphor for all of life. I try to learn from it. That is, recognise I can’t do everything all at once, that there’s no such thing as perfection, that it’s fine to let your focus flit around a bit, just not too much.Above all, in a garden more than anywhere, understand that life is about patience and that hiding in plain sight in the galaxy of distractions are countless little miracles you can lose yourself in: a mere snowdrop or the first yellow flower on a forsythia.Unfortunately, both of these things herald the coming of spring. Everything is going to start growing again. Panic back on. Now, where in God’s name have I left my spade?Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No one knows what to argue aboutZoe WilliamsWith this US president, diplomacy is over, but it would be great to have a clue how Britain is going to respondWed 26 Feb 2025 12.14 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 15.42 ESTShare“Does the prime minister agree with me,” asked Labour’s Alex McIntyre, “that we are delivering opportunity for the next generation?” The soft-soap question from your own team is such a well-worn convention of PMQs that it was previously impossible to imagine anyone bringing anything new to it, but McIntyre was so trite and banal, with so much incongruous passion, nay, fury, that it was genuinely diverting. Good job, that man. Someone put a sticker on his suck-ass chart.The real business was the prime minister’s trip to Washington; and what a vast amount of business this encompasses. It’s three years this week “since Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine”, Starmer reminded the house, and that grinding war still holds a unique place in the chamber: the issue on which every serious person is agreed.Every party is proud to support Ukraine, proud of the generosity of the British people in opening their homes to refugees. If Kemi Badenoch was looking for one of her clip moments – where she asks a question so hostile and overbaked that the answer comes back, “Eh? What are you on about?”, but it doesn’t matter, because she just needed 45 seconds for an Insta Reel – she wasn’t going to get one on this topic. She and the prime minister do not meaningfully disagree.And on the one hand, you might think: fair, it’s a war of aggression, naturally all decent people side with the aggressed. But on the other, you think, why the hell not? The real reason Ukraine is dominating political business now is not that grim anniversary, but rather, the actions ofDonald Trumpsince he came into office. Some people in this house agree with Trump and rejoiced in his victory, but it’s taking them a long time to marry that to a Russia/Ukraine position that was previously so simple.Other people regard Trump as the vanguard of a hard-right global surge that is terrifying to behold, and even if they never said anything to that effect, it would be possible to guess it from everything you know about social democratic values, juxtaposed against everyone he appoints, everything he says, and everything he does. So why aren’t they actually arguing? What’s the holdup?OK, on Badenoch’s first question, I can see the delay: “The prime minister and I are completely united in our support for Ukraine,” she began, “as a proud and sovereign nation. What specific steps will he take to ensure that Ukraine is at the negotiating table for any peace settlement?” Complete unity is not easily posable, as a question, and the way she framed it as one wasn’t easy to answer. “It is right,” Starmer replied, “and I think the whole house will think it’s right, that there can be no negotiations about Ukraine, without Ukraine.” But before the spectacle of Trump and Putin negotiating alone, this wasn’t even a live question, so what specific steps could you take, against two monomaniacs trying to carve up the world to their own liking? I guess, as with any daunting, gigantic task, the same way you’d eat an elephant, one bite at a time – but that would involve actually opening your mouth.Starmer remains determined that the US is as important an ally as ever. As he reminded Labour’s Rosena Allin-Khan, we have a “special and deep relationship with the US, and that’s not just words. That’s to do with security, defence, intelligence capability, all vitally important.” Fine, fine, don’t disagree with Trump then, not when you’re flying out to see him this very afternoon and you haven’t even decided what house gift to bring. But would it be remiss to ask whether there’s anything you disagree with him on, given that your support for Ukraine is the exact opposite of what he stands for?Round and round they all went. Badenoch distracted herself by fixating on whether the Chagos deal was going to come out of the new defence spending figure, and whether it was in response to her suggestion that Starmer had taken that money out of the aid budget (to which she got an answer so salty from Starmer, it was almost teenage – “She didn’t feature in my thinking at all. I was so busy over the weekend I didn’t even see her proposal”).But whether from Allin-Khan or the Conservative Simon Hoare, asking whether the prime minister intended to protest against Trump’s degrading noises about turning Canada into a 51st state; whether it was Ed Davey, suggesting that now’s the time to focus on the EU (tsk, typical remainers, always ready to rejoin through the back door), or the Tory John Lamont, invoking the spirit of Churchill every which way, the foundation of each question was the same: the US is no longer speaking recognisable foreign policy. The grammar is all shot, the language is different, diplomacy is over, and while Trump’s precise ratio of meaning to posture is not yet clear, one thing we cannot call this is “all on the same page”. So we’re going to, what? Not mention that? Mention it in a nice way? It’d be great to have a clue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In simple terms, the company plans to focus on the areas of its business that make the most money.This means increasing investment in its oil and gas business to just over $10bn a year, of which 70% will be invested in oil and 30% will go to gas. It hopes this will lead to at least 10 major oil and gas projects by 2027, and another eight by 2030.At the same time it will slash $5bn from the spending plans for its low-carbon energy and retail service stations. It has already spun off of its offshore wind interests tocreate a 50-50 joint-venturewith the Japanese power generator Jera, and it plans to sell off a stake in the solar farm developer Lightsource BP, too. Low-carbon energy will make up less than 5% of its annual investment, versus about 75% from oil and gas extraction. Its previous plan involved putting more than 20%, or $3-$5bn of its $14-$18bn capital spending, into low-carbon.“I’m truly excited,” said Auchincloss. “It’s very cool.”How does this compare with its previous plan?It is a stark shift from theplan set out in 2020 under the then boss, Bernard Looney, when BP won praise from green groups for committing to the most ambitious energy transition plan of any major oil company.The company vowed to “reimagine” itself as a net zero energy company by 2050 by cutting oil and gas production by 40% by 2030 and growing its low-carbon energy investments ten-fold to $5bn a year by the end of the decade.Under these plans BP hoped to increase its renewable generating capacity from 2.5GW in 2019 to 50GW by 2030. It also promised to shrink its oil and gas production from 2.6m barrels of oil and gas to 1.5m barrels over the same period.However, by 2023 BP hadbegun to water down its strategy. It raised its oil and gas production target from 1.5m barrels a day by 2030 to 2m barrels, saying Russia’s war on Ukraine meant the world would need more sources of secure energy.Why has BP ‘reset’ its strategy?BP has come under pressure from investors to turn its back on its remaining green ambitions after the company’s share price slumped by a quarter in the past two years, while the market value of rival oil companies has climbed.Auchincloss, BP’s former finance chief, told investors that the company’s faith in the green energy transition had been “misplaced” and that the company had gone “too far, too fast” in recent years.The green strategy faced two major obstacles: first, a post-Covid bottleneck in global supply chains combined with the recent surge in interest rates has made investing in green energy more expensive. Second, the recent surge in global oil and gas prices has made producing fossil fuels more profitable.There is a third problem now, too: the notorious activist hedge fund Elliott Management hasamassed a significant stake in BP, which could embolden it to call for sweeping changes to restore its lost value – including a breakup of the company and a boardroom cull.Has BP’s plan won over investors?It is not clear whether BP’s investors are convinced by this plan.Equity analysts at HSBC described the strategy as “the fundamental reset we’d been waiting for”. In a note to investors the bank said: “We’ve argued in previous research that capital allocation and a change in narrative were key to success of BP’s long-awaited [capital markets day]. To be fair, it does feel like BP has heard the market’s message on the need for a fundamental reset loud and clear.”However, the company’s share price fell 3% after it unveiled the new strategy. This may reflect short-term frustrations over BP’s plan to reduce its share buybacks to no more than $1bn a quarter, down from $1.75bn previously, to shore up its balance sheet. But it may also reflect investor fears that the plan offers too little, too late.What do green groups say?There has been outrage from climate campaigners, with protest plans targeting the company’s London HQ emerging hours after the strategy was announced.Charlie Kronick, a senior climate adviser for Greenpeace UK, said the reset was proof that fossil fuel companies “can’t or won’t be part of climate crisis solutions”. He called on the government to “ensure companies like BP pay their share for the climate damage they’re causing”.The plan could be bad news for BP’s long-term financial health, too, according to Mark van Baal, the founder of the shareholder action group Follow This. He said BP risked “a dramatic decline in share value” as the reality of the climate crisis became apparent. “Sooner or later oil companies will be held liable for the costs for climate damage,” Van Baal said.Explore more on these topicsBPClimate crisisFossil fuelsGreen politicsOil and gas companiesEnergy industryOilexplainersShareReuse this content"

This is usually followed by a group photo; something that the people in attendance can look back upon and cherish, knowing that for this one moment all competition fell away and they found joy in surrounding themselves with their gifted colleagues.At least that’s the idea. As anyone who has ever been in a group photo will attest, these things are an absolute mess. There are simply too many people to control, and the resulting image is generally a free-for-all of weird costumes, odd expressions and seemingly hostile body language. As such, let’s use this year’s Oscars class photo to hand out some awards of our own.Most recognisable: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande (front row, centre)Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande bring the joy.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyThis is less a category, more a shameful admission. The Oscars are the biggest night of the movie-industry calendar, and I make a living from writing about the movie industry, and yetI do not know who most of these people are. If this photo proves anything, it’s that the films you enjoy are often made by people so anonymous that you wouldn’t give them a second look if they tripped over a bag on a bus. So thank God for the stars ofWicked, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, for at least making an effort. Yes, it helps that they’re among the most famous people in the room. Yes, it helps that they’re sitting in the front row. Yes, it helps that they seem to have dressed expressly for the purpose of standing out in a group photo, and seem much happier to be there than anyone else. But mainly, it helps that I know who they are. Congratulations!Most keen to distance themselves from all this: Timothée Chalamet (third row from back, far left)How does it feel, to be on your own? … Timothée Chalamet.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyForget anything I said about this photo being a chummy opportunity for the participants to demonstrate that they are part of a wider community. Honestly, just look at the body language on Chalamet here. His face is a tight rictus grin of reluctance. He is leaning away from his neighbour with his entire torso, the way you would if a foul-smelling stranger plonked themselves next to you on a park bench. Most strangely, he seems to be raising a fist, as if he’s getting ready to punch his way out of the room. The poor boy seems to be having a nightmare.Least able to look at the camera: James Mangold (second row from back, far right)Watch the birdie … James Mangold.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyJames Mangold, your job is literally photographing people. You’ve become one of ourfinest film-makersbecause you are good at taking people and getting them to stand in the correct poses in front of a camera. And yet look at you. Everyone else is looking at the photographer, but not you. You’re staring at the guy in front of you, lost in a world of your own. Would it kill you to tilt your chin up a little bit? You have no choice but to make another good film this year so you can try to look at the camera properly when this picture is taken again a year from now.Oddest squish: Zoe Saldaña and Mikey Madison (front row, left of centre)Budge up a bit … Andrew Watt, Zoe Saldaña and Mikey Madison.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyOscars nominations 2025: the full listRead moreIt’s genuinely hard to say what’s going on here. Most of those in attendance get to sit in regular cinema seats, except for a few people at the front who are sitting on chairs that have been placed in the spots reserved for wheelchair users. Four people sit in four chairs placed on the right-hand side of the photo. Four chairs also appear to have been placed on the left-hand side, yet five people are sitting there. Indeed,Andrew Watt, Zoe Saldaña and Mikey Madison appear to be squeezed on to just two seats. Why is this? There are plenty of empty seats elsewhere in the auditorium. One of them could have gone to sit next to Chalamet. It might have even cheered him up a bit. My guess is that someone threw a gigantic fit about their allotted seat placement and crammed themselves into the front row, to the discomfort of those around them. The question is: who?Most visibly bored: Diane Warren (fourth row, sixth from right)Here we go again … Diane Warren.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/The AcademyAnother year for Diane Warren,another nominationfor a song in a film thatnobody has heard of.

This is the follow-up tohis debut Slow West, and as with that film it is shot by Robbie Ryan with music by Jed Kurzel (director Justin’s brother and collaborator). I have to admit, though, that this does not quite have the energy or the fluency of that previous film, perhaps not the same production resources either – and by comparison it is more strenuously contrived. Yet the pure strangeness of the movie commands attention and there is a charismatic lead performance by Japanese actor-musician Mitsuki Kimura, or Kôki.She plays a dancer called Tornado, who travels around what looks like utterly empty terrain with her impresario father Fujin (Takehiro Hira) in a covered wagon, putting on a samurai show. They perform with puppets, whose little lopped-off heads and limbs squirt out fake blood with tiny ingenious pumps; they also demonstrate samurai sword-twirling combat themselves. They appear to have once been part of a travelling circus encamped elsewhere. And who do they perform to? A crowd of people show up out of nowhere, having presumably walked many miles from the (unseen) villages where they live.Among this crowd is a sinister, motley gang of violent thieves led by Sugarman – a solidly uningratiating and menacing performance from Tim Roth – and his quasi-son (or perhaps actual son) Little Sugar (Jack Lowden), whom he bullies mercilessly. They are so diverted by Tornado’s show that a little kid steals two bags of stolen gold at their feet, and so they set out on a brutal expedition to reclaim their loot and punish the kid, which leads into a violent confrontation with Tornado whose samurai skills and martial arts moves are not just for show.It really is a weird drama, made the weirder for a timeline-shuffling effect at the beginning for an episode that takes us to the local manor house, whose laird is played by Alex Macqueen. Many scenes are played out to the accompaniment of high, sometimes almost gale-force winds. And the gang themselves do not travel by horseback: they simply walk everywhere, a disturbing itinerant caravan of bandits on foot who never need to eat or sleep or take shelter. In some ways, they are the evil version of the travelling players whom they are pitted against and the confrontation has the quality of a peculiar lucid dream. It’s a puzzle of a film in many ways, but it shows that Maclean has his own film-making language.Tornado screened at the Glasgow film festival and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsPeriod and historical filmsThrillersScotlandTim RothJack LowdenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Time for the law to close these loopholesMaarten van der HeijdenCynical actors exploit the legal ambiguities around targeting healthcare facilities, as seen in Gaza. Unequivocal protections are neededSupported byAbout this contentWed 26 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareHospitals in Gaza have “turned into battlegrounds”, the World Health Organization’s representative for the West Bank and Gazastatedat the UN security council in January. He warned that the healthcare system was being “systematically dismantled and driven to the brink of collapse”.Israel’s attacks on medical centres in Gaza have prompted widespread condemnation fromcivil society,academicsandnews agencies, manylabellingthese strikes as breaches of international law or war crimes. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesuspostedthat: “Any attack of healthcare facilities is a violation of international humanitarian law.”In an ideal world that assertion would hold true. But this is not the legal reality: international law does not in fact impose a blanket ban on attacks against hospitals or other medical facilities. TheGeneva conventionsleave a broad margin for hospitals to lose protection if they are used for acts considered “harmful to the enemy”.Although the Geneva conventions require that military strikes adhere to the principles ofproportionalityand implement every feasibleprecaution, in practice these obligations remain conspicuously vague. This leaves considerable room for interpretation and forgoes accountability. As a result, healthcare infrastructure remains perilously exposed in war. InGaza, attacks have been systematic, as they have been inUkraine,Yemen,MyanmarandSudan.To reverse the rise in attacks on healthcare systems international law must provide unequivocal protectionThose accused of bombing hospitals use this ambiguity with awell-wornplaybook:Option 1:Deny the allegationsorclaim ignorance, after all, no public investigation will scrutinise your targeting assessment or attack.Option 2:Insist the strike was a mistake, since intent is required to establish a war crime.Option 3:Claim the intended target was an object nearby, making the hospital anunfortunate case of collateral damage.Increasingly, states opt for Option 4: Accuse the opposite side of violating international law,alleging, oftenwithout sufficient evidence, that the hospital was being used as a command centre, weapons depot, or missile launch site.View image in fullscreenBeit Hanoun hospital in northern Gaza, demolished by the Israeli army, served more than 400,000 people and was the only medical facility in the area.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOverall, the legal framework provides a favourable position for everybody with a voice in the matter. Rogue states can hide from their responsibilities. Friendly states remain silent, benefiting from the ambiguity. And legal scholars can contemplate the complexities of the proportionality assessment for attacks for decades to come, with no effect. Healthcare workers and patients – injured, silenced, imprisoned, tortured and killed – seem not to be worth an honest discussion on the functioning of the law for their protection.One of the most highly regarded experts and advocates for humanitarian law, Prof Marco Sassòli,arguesthat the lack of an obligation for transparency regarding the targeting process makes the Geneva conventions a “playground for ‘lawfare’ through false accusations”. He calls for greater transparency in war, including post-conflict disclosure of targeting decisions, yet notes that parties are unlikely to release sensitive military information lightly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their impact is well documented too: a16-country studyby the ICRC concludes that explosive weapons are the leading cause of damage to health facilities. They are also responsible for the greatest number of casualties among staff and patients. In light of these sobering facts, additional protection is needed.To reverse the rise in attacks on healthcare facilities and workers international law must provide immediate, simple and unequivocal protection.One possibility would be to establish an absolute prohibition on attacks against healthcare facilities. Or, at the very least, to ban the use of aerial bombing and explosive weapons in and around them. This should be combined with a prohibition to use hospitals and surrounding areas for military purposes. Ideally, both should also be war crimes, without exception. Without such unequivocal protections, hospitals will remain theatres of war, and international law will continue to offer a script for impunity.Maarten van der Heijden is a global health lawyer and a researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Geneva Graduate InstituteExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDoctors in detentionGazaPalestinian territoriesHospitalsIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

Did the stock market agree? Hardly. Even afterhe ditched the climate goals, and vowed to pray solely at the altar of shareholder value, the shares fell by 1.4% on a day when the FTSE 100 index was up. The rotten share price, down by almost a quarter in the past two years, is a very long way from being “fundamentally reset”.The strategic U-turn itself, one can agree, is far-reaching. A company that until recently was still mouthing (just softly) former boss Bernard Looney’s old2020 refrainabout “reimagining energy for people and our planet” has relegated investment in low-carbon energy to 5% or less of the overall budget. Even that portion will need to be “underpinned by government support”, the finance director emphasised. And, having bought full control of solar developer Lightsource only last year, BP now wants to find a partner to share the capital load.Meanwhile, spending on oil and gas is being boosted by 20% versus previous targets. Looney’s old idea that fossil fuel production would fall to 1.5m barrels of oil a day by 2030 has been thrown out of the window. The new target is 2.3m to 2.5m barrels a day by the same date, with increases possible thereafter.The rejigged numbers enraged environmental campaigners, understandably so –BPsold them a pup in 2020. “Our optimism for a fast transition was misplaced and we went too far too fast,” argued Auchincloss, blaming Covid, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and governments’ waning appetite for decarbonisation for the abandonment of BP’s climate pledges.He’s correct that those factors lie behind the continued rise in global fossil fuel consumption, but BP’s point, back in 2020, was that it was going to cut production in all circumstances. An honest presentation (and Auchincloss, remember, was one of the architects as the finance director) would have admitted that the visionary green stuff depended on the share price vaguely keeping up with oilier rivals. It hasn’t, thus BP is being forced into the strategic U-turn that Shell performed, with less drama and without an activist investor on its tail, about two years ago.One big difference, though, is that BP is carrying proportionally more debt. That is why it is volunteering to sell lubricants business Castrol, a perfectly decent financial performer, and a share of Lightsource. The aim is to raise $20bn (£15.7bn) from disposals by 2027, which is probably the earliest the balance sheet could be considered to be reset.It all means that distributions to shareholders – the bit that the core investors care about – came out at an underwhelming level. Share buybacks, Big Oil’s main symbol of financial virility these days, will be no more than $1bn a quarter, down from $1.75bn at present. Meanwhile, even within the renewed focus on oil and gas, production levels will actually go roughly sideways from today’s levels, which may not excite those shareholders who want to see growth. The whole financial frame is also predicated on oil and gas prices remaining roughly where they are today, which is not a given.Financial recovery for BP, then, is still a way off. Auchincloss has served up most of the U-turns the City was demanding, but still needs at least two years to repair the balance sheet and perform more cost-cutting. A reset in the chair’s seat would help on the credibility front in the short term because Helge Lund, the incumbent, isequally tied to the broken green promises and the share price failure. The rest of it looks a long haul – still.Explore more on these topicsBPNils Pratley on financeCorporate governanceEnergy industryOilOil and gas companiesGasCommoditiescommentShareReuse this content"

His career was about to be over. The body of the socialist deputy and his bitter foe,Giacomo Matteotti, had been discovered in a shallow grave near Rome and mounting evidence pointed to Mussolini’s responsibility for his murder. With the king, the old liberal democratic elite, the left and many of his own party pressing for his dismissal, Mussolini declared that everything – the fascist violence, the immorality, the turmoil into which Italy had sunk – was his fault, “because I, I alone, created it”. By the same token, he alone was the man “capable of dominating the crisis”. Parliament, stunned, sat silent. There was no voice of protest. The dictatorship was saved.Based on the first volume in a trilogy of the same name by Antonio Scurati and garlanded with praise by Italian critics, the television dramaMussolini: Son of the Centurycovers just six years in Mussolini’s life, from his days as a brawling but highly effective journalist in Milan to his assumption of total power. Joe Wright, better known for his gentle approach and light touch in Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, has produced a series that is loud, provocative and violent. The music that accompanies it is throbbing, incessant and often intrusive, with occasional snatches of Verdi and Puccini. All is dark, deeply gloomy and sepia-coloured.The series is presented as a “biographical historical drama” – that is to say, with considerable licence to play about with the facts. It would be fair, however, to say that for the most part the narrative keeps close to the broad sweep of Mussolini’s rise. The gerarchi, the fascist leaders such as the flying ace Italo Balbo and the gross and vituperative Roberto Farinacci from Cremona, are portrayed in their greedy, strident, vulgar colours; and his mistress, the art criticMargherita Sarfatti, is rightly seen as a considerable influence on fascism’s emerging ideology. Rachele, Mussolini’s long-suffering wife, is relegated to the shadows, and Bianca Ceccato, mother of one of his illegitimate children, is made to stand for the many others he impregnated.But the details niggle. It is highly unlikely that Quinto Navarra, Mussolini’s valet, saw Matteotti’s bloodstained wallet in the drawer of his employer’s desk. The blackshirts never staged a vast, orderly rally along the Appian Way and Mussolini surely never flung himself backwards into the arms of his yelling, flame-throwing followers. Cesare Rossi, the regime’s press and propaganda man, is shown here as the Duce’s main confidant – when that role was in fact occupied by his brother, Arnaldo.View image in fullscreen‘Luca Marinelli gives a convincing performance as the narcissistic, bombastic, insecure Mussolini.’Photograph: Andrea Pirrello/Sky ItalyDoes this matter?Luca Marinelligives a convincing performance as the narcissistic, bombastic, insecure Mussolini who, when not addressing Rossi or a vast bust of himself in the Palazzo Venezia, speaks directly to the camera, to us, his audience. There are very few scenes in which he is not present, filmed a little from below, glowering over us, confiding his thoughts, his triumphs, his contempt for his companions. This is fascism as theatre, hectoring and loud. More important than the details, perhaps, is the lack of subtlety, the crude juxtaposition between the sanity represented by Matteotti and the noisy, inarticulate barbarity offered by the fascists.There are few moments of respite. This series is not for the faint-hearted. Many people were indeed bludgeoned, dosed with castor oil and killed by the fascists, but not on this vast, orgiastic scale. The March on Rome was, in fact, concluded not in widespread bloodshed, as the series suggests, but remarkably peacefully. In Milan, Turin and Parma, where opposition was expected, the fascists took control quietly and smoothly. Rome, on the day the king lost his nerve and offered Mussolini the prime ministership, has been described as being in a “fever of delight” and florists ran out of flowers.Some of the more interesting wider perspectives have been lost. Mussolini won friends abroad: by 1923, Sir Ronald Graham, British ambassador to Rome, was reporting to London that Mussolini was a “statesman of exceptional ability and expertise”. And you get little sense ofItalyitself in the early 1920s, a country that felt betrayed by the allies, but was full of clever, articulate people, such as the historian Gaetano Salvemini and the philosopher Benedetto Croce, highly intelligent anti-fascists who, like Matteotti, fought hard to save the country from the dictatorship.Italian neofascists display banner celebrating Mussolini’s march on RomeRead moreThe miniseries aired in Italy before the UK release, and has attracted a great number of viewers, many of them admiring. In contemporary Italy, Mussolini is never far away. At the end of the war, the allies planned to rid the country of all visible signs of the dictatorship. They discovered that Mussolini had successfully imprinted fascist ideology on to the landscape, stamping his mark on to houses, sports stadiums and entire towns.Predappio in Emilia-Romagna, where he grew up, remains a place of pilgrimage for Italians who descend on the anniversary of the March on Rome, to raise their arm in the fascist salute and buy replicas of the Duce’s various helmets and berets. On Lake Garda, where he had his last government, the villas in which he and his mistress Clara “Claretta” Petacci lived are now five-star hotels. The rooms that bear their names are booked out years in advance. Books about him, his family and the fascist leadership never stop appearing. Mussolinismo, as the cult is known in Italy, is not illegal. Not surprising, then, that whenGiorgia Meloni, a former member of the neofascist MSI, was made prime minister, there was much talk of Mussolini’s legacy.It would be hard to watch the series today without being conscious of the warning it contains. When Mussolini boasts that his plan is to “make Italy great again”, his words resonate.Caroline Moorehead is a writer and historian.

But businesses know multiculturalism is good for the economyWed 26 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 06.08 ESTShareFor people who believe that the world should be run by straight white men, these are heady times. Probably the most powerful social conservative on the planet occupies the White House again, and seems determined to drive“immoral” and “discriminatory”diversity policies out of American life.Two years ago, the US supreme court banned theuse of affirmative actionin university admissions. A growing list of American and British companies, from Ford to BT toGoldman Sachs, appear to be reducing their commitment to the once fashionable corporate principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Meanwhile,Reform UK promisesto “scrap DEI rules that have lowered standards and reduced economic productivity”. In politics, commerce and education, a huge, potentially lasting counterrevolution seems to be under way.“The death of DEI is finally here,” wrote the columnist Michael Deacon in the Telegraph last year, “and it’s a joy to behold … A radical progressive ideology that, in recent years, has held countless western institutions in its miserable grip … is finally loosening.”For many companies,promoting diversityhas only been a priority for a few years, since the surge of anti-racist activism set off around the world by Black Lives Matter in 2020. And in some ways the inclusive values of DEI and the winner-takes-all ethos of capitalism have always been an awkward fit. For all but the most ethical businesses, hiring and employing people in a more egalitarian way is less fundamental than maximising profits.In many supposedly diverse companies, progress towards a truly representative workforce, especially in senior positions, has been slow and far from complete. From rightwing and leftwing perspectives, it can be argued that diversity policies have just been a cynical experiment: yet another attempt to polish corporate capitalism’s increasingly tarnished public image. Now that the political climate has changed, the experiment is being unceremoniously abandoned.But is the situation really that clearcut? One of the key features of current rightwing populism is a desire to escape complicated social realities, and so it is with the revolt against diversity. Thanks to globalisation, immigration and trends in birthrates, Britain and the US, like most other rich countries, are much more multicultural than they were in the 1980s – the last time there was a big conservative pushback against diversity policies. Between 1980 and 2019, the minority ethnic proportion of the US populationdoubled to 40%. In England and Wales, the proportion of people who didn’t describe themselves as white Britishdoubled between 2001 and 2021alone: from one in eight to one in four. During these decades of flux, there were also profound shifts in how millions of Britons and Americans thought about feminism, gender, sexuality and disability.None of these socially embedded trends is likely to be completely reversed, however much rightwing populists rail against them. In a speech last week, Kemi Badenoch describeddiversity policies as “poison”, but the Conservatives have their ownequal opportunities policy, with her face on the document’s first page. It commits the party to being “a supportive and inclusive environment where … the diversity of people’s backgrounds and circumstances will be positively valued … [and] where the party will also continue to work towards its dedicated goal of encouraging and promoting equality and diversity”. It’s easy to see these commitments as insincere or hypocritical, but they are also a sign of how far DEI ideas have spread.Back in the 1980s, the last transatlantic campaign against diversity policies was led by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Her government caricatured Labour councils that helped minorities as “loony left”, and then took many of their powers away. Meanwhile, in the US, Ronald Reagan aimed to abolish the federal government’s affirmative action programme, which he saw as “bureaucratic” social engineering. He alsoreduced fundingfor the agency that enforced equal opportunities employment law, drastically reducing the number of cases it brought against companies.But his counterrevolution got no further. Strong opposition – hard to imagine now – came from relatively liberal senior figures in the Republican party. More relevant to today, further support for diversity policies came from big business. “When Reagan sought to tear down affirmative action,” wrote the American sociologist Frank Dobbin in his 2009 book, Inventing Equal Opportunity, “corporate America stood together to oppose the [president’s] idea.”Businesses argued that diverse workforces made the best use of the country’s range of talent and were more creative and productive, and more able to understand a broad spectrum of customers at home and abroad. Shrewdly, businesses also rebranded affirmative action in more neutral, less political language, as “human resources management”. Reagan’s attempt to abolish affirmative action was quietly abandoned.Let’s be clear – the US never had moral supremacy. With Trump, it’s not even pretending any more | Owen JonesRead moreMight today’s war on diversity fail in a similar way? The forces of white male supremacy have a more relentless rightwing media on their side than in Reagan and Thatcher’s day.Donald Trumpand other reactionary populists also seem less likely to compromise in culture wars than their more pragmatic conservative predecessors.Yet with multiculturalism now deeply entrenched, rooting out diversity policies will be harder than Trump’s confident executive orders suggest. Legal oppositionis building, and there are already signs that business is hiding its diversity programmes behind euphemisms again. On Tuesday, Apple shareholdersvoted againstending the company’s diversity programme. “DEI is beingrebranded – not disbanded,” complained the rightwing New York Post recently. It pointed out that some companies widely thought to have dropped DEI continued to promote it on their websites in slightly modified language. If diversity policies increase profits – and according to the president of the British Chambers of Commerce,Martha Lane Fox, “Businesses that embed diversity have 25% higher financial results” – then even the most determined anti-DEI campaign is unlikely to totally prevail.Moreover, what the reactionaries want is less clear and coherent than it first seems. Do they want to restore a society utterly dominated by straight white men, which is almost certainly impossible? Or do they accept the existence of a diverse society, as long as it isn’t actually shaped by diversity policies? On these questions, conservatives are divided.Even Trump sometimes acknowledges American diversity’s permanence and importance. In his inauguration speech,he boastedof his “increases in support from … young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans …” Social conservatives around the world may be feeling triumphant now, but their revolt against diversity has probably come too late.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He will try to persuade the US president that what is in Europe’s and Ukraine’s interest is also his best betTom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer, The BiographyWed 26 Feb 2025 09.22 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 12.47 ESTShareKeir Starmer is neither the kind of leader to light up Britain with a shining vision of the future, nor one of those populists who reheat supposedly glorious myths from a largely imaginary national past. On Tuesday, however, the prime minister proved there are few better than him at communicating the heavy weight of decisions that bear down on him – here and now – in the present world upheaval.Indeed, from the funerealmanner of his announcement, you might have been forgiven for thinking that he was saying something deeply unpopular. Yetpolls have suggestedfor some time that about two-thirds of the public – especially those parts of it Labour fears losing to Reform – want less taxpayers’ money spent helping the poorest in the world. More funding of Britain’s defence isusually backedby voters who also strongly support Ukraine in its fight for freedom. And, most importantly of all, it has been the key demand of a president threatening to withdraw US security from Europe and whom Starmer meets at the White House on Thursday.For all these reasons and more, there are plenty of politicians such as Nigel Farage or Kemi Badenoch who would have relished making deep cuts in foreign aid to increase military spending. But they clearly do not include Starmer, who on Tuesday repeatedly showed his discomfort and emphasised his unhappiness as he talked grimly about the decision being necessary to keep Britain safe.Partly this is because international development has become a sacred Labour principle in recent years, and the decision has stunned not only global aid agencies but also some parliamentary colleagues on front and backbenches. Nor is support infinitely elastic from asignificant proportionof voters already tempted by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens in seats that Labour won by small margins over the Conservatives last summer. They are horrified by Donald Trump and certainly do not want to see their prime minister doing the president’s bidding.The prime minister’s display of unhappiness on Tuesday wasn’t just about the awkward politics. On several occasions when I waswriting my biographyof him, Starmer told me proudly about his time in charge of the Crown Prosecution Service when it helped establish the rule of law and improve judicial systems in developing countries. He explained how such “soft power” was good for national security, too, because it stopped organised crime and terrorism at source before reaching the UK’s borders. If there is an ideological core to the prime minister, it revolves around the rule of law, human rights and a belief in strong international institutions, including the EU.I’m pretty sure he resisted efforts before the election to water down Labour’s commitments on aid because, as he said on Tuesday, he still believes in overseas development. And he certainly recognises the damage this decision will cause, not only to the people whom Britain helps around the world, but also to efforts by the foreign secretary, David Lammy, to re-engage with the global south, and Starmer’s own view of Britain’s place in the world.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy and Keir Starmer inspect Ukrainian-made drones in Kyiv, 16 January 2025.Photograph: Ukrinform/Rex/ShutterstockNor are decisions going to get easier any time soon. Cutting overseas aid will only take Britain’s defence spending to 2.5% of GDP and Starmer has set a target of reaching 3% in the next parliament, which probably necessitates even bigger cuts or tax rises elsewhere. But asLammy pointed outon Tuesday, at the height of the cold war, when the UK was still wrapped tight in the US security blanket, that figure fluctuated between about 4% and 7%. If Britain and Europe have to foot the entire bill for defence against a Russia emboldened by the retreat of the US, then Starmer can probably forget about achieving much of Labour’s domestic agenda – even if such questions remain relevant in the years to come.It’s why other ideas for defending Ukraine are now being urgently considered. Most of them would push Britain back into a closer relationship with Europe. One that’s already beenbacked by the Polish government– and is gaining momentum – is for a European rearmament bank. This might leverage £100bn or more in investment loans from initial funding of perhaps just £10bn by a dozen willing nations. Although Rachel Reeves is understood to recognise it’s “not a magic bullet”, the chancellor has been interested enough to ring round European finance ministers to test support for a plan in which the UK could participate without either EU membership or a significant increase in government borrowing.A more remote prospect is rebuilding and rearming Ukraine by using£200bn in Russian assetsfrozen by European banks after Vladimir Putin’s invasion three years ago. But there are concerns that confiscation of the money would, even if within the bounds of international law, deter China or Gulf nations from keeping their money in Europe and destabilise economies still further.Perhaps Ukraine’soutline dealwith the US on mineral extraction will give it the money and what Trump calls “the right to fight on”. But Starmer’s overarching priority on Thursday will be to get some sort of promise that the US will continue providing “backstop” support not only for Ukraine but also for a European “coalition of the willing” that would include Britain in committing troops on the ground to shore up any fragile truce.Although no one really knows exactly how the first formal meeting between president and prime minister will play out, not least because the former is so unpredictable, Starmer’s reluctance to engage in what he calls the “performative” or posturing side of politics may, for once, be an advantage. Doubtless there will be efforts to strengthen what’s been a perfectly friendly relationship so far. He won’t arm wrestle or interrupt as much as President Macron did on Monday. Instead, he will try to make a quiet, reasoned case that giving Putin everything he wants really won’t help “Make America Great Again”. The plan is to focus on outcomes and detail because Starmer knows there’s little to be gained, and much more to lose, from picking a fight or hectoring Trump for the sake of some easy headlines back home.Even so, it would be wrong to confuse his respectful and pragmatic approach with acquiescence – let alone support – for a new world order carved up on the basis of military strength rather than the values Starmer has held dear for his entire adult life. Anyone watching him sit down with Trump on Thursday will see a profound contrast in style. But there is, still, a big difference in substance. And that matters more than ever.Tom Baldwin is the author of Keir Starmer, The BiographyThis article was amended on 26 February 2025. The sum of Russian assets frozen by European banks is £200bn, not £200m as an earlier version stated.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Pistachios are also, it turns out, having a moment. We’ve been here before, with pomegranates and acai and, a few years ago,bone brothand anchovies. Now it’s the turn of the upmarket green peanut (oh look, I do have an opinion), which, once you start noticing it, you’ll find appears to be everywhere.It started last year with the rise of what is informally known as Dubai chocolate, the so-called confectionery invented by the British-Egyptian entrepreneur Sarah Hamouda, thattook over the world– and that became, according to Deliveroo, one of last year’s top items ordered worldwide. If you haven’t encountered it, the Can’t Get Knafeh Of It chocolate bar is a fancy slab of milk chocolate stuffed with a mixture of shredded filo, date syrup and pistachio cream, which tastes like a blocked artery and looks like wet tobacco. The original bar – the market is teeming with knock-offs – costs about £15.99, and if you can finish it in one sitting I raise my cholesterol to you.Starbucks, meanwhile, which has been flirting with pistachio flavouring for a few years now, has pushed itspistachio velvet latteand iced pistachio latte to the front of its UK menus. If you’re in the US, in Boston you can order apistachio martini, or a pistachio croissant from bakeries in downtown New York. Last year, Americans ate 225,000 tonnes of pistachios, making them the world’s biggest pistachio consumers, while in Britain, Marks & Spencer just launched the extra thick pistachio and milk chocolate egg, featuring “pistachio truffle”. At £20 a pop, this provoked the Mirror to report instances of British shoppers encountering the egg and becoming, as they put it, “startled”. High end nuts will do that.And I mean, it’s a solid snack. Right? For people who pay attention to these things, the fact that pistachios are lower in fat than peanuts will be very important, as is the fact that pistachios are tree nuts and peanuts are legumes. Pistachios are posh, I have no idea why – probably via some lingering association with their “exotic” provenance, which historically is the Middle East, not the west. No one says “pistachio” and thinks of Jimmy Carter. They’re not a bar nut. Americans might eat them by the sack-load, but the word “pistachio” derives from the Persian. And they’re expensive, roughly double the cost of a peanut because of the longer growing time and the more onerous harvest. No one is saying it’s a macadamia, but still: that’s a luxury nut.The nut of the future! 17 delicious ways with pistachios, from cakes to salads to cocktailsRead moreLike a lot of individual ingredients that go through a moment of wild popularity, there is a health rationale undergirding the pistachio stampede that is completely legitimate if you enjoy plain, unsalted pistachios and less relevant if you eat one submerged in three inches of lard and encased in a chocolate straitjacket. The pistachio martini, for example, is made from pistachio cream, vanilla vodka and chocolate liqueur, which sounds even less healthy to me than vermouth. Still, just saying the word “pistachio” evokes intimations of a life in a healthy and soothing pale green, backed up by echoes of words we know to be good for us, even if their meaning remains vague – “antioxidants”, “anti-inflammatories”, “potassium” and “Farrow & Ball” – and that make us feel better about life.Of course, people can’t help themselves and take things too far. I saw a recipe recently for “pistachio pesto” – nobody wants that. If my fish comes encrusted in pistachio instead of breadcrumbs I’ll be livid. And I don’t want the pistachio latte, obviously, an item made exclusively for adults who, when no one is looking, will happily tuck into a bowl of Oreo cereal or be tempted by the words pumpkin spice. I am eating these extremely plain nuts, no salt, no dry roast, no chocolate shell and no incentive – beyond the warm glow of knowing my arteries and I are precisely on trend.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If we cut that now, who will fill the vacuum?Halima Begum is the chief executive of Oxfam GBWed 26 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 06.02 ESTShareThe savagely deep cuts that Keir Starmer has announced to the international aid budget make a mockery of the pledge his party made to the British people in its manifesto. Then, it promised to restore development spending at the level of 0.7% of gross national income “as soon as fiscal circumstances allow”. On Tuesday the prime minister stood in front of parliament and announced that he willcut it from 0.5% to 0.3%of GDP. Inthe same manifesto, Labour made a commitment to “rebuild Britain’s reputation on international development with a new approach based on genuine respect and partnership with the global south”. This week, the government turned its back on it.Of course, I understand the argument that defence spending has to be increased, but cutting our aid budget still further when governments around the world are cutting theirs too will only increase division in our already deeply divided world. More than that, cutting aid amounts to a collective betrayal of the most vulnerable and dispossessed by western leaders.Too often, foreign aid is thought about through a colonial mindset – western saviours giving generously to the needy. The reality is that a great many people are now reaching out for help because of wars that the west has instigated, or a climate catastrophe rendered inevitable by our industries.Foreign aid – as wise Conservative and Labour leaders have understood in the past – has never been simply about global solidarity, but also cold national self-interest. As Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary in the last Conservative government,has said: “Far from giving money away, it is an investment … International development connects the dots between prosperity, security and migration across the world. It is a recognition that what happens over there, for good or ill, will repercuss over here.”Trump and Musk’s attack on USAid is causing global chaos. Millions of lives are now at risk | Devi SridharRead moreStarmer’s decision to cut back international aid closely follows – and is presumably inspired by – Donald Trump’ssimilar cuts to USAid, the US agency for international development.That agency was establishedin 1961 by Trump’s illustrious predecessor John F Kennedy, a realist who understood that a stable world – in which the rich did not spurn the most desperate, the planet was protected and nations pulled together on issues such as food standards and communicable diseases – was in the best interests of America and the west generally.Kennedy was a war hero –he won the Purple Heart– and a member of a generation that yearned for a more peaceful future. At the height of the cold war, he could see that if America didn’t advance its soft power through aid and socioeconomic development, then it would be the Soviet Union that would fill the vacuum. If the west abdicates its responsibilities now,it will leave a vacuumthat may well be filled by what America perceives as its current greatest threat: China. If China makes itself necessary to communities struggling to get back on their feet, it will make itself still more powerful, economically, as well as politically and ideologically.Theimmediate casualtiesof Trump’s decision will of course be those who had depended the most on USAid, one of the largest and most indispensable official aid agencies in the world. Those hardest and most immediately hit will be in places such as Sudan, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria and Gaza. It doesn’t take a vast amount of imagination to understand – given what life is now like in all these locations – that UK cuts to the tune of billions of pounds will result in still more lives lost.Populism makes our politicians focus on symptoms, rather than causes. The easy, visible targets, such as migrants making the Channel crossing, are easy to rail against, but they will only be stopped when the causes are addressed. Foreign aid addresses the causes directly by helping people to survive and even prosper in their own communities, by making inhabitable once again parts of the world that are now uninhabitable.Bending to populist pressure may seem the pragmatic thing to do, but real political leadership means standing firm in our commitment to global justice and demonstrating how Britain can be a global force for good in our world. The pressure on Starmer not to increase taxes still further is intense, but spending less on medicines and more on missiles is a short-termist solution and a false economy.Organisations such as Oxfam will do everything within our power to fill the gap in the UK and other nations’ international aid budgets, but we cannot do it alone.How right Kennedy waswhen he said that “in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal”. Governments around the world need to adjust quickly to new realities, but cutting foreign aid is not the answer.Dr Halima Begum is the chief executive of Oxfam GBExplore more on these topicsAidOpinionKeir StarmerUSAidcommentShareReuse this content"

British prime ministers have visited the White House before and in a wide variety of geopolitical contexts, but never has the hosting president been hostile to the transatlantic alliance. Never before could it be said that Washington’s foreign policy regarding European security wascloser to a Moscow linethan a London one.Conventional platitudes about a “special relationship” and common values are of little use to Sir Keir Starmer in handling Donald Trump. History is not irrelevant, but on matters of substance – most urgently, a settlement to end the war in Ukraine – Mr Trump is behaving more like a mafia boss than a statesman. His method is todemand tributein exchange for protection.Sir Keir’s challenge is to engage with the US president on his own terms, while cajoling him towards a more sophisticated understanding of events – one that includes the concept of an ongoing US interest in Nato and the security of European democracies. The prime minister’s pledge this week toraise UK defence spending, regrettably financed with an ill-judged transfer of resources from overseas development aid, is a key step in that tactical manoeuvre.Mr Trump’s scorn for Nato comes from the view, shared to some degree by previous US administrations, that Europeans use the alliance to freeload on the Pentagon’s resources. Advertising Britain as a nation that is stepping up to pay its way might buy some traction in the conversation about Ukraine’s future. Sir Keir will also want to reinforce the message, delivered to the White Houseearlier this weekby the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that Russia cannot be trusted to honour any deals that don’t include a significant deterrent against further aggression by Moscow.This has to be framed in terms of American strength and Mr Trump’s personal glory. The president must see his own interests clearly illuminated in viable alternatives to a dirty deal struck in haste with Vladimir Putin, over the head ofVolodymyr Zelenskyy, on terms that trade away Ukrainian sovereignty.Sir Keir should argue that American prestige and commercial opportunity will only be available if a deal is sustainable. That means, in the short to medium term at least, security guarantees forUkrainethat Europe alone is not yet equipped to provide. He must find the angle where UK national interests and Mr Trump’s personal vanity coincide.It is a grubby business. The US president often says things that are blatantly false. He is famously sensitive to contradiction. Sir Keir will not want to inflame the presidential temper, but he must also stand up for reality against wilful disinformation. He has rebutted Mr Trump’smisrepresentation of Mr Zelenskyyas a “dictator” and his denial of Russian responsibility for the war. That message is easier to deliver in statements from Downing Street than to the president’s face as a guest of the White House. It will require considerable tact.Sir Keir has to be realistic about the new and dangerous character of US foreign policy, but realism doesn’t equate to cynical accommodation with Mr Trump’s caprice. Alongside the ethical imperative, the UK has a strategic interest in facts forming the basis of international diplomacy. Speaking truth to a superpower gone rogue, in public and in private, is an indispensable part of the prime minister’s mission.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But for European progressives, there was also a third depressing takeaway: the comprehensive rejection of Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party, which recorded its worst postwar result.Across the continent, centre-left parties have beenexiledfrom the corridors of power, while the radical right has fuelled anxieties over immigration and economic stagnation to extend its influence. There is, however, one startlingoutlierto this dismal trend. Last year, Spainrecordedthe highest growth of any major country, at 3.2%. This was achieved under a Socialist-led coalition government that has welcomed high levels of immigration as a driver of economic prosperity, and which from this year plans toofferresidency and work permits to up to 900,000 undocumented migrants. In 2024, over 400,000 vacancies were filled by migrants and dual nationals, as overall unemployment figures fell to theirlowest levelsince the 2008 crash.The case for migration in a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the European Union – forcefully made by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez – has been complemented by a commitment to generous public spending that is also at odds with the zeitgeist. Boosted by EU post-pandemic recovery funds, levels of government expenditure reached anall-time highat the end of last year. Most of the money has gone on upgrading vital infrastructure and green investment, including urban low-emission zones and subsidies for small businesses.On the European stage, too, Spain is blazing a progressive trail. As crucial negotiations over future EU spending begin, Madrid hasproposeda doubling of the next seven-year budget, financed by joint borrowing mechanisms pioneered after Covid. In an era in which spending on defence risks diverting resources away from other public goods and the green transition, Mr Sánchez is right to argue that more Europe, not less, should be part of the solution.Panglossian hyperbole should be avoided. An important factor boosting Spain’s growth has been the booming tourist industry, which is creatingtensiin cities and resorts hollowed out by Airbnb. A related housing crisis urgently needs to be addressed. And interpreting to what extent impressive GDP figures translate into general wellbeing is far from straightforward.Nevertheless, at a time when much of the mainstream centre-left appears to have lost faith in progressive political solutions, the Sánchez government’s achievements deserve to be celebrated. A robustly social democratic approach to economic renewal, and a recognition of what migrants can offer ageing societies, remains the best response to the rise of nationalist, xenophobic politics.When unveiling his government’s plans to make it easier for migrants to settle last October, Mr Sánchezcommented: “Throughout history, migration has been one of the great drivers of the development of nations, while hatred and xenophobia have been – and continue to be – the greatest destroyer of nations. The key is in managing it well.”It has become vanishingly rare to hear political leaders not only making such an argument but also acting on it. This may be a moment of maximum hubris for the Trumpian right across the west. ButSpaincontinues to show that there is another way.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This was partly because the amount saved, £3bn-£4bn, was “chickenfeed” in the context of a budget deficit running at 20% of GDP, but mostly because it completely undermined “the idea of aid as global public investment for the common good”.Keir Starmer’s aid cut is even more cynical, as youreditorial(25 February) correctly identifies, because it is self-imposed without any economic logic to gain political traction in the Trumpian unilateralist world order. The moral bankruptcy of this approach was particularly evident in Elon Musk gleefullypostingon X that “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper”. Starmer’s “aid for arms” announcement may find favour in the White House, but it will destroy the Labour government’s reputation and undermine multilateral approaches to poverty eradication when they are needed most.Stephen McCloskeyDirector,Centre for Global Education, BelfastCutting the UK aid budget to 0.3% rolls back any progress made on development and humanitarian assistance, which makes it hard to understand why David Lammy, who says he is proud of our record on international development, would try and justify this (This is a hard choice. We believe in foreign aid – but we have to make cuts. We must keep the UK safe, 25 February).Instead of stepping up, the UK is turning its back on communities facing poverty and conflict. Make no mistake, cutting UK aid doesn’t make the UK safer. Investing in peace-building and tackling the causes of instability and poverty, alongside diplomacy and defence, does – and that is what UK aid did.This is not progressive realism, this is a kneejerk move that undermines the UK’s global commitments and weakens our own security interests.Romilly GreenhillCEO, Bond, thenetwork thatrepresents British aid organisationsTalk of “hard choices” obscures the reality of lives lost to poverty before a shot is fired. Millions of children, women and men die each year because they are too poor to stay alive. A disaster year in, year out, and for which UK aid fulfils our duty to assist and treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves.David Lammy says that to “stick within our fiscal rules, we have had to make the extremely difficult decision”. Difficult indeed for those who will die or have their growth stunted as a result. All to buy arms which, at best, will never be used and are eventually thrown away. As Eisenhower said: “This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.”A better decision would be to raise taxes, print money or change the fiscal rules, but apparently that would be too “difficult”.Michael McGuffieWellington, SomersetIt is misleading of David Lammy to claim that Harold Wilson took a far-sighted decision not to support US military involvement in the Vietnam war. Britain may not have openly sent troops, but it provided armaments and political support for over 10 years under successive prime ministers, from the earliest US involvement in 1961 until its ignominious withdrawal in the 1970s. This was concealed at the time, but isnow well known, and it is disturbing that Lammy should continue to peddle the myth of non-involvement to defend aid cuts.Peter CraigGlasgowIt is only a week since Patrick Wintour mentioned the idea of the EU issuing defence bonds (19 February). A week is a long time in politics. Perhaps now is the time for the government to issue overseas aid bonds? I would happily invest and suspect others would too. If it means the government has to change its fiscal rules, I really don’t mind.Dr Brian RamsdenMilton KeynesDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Isn’t he an example of the authoritarian personality (not to be confused with being authoritarian)?Rupert Wilkinson’s 1972 book The Broken Rebel explored the subject. Some of the characteristics of the authoritarian personality that he listed are submission to a strong, admired authority; aggressive hostility to people in authority whose traits he resents, often as a result of being dominated himself in childhood or to compensate for a sense of weakness; open hostility to outsiders and admiration for his own side; a desire to be strong, to hold power and assert it aggressively; detests ambiguity and uncertainty; craves simple solutions and obvious results.Mary WilkinsonLondonSo abject is Donald Trump’s surrender toVladimir Putinthat in this new counterintuitive world, Keir Starmer’s return from his trip to Washington this week must surely be accompanied by Trump’s vitriolic attack on him as a dictator with no mandate and a suppressor of free speech. Only then will we know that our prime minister has grown a backbone and challenged this abhorrent monstrosity that suffocates any moral order.Tom BrownGore End, HampshireAs a mediocre chess player, I was challenged to a game by someone much better than me. I beat him by making random, nonsensical moves, which turned out to be a brilliant tactic, because he panicked and became so confused that he conceded.

But a win for the European champions against theWorld Cup holders Spainto put them level on points with Portugal in their Nations League group lifts a pressure that perhaps shouldn’t be there.England 1-0 Spain: Women’s Nations League – liveRead moreThe England manager has repeatedly cautioned against expectations of a clean run of wins in the European Championship in Switzerland this summer. “The game has changed,” she has said, the introduction of the Nations League elevating the level of opposition the Lionesses meet on a regular basis.No game is easy anymore, it’s a cliché but it’s a fact. A 0-0 draw against Olympic champions USA, a 4-3 defeat by Germany (a wild anomaly of a game) and a1-1 draw against Portugalon Friday have pockmarked their record recently. Against Portugal, England thrilled in the first half and struggled in the second, a formation change and fresh personnel frustrating Wiegman’s charges and producing the leveller. How would England fare when swapping a team ranked 22 for the World Cup holders and No 2 team on the planet?It turns out, incredibly well. The opening 15 minutes were nervy for the home team but they weathered the red storm around them, holding their shape and composure against a team that can bamboozle the best players with their guile and possession-laden football. Salma Paralluelo posed a threat on the left and slithered into the box evading both Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson before Millie Bright powered the ball away.Less than five minutes later, the former Manchester United forward Lucía García capitalised from a corner to clip the ball off the underside of the bar. Had that gone in, the game could have been very different. Instead, the Lionesses grew into the game, Bronze and Lauren James particularly effective on either flank.This was a streetwise performance from the Chelsea duo and their England teammates, a display described later by both Bright and Williamson as “properly English”. Bronze’s grin after she had hustled and harassed the two-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí to put the ball out for a corner symbolic of that.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson leads from the front as England’s defence kept out the world champions.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIn the 23rd minute England registered their first real chance and James was the instigator, getting the better of Ona Batlle deep into England’s half before releasing Niamh Charles on the left. The full-back was taken down by the Spain captain, Irene Paredes, and James stung the hands of goalkeeper Cata Coll from the resulting free-kick.James got a chance on the other side soon after, latching on to Bright’s cross-field ball from deep before attempting to chip Coll from close range, but the keeper was ready.The home team were rewarded for their patience and persistence just after the half-hour. Grace Clinton found Alessia Russo, who spun and drove into the box, her holdup play exceptional, with the forward’s shot coming off the foot of Paredes and turned in by Jess Park via the leg of the World Cup final goalscorer Olga Carmona.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Much like the opening 15 minutes, Spain had chances early in the second half but England looked more settled and assured under pressure.There was a moment for pause and tactical tweaks in the 50th minute as the floodlights failed, allowing both sides to crowd round their respective dugouts. But after the lights out interlude, play resumed with the same intensity and Wiegman made a double attacking change past the hour, introducing Nikita Parris and Chloe Kelly to maintain the energy out wide as they sought to lift the tension a narrow margin ensures.Still, the indomitable James, who had looked quite out of sorts against Portugal, was England’s livewire, forcing a fingertip save from Coll at one end one minute and crowding out Paralluelo with Bright and Williamson the next.There was a late push for an equaliser but bodies were put on the line as England clung on to a morale-boosting victory. This is not the Spain of the World Cup, they are a different beast and have been through a lot on and off the pitch, but they still maintain a grit that was evident in their recent late comeback win against Belgium.They were out-gritted under the temperamental Wembley lights though, England making a statement before the European Championship with the most solid performance across 90 minutes since the summer.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Arne Slot’s relentless side stretched theirPremier Leaguelead to 13 points with 10 games to play courtesy of an assured victory over Newcastle. The strongest team in the league is improving while so-called title rivals falter, and Anfield knows what is coming.At 9.22pm news filtered through ofArsenal’s draw at Nottingham Forestin the earlier kick-off. The first chant of “Liverpool, top of the league” emerged from the Kop. Alexis Mac Allister soon added to Dominik Szoboszlai’s first-half goal with an emphatic finish of his own and the title-winning atmosphere cranked up. Anfield was denied the chance to roar home league championship No 19 due to the pandemic. The procession towards No 20 affords Liverpool supporters plenty of time to make amends. The run-in is turning into a lap of honour.Arne Slot claims Liverpool players have silenced doubters with ‘mental strength’Read moreNewcastle signalled the end of a demanding sequence of five games in 15 days for the Premier League leaders. It was portrayed as a defining period in the title race and so it has proved. Liverpool have emerged in a more commanding position than they started, the doubts that followed Everton, Wolves and Aston Villa convincingly dispelled. Eddie Howe must hope key players return from injury and confidence is not too badly affected when the two clubs meet again in the Carabao Cup final in 18 days’ time. The Newcastle manager praised a display that was vastly improved on the previousaway game at Manchester City, yet his team never laid a glove on their impending Wembley opponents.Slot sat at the back of the directors’ box having been handeda two-match touchline banfor improper conduct following the recent Merseyside derby. With his assistant, Sipke Hulshoff, also banned for two games for his behaviour at Goodison Park it fell to a former Everton player, John Heitinga, to direct Liverpool from the technical area. In keeping with Slot’s entire Anfield reign, it was a seamless transition.There was no let-up from aLiverpoolteam that enjoys a clear view from the Premier League summit. Their work rate and desire were again exemplary, confidence understandably high. Luis Díaz was a tireless presence who Tino Livramento struggled to contain.Mohamed Salah thought he should have had an early penalty when, attempting to reach Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cute pass inside Lewis Hall, the Newcastle left-back tumbled in front of him and sent the forward sprawling. Salah was aghast when penalised for a foul on Hall. Slot was not impressed by the referee Stuart Attwell’s decision either, judging by his reaction in the stands. Better to keep a distance sometimes.Slot was soon celebrating in the posh seats, however, when Szoboszlai steered home a polished finish for the second successive game. Díaz was the architect of the breakthrough, attacking Livramento and flicking the ball back to the unmarked Liverpool midfielder when approaching the byline. Szoboszlai’s shot lacked power but sailed between the legs of Sandro Tonali and flicked off Dan Burn to beat an unsighted Nick Pope down the centre of Newcastle’s goal. The Hungary captain has been under instruction to shoot more and has clearly taken Slot’s message on board. The goals atManchester City on Sundayand against Newcastle were reward for relentless shifts from the increasingly influential midfielder.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai unleashes the shot which flicks off Dan Burn (centre) to put Liverpool ahead.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PANewcastle’s task had become more complicated before kick-off, in fairness, when Alexander Isak joined Joelinton and Sven Botman on the sidelines with a groin injury. The loss of his leading striker forced Howe to hand Callum Wilson a first league start of the season and adjust to a 4-4-1-1, with Anthony Gordon playing off the recalled forward. Wilson’s lack of match sharpness showed when he was twice played through on Alisson’s goal and twice fluffed the finish. The first, from Gordon’s piercing pass, would have been ruled out for offside anyway but Wilson was onside when Burn’s long ball caught out Ibrahima Konaté. His shot sailed well wide of the Kop goal.There was more belief in Newcastle’s second-half display but Liverpool ensured there was no way back in devastating fashion. The leaders’ second goal was another demonstration of Mac Allister’s intelligence and Salah’s vision.The Argentina international seized on a loose pass by Sandro Tonali and drove at the visiting defence before finding Salah. Liverpool’s prolific marksman was crowded out yet, with his route to goal closed off, he worked space for a return pass to Mac Allister. The midfielder swept an emphatic first-time shot into the top corner of Pope’s goal and Salah had his 22nd assist of the season in all competitions. A sublime cross with the outside of Salah’s left foot almost produced another but Díaz poked wide at full stretch at the far post.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal, in second place but trailing Liverpool by 13 points, are resigned to Champions League qualification;Nottingham Forest, in contrast, are intoxicated by the prospect.Arsenal’s title challenge was limping anyway as their striking department fell into the treatment room in mid-winter but gaining one point from two gamesagainst West Hamand Forest over the past five days seems to have killed it off.Arteta admits Arsenal ‘lacked spark’ but face wait for Saka and Martinelli returnRead moreWith the second-string midfielder Mikel Merino again obliged to deputise up front, in the absence of the injured Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bakayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli,Arsenallacked the killer instinct as Forest returned to their resolute and robust role as the great underdogs in this challenge for a first return to Europe’s premier competition since 1980.This was the first goalless draw at the City Ground in thePremier Leaguesince 1998 but was greeted with huge roars by the home supporters.After uncharacteristically conceding at least two goals in five of their previous six games, includingfour in the first halfat Newcastle on Sunday, Forest defended for their lives once again, with Murillo outstanding. “The most important thing was to realise how we do things, how we play and our strengths. Today it was there,” Nuno Espírito Santo, their head coach, said.“We were compact and didn’t allow Arsenal too much. Arsenal had chances, of course, because they are a very good team. But at the same time, we were compact, solid and aggressive.”Arsenal thought they had broken through eight minutes from time when Martin Ødegaard was released inside the penalty area by Leandro Trossard and not once but twice had his efforts cleared from off or near the line. But the flag had gone up to indicate Trossard was offside. It typified Arsenal’s frustrating night.The early stages of the game all seemed to hinge around Riccardo Calafiori. The Italian left-back, who might not have started but for Myles Lewis-Skelly’s suspension for his red card against West Ham, was booked for an early foul on Callum Hudson-Odoi, leading to his substitution at half-time. Arsenal fans’ hearts were in their mouths when the winger, switched to the right flank for this game, then burst past the Italian, into the area and stumbled over after light contact. Andrew Madley deemed it no penalty; the video assistant referee agreed.Calafiori regularly roamed forward as in inverted left-back and, midway through the first half, bent a shot against the inside of the far post, Matz Sels catching the rebound.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But such a situation is not anathema to Forest, whose position in the top three of the table has relied so much on their counterattacking prowess.Arsenal’s prowess at corners promised to provide a breakthrough after the break. First Merino, Arsenal’s saviour in the East Midlands with the two goals that did for Leicester City 11 days earlier, found freedom at the back post to head Declan Rice’s delivery goalwards, Sels parrying superbly at point-blank range; then Kieran Tierney worried his way in at the near post to thud his effort just wide. Arsenal looked to be tightening the screw. “We generated more [chances from corners],” Arteta said. “It’s been so helpful, especially when we lost so much threat in the attacking options [injured players]. We couldn’t open [the game] up even with that and so we’re very disappointed.”Forest’s role as top-four interlopers was represented by their xG of 0.06 as the hour mark passed and Nuno called for Ryan Yates and Danilo to stiffen up the midfield. After three defeats in four, a point was a good one as the City Ground retained its ferocious hostility.Finally Chris Wood chiselled in down the inside-left channel and fired off a fine shot that David Raya had to save. Then William Saliba was obliged to pull out a superbly timed last-ditch tackle to deny Forest’s topscorer from breaking in on goal. After their FA Cup visit from Ipswich on Monday, Forest could confirm their position as the most unlikely favourites for a top-four finish if they can keep out Manchester City – also only one place away from them in the table but a million miles distant in resource and aspiration – here a week on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Their defeat by Afghanistan, following the loss against Australia last Saturday, made it a third consecutive tournament failure under Buttler’s leadership.England crash out of Champions Trophy after nail-biting defeat to AfghanistanRead moreAsked if he will now weigh up the role he inherited from Eoin Morgan in 2022 – one that began with initial silverware at the T20 World Cup that year – Buttler replied: “Yep. Obviously the results aren’t where they need to be. We need to consider all possibilities and get England cricket back to where it needs to be.“I’ve got to work out personally, am I part of the problem or am I part of the solution?I’m not going to make any emotional decisions right here, right now. The guys at the top – they’re in charge and they will have their own views as well.”Regarding the match, in which his side were bowled out for 317 with a ball to spare chasing 326 to win, their heads still spinning from Ibrahim Zadran’s remarkable 177, Buttler said: “We’re obviously gutted. We had our chances. It has been a familiar theme. A more firing and confident team would have got over the line.”Both Rob Key, England’s team director, and Richard Gould, the England and WalesCricketBoard chief executive, have been on the ground in Pakistan but are due to return to the UK on Thursday. Given the pair only recently made Brendon McCullum the all-format men’s head coach in a final attempt to help Buttler, any decision may well be out of the captain’s hands.“I know lots of people think being captain doesn’t sit well with me,” said Buttler, who has overseen 22 defeats from 34 ODIs since replacing Morgan. “But I really do enjoy it. Results are tough and weigh heavy at times. You want to be leading a winning team. We haven’t been that for a while now.

They were energetic and incisive, threatening to tear Tottenham apart. Erling Haaland was back after injury and his 20th goal of the Premier League season – and 28th overall – was scant reward for their dominance.City’s previous visit to this stadium in late October had brought their first defeat of the season –in the Carabao Cup– and it is remarkable to consider how they have fared since then. Before kick-off here and taking in that result, their record showed 14 losses in 27 games in all competitions. They looked set to make a more coherent statement.Maguire heads Manchester United past Ipswich despite Dorgu’s red cardRead moreThen the second half happened and we were reminded of why City have sunk so far. The conviction evaporated in the face of Spurs showing plenty of it themselves – aggression, too – and the equaliser looked on. Ange Postecoglou’s team were a different beast, pressing hard and they had the chances.The big one came at the very end and what a story it would have been if Pape Sarr, on as a Spurs substitute, could have adjusted his body to head home after Son Heung-min, who had also come off the bench, had flicked on a Pedro Porro cross. Sarr nodded over. There were 98 minutes on the clock, well over the additional four that had been signalled because of what happened immediately before – a lengthy VAR check on a Haaland effort that stood to make it 2-0. It was ruled out on the field for handball, too hastily according to Pep Guardiola.Haaland seemed to have gained an advantage with his upper arm to set himself after a touch from another substitute, Phil Foden. The VAR officials could find nothing conclusive to overturn the decision. And so Spurs went straight up to the other end for a moment of high drama. Sarr could not quite bring the house down.The Spurs support could tell everyone beforehand that they had always won against City in the league at their rebuilt stadium when they had wanted to win. Remember the weirdness aroundthis fixture last season– and the implications of them helping Arsenal to secure the title if they had not lost. Spurs, though, were poor in the first half.View image in fullscreenTottenham’s Pape Sarr (in white) heads over Ederson’s goal late on.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersCity were in the mood, bristling with attacking intent. Omar Marmoush, up alongside Haaland, caught the eye again while Jérémy Doku was electric on the left. Savinho was a danger on the other flank. All four were involved in the goal and it had been coming, Haaland having swiped at a chance moments earlier.Marmoush got City moving when he rolled away from Kevin Danso and Savinho found Haaland, who went left to Doku. Haaland made for the middle and when Doku crossed low, the ball deflected and fell for the City No 9. He was close in and never going to miss.Doku sent chills down spines in the South Stand when he ran with the ball. He worked Guglielmo Vicario with one effort, while he teed up Savinho for a glorious opportunity; the finish was high and wasteful. There was also the moment on the half-hour when Doku set up Haaland, who shot too close to Vicario.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is virtually a tradition when their team are behind. They had seen precious little, save for a looping Danso header that Ederson tipped over. From the corner, James Maddison played it short and loose, allowing Doku to intercept and City to break. Spurs were lucky that Matheus Nunes overhit the final pass.O’Brien dives to Everton’s rescue and extends Moyes bounce at BrentfordRead moreCity should have been home and dry but, when the tide turned, it was easy to feel we had seen this movie before. Spurs were better with the ball in the second half, they played with pace and slickness. They looked more like the best version of themselves. Maddison was booked for a horrible tactical foul; he practically rugby-tackled Savinho to stop the break. But the midfielder was otherwise instrumental while Postecoglou’s introduction of Sarr, Son, Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson in one fell swoop made a difference. It was a show of strength; a clear sign that his injury crisis has eased.Wilson Odobert could not stretch enough to convert a Porro cross and Spurs had other openings. The transformation was stark. City wobbled. Destiny Udogie was close to setting up Mathys Tel. Sarr could not finish after a surge by Spence. Son extended Ederson from a Johnson cross. And then, at the very end, we had Sarr again. Guardiola could smile this time. Did he feel that the old City had returned in the first half? “Never will this season be the old City,” he replied. “The old City was too good.

In a tumultuous time of further redundanciesand free lunches endedfor many remaining staff, the head coach’s declaration that United’s players are in the “bubble” of trying to turn fortunes around was borne out on a night that began in incessant rain and ended with a precious win.Amorim will talk to Garnacho about angry reaction to early substitutionRead moreAmorim talks about “surviving” this season; the Portuguese needs to do so. But a best asset was on show here: a doughty spirit which, even when his side goes a player down, finds a way.Less than four minutes were needed for United – actually Dorgu – to shoot themselves in the proverbial. Amorim spoke of sticking to the gameplan and nothing in that has United’s new arrival knocking the ball past the on-rushing goalkeeper André Onana to allow Jaden Philogene to tap home. The calamity derived from Dara O’Shea’s hoof upfield and the left wing‑back aimed recriminations at his goalkeeper. But this was his fault.Ipswich, with a solitary point in 2025, were cock-a-hoop, United dismayed, Amorim in shoulder-slump mode. A reply came via Harry Maguire’s header, from Bruno Fernandes’s corner, which Alex Palmer flew left to claw out. The next time United’s captain stroked in a dead ball, he fashioned the equaliser.A 22nd-minute free-kick was arrowed over from the left, up went a melee of home and Ipswich players and at close range the hapless Sam Morsy headed into his own net.Set piece No 3 from Fernandes had United taking the lead. Once more a corner was flighted over from the left and once more Maguire rose to head. The ball careered about, Palmer saved Diogo Dalot’s shot and Matthijs de Ligt smashed into the roof of the net.View image in fullscreenPatrick Dorgu walks off in despair after his tackle on Omari Hutchinson was deemed a red card by referee Darren England after consulting the pitchside monitor.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PATwo goals in four minutes reversed emotions for the home faithful and gave United what they lack: a swagger that featured Leny Yoro, Dorgu, Fernandes and Garnacho punching the ball about, and Joshua Zirkzee drawing a Morsy booking for an ankle clip.For a passage United enjoyed control, a rarity for this Amorim side, and Dorgu’s fierce effort almost earned redemption for the Dane but Palmer beat it away. Then, Dorgu’s night became a certifiable shocker as he was sent off, Darren England raising the red card after viewing the monitor. The referee’s decision was fair: when the ball was played for Omari Hutchinson, Dorgu’s right foot missed it, and administered a heavy blow to the player’s left shin. After treatment, Hutchinson continued but the challenge was clearly dangerous play.On came Noussair Mazraoui, with Garnacho sacrificed, the latter heading straight for the tunnel to the disquiet of Amorim. “I’m going to talk obviously with Garnacho about that,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again, Philogene was the scorer and Onana definitely the villain this time. Philogene swept in a hopeful diagonal from the right, United’s goalkeeper hesitated, De Ligt and Liam Delap did not touch the ball, and in it bounced.Amorim’s anger was transformed to a rosier emotion when Maguire’s forehead gave United the lead again, the defender beating Palmer at yet another Fernandes corner, this from the right just after half-time.The former captain was delighted and the question was simple: how long could his team protect their advantage? They might have stretched it at a clever free-kick dinked along the sideline but Rasmus Højlund chose to pivot rather than cross and he slipped and was dispossessed.Once more United’s No 9 fed off scraps. Amorim recognises this and how it causes the Dane to lose his cool. An illustration came in the pass he spiralled beyond Zirkzee and straight out, but at least this was a second touch in as many minutes. A third touch should have come when Yoro performed a quasi-Cruyff turn along the left and rolled the ball over but instead of taking aim Højlund dummied and Ipswich escaped.Casemiro replaced Højlund as Amorim valiantly defended what the 10 men fought for: a first league win in four games. And Mazraoui’s shove of Delap after the latter’s disagreement with Manuel Ugarte was a welcome further sign of togetherness.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

David Moyes’s resurgent side secured a third draw in four games and extended their unbeaten run in the league to seven, despite their recently red-hot Portuguese striker’s failure to find a way past Mark Flekken with any of three superb chances.Instead it was Jake O’Brien – the 23-year-old whose promotion by Moyes to the first-team coincided with the start of their current run – who rescued a point with his first goal for the club after Yoane Wissa had putBrentfordahead in the first half. With Ipswich losing at Old Trafford, Everton, who were a single point above the relegation places when Moyes was appointed last month, now stand 15 clear with relegation worries a distant memory.Blunted Arsenal grind to a halt in grating stalemate at Nottingham ForestRead moreSo, too, is Brentford’s last home win, and this result means at least three months will have elapsed between their last victory here and their next. In truth that is a reflection of the quality of their opponents and a bit of bad luck rather than anything more concerning, and Thomas Frank was probably correct in asserting that “we’d be out of sight, we win” if only Keane Lewis-Potter had scored when picked out by Mikkel Damsgaard’s excellent reverse pass in the 70th minute. Wissa turned the ball in when it broke to him off Jordan Pickford but he was three yards offside.Frank insisted that this was “probably a fair result” and that “in the second half we controlled them, they had nothing”; Moyes said his side “were terrific in the second half” and “we’re very disappointed not to take all three points”. With proper finishing they would have done so.Ethan Pinnock’s slip allowed Beto to run clear on goal in the 39th minute, but in attempting to lift the ball past Flekken the forward succeeded only in chipping it into the goalkeeper’s arms.Three minutes later Carlos Alcaraz’s headed through-ball sent the forward, author of five goals in his previous five games, sprinting clear again, but this time his shot deflected wide off the keeper. Then in the 88th minute Pinnock went to ground again in an attempt to cut out a through-ball but succeeded only in diverting it a little wider than Beto would have liked, and again Flekken saved.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Yoane Wissa jumps in the mix to head in the opener.Photograph: Tony O Brien/Reuters“I know it sounds crazy when he got three one‑on-ones but we actually controlled him in open play,” Frank said.Brentford had started the game brightly before losing steam towards the end of the first half, at which point they took the lead. It was a goal that would have infuriated anyone who shares Moyes’ enthusiasm for effort and organisation: Schade’s long throw from the right was allowed to bounce in the area, Mbeumo was unimpeded as he headed it against the bar, and even then there were three defenders better placed to reach the rebound than Wissa, who sprinted past them all to crash it into the net from barely a yard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hamilton has always been a star but, entering his 19th Formula One season with a new start at Ferrari, he is now burning even brighter.In the chill wind of an ­unseasonably cold Bahrain for pre-season testing, Hamilton is a man anew as he takes on a challenge with theScuderia, reinvigorated as perhaps he has not been since last he struck out on his own course whenleaving McLaren for Mercedes in 2013.Christian Horner unhappy that Max Verstappen was booed at F1 curtain-raiserRead moreHe was the centre of attention from the moment he emerged from ­Ferrari’s hospitality area before climbing into the new SF25 in front of the horde of photographers who had gathered early, encamped outside his garage. Hamilton looked relaxed and at ease, with his new helmet, in the bright Modena yellow ofFerrari, setting off the distinctive overalls in the team’srosso corsa.Indeed, so at home has Hamilton made himself and so familiar he already looks interacting with his ­Ferrari teammates in Bahrain it seems hard to imagine that for so long he has been clad in Mercedes silver. It illustrates how quickly the world ofFormula Oneturns and how adept Hamilton is at assimilating and accommodating change.Previously there was at least some continuity, but this is the first time in his career that he has not driven with a Mercedes engine and that too was part of the learning process as he pounded round the Sakhir circuit, coming to terms with how the new horses hum.Hamilton, who usually dislikes testing, displayed no such lack of enthusiasm here. He has long not wanted to go out on the first run but was front and centre for the opening session. Just as well, as the second stint was halted for an hour and five minutes because of a power ­outage at the circuit and subsequently extended, with the times topped by McLaren’s Lando Norris.With it being the first serious run of the season, for much of the opening session the teams are assessing initial data from the car, not least in whether real life is living up to the computer and wind‑tunnel simulations. To that end, Hamilton and the majority of teams ran with the aero rake device early on, the ungainly collection of metal spars which sits, like an angry expressionist Meccano kit, behind the front wheels to assess the airflow.Once it was removed, however, the Ferrari cut quite a dash against the bland backdrop in Bahrain. The car sports a white streak across the engine cover which may irk the ­purists but it has elegant lines and from trackside it looked quick, even in these tentative steps.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton puts his new SF25 Ferrari through its paces on the circuit in Bahrain.Photograph: David Davies/PAHamilton duly nailed down 70 trouble-free laps and was fifth ­fastest in a session headed by the driver who replaced him at Mercedes, the rookie Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, although timings at this stage are all but meaningless. There was a minor run wide toward the end at turn four, likely coming as the seven-time champion began to push his new ride and get a feel for where its limits lie.Cautious optimism was his mood afterwards. “Everything feels good,” he said. “There’s more to do over the next few days to get through our programme and understand the car to the best of our ability, but right now I’m looking forward to getting out there again tomorrow.”These are then still early days at Ferrari but alongside the serious faces of mechanics and engineers who have to pack an awful lot of work into three short days, there is also a palpable sense of optimistic zeal around theScuderia. Hamilton referred to it as a “magic” possessed by the team but it is impossible that they too have not been inspired by the ardour of the seven-time champion.He has spoken repeatedly of how motivated he is, not least by the dual challenge of a new team and a steely eyed determination to win the ­championship with them. It is ­notable that he is framing it not as securing his record-breaking eighth title but rather as one of taking ­Ferrari’s first drivers’ ­championship since 2007. It is significant that ­Hamilton has the team goal as a ­central target and this will not have gone unnoticed at Ferrari.Intriguingly, Hamilton’s car too had caught the eye, not least of the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, whose cars have dominated the sport since the regulation changes of 2022. “Into this cycle of regulations it’s clear the cars have converged and they look very, very similar,” he said. “Ferrari is the standout as probably being a differentiator.”It is still too early to tell whether ploughing a singular furrow will pay off but they do already have ­Hamilton, who has proved to be an effective differentiator himself and who is now champing at the bit to be given the tools to get the job done. Two more days of putting in the laps in the desert then and he at least will have a good idea if Ferrari have risen to match the boundless verve with which he has embraced his new task.Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The climate crisis is weakening the complex system, but determining if and when it will collapse is difficult.Studies based on ocean measurements indicate that the Amoc is becoming unstable and approaching a tipping point, beyond which a collapse will be unstoppable. They have suggested thiswould happen this century, but there are only 20 years of direct measurements and data inferred from earlier times bring large uncertainties.Climate models have indicated that a collapse is not likely before 2100, but they might have been unrealistically stable compared with the actual ocean system.The latest study is important because it uses climate models to reveal the reason that the Amoc is more stable: winds in the Southern Ocean continuing to draw water up to the surface and drive the whole system. The study does not rule out an Amoc collapse after 2100, and other modelling research suggestscollapses will occur after that time.“We found that the Amoc is very likely to weaken under global warming, but it’s unlikely to collapse this century,” said Dr Jonathan Baker at the UK’s Met Office, who led the latest study. He said it was reassuring that an abrupt Amoc crash was improbable, and that the knowledge could help governments plan better for future climate impacts. Amoc weakening would still bring major climate challenges across the globe however, with more floods and droughts and faster sea level rise, he added.“Of course, unlikely doesn’t mean impossible,” he said. “There’s still a chance that Amoc could collapse [this century], so we still need to cut greenhouse gas emissions urgently. And even a collapse in the next century would cause devastating impacts for climate and society.”Prof Niklas Boers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany said the study delivered a substantial improvement in the understanding of Amoc. “But even a weakening that is not due to a tipping point could have similarly severe impacts on, for example, tropical rains,” he said. “One could even go as far as saying that, in the short term, it doesn’t really matter if we have a strong weakening, say 80%, or a collapse.”The Amoc system brings warm, salty water northwards towards the Arctic where it cools, sinks, and flows back southwards. Global heating, however, is pushing water temperatures up and increasing themelting of the huge Greenland ice cap, which is flooding the area with fresh water. Both factors mean the water is less dense, reducing sinkage and slowing the currents.The Amoc was already known to be at itsweakest in 1,600 yearsas a result of global heating, and researchers spottedwarning signs of a tipping pointin 2021. The Amoc has collapsed in the Earth’s past, Baker said. “So it’s a real risk.”A collapse of Amoc would have disastrous consequences around the world, severely disrupting the rains that billions of people depend on for food in India, South America and West Africa. It would increase the ferocity of storms and send temperatures plunging in Europe, while pushing up sea levels on the eastern coast of North America and further endangering the Amazon rainforest and Antarctic ice sheets. Scientists have previously said a collapse must beavoided at all costs.The latest study,published in the journal Nature, used 34 state-of-the-art climate models to assess the Amoc. The researchers used extreme conditions – a quadrupling of carbon dioxide levels or a huge influx of meltwater into the North Atlantic – so that the changes in the modelled ocean currents were clear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This was because winds in the Southern Ocean continued to draw water up to the surface. Balancing this, to the scientists’ surprise, were new downwelling areas in the Pacific and Indian oceans, but they were not strong enough to wholly compensate for the slowing of the Amoc, leaving it significantly weakened.“Even just a 50% reduction in strength would result in a large drop in heat transport that would alter regional and global climates,” said Dr Aixue Hu at the Global Climate Dynamics Laboratory in Colorado, US. “There is therefore no reason to be complacent about Amoc weakening, and every effort must still be made to combat the global warming that drives it.”Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, an Amoc expert at PIK, said the latest study considered a collapse to be the total cessation of the currents in the North Atlantic, while previous studies have termed a greatly weakened Amoc a collapse.Amoc is partly driven by the sinking of dense water and partly by winds, and the latest study provides particular insights on the latter. “It does not, however, change the assessment of the risk and impact of future Amoc changes in response to human-caused global warming, as that is linked to the [density-driven] part of Amoc,” Rahmstorf said. His own research onpost-2100 Amoc collapse, currently under review, concludes “a collapse cannot be considered a low-probability event any more”.Despite the revelations in the latest study, the extent of future Amoc weakening and the timing of any collapse remain uncertain. “There’s a huge amount of work left to do, because there’s still a huge range across models in how much Amoc will weaken,” Baker said, with increasing the resolution of models one important requirement.“We also show that the Southern Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are more important than we thought for Amoc, so we need better observations and modelling in those regions. That’s crucial to improving the projections so we can better inform policymakers,” he said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOceansnewsShareReuse this content"

But criticism of the rules has grown, against a backdrop ofsoaring energy pricesafter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and intensifying competition fromheavily subsidised Chinese companies.Now the clean industrial deal reaffirms the EU goal of cutting emissions by 90% by 2040, and unveils 40 different measures to speed up the green transition, including faster permits for windfarms and other infrastructure, and changing public procurement rules to favour clean tech made in Europe.“We think that the clean industrial deal is Europe’s business plan to tackle the climate crisis,” said Teresa Ribera, the European Commission executive vice-president in charge of the green transition. Ribera, the most senior socialist in a centre-right-leaning commission, rejected criticism that the EU was reversing course. “We are not deregulating,” she said. “On the contrary: we are coming to the implementing phase.”The commission said it would create a new industrial decarbonisation bank with €100bn (£83bn) in new and repurposed public funds, which it said could indirectly leverage €400bn from the private sector.It outlined a bigger role for the European Investment Bank, including in the provision of guarantees to grid component manufacturers, allowing them to increase production. Experts say hundreds of billions in global investment is needed to buildvast networks of electricity grids to hit climate goals.Ribera, who also leads on competition policy, promisedchanges to the EU’s state aid rules by Juneto accelerate renewable energy and industrial decarbonisation.But the Climate Action Network Europe said there was “no concrete plan to mobilise genuine additional finance” and “little to turn ambition into action”.The new European Commission, which took office in December with ared-tape-cutting agenda, simultaneously published details on relaxing environmental reporting and due diligence rules for small companies, a far-reaching rethink of laws only agreed in 2023 and 2024.The commissioners presenting the proposals argued they were not weakening Europe’s green transition, but encouraging businesses to join in the transition and adjusting to a new geopolitical reality.“Europe knows how to reform itself,” said Stéphane Séjourné, the commissioner in charge of industrial strategy. “We don’t have a chainsaw,” he added, referring to the power tool that the Argentine president, Javier Milei,recently gave Elon Musk as a symbol of slashing red tape. “But we have competent people leading the charge.”The commission suggested a two-year freeze of its corporate sustainability reporting directive, which entered into force in 2023, while it pursues detailed consultations on exempting small businesses. Similarly, officials said the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, which requires companies with more than 1,000 employees to assess the environmental and human rights impacts of their products, would be delayed by one year, while the commission tries to lighten the load on smaller companies. While SMEs are already exempt from the directive’s requirements, many say they will be caught in burdensome rules because they supply larger companies.While business groups broadly welcomed the plans, the European Sustainable Investment Forum said the move created “legal uncertainty” and harmed those who had already prepared reports or taken steps to comply.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Environment campaigners welcomed initiatives to reduce bills and hasten electrification, but expressed alarm at a proposal to fund the building of liquefied natural gas export facilities abroad.The Greenpeace EU climate campaigner Lorelei Limousin said the proposal neglected other measures that could bring fossil fuel imports down rapidly, such as cutting energy waste. “This commission is vague on cutting energy waste while, to appease Trump, wants to invest in polluting gas infrastructure overseas that will keep Europe hooked on this expensive and dangerous fuel for decades.”The director general of BusinessEurope, Markus Beyrer, said he was encouraged that the commission had listened to industry, but called for swifter action, saying it was unlikely the measures would be enough to lower short-term energy costs.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionGreen politicsEuropean CommissionGreenhouse gas emissionsSteel industryConstruction industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is an area well-known for its small-scale agriculture, forestry and tourism.In recent weeks, however, the region, which spans the provinces of Rio Negro and Chubut, has been in the news for its large-scale wildfires – and the authorities’ crackdown on the local population.Since January, more than 35,000 hectares (86,500 acres) of forest, farmland and pine plantations have burned. In recent days,several new fireshave broken out on the eastern slopes of the Andes.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from the mountains near El Bolsón, in the Patagonian province of Río Negro, Argentina, on 4 February.Photograph: Gonzalo Keogan/AFP/Getty Images“The fire has been incredibly violent,” says Maicoñio, 52, aMapuchesinger and actor from Chubut. “More than 200 families lost their houses. We also lost orchards, vegetable gardens, animals, vehicles, workshops and cultural and educational spaces.”Hundreds of residents have been evacuated. The southern hemisphere summer (between December and February) is the dry season in Argentina and Chile,favouring forest fires. Intense, arid winds from the Andes and temperatures above the normal range have worsened the situation.In 2021, under similar conditions of drought, high winds and temperatures, the regionexperienced wildfiresthatleft three people dead, 500 homes destroyed and 14,000 hectares of forest burnt.But authorities in both provinces have stressed the criminal intent behind the fires, downplaying other factors such as the impact of increasing tourism, pine plantations or inadequate maintenance of the electricity infrastructure.While climate scientists believe rising temperatures increase the risk of wildfires, Argentina’s president Javier Milei has called the climate crisis a “socialist lie.” Accordingly, his government is imposing budget cuts on its environmental agencies. In 2024, the National Fire Management System budget alone wascut by 81%.View image in fullscreenA house destroyed by wildfires in the mountains of Mallín Ahogado near El Bolsón, on 9 February.Photograph: Martin Levicoy/AFP/Getty ImagesMilei, who is facing hisdeepest political crisisyet amid allegations that he promoted acryptocurrency market manipulation scheme, has dramatically transformed Argentina’s environmental policies during his first year in office.‘Making Argentina great again’? What a year under a climate-change denying president has done for the countryRead moreEnvironmental groups and community leaders havechallenged his government’s decisions, often becomingtargets of violence or surveillanceas a result.In response to the wildfires, the response has been violent. Even before the outbreaks were under control, authorities identified guilty parties and made arrests.Early on 11 February, simultaneous raids were launched against Mapuche communities and households across Chubut. Search warrants listed molotov cocktails, accelerants and communications equipment. The raids resulted in one person,Victoria Núñez Fernández, being taken into custody and charged with an unrelated arson.View image in fullscreenPolice evict the Mapuche community Lof Paillako, in the Los Alerces national park in Chubut in January.Photograph: Nicolas PalaciosIn Pillán Mahuiza, 250km south of the fires, helicopters and snipers accompanied security forces to raids. At a press conference the following day, flanked by armed and masked special forces, Chubut’s minister of security and justice, Héctor Iturrioz, said they hadprepared foran “armed confrontation” and “lethal traps”.Mauro Millán, a prominent Mapuche organiser and community member, calls the statement absurd, saying it “recalls the Vietnam war”, not the area’s rural communities.View image in fullscreenMauro Millán (right), from the Pillán Mahuiza community, with his sister Moira Millán (middle) and Angel Quilaqueo (left) of the Nahuelpan community during a press conference on 17 February.Photograph: Nicolas PalaciosHe says that the “ongoing persecution” of the communities has created a climate of fear as further threats of evictions have been announced. “Not only are the forests going up in flames, so is the rule of law,” he says.Mauro’s sister Moira, a leading Mapuche activist in Argentina, says the tactics used, including the confiscation of books, “recall the military dictatorship” – a reference tothe brutal regimethat lasted from 1976 to 1983.Also raided was one of the few Indigenous radio stations in the country, Radio Petü Mogeleiñ. The journalist Aymará Bares says “the police did serious damage” during the raid. With their equipment now broken or confiscated, “we aren’t able to broadcast, which is a serious violation of the rights of Indigenous peoples”.The prosecutor’s office in El Bolsón declined to comment on the investigation “in order not to prejudice the case”, while the prosecutor’s office in Chubut referred to its website for further information. It acknowledged verifying evidence suggesting Núñez Fernández was not at the crime scene, but argued against her release, citing “flight risk” and “obstruction of the judicial process”.View image in fullscreenThe Petü Mogeleiñ Mapuche community radio station was raided by police, with equipment broken and confiscated.Photograph: Hernan VitenbergTerritorial conflicts have increased in the region as the state prioritises sectors such as mining, tourism and plantations. El Bolsón is the first municipality in Rio Negro to sign up to Milei’sIncentive Regime for Large Investments, a sweeping law that provides tax, legal and other incentives to multinational corporations for large projects in sectors such as mining, hydrocarbons, energy, forestry and tourism.Activists have raised concerns about the federal government’s decades-long subsidisation of planting exotic species in or near forests. In Chubut,more than 95%of its 35,000 hectares of plantations is pine, which is much more flammable than native species.In addition to being invasive, pine thrives after fires, which creates a vicious cycle in which fires produce more hectares of flammable forest.They also deplete water tablesand are threatening several rivers’ headwaters, including the Rio Chubut.View image in fullscreenBurned trees in the mountains of Mallín Ahogado near El Bolsón, on 9 February.Photograph: Martin Levicoy/AFP/Getty ImagesHere, as in Chile, pine plantations have been the site of conflicts between Mapuche communities and private entrepreneurs. In 2021, the activist Elías Garay wasshot deadin the Quemquemtreu community on territory in dispute with a private individual who had claimed the land for a pine plantation.Although the region faces numerous land conflicts, violence is most pronouncedwhere Indigenous communities are concerned. Some have been in the public eye for decades, such as those resulting from the frictions between Mapuche communities and Argentina’s largest private landholder, theCompañía de Tierras Sud Argentina. The company, a subsidiary of Benetton, was originally British and was established shortly after theconquest of Patagonia.Other conflicts are the result of more recent developments, such as theCalcatreu goldmine project, owned by the CanadianPatagonia Gold.Compañía de Tierras SudArgentina, Benetton and Patagonia Gold were approached for comment.Sonia Ivanoff, a lawyer who has represented Indigenous communities in Chubut for decades, says the conflicts stem from the “state’s failure to grapple with the colonial legacy of territorial dispossession”, which translates into a failure to grant community land titles.View image in fullscreenThe Lof Cañio community near El Maitén.Photograph: Hernan VitenbergShe says the provincial executive also “criminalises leaders, portraying them as internal enemies” and “circulates the discourse of the good versus bad Indian”. Ivanoff says provinces use this tactic when Indigenous rights to free and prior consultation are viewed as obstacles, as in the case of extractive projects.Although the country’s laws and constitution enshrine Indigenous rights, these are rarely implemented. Under Milei, key protections such as thenational registry of Indigenous communitiesand theIndigenous Territory Emergency Lawhave been scrapped.Campaigners also say legal and extrajudicial persecution of the Mapuche has intensified.

Bullrich has been to Patagonia several times recently,leading media toursof evicted Mapuche communities.

We do everything ourselves.”Reflecting on the fires, Mauro Millán says “the great majority” of Mapuche people now demand justice. “They are demanding that the true instigators of the inferno in the Cordillera [mountain range] be found,” he says. “The kind of state that Milei is proposing, an eviscerated state, is the one that isn’t where it should be right now, putting out the fires.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanWildfiresClimate crisisArgentinaAmericasIndigenous peoplesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some court challenges have already begun.On Wednesday last week, local and national green groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Louisiana-based Healthy Gulf and the Northern Alaska Environmental Center sued federal officials forpulling Biden-era protections for federal watersfrom oil and gas development. And on Thursday, the Center for Biological Diversitysent a notice of intentto sue over an administration move to expedite infrastructure permits in ways that threaten wetlands.Other litigation could take more time to develop, since some of Trump’s orders have not yet been enacted.“We can’t litigate an executive order – we have to see how the agencies will respond and try to roll back regulations,” said Alexandria Trimble, a spokesperson for the environmental law non-profit Earthjustice. “If those actions are inconsistent with the law, then we’ll challenge.”Advocates have been laying the groundwork for those upcoming legal battles for months, including by filing requests for more information. Last month, the Center Biological Diversityfiled a suitagainst the Trump administration to obtain public records about the relationship between the White House and Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).And in summer 2024 – before the election even took place – the Sierra Club submitted Freedom of Information Act requests about officials they expected would come into the White House if Trump were to win.These records requests could be crucial, said Joanne Spalding, director of the Sierra Club’s environmental law program.“That was the work that led to [former EPA administrator]Scott Pruitt’s resignationduring the first Trump term,” she said. “We were able to shed a light on inappropriate behavior of federal officials.”Very often, when we sued, we wonJason Rylander, the Center for Biological DiversityDuring its first term, the Trump administration faced hundreds of legal challenges to its deregulatory efforts. It won injust 23% of cases, one New York University analysis found – a steep decrease from previous administrations’ average success rate of 70%.Some environmental groups won lawsuits even more often. Earthjustice, for instance, filed more than 130 lawsuits and saw an 85% success rate, while the Center for Biological Diversity sued 266 times and won 90% of the time.“Very often, when we sued, we won,” said Rylander.In some ways, environmental groups are at a greater disadvantage this time around. While Trump’s first term was marked by ethics violations and scandals – whichexperts attributeto a lack of experience – this term, the president came into office armed with detailed plans to gut environmental policy such as theinfamous Project 2025.Another edge Trump has over his opponents: three of the nine members of the supreme court are his own appointees, and three others were picked by other Republican presidents.“It’s the most conservative supreme court we’ve seen in many decades,” said Rylander. “We have seen even across the Biden administration that they have been taking a much stricter look at federal agency power and particularly a much more skeptical look at environmental law.”Certain changes in the legal landscape may also work against environmentalists. For instance, a July supreme court decision altered the statute of limitations for challenging agency actions that could prove to have deleterious effects for the planet, said Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.Previously, parties had six years to challenge new agency regulations after they were crafted. Now parties have six years beginning from when they are first affected by a rule, meaning new corporations may be able to challenge decades-old rules.“So, for instance, if a Clean Water Act regulation was enacted in 1985, someone could find a way to challenge it today if they’re only now subject to that regulation,” Gerrard said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

For instance, the supreme court in June overturned the Chevron doctrine, a40-year-old legal frameworkwhich directed courts to defer to the expertise of federal agencies to determine how to interpret and implement laws.Climate advocates have lamented the decision to rescind the doctrine, saying it hamstrings agencies’ ability to protect both public health and the environment. But surprisingly, it could also make it easier to oppose the Trump administration’s actions, said Daniel Farber, who directs the University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment.If you’re going to gut the agency, how are you going to develop the scientific record you need … to justify a weaker rule?Joanne Spalding, the Sierra Club“Down the road we will see a lot of proceedings to repeal and/or replace existing regulations. Those are probably also going to be the subject of litigation,” he said. “In some instances, the agency will rely on a novel legal theory to justify its action, but since Chevron is gone, cases will be decided on the legal issues for themselves.”The administration may also be undermining its deregulatory goals with its mass layoffs and firings, advocates say. By leaving agencies with fewer experts and less capacity, it could make it harder for them to enact rules, especially in legally defensible ways.“There are technicalities to worry about,” said Spalding, of the Sierra Club. “If you’re going to gut the agency, how are you going to manage to develop the scientific record that you need, the technical record that you need, to justify a weaker rule?”Environmental groups also say their experience from suing Trump years ago has left them better prepared to tackle Trump this term.“They have the benefit of experience from last time, but so do we,” said Sean Donahue, a lawyer who represents the environmental non-profit Environmental Defense Fund.These people protected US forests and lands. Their jobs have now vanished due to TrumpRead moreYet Trump officials during this term have demonstrated an apparent disregard for the law, said Donahue. Last week, the president posted on social media a quote often attributed to Napoleon – “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law” – signaling a lack of interest in comporting with the US legal system.“What they are better at is acting like they have a mandate to just get rid of laws through what I would almost call extra-legal means,” Donahue said.This “authoritarian streak” is “keeping many of us up at night”, Rylander said of the environmental movement.“The great fear is that this administration is not a normal, if slightly amped-up, Republican administration, and that battle ahead is going to be one not just to preserve our environmental laws or to make progress on climate change, but to save our democracy,” he said.Will the legal system be strong enough to withstand these threats?“We will just have to watch and see how this plays out,” Rylander said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDemocracy and justiceUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

There are civil servants inGazanot involved in political activities, some of whom worked for the government before Hamas took over the territory.The letter also claims that criticism levelled against Abdullah, the 14-year-old narrator, disregarded “core safeguarding principles”, adding that children “must not be held responsible for the actions of adults, and weaponising family associations to discredit a child’s testimony is both unethical and dangerous”.The BBC documentary was based on nine months of footage filmed in the run-up to last month’s Israel-Gaza ceasefire, with three children among the main characters. It was produced by an independent company, Hoyo Films.The Bafta-winning director Jasleen Kaur Sethi, who signed the letter, said: “At the heart of this film are children surviving a war zone and as documentary-makers we have a sacrosanct duty to protect them. The campaign to discredit this film has dehumanised them and shamefully risked putting their lives and safety in danger.”Lineker, who signed the letter and is theBBC’s best-paid star, announced last year that he would step down as host of Match of the Day. He has previously been criticised for wading into politics, including condemnation of government immigration policy, and has been a staunch defender of the BBC.Other signatories include the actor Khalid Abdalla, the Bridgerton star India Amarteifio, the novelist Max Porter, the director Ken Loach, the photographer Misan Harriman, the comedian Jen Brister, the presenter Ayo Akinwolere and the writer and actor Asim Chaudhry. The Guardian understands 10 current BBC staff have also signed.Last week, the BBC received a letter signed by 45 prominent Jewish journalists and members of the media demanding the programme be taken down. Signatories included the former BBC One controller Danny Cohen, the former BBC governor Ruth Deech, the EastEnders actor Tracy-Ann Oberman and the Strike producer Neil Blair.Phil Rosenberg, the director of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called for an independent inquiry into the broadcaster earlier this week, saying he was concerned by the its “credulous” approach to Hamas.A spokesperson for the BBC pointed the Guardian to two statements on its corrections and clarifications page saying it was conducting further due diligence with the production company. The documentary will not be available oniPlayerwhile investigations continue.Explore more on these topicsBBCGazaTelevisionGary LinekerJuliet StevensonMiriam MargolyesChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Despite “multiple searches” over the years, no body had been found.Following fresh information a new search began in Thirsk on Monday, Greater Manchester police said, resulting in human remains being found. While no official identification has taken place, a spokesperson said: “We strongly suspect the remains are that of Rania.”Alayed’s son Yazan, speaking on behalf of their family, said: “The discovery of my mother’s remains more than a decade onwards has come as a surreal surprise to me and my family.“At last, being able to provide a final resting place is all we have wanted for the last 11 years, to have the ability to lay down a few flowers for my mother is more than I can ask for from this world.”Alayed was a Palestinian refugee who moved to the UK with Khatib from Syria. Her marriage was marred by domestic violence but she had left Khatib and was trying to make a better life for herself and her three children.The murder trial heard that Khatib killed her while her children were in the next room. He was captured on CCTV in his wife’s headscarf and jeans, worn to convince friends and family that she was still alive.After Khatib was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 20 years, a police detective involved in the case said: “Make no mistake, this was an ‘honour’ killing.”He said Khatib was motivated by “his outrage and jealousy that Rania would attempt to take control of her own life and live a more westernised life, after suffering years of abuse at his hands.“His male ‘pride’ clearly couldn’t take a strong woman trying to determine her own fate, so he carried out one final act that would ensure she could never defy him again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I hope that we are now able to finally reunite her with her family, where she belongs, so that they can give her a proper resting place.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsYorkshireSalfordGreater ManchesterEnglandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The judge told him: “You were held in high regard by many. The sentence you will serve will be alien to you.”James was convicted of three counts of rape, three of sexual activity with a child, and two counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity. He pleaded guilty to six counts of making indecent photographs of a child.James, who was a student officer with Devon and Cornwall police at the time of his arrest, carried out the offences over a 10-year period between 2012 and 2022. The court heard James was at police headquarters when he was sent indecent images by one victim.One of the women assaulted by James read out her victim personal statement in court, telling him he was “twisted and strange”. She said: “You used me again and again.”The survivor said James had robbed her of some of her formative years. She added: “The person I was supposed to be was taken from me – I always wondered what type of girl I would be if you didn’t do this to me.”She said she had panic attacks and constantly felt in a state of “flight or fight”. The woman said she felt ashamed when she looked at her body. Before the attacks, she said, she had been a confident girl; afterwards she felt “vulnerable, weak and trampled”.She told him: “I can never forgive you for what you did to my family. I hope you are struggling to live with what you have done – but somehow I doubt you will.”Joe Stone KC, defending, said: “This is a Shakespearean fall from grace given his contribution to this city and country.”He said James had risen to the “pinnacle of the sporting world”, representing his country at European, Commonwealth and world level as well as at the Olympics, and had broken British records. Stone said James had also helped people with special needs.Gemma Kneebone, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Antony James manipulated and controlled his teenage victims to fulfil his own sexual desires. This prosecution would not have been possible without the evidence so bravely provided by the young women involved, and I would like to thank them for coming forward to support the case.”James, from Plymouth, will serve 14 years in prison before he can be released, and will be on the sex offender register for life.He began his training with Devon and Cornwall police in October 2020, but was suspended immediately after initial disclosures were made in January 2022. He was dismissed from the force in August 2023.Assistant chief constable Jim Pearce said: “We hope that seeing him prosecuted and sentenced, regardless of his position, sends a clear message that we will not tolerate such abuse and harmful attitudes within our service. Maintaining the highest standards of integrity remains a priority and any wrongdoing or unacceptable behaviour will be subject to thorough investigation.”Explore more on these topicsCrimePlymouthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It consists of an edited clip from a Times Radio interview where Vince is asked: “Is a terrorist attack from Hamas Palestine defending itself?”“I think one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter, right? That’s how it works,” replied Vince, who claims the clip was used to imply that he supported the terrorist acts of Hamas.He has already forced the Daily Mail and GB News to apologise and pay damages to him over stories about the comments. He has been suing Staines, the editor-in-chief of theGuido Fawkeswebsite, and Tice, who tweeted in reference to the clip.After a high court judge’s ruling on early issues in the case, Vince said: “The court ruling today makes clear that I was seriously defamed by Paul Staines and that left him with no real prospect at a full hearing. He has therefore conceded.”Staines has agreed to pay damages of £9,995 and is also liable for Vince’s legal costs, which are expected to be in the region of £100,000.Vince added: “Whether Richard Tice wants to go all the way, I don’t know. I want him to accept that what he said was wrong, that it was defamatory as the judge has ruled today, and I would be happy with an apology, a correction and to move on. If he loses it will mean significant damages and costs.”Tice said: “The judge agreed at the hearing with me that my tweet was an opinion … which is a key defence to libel, that of honest opinion. Thus I won the hearing in respect of me, and it is almost impossible for Mr Vince to succeed in his claim. I expect to be awarded costs in my favour.”Explore more on these topicsDale VinceGuido FawkesRichard TiceMedia lawnewsShareReuse this content"

What should we do?”Judge Kearl told them: “You have all taken an oath or affirmation to try this case on the evidence, not your conscience. If you are unable to abide by your oath or affirmation you should let me know.”Warner told the Guardian that the jurors had the right to acquit her based on their conscience, citing a legal principle called jury equity, in which the jury can vote not guilty even when they think the defendant has committed the crime because they believe the law is unjust.This came into focus last year when another climate protester, Trudi Warner (no relation to Diana Warner),was accused of contempt of courtwhen she held up a sign outside the inner London high court reading: “Jurors, you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience.”Diana Warner said she felt the jury in her trial had been on her side, with some of them smiling at her as they left for the jury room. “At the end, when they had heard my evidence, and especially once they posed the question to the judge, I had a strong impression that they agreed with me,” she said.She believed the jury’s good faith had been “abused” by the judge. “I personally would call it bullying … bullying by the judge who was acting on behalf of the state.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, more than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Damon Albarn and Annie Lennox,released a silent album in protest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The event, in November 2024, was hosted by Lord Evans and similarly organised by his son, Richard Evans. More than 70 guests attended the event, some of whom had paid more than £600 for access.The revelation raises questions about the judgment of the second most senior minister in the upper chamber. As chief whip, Kennedy is responsible for party discipline.0:22Richard Evans speaks with undercover reporter about chief whip attending \"last minute\", 6 DecemberThe Guardian can also reveal Sharon Taylor, a housing minister, was announced twoweeks ago by Richard Evans as the keynote speaker at another House of Lords event concerning UK housing and infrastructure, scheduled for June. Access to attend the event is available for more than £320.The online announcement appeared alongside an appeal from Richard to sponsor the event, for up to £25,000.Revealed: how members of House of Lords benefit from commercial interestsRead moreBut Lady Taylor told the Guardian after she was approached for comment: “I would like to make it clear that I have declined this invitation and will not be attending in any capacity.”The minister’s apparentwillingness to speak at the event, alongside Kennedy’s involvement, is particularly embarrassing for the government, given Lord Evans’ comment to undercover reporters: “It’s great being aLabourpeer at the moment because we’ve got our mates who now have senior jobs, which is wonderful.”The undercover reporters had posed as property developers interested in sponsoring a House of Lords event, organised by Richard. They said they wanted to have their voice heard in government.The latest revelation may lead to a wider debate around the culture and rules that govern parliamentarians hosting private events in Westminster.0:25Lord Evans speaks to undercover reporters and his son about invites for the main event, 19 DecemberThe construction events are run through Richard’s company, in which Lord Evans is a one-third shareholder. Lord Evans said: “I would NOT and I do NOT accept payments for hosting any House of Lords events.” He said he had forgotten he had a share in the company.There is no suggestion that any other peers attending the events were aware of their commercial nature.‘To get the chief whip though, like, last minute’It was a quiet Friday in November in the Lords when Kennedy spoke. The day’s business, a debate on the Grenfell Tower inquiry report, concluded shortly after 12.30pm. Downstairs, on the terrace overlooking the Thames, Lord Evans’ guests mingled in the Cholmondeley Room for the construction industry event.As they sat for lunch, Lord Evans welcomed them, and said he had “another friend” to introduce. Kennedy stepped on to the stage.Kennedy told the guests, many of whom worked in construction, that he had been housing spokesperson before the last election. He explained how his role as chief whip limited his opportunities to speak, so he was pleased “to be able to come down and say hello to a few people”.Speaking in front of a banner for one of the event’s sponsors, he added: “Housing is a passion of mine and ensuring we build sustainable housing for the future is really, really important. I also want to wish you a really, really interesting afternoon and have a lovely lunch. I know it’s a very cold day but it’s also a beautiful day and what a fabulous setting here, here in the House of Lords.”He concluded by saying he had to leave for meetings to discuss the upcoming business of the house, but hoped to return later. He did not come back.In a later conversation with an undercover reporter, posing as an adviser interested in sponsoring a similar event, Richard bragged about Kennedy’s attendance and suggested he could be persuaded to attend again.“We can go for Roy Kennedy again … He was asked like, last minute, to come along. But to get, to get the chief whip though, like last minute,” he said, with a snap and click of his fingers, “like, just to come in and say.”Do you have information about this story? Email henry.dyer@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348.Richard was asked how he got Kennedy to attend. “We’ve been members of the Labour party for 40, 50 years,” Richard replied.A spokesperson for Kennedy said he “responded to a request at short notice from a fellow Labour peer to give a welcome to attenders at an event in the House of Lords. He was in the room for a few minutes, spoke briefly then promptly left.”‘Better than Keir Starmer, to be honest’Ministers’ attendance form a part of the promotional materials for the events shared by Richard on LinkedIn.When Richard was working to secure a sponsorship deal from the undercover reporter, he referenced the attendance of ministers at previous events.He said that getting a particular minister for a previous event had been “unbelievable. That’s a major coup.” He added: “Better than Keir Starmer, to be honest.”Richard said parliamentarians, not only ministers, would be invited to attend events hosted by his father.During the course of the discussions with the fake developers, Richard said his father had lined up Richard Harrington, a peer and former Tory refugees minister in the housing department.Lord Harrington was going to speak at an event in the Lords to be held in March, which the undercover reporters had expressed an interest in sponsoring. Access for the event, through purchase of an Affinity membership, was on sale from £299.But after the Guardian contacted him for comment, he pulled out. Harrington said: “I was personally asked by Lord Evans to speak at an event on foreign direct investment.”He added: “Given the information that has been presented, I will no longer be attending this event.”Lord Evans told the Guardian he was not involved in cash for access. He said he was “NOT involved in the commercial side of the event and only interested in the political objective of building more social housing”.He said he had never taken any money for hosting events in parliament.Richard told the Guardian the Affinity events in parliament were “educative”, with 90% of attenders on gifted places.He said the £25,000 sponsorship deals “extends beyond covering the cost of event delivery – it includes ongoing marketing support for our sponsors”.He added: “Ministers are invited to speak briefly (typically six to 10 minutes) to update guests on a latest government news at these educational events, before returning to their busy schedules.”Harrington is no longer referenced on the marketing for the Lords event in March. Shortly after the Guardian contacted Taylor, her attendance at the June event as the keynote speaker was also removed from promotional material.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateLobbyingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Zhu also gave the ages of the children Shein previously said it had found working at suppliers in 2023 as 15 years and 11 months, and 15 years and nine months.Shein conducted about 4,300 audits covering about 317,000 workers in 2024, up from 4,000 audits covering 285,000 workers in 2023, according to the letter.“We take a strict zero-tolerance approach to child labour,” Zhu wrote. “We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that these isolated cases are removed from our supply chain entirely in future, bringing our network of third-party suppliers globally, including in China, Brazil and Turkey, along with us.”The latest concerns about conditions in Shein’s supply chain emerged after reports that the retailer was under pressure to cut the valuation for its planned flotation to $30bn (£24bn), well below the $64bn-plus it had previously hoped for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fire safety will be brought under one department, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.The official fire safety guidance, known as Approved Document B (ADB), will be reviewed and revised, and the definition of “higher-risk building” in law will also be revised.TheGrenfell Tower inquiryphase two 1,700-page report, released on 4 September, contained 58 recommendations, of which the government accepted 49 in full and nine in principle , saying they required “further consideration” through consultations.The 2017 fire killed 72 people, with cladding found to be the principal reason for the rapid spread.Publishing the government response, the deputy prime minister,Angela Rayner, said: “The Grenfell Tower tragedy claimed 72 innocent lives in a disaster that should never have happened. The final report exposed in stark and devastating detail the shocking industry behaviour and wider failures that led to the fire, and the deep injustices endured by the bereaved, survivors and residents.“We are acting on all of the inquiry’s findings, and today set out our full response, detailing the tough action we are taking to drive change and reform the system to ensure no community will ever have to face a tragedy like Grenfell again.“That means greater accountability, stronger regulation and putting residents at the heart of decision-making. We must deliver the fundamental change required. We owe that to the Grenfell community, to the country and to the memory of those who lost their lives.”The seven companies are: Arconic Architectural Products SAS; Saint-Gobain Construction Products UK Limited, which previously owned Celotex Limited; Exova (UK) Limited; Harley Facades Limited; Kingspan Insulation Limited; Rydon Maintenance Limited and Studio E Architects Limited.In a written statement published on Wednesday, the Cabinet Office parliamentary secretary, Georgia Gould, said the firms would be investigated under debarment powers in the Procurement Act 2023, which came into effect on Monday. “These investigations will establish whether the organisations have engaged in professional misconduct for the purposes of that act,” she said.“The new act allows us to investigate suppliers and, if certain grounds are met, to add their names to a published and centrally managed debarment list, which must be taken into account by contracting authorities in awarding new contracts and undertaking new procurements.” .Other measures announced include:Consulting on a new college of fire and rescueLegally requiring fire risk assessors to have their competence certified.Improving the fire safety and evacuation of disabled and vulnerable residents in high-rise and higher-risk residential buildings,In addition, the government has launched a construction products green paper for consultation, including consulting on measures to introduce liability sanctions and penalties, such as fines and imprisonment.The government seeks to implement a legal duty of candour through a new Hillsborough law, compelling public authorities to disclose the truth, ensuring transparency in major incidents and holding to account those responsible for failures.It also pledges stronger, clearer and enforceable legal rights for residents, making landlords responsible for acting on safety concerns, and empowering social housing residentsto challenge landlords and demand safe, high-quality housing, by expanding the Four Million Homes training programme.Rayner, who is also housing secretary, told MPs of manufacturing companies “including Arconic, Kingspan and Celotex, whose products were used to refurbish the tower. The report found that they acted with systemic dishonesty as they mis-sold and marketed them. Their disgraceful mercenary behaviour put profit before people and exploited the regulatory regime to evade accountability with fatal consequences.”Grenfell Next of Kin, a group representing some of the bereaved, said it would be “paying close attention to the words and intentions” from government.The shadow housing and communities secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, told MPs the “pace must quicken” in the criminal investigation into the 2017Grenfell Tower fire, as he called for “criminal charges where evidence allows”.Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireGrenfell Tower inquiryConstruction industryAngela RaynerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

A Vatican official said he had been inundated with letters and cards wishing him well.Nightly prayer vigils for the pope’s health are continuing to take place at St Peter’s basilica, in towns and cities across Italy and abroad.Vigils have also been held outside the Gemelli, which has long been the preferred hospital for pontiffs.Francis was admitted to hospitalon 14 Februaryand was subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in both lungs.He is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while he was training to be a priest in his native Argentina.‘We are very worried’: Conclave cast express concern for Pope Francis in health crisisRead moreThe pope has suffered from ill health in recent years. He was admitted to hospital in March 2023 for what was eventually diagnosed as pneumonia. He also underwent a colon operation in June 2021. The pontiff has often been seen using a wheelchair or a walking stick as a result of sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem.Before his hospital admission, the pope maintained an intense schedule, especially with events related to theCatholic jubilee year.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyVaticannewsShareReuse this content"

In a letter to British lawmakers on Wednesday, she wrote that the UK government’s order for Apple to create a “backdoor” to iCloud users’ accounts is a “clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties”.“Any information sharing between a government – any government – and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,” Gabbard wrote.Gabbard’s letter comes after the US senator Ron Wyden and the representative Andy Biggs sent her a letter on 13 February with their concerns about what such a demand would mean for US residents’ online safety and privacy. Gabbard echoed their worries, saying that the order would “open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors” and could violate a bilateral agreement between the US and the UK.News of the UK government’s order first surfaced earlier this month when the Washington Post reported thatthe Home Office had issueda “technical capability notice” under the Investigatory Powers Act, which requires companies to help British law enforcement uncover evidence in investigations. The government demanded Apple build a backdoor into its cloud service that would allow access to people’s iCloud accounts, even when their information was encrypted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Apple has made a point of publicly fighting back against government requests for user data. It famouslyrefused to create a backdoorfor the FBI related to a terror attack in San Bernardino, California, in 2015.Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.In her letter, Gabbard said she was not aware of the UK government’s order until it was reported on in the media. She said that she’s requested her counterparts in various US security agencies, including the CIA, FBI and NSA, provide insights into UK’s actions. She added that US national security lawyers are working on a legal opinion about the implications of such a demand.The US and UK have entered into bilateral agreement called the Cloud Act that, Gabbard said, prohibits the UK from issuing demands for data of US residents or any persons located inside the country. The converse applies to the US government under the agreement.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAppleEncryptioniPhoneiCloudnewsShareReuse this content"

Kathryn Barger, chair of theLos Angelescounty board of supervisors, said that during the first four days of the blaze, some tow truck operators were falsely claiming to be working for Altadena officials. They towed vehicles without telling owners where the cars were being stored.These companies then demanded excessive fees to give back the vehicles, some of which were found in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, both about an hour’s drive from Los Angeles.“I find it disgusting that these fraudulent tow operators exploited fire survivors during their time of distress,” Barger said in astatementon Monday.Barger’s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment from the Guardian regarding how many residents had been affected.Officials have urged anyone who experienced suspicious interactions with tow companies, such as requests for photos of driver’s licenses or claims that a vehicle could not be located, to report them to the Inland Empire auto insurance fraud taskforce.“Those behind this abhorrent scheme must be held accountable and brought to justice,” Barger said. “I urge anyone who was victimized to come forward so we can stop these bad actors from preying on our communities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company later placed a lien on their car.“I realized they wanted the cars. It’s complicated,” Knudson told ABC7. “It would be impressive if it wasn’t so awful.”Although recovery efforts after the fires in Los Angeles county are afoot, the process has been rocky. Last week, the mayor, Karen Bass,removed the fire chief, Kristin Crowley, following criticism of the city’s wildfire response. Crowley reportedly sent 1,000 firefighters home on the day the fires started, a move that drew sharp criticism from the firefighters’ union.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastLos AngelesUS crimeShareReuse this content"

He later admitted he was taking revenge on “you [westerners] who kill Muslims every day”.Armed with a kitchen knife, Aouissaoui almost decapitated 60-year-old Nadine Devillers, stabbed Barereto Silva, a 44-year-old Franco-Brazilian care worker, and slit the throat of Vincent Loqués, a 55-year-old church worker, at the Notre-Dame basilica.He was convicted of the three murders and six attempted murders.On Wednesday the court made the rare decision to give him the maximum sentence of life imprisonment with almost no chance of parole for the attack described in the trial as one of “unusual savagery”.The presiding judge, Christophe Petiteau, described the murders as “very violent” and said the sentence reflected the judges’ verdict that Aouissaoui presented a “too high risk” of reoffending.Petiteau described Brahim Aouissaoui as “an extremely dangerous man” whose “intention to kill could not be disputed”. His actions could not be described as being the result of a spontaneous “mad act”, the judges added.The investigating magistrate said Aouissaoui had described France as “a country of miscreants and dogs” and said he was determined to “sow terror”.The court was told that Aouissaoui had dropped out of school in Turkey at the age of 13 and was drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis at the time. He was radicalised at the end of 2018.In a closing address to the special court, the counsel for the national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said Aouissaoui was “locked into his totalitarian and barbaric fanaticism”. He added: “The attack was in reality the culmination of a jihadist commitment born in Tunisia.”It took seven police officers to arrest Aouissaoui, who was shot several times. Afterwards, officers said he was carrying a copy of the Qur’an, three knives and two mobile phones.‘Tell my children I love them’: the victims of the Nice attackRead moreAccording to the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office there were “many indications that at the time he left Tunisia … the accused intended to carry out an attack in France”.A national day of mourning was held forthe three victims. The killings came two weeks after the history-geography teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded near his secondary school north-west of Paris by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee angered at reports he had shown pupils caricatures of the prophet Muhammad in a lesson on freedom of speech.Aouissaoui had crossed the Mediterranean from Tunisia to Italy a month before the attack and then entered France overland.Explore more on these topicsFranceIslamReligionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” Bezos said.“We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.”Bezos’s decision to inject more regular and weighty conservative theming will also see the departure of opinions editor David Shipley, although it was not immediately clear if he was fired for resisting Bezos’s direction, or chose to resign.Shipley had been in discussions over the content of the opinion section of the paper for several weeks, according to theNew York Times. The dialogue began in January when Will Lewis, the chief executive of the Post, sent a memo to Shipley outlining Bezos’s new vision.Shipley pushed back against the idea, arguing that restricting content in the way Bezos proposed would lose the breadth of viewpoints aired in Post opinion, the Times reported.Shipley joined the Washington Post in 2022 as editorial page editor and was in that job when Bezosblocked the Post’s editorial boardfrom publishing an endorsement for Kamala Harris,Donald Trump’s Democratic opponent, before last November’s presidential election, sparking outrage.But he defended the Post’s decision in January not to publish a satiricalcartoon by Pulitzer prize winner Ann Telnaesthat depicted Bezos and other billionaire media company owners kneeling at the feet of a giant figure of Trump, offering bags of money.Telnaes resigned, one of a growing number of departures of senior Post employees during a tumultuous time for the newspaper. Itlost 250,000 subscribersafter Bezos blocked the Harris endorsement, and a slew of star writers joined rival publications.In his message on Wednesday, Bezos emphasized that he’s “for America, and proud to be so” and that he offered “David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter.“I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no.’ After careful consideration, David decided to step away… I respect his decision,” he wrote.Bezos also shared the letter to staff directly on hisX page.Bezos’s extraordinary rightward shift prompted a scathing response from the paper’s legendary formereditor Marty Baron. Baron called the billionaire’s intervention “craven” in an interview by the online outletZeteo.“He’s basically fearful of Trump. He has decided that, as timid and tepid as the editorials have been, they’ve been too tough on Trump,” Baron said.He later told the Guardian via email on Wednesday: “What Bezos is doing today runs counter to what he said, and actually practiced, during my tenure at The Post. I have always been grateful for how he stood up for The Post and an independent press against Trump’s constant threats to his business interest. Now I couldn’t be more sad and disgusted.“Bezos argues for personal liberties. But his news organization now will forbid views other than his own in its opinion section,” Baron continued, noting that only a few weeks ago, the Post described itself in an internal mission statement as intended for “all of America”.“Now, its opinion pages will be open to only some of America, those who think exactly as he does.”Baron, who was the top editor of the Post from 2012 until he retired in 2021, added: “At a time when we’re talking about freedom and democracy, he is saying there will not be freedom and liberty on our own pages.”At the time Baron made those comments the Post was still being published with the slogan: “Freedom dies in darkness.”In the aftermath of Bezos’s email, Jeff Stein, an economics reporter for theWashington Post, spoke out about the billionaire’s edict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the first, he said he was using his “personal liberties” to repost an earlier video he made about “why some billionaires are going soft on Trump”.In the second,he wrote: “Echoing Jeff (Stein), if Bezos interferes with my work on the news side – I’m out.”The executive editor of the Post, Matt Murray, tried to assuage jitters via a newsroom memo saying changes affected opinion alone and “the independent and unbiased work of The Post’s newsroom remains unchanged.”Jeff Bezos is muzzling the Washington Post’s opinion section.

Excluding posts from accounts with fewer than 1,000 followers and in languages other than English, they analysed the resulting 982 social media posts, from account holders with more than 194 million total followers.Expert says overdiagnosis means Australian cancer screening tests must be ‘handled very carefully’Read moreThe study’s lead author, Dr Brooke Nickel, said posts about these tests came from a “wide range” of account holders, from major influencers to “everyday girl-next-door” accounts, as well as news outlets, doctors and the companies making the tests. “Across the board, they were being promoted misleadingly,” she said.Nickel said the tests were being promoted under the guise of empowerment: early screening as a way for people to take control of their own health. However, as Nickel noted: “These tests carry the potential for healthy people to receive unnecessary diagnoses, which could lead to unnecessary medical treatments or impact mental health.”Nickel said she was struck by the “really personal narratives” being used: “Fearmongering that if you don’t do this test, you’re not taking care of your own health.”For example, despite the science of the gut microbiome test being in its very early stages, an Instagram account with over 65,000 followers promoted the test to its followers, telling them: “You DESERVE to be healthy. It is your BIRTHRIGHT. These tests will let us know with CERTAINTY what is causing your specific health concerns.”Researchers involved in the study found the overwhelming majority of posts (87.1%) mentioned benefits of the tests, with harms mentioned by less than 15% of posts, and only 6% mentioned overdiagnosis or overuse.A promotional tone was used in 83.8% of posts – more than half (50.7%) encouraged viewers to take action and get the test, and 68% of account holders had financial interests involved.Posts from doctors were more likely to mention harms and less likely to have an overall promotional tone but Nickel said in some cases they were also “really strongly promoting the test”.One medical doctor withmore than 65,000 followers on TikTok promoted the multi-cancer early detection test to their followers, telling them: “As you get older the chance of cancer is pretty high, if you do this test yearly then you’ll pretty much catch cancer early.”We should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get testedProf Stacy CarterTheharms of cancer overdiagnosiswere most clear, Nickel said, with both the full-body MRI and multi-cancer early detection test promoted as a way to identify early forms of cancer.Overdiagnosis refers to the diagnosis of very early forms of disease that are unlikely to cause any symptoms or problems but knowledge of which can do more harm than good, leading to psychological stress andunnecessary treatments including major surgery.In addition to concerns about overdiagnosis, there were the financial costs of the tests themselves (full-body MRIs cost upwards of $800 in Australia) and of costly interventions pursued as a result.Despite egg-timer tests beingunable to reliably predict a woman’s chance of conceiving, Nickel said there were concerns women who received low results may experience unnecessary anxiety, and go down the path of elective egg freezing or IVF interventions when they may not have been needed.Nickel said the test “preys on the insecurity” of women regarding their future capacity to conceive, noting it was often promoted to younger women who might be years away from the decision.A medical doctor with more than 70,000 TikTok followers promoted the test: “Whether you’re in your teens or 30s, empowering yourself with fertility knowledge is extremely important. For women, age is not a friend.”The testosterone test was most closely linked to promotion of treatments or supplements, and often carried “really clear narratives around masculinity”, Nickel said.A TikTok account with close to 100,000 followers promoted the testosterone test by telling followers: “Watch out for this scary sign of low testosterone levels … You should be waking up in the morning with a boner. If you’re not waking up in the morning with a boner there’s a large possibility you have a low testosterone level. Get it checked!”Nickel said there were also potential dangers for men taking some testosterone supplements because of a lack of long-term evidence around safety.She said the problem overall was that because these tests were often sold direct to consumers, they “take the middle man – the doctor – out of the equation” and the space for a person to discuss with a medical professional whether they need the test or not.Prof Stacy Carter, the director of the Australian Centre forHealthEngagement, Evidence and Values at the University of Wollongong, said the study used robust methods and “shows clearly that influential social media posts promote testing and talk up the alleged benefits of testing – even when tests are useless, or potentially harmful”.“This study adds to the evidence that medical misinformation is common on social media, and suggests we should all think again when an influencer encourages us to get tested,” Carter said.Nickel said stronger regulation was needed so that the onus was not on individuals to see through the misinformation.This article was amended on 27 February 2025 to clarify that posts from accounts with fewer than 1,000 followers were excluded from the study – not fewer than 100 followers, as stated in an earlier version of the story.Explore more on these topicsHealthSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

The judgment becomes final after the expected appeal process.Dodik and his lawyers weren’t in court during the sentencing. He has said he would disobey any conviction and threatened “radical measures” in response, including eventual secession of the Serb-run entity in Bosnia called Republika Srpska from the rest of the country.Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join neighbouring Serbia,which prompted the Biden administration to impose sanctions against him and his close allies. Dodik was also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies.Dodik’s separatist threats have stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war erupted when the country’s Serbs rebelled against independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a mini-state with the aim of uniting it withSerbia. About 100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced.The US-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war and created two regions, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, which were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Serb and Croat members.Dodik has repeatedly clashed with the top international envoy overseeing the peace, Christian Schmidt, and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska. The Dayton peace agreement envisages that the high representative can impose decisions and change laws in the country.Bosniak official Camil Durakovic said the verdict against Dodik showed that “no individual is above the state and that everyone will be held accountable for their actions”.Dodik, a supporter of Donald Trump, spoke on Wednesday to thousands gathered in the Bosnian Serb administrative capital, Banja Luka.“They say I am guilty, but now people here will say why I am not guilty,” Dodik told the crowd after the verdict was announced. “There is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations.”In Serbia, its populist president, Aleksandar Vučić, called an urgent session of the national security council, then flew to Banja Luka to support Dodik. He described the verdict as “shameful, unlawful, antidemocratic and designed to break down Republika Srpska and the position of the Serb people”.Dodik is unlikely to be sent to prison for now because he enjoys the full support of Vučić, who can provide him shelter in Belgrade.Dodik told the crowd he spoke by phone with Hungary’s prime minister,Viktor Orbán, whom he called a friend.“The political witch-hunt against President @MiloradDodik is a sad example of the weaponization of the legal system aimed at a democratically elected leader,” Orban said on X. “If we want to safeguard stability in the Western Balkans, this is not the way forward!”Explore more on these topicsBosnia and HerzegovinaSerbiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The organisers of the march did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Orbán, a longtime ally of Donald Trump, told supporters on Saturday that Pride organisers “should not even bother” this year as the event would be a “waste of money and time”, without going into any detail.His chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, then told the news site 24.hu on Wednesday that Pride should not be held the way it had been in the past. He said the goal was to “enforce the point of view of child protection” and that he did not see any such risk with “a Pride that is held in a closed space”.For decades, Pride participants have processed down Andrássy Avenue, a spacious, tree-lined street in Budapest’s city centre.‘In a real sense, US democracy has died’: how Trump is emulating Hungary’s OrbánRead moreOrbán, in power since 2010, promotes a Christian-conservative agenda and in 2021 banned the “promotion of homosexuality” among under-18s, despite strong criticism from rights groups and the EU.His government has said the law – which appeals to Fidesz’s core voter base – is meant to protect children and does not target the LGBTQ+ community.The law has caused anxiety among gay, bisexual and transgender Hungarians. The European Commission referredHungaryto the court of justice of the EU over it in mid-2022.Gay marriage is not recognised in Hungary and Orbán’s government has redefined marriage as the union between one man and one woman in the constitution, and limited gay adoption.Explore more on these topicsHungaryLGBTQ+ rightsEuropePrideViktor OrbánnewsShareReuse this content"

Bad art is lifeless, good art is alive and great art is supervital. And it’s a supervital masterpiece I am looking at right now. Face as sharply hewn as a Congolese mask, with a flesh-coloured pullover melting into the shadows of his loins, Peter Lacy dominates the room, captured in a gold-framed portrait by his loverFrancis Bacon.That room is the Colony Room Green in London, not the original Colony Room but a bar nearby that lovingly recreates, with the precision of an art installation or stage set, the bohemian drinking den run byMuriel Belcherwhere Bacon would order drinks all round with his famous toast: “Champagne for my real friends and real pain for my sham friends!” Its green walls are covered with art and memorabilia, including a wanted poster made by artist Lucian Freud to recover his own lost portrait of Bacon.So how has Peter Lacy, who seems an immense, baroque phenomenon propped up in the middle of these cosy confines, made his way home ? He is on “day release”, explains Jago Cooper, director of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia – as in a day out from prison. The Sainsbury Centre has declared that all the artworks it owns are alive: “Art is alive and animate, waiting to be communicated with by anyone with a soul.” So, Cooper wondered, where would a living work of art want to go if it had a brief escape from the jail of the museum?It’s a pretty good guess that a Bacon painting would choose to return to its creator’s old haunt, or at least this replica. The burningly intense painting holds court at the centre of the room. You half-expect it to start dropping acid one-liners to the cackling delight of drunken ghosts – all the Soho monsters and reprobates hovering in the afternoon shadows, drinks in their skeletal hands. It’s a lovely bar, but if you do visit the new Colony Room, you won’t, sadly, find Bacon’s painting. This really is just a day release, although it is all being recorded for a film to be shown from April at the Sainsbury Centre, with actors playing gay men from Bacon’s generation and from today, comparing experiences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lightning visit by a masterpiece to a drinking den where the public can’t see it except on film? Let’s not use the dread words “publicity stunt”. Instead, let’s wonder whether it really is meaningful to claim that a work of art is a living thing, with a mind of its own and opinions about where it would like to go.Anyone who has ever loved a work of art knows this to be true. It is fundamental to art’s power and magic. The Bacon in the bar is electrifying proof. Every smoky brushstroke, every matted smear of black or pink, simmers with life. Lacy is a sentient being, and behind him, you feel the vital presence of the artist himself, the warm blood coursing through his painting hand.Five centuries ago, the Renaissance writer Giorgio Vasari praised the Mona Lisa thus: “In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse.” In fact, art has been experienced by most people in the majority of places throughout human history as animate: that is, as sacred objects in which a divine or magical force is infused. In southern Italy, you can still see statues weep, come to life, process at festivals. In this pleasantly claustrophobic little bar, I am getting that same uncanny feeling about Peter Lacy. Is he about to reach out of the painting and hit me,as he was wont to hit Bacon?Francis Bacon: Human Presence review – ‘This whirligig of horrors is the best Bacon show I’ve ever seen’Read moreIt’s a reverence that was replaced in most parts of Europe by the 18th century with a more secular, rational spirit of aesthetic admiration. Works of art – or objects designated as such – were torn from religious or ritual settings and placed in museums. Or imprisoned, to continue the “day release” image. There we sometimes struggle to feel their magic power, their life.The Sainsbury Centre is trying to reclaim that intoxicating belief in art, not just through its day-release programme but in its displays, which urge you to encounter artworks as living beings, from carved masks of the Pacific Northwest to Picasso drawings. Its app tells you not the “history” of an artwork, but its “life story”; not when it was made, but when it was “born”.Gimmicky? Not to me. Either you believe art is alive, or it means nothing to you. Do yourself a favour. Believe.The Living Art collection displays can be experienced atSainsbury Centre, University of East Anglia, Norwich.Explore more on these topicsFrancis BaconArtPaintingNorwichLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are the photo booths that were once found in every town which celebrate their centenary. A new history about Welsh modernist holiday cabins makes us think anew about architecture and even Le Creuset finds new purpose.1Craft from the heartView image in fullscreenPyrographic vessel by Darren Appiagyei.Photograph: Matt WarnerWhile craft is often associated with dexterity, skill and practicality, modern artists are also using traditional methods such as ceramics, woodwork and textiles to raise awareness of social issues in an almost therapeutic expression of emotion and reaction to life events. At this year’s Collect craft fair in London, 40 galleries from 30 different countries are exhibiting work from over 400 artists, and some of the standout works were inspired by these personal stories and historic social events. Fibre artist Manya Goldman’s work is informed by her experience as a refugee from the apartheid regime in South Africa. Artist SaeRi Seo’s is inspired by Korean moon jars and the way that women weren’t traditionally allowed to create these culturally significant vessels. On a more personal level, wood artistDarren Appiagyeiis exhibiting intricate carved pieces which address his mother’s chronic problems with fibroids, and ceramicist Jemma Gowland uses her work to look at the restrictions that society typically places on women. This year’s Brookfield Properties Craft Award Prize has been won by Ebony Russell, an Australian ceramicist whose ‘piped’ porcelain pieces reference cake decorating techniques and which, she says, represent “a commitment to celebrating feminized and matrilineal craft traditions”.Collect 2025runs from 28 February-2 March at Somerset House in London2Snap happyView image in fullscreenA refurbished photo booth in London.Photograph: AutofotoOne hundred years ago, a Jewish American, fascinated by Box Brownies and obsessed by photography, invented the first photo booth. Anatol Josepho’s machine – called the Photomaton – was on Broadway in New York. It was an instant hit, and even when people no longer queued for the novelty, the sheets of photos produced in these egalitarian studios were loved for decades to come. Even as one-hour photo shops, Polaroids and camera phones eroded the special functionality and intimacy of the photo booth, they still hold a special place in social history. Autofoto is a company that keeps the remaining booths serviced and in circulation. This year, Autofoto is organising centenary celebrations, working with artists, designers and photographers to create new art using the photobooth.The Real Selfie Projectwill also document the communities around the locations booths are currently found. This month it’s the turn of London’s Spitalfields Market and local market traders and the general public will be invited to take an analogue selfie as part of this event.Visitwww.autofoto.orgfor more events3Testing the watersView image in fullscreenGroundtruth ambassador Mike Coots with the Unda bag.Photograph: GroundtruthA “ground truth” is a fact established by gathering facts by direct observation and measurement. It’s something that the Scott sisters, Georgia and Sophia, first encountered as documentary filmmakers in conflict zones around the world and they used it as the name of their film production company; so it made sense to use the name for the travel gear company they’ve now founded with their sister Nina. The same approach to scrupulously investigating manufacuture, supply chain and materials has been applied to the venture.Groundtruth’s new range, Unda, is a waterproof collection of backpacks, pouches and rolltop bags made from 100% recycled materials – includingghost fishing nets, which account for over 50% of marine plastic waste. The bags feature some high-tech, patent-pending clasps and D-rings which capture carbon emissions and Groundtruth has partnered with the professional association of diving instructors (PADI) on this new collection to highlight the organisation’s conservation efforts. Brand ambassador for the PADI/Groundtruth range is ocean photographer Mike Coots, who lost his leg in a tiger shark attack off the coast of Hawaii, but now advocates for ocean and shark conservation. His story is featured in an upcoming documentary by the Scott sisters calledKuleanawhich looks at the devastating effects of plastic pollution on our oceans, focusing on the seas around Hawaii.“We aim to make a significant positive impact through the repurposing of these harmful plastics,” says Georgia. “Groundtruth was created with the value that all consumer products should contribute to a safer planet.”Go to the Groundtruth website for more information on theUndarange and Groundtruth’s other projects, including Kuleanaskip past newsletter promotionSign up toDesign ReviewFree monthly newsletterOriginal, sustainable ideas and reflection from designers and crafters, plus clever, beautiful products for smarter livingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Welsh architecture firm Hird & Brooks (a partnership between businessman John Grenfell Hird and architect Graham Brooks) made award-winning houses in the 60s and 70s, winning 17 major design awards. The private residences they created are well-loved and respected by design aficionados – particularly a group of villas in the Vale of Glamorgan. But the book details Brooks’s less well-known obsession: crafting the perfect holiday home. The book draws on interviews and an extensive archive of correspondence to bring to life the romance and delight of the holiday cabins Brooks created, inspired by the cabins found in Denmark.Jack Hale, co-founder of the Modernist Society, says: “Unknown to most, many of these cabins remain standing to this day, tucked away in the corners of rural Wales and Scotland. We’re delighted to remind people of Hird & Brooks’ legacy.”Cabin Crew by Peter Halliday, Bethan Dalton, Lizzie Biggs and Jessica Halliday is available to preorder for £20 fromThe Modernist Society5Lunch to goView image in fullscreenThe new, improved drinks flask from Le Creuset.Photograph: Le CreusetA century ago, two Belgians, one a casting specialist and one an expert in enamelling, founded Le Creuset, the colourful cast-iron cookware company that has become a mark of distinction in kitchens the world over.

There were some very difficult moments and I often questioned my decision. But as we got better I thought, ‘OK, this is really good.’ We proved Wings could be a really good band. To play to huge audiences in the same way the Beatles had and have an impact in a different way. It was a huge buzz.”Formed in 1971, Wings released seven studio albums, a live album and a compilation album over the ensuing decade, including Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, and At the Speed of Sound. Alongside McCartney, the band’s core members were his wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.“Wings was about love, family, friendship and artistic growth, often in the face of tremendous adversity”, said Widmer, who was a speechwriter in the Clinton White House.Described as an “oral history”, the book will remember Wings’ songs, collaborations and performances, drawing on interviews with McCartney and others in the band’s orbit. Organised around nine Wings albums, the book “sheds new light on the immediate aftermath and seismic global impact of the Beatles’ break-up”, according to its publisher, Penguin imprint Allen Lane.“The narrative follows the various incarnations of the band as they survive a mugging in Nigeria, appear unannounced at UK university halls, tour in a sheared-off school bus with their children, while producing some of the most indelible and acclaimed music of the decade,” Allen Lane added. The volume will also feature more than 100 photographs, many of which have never been seen before.Paul McCartney and Wings: One Hand Clapping review – restored rockumentary is pure pleasureRead moreThe book is part of a wider re-examination of the band’s catalogue, which has included the theatrical release last year of performance filmOne Hand Clappingand its accompanying album, 50th anniversary editions of Band on the Run (released last year) and Venus and Mars (released next month), and a forthcoming documentary about McCartney’s solo and Wings-related work of the 70s by film-maker Morgan Neville.Explore more on these topicsMusic booksBiography booksPaul McCartneyThe BeatlesAutobiography and memoirnewsShareReuse this content"

But all the information is old and it’s so padded out it’s the TV equivalent of a Zoom call that could have been an emailHannah J DaviesWed 26 Feb 2025 11.46 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 11.49 ESTShareWho is Satoshi Nakamoto? It’s a mystery that has vexed the internet since long before crypto went mainstream, via Silicon Valley bros and that weird period where celebrities got really intoNFTs.Finding out the identity of the person who designed bitcoin – the decentralised, multitrillion-dollar currency – would be a big (and potentially dangerous) deal. Think WikiLeaks, if Julian Assange was also a potential kidnapping target with a handsome digital ransom fee. It is also – you may be unsurprised to hear – a mystery that this digital two-parter from Channel 4 does not get to the bottom of. At the outset, its journalist host,Gabriel Gatehouse(known for the BBC’s Trump podcast,The Coming Storm), warns viewers that: “The film you’re about to watch – in fact, this whole series – consists almost entirely of middle-aged white guys talking about tech”, as their middle-aged, white-guy faces flash up on screen. That wouldn’t be so much of an issue if any of these “cypherpunk” pioneers – or Gatehouse himself – had anything to say that hadn’t already been debunked on Reddit.It’s not the interviewees’ fault. Gatehouse blames a possible omertà code for their silence, but with Satoshi potentially a target for all manner of cartels, criminals and governments, why would any of these computer scientists – namely fellow Briton Adam Back, who ducks and dives away from Gatehouse at a conference in Miami – give anything away? In lieu of revelations, we get anAdam Curtis-inspired visual treatment to distract us – all film noir clips juxtaposed with old cartoons and animations of faceless automatons marching in lockstep.Satoshi isn’t interesting because he invented a new type of money, says Gatehouse, but because of what he was trying todowith it. We don’t exactly nail down what that is, either, but we do get lots of tangents into transhumanism, and theBryan Johnson-esque bros fuelled by gene therapy injections, who want to run countries like private businesses. Manbunned nepo baby Patri Friedman – grandson of Milton, the Nobel prize-winning economist – is one such bro, who thinks humans should live for 80 to 160 years, and says that anyone who thinks otherwise is “advocating for mass murder”. He meets Gatehouse at a libertarian city powered by bitcoin and populated by “international frontier tech entrepreneurs”, off the coast of Honduras. There’s a story about how they got there – via a corrupt, drug-pushing president – that sounds enticing, but it’s one Gatehouse doesn’t dwell on.But hold on – what’s all this got to do with Satoshi? It’s not until halfway through the second episode that we get back to that big mystery: just who is the bitcoin creator, and could Satoshi even be a collective of tech nerds who banded together to further obfuscate their identities? There’s another suspect, Len Sassaman, but – like many of the people mentioned in this series – he’s already dead and, er, was unlikely to have the technical nous to pull it off. The trail runs cold again.Gatehouse seems like a lovely man, and it brings me no pleasure to lay into a show he has clearly laboured over. But Seeking Satoshi is unmistakably thin, the TV equivalent of a Zoom call that could have been an email. At one point, Gatehouse even recruits his mum to give him a pep talk. She, too, seems lovely. But she is not Satoshi. Not only has a lot of this material been raked over by the internet, but unluckily for Gatehouse it was also raked over very recently by HBO. Its bitcoin documentary, Money Electric, wasn’t much better, but it at least illuminated a key question those of us coming to the topic with limited knowledge might appreciate: namely, how does bitcoin actually work? Here, the technical explanations feel tacked on, neglected in lieu of pursuing another reluctant interviewee on a travelator.As the second episode ends, we circle back to that search for immortality, with a visit to a cryonics facility where the frozen head of one of the suspects, Hal Finney – who died in 2014 – is preserved in liquid nitrogen. I was worried that Gatehouse was going to ask to unfreeze Finney for an interview, but thankfully he stopped short of that. Instead, we are treated to another tangent about the wild things the wealthy will do for eternal life. As we close with stock footage of Trump and Elon Musk and a warning that “the future belongs to them” (that is, the cypherpunks, who are also increasingly influential in the world of politics), it feels less of a gripping hunt and more a depressing bump back down to earth.Seeking Satoshi: The MysteryBitcoinCreator is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionBitcoinCryptocurrenciesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a film about families, adoptive families and ersatz families; the director is famously the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola and a cousin to producer Matthew Shire, who is married to the film’s screenwriter Karen Gersten, but this is a film with more than nepo status.Jamie Lee Curtis is forthright and humorous as Shelly’s pal Annette, a former dancer who got out years ago and is now a cocktail waitress with a gambling problem: she has a great, almost semi-hallucinatory setpiece rocking out solo on the casino floor to Bonnie Tyler’s Total Eclipse of the Heart. (Maybe the film should have been all about her.) Dave Bautista is Eddie, the show’s lighting director, a big, gruff guy who can’t easily talk about his feelings for Shelly. Kiernan Shipka and Brenda Song are Jodie and Mary-Ann, two young dancers who are angry and hurt when Shelly rejects the quasi-mom role they insist on creating for her – andJason Schwartzman(another Coppola cousin) plays the cruel director for whom Shelly must humiliatingly audition to get another job.Coppola and cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw create interestingly ruminative outdoor sequences for Shelly, brooding in the harsh sunshine of the Vegas strip in the daylight that doesn’t get let in on the magic – although the big confrontation scenes with Hannah and Eddie are a little contrived, as is their implied final reconciliation. It is a strong turn from Anderson, though, whose fans are entitled to wonder if it is she, and not Demi Moore, who deserves this year’s “comeback queen” crown.The Last Showgirl is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 February and in Australian cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPamela AndersonJamie Lee CurtisJason SchwartzmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it doesn’t even begin to do justice to the astonishing real-life historyLanre BakareArts and culture correspondentWed 26 Feb 2025 09.24 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 09.27 ESTShareFor many people, the story of Black British boxing starts with the disgraceful scenes that took place at Wembley Arena in September 1980.Bottles and racist abuse rained down on Black American boxer Marvin Hagler after beating Alan Minter, a white British fighter. It was an ignominious end to a match whose ugly buildup involved race-based taunts, and which commentator Harry Carpenter described as the “low point of my many years at British ringsides”.That’s theargument made in Four Kings, Prime Video’s recent series which claims that the 1990s – buoyed up by the rivalries and showmanship of Frank Bruno, Lennox Lewis, Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn – was when Black British boxing truly emerged. But the truth is there were Black boxing stars fighting, and winning, in the UK back in the 1890s.A Thousand Blows, Steven Knight’s tale of street crime and bare-knuckle brawls on the streets of London, inhabits that Victorian era. It’s a world of hustlers, pickpockets and pugilists, such as Henry “Sugar” Goodson, a real underworld enforcer, played byStephen Graham. Malachi Kirby plays Hezekiah Moscow, another real-life figure who came to Britain from Jamaica and became a boxing superstar.But Moscow wasn’t an outlier. The fighter – who was also a music-hall singer and a lion tamer at the East London Aquarium – was following in the footsteps of dozens of Black boxers who had found success (and tragedy) in British rings.View image in fullscreenBoxer, singer and lion tamer … Malachi Kirby as Hezekiah Moscow in A Thousand Blows.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney PlusOn the final few pages of Staying Power, Peter Fryer’slandmark history about Black British life in the UK, there is an appendix dedicated to boxers. Many of the stories Fryer tells are remarkable.There’s Bill Richmond, an African American from Staten Island, who was a servant of the Duke of Northumberland during the British occupation of New York, before the nobleman sent him to school in Yorkshire, where he learned to box in “a series of fights with soldiers”. Richmond was constantly getting into scraps: knife-grinders, blacksmiths and brothel-keepers all ended up on the receiving end of “complete millings”, according to Fryer. After several in-ring battles, Richmond became a publican and once trained the essayist William Hazlitt in the noble art. Like many literary figures, from Norman Mailer to Ernest Hemingway, Hazlitt was fascinated by pugilism and one of his most famous essays, The Fight, is all about the illicit thrill of seeking out underground boxing bouts.Another African American (and formerly enslaved man), Tom Molineaux, came to Britain after winning his freedom in a boxing match. His trip was inspired by hearing tales about Richmond, who took him under his wing as his trainer. He had two fights with the British heavyweight Tom Cribb, who dominated the early 19th-century boxing scene.The first of these was a 39-round war of attrition fought outside in driving December rain near East Grinstead. Molineaux ultimately lost when he was (falsely) accused of holding bullets in his hands to increase his punching power after knocking Cribb to the ground. The second was a decisive knockout win for Cribb in the 11th round.Despite losing both bouts, Molineaux’s exploits inspired artwork, poetry and songs.View image in fullscreenThe second fight between Tom Molineaux and Tom Cribb (artist George Cruikshank).Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThe action in A Thousand Blows takes place in London, but in real life, the men fought all over the country. Molineaux drew a crowd of 15,000 in Rutland for his rematch with Cribb; Sam Robinson won fights in the West Yorkshire village of Ferrybridge, but was knocked out near Edinburgh in 1816; and Harry Sutton went on sparring tours around Lancashire and Ireland.The most heralded fighter featured in Fryer’s primer is James Wharton AKA the Moroccan Prince, who was never defeated in the ring. Based in Liverpool, which has the oldest settled Black community in the country and has produceda long line of fighting talent, boxing historian Nat Fleischer wrote that there was “no fighter of his era that was equal to him”.Hezekiah Moscow didn’t make Fryer’s list, which is dominated by US-born fighters rather than those born in the UK or the Caribbean. But thanks tothe meticulous research of the historian Sarah Elizabeth Cox, his story was picked up,first by Stephen Grahamand then by Steven Knight, who made him the hero of A Thousand Blows. Moscow, who was known as Ching Hook, found fame in London, ran businesses and toured music halls, but like many of the other boxers mentioned here, the end of his life isclouded in mystery. Several of these boxing pioneers died penniless.Leith boxer Manuel Abrew.Photograph: BoxrecI came across many fighters while researching my own cultural history of Black Britain,We Were There. While writing a chapter about Edinburgh, I discovered the Abrew family, whose story wascaptured by the film-maker Maureen Blackwood. Based near the docks of Leith, the family’s young men dreamed of becoming engineers on the ships that came and went on their very doorstep, but could only find steady employment in the ring. Brothers Manuel and Charlie Abrew (who once sat for celebrated artist Maggi Hambling) both had over 50 fights.But perhaps the most remarkable wasLen Johnson. The son of a Sierra Leonean merchant seaman and a Mancunian woman who worked as a pinafore machinist, Johnson was trained by his father and fought as a middleweight. By the late 1920s, the press had dubbed him the “uncrowned champion” because, despite his skill, he was barred from fighting for a title because of a “colour bar” rule imposed in 1911 by the British Boxing Board of Control.View image in fullscreenThe ‘uncrowned champion’ … Len Johnson, photographed in 1926.Photograph: Brooke/Getty ImagesJohnson would fight a successful campaign against the colour bar at pubs in Manchester and became a communist who attended the 1945 Pan African Congress in the same city. (Johnson wasn’t the only Black Briton denied a chance at a title shot because of his race; Peter Banasko from Liverpool was also thwarted by the legislation, which was only lifted in 1948.) There is a campaign to havea statue of him erected in Manchester.The history that A Thousand Blows and Peter Fryer shed light on is vital. These pre-Windrush stories of in-ring exploits date back to the reign of George III and force us to rethink our idea of when Black British history begins. WhenAnthony Joshua and Daniel Duboismake their ring walks, orNicola AdamsandNatasha Jonasmade theirs, it was in these footsteps that they followed, not just the big hitters of the 1990s. More than tales of sporting prowess and uppercuts, the likes of Hezekiah Moscow show another quality those earlier Black Britons needed to survive – the one that gave Fryer the title of his book: Staying Power.A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ nowWe Were There: How Black Culture, Resistance and Community Shaped Modern Britain by Lanre Bakareis published by Vintage (£22).

However, I now have to admit that the right clothes for the right weather can bring a freedom. Enter: the humble anorak.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I spent my 20s dreading winters, which I spent freezing, only thawing out come summer. Even then, a light July sprinkling might have stopped me in my tracks, so opposed was I to clothes that made concessions for meteorological conditions. But with adulthood came an admission that anoraks are low-key amazing. I bought one and – by keeping me dry and therefore warmer – it has, without hyperbole, changed my life.But not all anoraks are created equal. Some are designed for the kind of conditions you might meet on an Icelandic fishing trawler, while others barely stand up to a summer drizzle. Some don’t seem to consider aesthetics at all, but others can keep their wearer dry without making them look as if they’re going on a log flume.I’m now the proud owner of two anoraks, and often mix and match with my partner’s, depending on the occasion and type of rain with which I’m faced. Sometimes, I’ll wear an oversized raincoat over my smarterwool coat, and shed a layer as I reach my destination. Other times I wear one overa Uniqlo puffer jacket– a vital winter layer, in my book – and cycle, without feeling weighed down by wool and sweat.The best women’s raincoats for 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zorica Nastasic/Getty ImagesBest all-rounder:Rains long jacketView image in fullscreen£95 at Rains£78 at John LewisWhen it comes to wet-weather gear, Scandinavian brand Rains knows what it’s doing (the clue is in the name). This is one of the brands I reach for whenever the weather takes a turn; its long jacket has seen me through countless soggy commutes, playground trips and walks in the woods. After a muddy walk, it’s happily machine-washable – despite having been washed several times over the years, mine is still going strong(use a guppy bagwhen washing to help prevent the shedding of microfibres into the waterways). I’m a fan of the unisex cut, but if you prefer something a bit more sculpted, thenan anorak with an A-line silhouette may be preferable.It also comes in a shorter style, but I find the longer length more practical. Having said that, I often find myself with sodden legs, as rain seems to be expelled from the anorak and drip violently down on to my knees. Maybe next winter I’ll go for one of itswaterproof all-in-ones. A cape –particularly in tinfoil silver– is tempting for cycling.Best for a minimal look:Uniqlo Blocktech parkaView image in fullscreen£59.90 at UniqloIf you prefer your raincoat to be minimal – melting into the background rather than bringing main-character energy – then this parka may be for you. It looks like something Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy might have worn on the streets of Manhattan in the 90s, which is no bad thing. Available in black, beige, khaki and blue, the black and beige in particular channel low-key cool. Be warned, though, that this coat won’t stand up to more than a shower: opt for something less Kennedy-chic if you’re expecting heavy rain.Best for torrential rain:Stutterheim Stockholm raincoatView image in fullscreenFrom £125 at StutterheimMy partner has one of these sturdy garments from the Stockholm-based brand Stutterheim. The texture of the fabric is less like a traditional anorak and more like the tough skin of a dogfish – more hardy than any other waterproof I’ve come across. It somehow still manages to look desirable, thanks to the Scandi design sensibilities that have gone into it. As the label reads: “Swedish melancholy at its driest.”Despite the underarm eyelets, it won’t be the best for strenuous activity – the heavy material would make an uphill cycle hot and sweaty work. There is amore lightweight version, which is less fit for the Atlantic and more apt for spring. There are a rare few colours here, such aspeach, that fall outside the usual black, blue, khaki and yellow – and several colours currently have between 30% and 50% off, which is welcome on the cost of a £250 jacket.Read our guide onhow to choose a waterproof jacketfor more advice on prices, features and fabricsBest value for money:Mac in a Sac Origin packable waterproof jacketView image in fullscreen£37.50 at Mac in a Sac£37.50 at John LewisMac in a sac, cag in a bag – whatever you want to call it, this pack-it-down-tight-and-pop-it-in-your-schoolbag anorak will be well known to any child of the 90s. Decades later and it’s still going strong – as close to an icon as you can get in the wet-weather space – the Spice Girls of anoraks.It’s also reasonably priced, weighs about the same as a punnet of strawberries and comes in an array of colours – neon blue, pink, orange, yellow and green; pink, soft orange and violet; classic black, navy and charcoal. The elasticated cuffs will help keep out rain, as will the adjustable hood, which can be pulled tight over your head for that particularly grim sideways kind of rain.Best fashion-forward style:Regatta Bayletta waterproof jacketView image in fullscreenFrom £23.95 at RegattaFrom £27.49 at DecathlonThere was a time when the words anorak and fashion wouldn’t be found dead in a sentence together, but times have changed. As ever, the dial has been pushed by one Mrs Prada, who sent a very Duke of Edinburgh-looking yellow raincoat down her spring/summer 2025 catwalk. The key is what you wear it with, however, so pair it with a cocktail dress – and definitely opt for the yellow – if you want to be true to Miuccia’s intentions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Orthis classic Barbour waterproof trenchcoat, which is inspired by men’s tailoring but has a drawcord at the waist so that you can cinch it in or not depending on your mood. It’s not cheap, but the ubiquity of vintage Barbour jackets in good condition speaks to their hard-wearing nature. Could this be the raincoat to keep you dry in style for years to come?Best for the office:Community Clothing Frances raincoatView image in fullscreen£199 at Community ClothingIf it’s a rainy day but you still need to look professional, Community Clothing’s belted raglan raincoat is the one for you. It doesn’t look out of place heading through the swivel doors of an office. Made from British Millerain (waxed) cotton, with a viscose lining, this coat is cut and sewn in Blackburn: with 137 rainy days a year, the town knows its way around a downpour. And while it’s probably no match for the heaviest rain, team it with a brolley and it should keep you dry on an otherwise soggy commute. It’s not cheap, but it’s well-made – and comes in smart black, navy and olive green.Best fordurability:Patagonia Boulder Fork rain jacketView image in fullscreenFrom £150 at Patagonia£150 at Cotswold OutdoorOutdoor gear specialist Patagonia offers DIY repair guides and a repair service via its website. Its Boulder Fork rain jacket isn’t cheap, but it’s built to be durable – and several of the colours are now on sale.It’s eminently practical. The hood comes with a laminated visor, which sounds extreme, but I can see it being useful up a mountain – or at the bus stop. In fact, there are lots of clever design features on this jacket, such as a front pocket complete with a watertight zipper – perfect for your phone or bus pass. Patagonia iswell regarded for its ethics, too.Best for ‘a chance of showers’:Muji water‐repellent hooded coatView image in fullscreen£63.95 at MujiIf you’re after protection from torrential rain, then look away now. This sleek, chic “water-repellent” hooded coat from Muji is an easy, pragmatic layer for days when it might rain, and you don’t want to wear a full-on anorak. Simple and stylish, this would work just as well for work as it would on the weekend – plus, it’s minimal enough design-wise that it won’t clash with almost any outfit. For a practical layer that feels likely to enter your outerwear rotation beyond rainy days, this coat feels like good value.Best to stash in your bag:Finisterre Rainbird waterproof jacketView image in fullscreen£135 at FinisterreThis lightweight waterproof jacket weighs just 300g and packs down small – perfect to ram into your bag just in case. This is advertised as a men’s jacket, but there’s something about the cut of some women’s anoraks that I find a bit old-fashioned. Size up in a men’s cut and this should fit over whatever else you have on as an extra waterproof layer. Some colours are on offer – although with several sizes sold out or low in stock, act fast if you want to nab one.Best sustainable option:Rapanui Raindrift raincoatView image in fullscreen£75 at RapanuiWhile most raincoats are made from some kind of plastic, this organic cotton, plastic-free option is worth considering. It might not cut it in driving winter rain, but it could hold its own against a spring shower. It’s coated with a PFC-free, water-resistant layer and comes in lavender grey and stone. The boxy cut should fit a chunky jumper underneath it, too.Explore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterWomen's coats and jacketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A lot are quite introverted and they have to walk out and be analysed by the world.”Getting ready is a team effort, involving stylists, hairdressers and makeup artists. It often starts weeks in advance, with mood boards, fittings, revision and posing practice. So what is the ordeal like? And could someone like me – who has never been on a red carpet – find a way to dazzle in front of the cameras?The outfitClothes are the starting point. Publicists help stars find the perfect stylist – someone whom ideally they will work with time and time again. “Some clients are really into fashion,” Eastabrook says. “With others, the joy of having a stylist is that someone else tells them what to wear.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTwo of my red-carpet looks: gold gown by Edeline Lee; green dress by Self Portrait, rented from Rites. Photographs: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAmelia Dimoldenberg, a red-carpet correspondent and the creator of the YouTube seriesChicken Shop Date, is in the former camp. “Red carpets are an amazing opportunity to showcase fashion, to express yourself,” she says.For the biggest red-carpet events, conversations about what to wear can start many weeks in advance. Where should I begin? “Exchanging references is super-helpful,” says the stylist Lauren Anne Groves, who has dressed the singer Raye for the Brits. “She’d send me references of Elizabeth Taylor, jazz singers, Marilyn Monroe.” Groves then researches designers for custom looks or couture loans and hunts for vintage pieces.A lot depends on the star’s style – what will help them feel comfortable and beautiful in a high-pressure situation – but there are some classic looks. “I’d probably go for a long gown, rather than a minidress,” says Groves. “The dress needs to feel elegant and sophisticated.” Some stars embrace sheer gowns; others would rather avoid any risk of accidental nudity. “Before any red carpet, we make sure we’ve got the correct knickers, nipple covers, tit tape,” Groves says. Double-sided wig tape is a “life-saver … Put the tape where you want the dress to be placed.”View image in fullscreenSeeking style inspiration. Photograph Linda Nylind/The GuardianI trawl red-carpet galleries and stylists’ Instagrams. I love Rachel Sennott’s velvet gown at the Oscar nominees announcement ceremony, Florence Pugh’s futuristic looks for the 2024 Baftas and Oscars and Raye’s off-the-shoulder dress for last year’s Brits. I send my mood board to the Guardian’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson.She sources a floor-length golden gown byEdeline Lee, a strapless dress with ruffles fromNeedle & Threadand a surprisingly heavy, crystal-encrusted green dress by Self Portrait (rented fromRites) that –along with earringsanda ringby Sif Jakobs – make me feel like a Hollywood grande dame. Stars have fittings to tailor their outfits; we clip mine in place to give the illusion of a perfect fit and combat my lack of height (I am a little over 5ft)with massive heels. Thank God I don’t actually have to walk a red carpet in them; there is no risk ofa tumble à la Jennifer Lawrence. Groves says if there are stairs, such as on the Met and Cannes red carpets, you might bear in mind heel height.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLooks I love: Rachel Sennott announcing the 2025 Oscar nominations; Raye at the 2024 Brits.

Some get fake tans, but, recalling orange-legged outings in my teens, I pass.View image in fullscreenFlorence Pugh does futuristic at the 2024 Baftas. Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAGentle facials orred-light therapycan be great, says Eldridge, who has been doing red-carpet makeup for two decades and counts Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet among her regulars. “Don’t do anything drastic. It’s too risky. No heavy-duty chemical peels. No strong acids. No extractions,” she says. “I once did somebody for Bafta – lovely actress; I won’t say who. She had a full chemical peel two days before and every time we put the makeup on it just separated; her skin was so reactive. It took a good few hours to get the makeup to work.”Paul Jones styles hair for A-listers, including Gillian Anderson, Kate Moss and Demi Moore. “Colour your hair if you’ve got grey roots,” he says. But he agrees with Eldridge. “Don’t do anything drastic. Don’t get a fringe cut two days before, because if you hate it you’re going to make life harder for me to hide it!” My hair only contains a handful of greys, but I use a semi-permanent coloured conditioner to catch strays.You want to “reduce puffiness” before applying makeup, says Eldridge. She recommends under-eye masks and metal tools, chilled in the fridge. “With people who have really puffy faces, I get a bowl of ice, let it melt a bit, then dip their whole face in.”I get a metal-balled facial massager to work on my jaw and cheekbones, which feels quite relaxing. Dunking my whole face in ice sounds like torture, but I am prepared to try. It’s … invigorating?View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenYou can reduce puffiness with under-eye masks, metal tools and dunking your face in iced water. Photographs: Linda Nylind/The GuardianMakeupOn the red carpet, you are photographed from all angles, so attention to detail is vital, says Eldridge. “I joke to my clients that we have to look out for the ‘Brians’. That’s what I call the bad paparazzi – the ones who may want a photo where the person doesn’t look great, because they know certain websites are going to love that.”Regular clients share their outfits in advance, so Eldridge can plan makeup looks. With new clients, she collects every photo of them she can find, to see what worked and what didn’t.Applying a thick layer of powder to combat shine doesn’t work for the red carpet. You’re going to look really dryShe advises I do the same. “Look at pictures of yourself through the years and see what was a good look. That’s not to say you’ve got to copy it, but maybe you looked really good in a strong lip, so that’s a good starting point.”A red lip and eyeliner flick have served me well in the past, so I decide to recreate some old Hollywood glamour. Eldridge sends a box of makeup to help. The ideal order is: eyes, skin then lips. For the eyes, “make sure there’s enough definition” and be careful with false lashes, which can “weigh your eyes down”. I follow Eldridge’sYouTube tutorials, layering eyeshadow, sparkle and liquid eyeliner.Skin comes next. I have a shiny complexion, so keeping that under control is my main concern. Eldridge advises avoiding too many products: “The makeup just won’t last as long. But make sure you’re well moisturised.” Then apply powder as late as possible, using a thin layer and dusting off any excess, to avoid cakey buildup. She never does “baking” – the technique of applying a thick layer of powder to combat shine. “It just doesn’t work for red carpet,” she says. “Photography is high-definition; you’re going to look really dry.”View image in fullscreenPainting my nails in nude. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFor foundation, Eldridge recommends thin layers, “so that each is completely fused to the skin”. Red-carpet outfits often show off the shoulders, back or chest: “Time and again, I’ve seen pictures of people with very pale backs with orange faces. I’m so paranoid about matching the skin.” I apply a thin layer of Eldridge’s foundation to my face. It’s boiling hot in the photography studio and my ears are turning pink – I quickly paint them to match my face.Under paparazzi flashes, “too little makeup is almost as bad as too much. Not enough blush and you can start looking really washed out. Blush should match your lip undertone. I feel sick when I see someone in a blue-toned lip and an orange cheek,” Eldridge says.I have a selection of her lipsticks and pencils to try. I settle on the shade Velvet Ribbon, a bright red that I pray matches my blush. “You need a nice, full lip. I always overdraw the lip,” Eldridge says. She recommends stepping farther away from the mirror to check that the shape of your eyes and lips are symmetrical – it’s easy to draw a wonky lip line –and the edges of your blush and contour are blended. “Take pictures; see how it looks with a flash,” she says. “Check every angle. If it looks good in a magnifying glass, it will look good on the red carpet.”HairView image in fullscreenCollecting photos of celebrity hairstyles can helpJones also collects photos of stars, so he can ask which past hairstyles they loved and which products work for them. “They have lived with their hair – they’re going to know best,” he says. He gives most clients a leave-in hair mask on the day, especially if the style involves high heat. “It’s great for the condition of the hair and makes it look super-shiny.”Red carpets are often outside, so weather must be considered. “If it’s hot and they want it down, use extra product to stop the humidity getting to the hair,” Jones says. “A good tip is hairspray and heat. If you use hairspray, then put the hairdryer on it afterwards. It goes really hard and locks in the style.” He recommends Got2Be Glued hairspray, which I buy promptly. “I won’t use it on hair down, because it can look a bit dry, but if I need it up and to not move, that’s what I’ll do.”To recreate red-carpet styles, Jones suggests following YouTube tutorials or looking at stylists’ Instagram accounts. “Use products to give it a lot of gloss and shine,” he says. “Have the right tools to do what you want to achieve. Doing it from wet, take about 90% of the moisture out before you start to style.”To match my makeup, I aim for waves in the style of Elizabeth Taylor. I use a conditioning mask and put rollers in my hair when it’s almost dry, then blast it with heat and hairspray. In the studio, I add extra curls with straighteners – and apply even more hairspray.PosingWho teaches stars how to pose on the red carpet?Paul Mescal revealedthat Andrew Scott was his mentor: “Andrew was like … rock back on to your left foot and you kind of just lean back.”“It’s a performance – that’s what everyone tells me,” says Dimoldenberg. “Approach it from that angle. You’ve got to turn it on and maybe be a bit of your alter ego.” I have been told I have an unapproachable poker face, so I lean into an ice-queen persona. The photographer, Linda Nylind, keeps trying to make me smile, but I do my best to resist.Men often go for hands over their private parts like a footballer. Don’t do that“Practise your pose in the mirror, in your outfit, before you leave for the carpet, because different outfits require different poses. Like, should you stick your leg out? Should you have your hand on your hip?” Dimoldenberg says. “It’s so daunting. Sometimes I’m like: killed it, slayed. Then sometimes I’m like: oh God, I look like a stiff little beanpole.”Groves agrees: “In the fitting, I’ll take pictures, then we’ll see how it looks. There’s not just one camera in front of you, they’re everywhere, so it’s always good to practise.”Men often go for hands “over their private parts like a footballer … Don’t do that,” Eastabrook says. “Have hands by your sides or behind you.” Posture is crucial, says Groves: “Rest your hands on your hips so your shoulders naturally go back.”View image in fullscreen‘Different outfits require different poses.’ Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianLike Dimoldenberg, I am worried about looking stiff, so I practise at home and again in the studio mirror. It’s surprisingly helpful. When it’s time to strike a pose, I feel less like a robot.InterviewsThe carpet isn’t all about posing – there are interviews, too. The best (and worst) could go viral. “Don’t chew gum!” says Eastabrook. “Have answers to things like: what was your favourite film this year? It’s embarrassing if you get asked and you can’t think of anyone in the category.” I decide I am rooting for Anora in every Oscars category and Little Simz and Fontaines DC at the Brits.Dimoldenberg is returning as an official Oscars red-carpet correspondent this year. Stars often get asked the same things, so she prepares fun questions she hopes they haven’t heard before. “Because there’s so many things at play, people get super-super-nervous,” she says. “A great red-carpet interviewee is someone with a sense of humour – that goes a long way, especially with my style of interviewing.”Oscars 2024: the red carpet – in picturesRead moreAtlast year’s Oscars, she asked Lawrence for “tips for nominees to not fall up the stairs” and played rock, paper, scissors with Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. “People really appreciate a non-media-trained answer,” she says. “Say something you would say to your friends, rather than the usual thing you’ve said a million times.”And remember that, even between interviews, you’re on camera, Eastbrook says. “Don’t do anything that you wouldn’t want to be on BBC News.”The afterpartyGetting glammed up and modelling dresses is fun. Trying to coordinate your face and limbs, while balancing in stilettos, remembering a multitude of nominees and appearing relaxed and relatable is more stressful. I reckon I can achieve a new level of glamour at the next industry awards or wedding I attend, but I can see why stars have a whole team to help. As I arrive home, I realise (sorry, Lisa) I forgot to put on any mascara.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In March 2023, my Transit van was stolen along with a number of possessions while I was working in a refugee camp.This was extremely stressful to come home to and things got worse because my insurer rejected my claim because I had been using it as a camper van at weekends. In the letter cancelling the policy it said I’d failed to tell it about “modifications” I’d made.I complained to the Financial Ombudsman but without success. As far as I’m concerned it was naive to throw a mattress and some camping gear in the back, not malicious.Then, in October 2024, my motorcycle insurance was automatically renewed, only to be cancelled two weeks later due to the van issue. I have since contacted multiple bike insurers only to be told there is no way I will be able to get cover again.I have been driving for 38 years. I have never had an accident and have no convictions.How can a man who used his van to sleep in on occasional weekends and put a few things in the back to make it more comfortable be left in a position where he can no longer get insurance?DF, LlangollenBroken gadget puts John Lewis two-year promise on electrical to the testRead moreThe letter you received when your van insurance was cancelled made clear that you had to advise any current or future insurer what had happened and “failure to do so may result in future policies being declared void”. You are frequently out of the country and this is what happened when you let your bike cover renew without flagging it.Sprucing up a van for weekends away seems harmless but, as you have discovered, if you don’t tell your insurer it can invalidate your policy. The argument is that adding any mod cons changes the vehicle’s value and might make it more attractive to thieves (your alterations included a kitchen, heater and solar panels). Had the insurer known, it might have upped the premium or pulled your cover.You had exhausted a lot of the options, including hiring lawyers to challenge the van insurer’s decision, before you came to me. I contacted the BritishInsuranceBrokers’ Association (BIBA) and through its “find insurance” service identified a broker able to help you. I passed the details to you and you’ve secured new motorbike insurance at a similar price.“Anyone who has had a policy cancelled may find it more challenging to find insurance from standard online routes, but specialist brokers often have access to niche markets that may be able to help,” says Graeme Trudgill, the chief executive of BIBA.Explore more on these topicsCar insuranceConsumer championsInsuranceMotoringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Seven thousand graffiti artists spraypainted nearly 2 miles (3km) of fabric, which was draped and swagged over the catwalk and seats of a concrete show space in Milan, transforming it into a rainbow-coloured, ballroom-sized skate park.View image in fullscreen‘Impossibly low’ bumster jeans.Photograph: Alessandro Garofalo/ReutersModels wore contact lenses that turned their eyeballs white, like horror-film dolls, or had clown smiles crayoned on to their faces. Hooded puffer jackets and corsets came with bumster jeans so impossibly low that they were fitted with adjustable internal underwear to hold them up, or tiny shorts that would make Daisy Duke blush.Five years ago, Diesel had fallen off fashion’s radar. The people who wore Diesel’s low-rise jeans to go clubbing in the 2000s were no longer going clubbing, nor wearing cutting-edge denim. Every new generation wants going-out jeans but no generation wants the same going-out jeans that their parents wore.The designer Glenn Martens, who arrived in 2020, has performed a remarkable turnaround, connecting the brand with generation Z consumers who love his oversized silhouettes and vintage washes.The power of denim in fashion is that it is democratic and sexy, two attributes that Martens has leaned into. He has collaborated with Durex to make Diesel-branded condoms – 200,000 of which formed the backdrop to a Milan catwalk show – and staged 12-hour raves for thousands of people in Rome and London, in partnership with the online radio station NTS. Shoppers aged 16-25 now make up 36% of Diesel sales.On the back of his Diesel success, Martens has become fashion’s breakout design star of 2025. He will graduate from denim to haute couture as the new creative director of Maison Margiela, the house founded by the avant garde designer Martin Margiela and more recently directed by John Galliano. Maison Margiela, the most cutting-edge couture house in Paris, will give Martens scope to elevate his iconoclastic fashion ideas to the highest level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why the quest for perfection could be ruining your holiday – and your relationshipsTomas Telegramma’s endless quest to optimise his holiday was doing the opposite. Here’s how he learned to put down the to-do list and love uncertaintyTomas TelegrammaWed 26 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 20.24 ESTShareRome. Late summer. The crowds aren’t easing, nor is the sun, and it’s about to sear a hole in my relationship. Hot, hangry and hungover – a diabolical combination – we’re our own kind of ancient ruins, skulking aimlessly in what feels like a black hole: an area nowhere near any of the 50-odd places I’ve saved on Google Maps for our four-day stay.A bakery appears. Then a panini bar. Then a trattoria. Then another. We don’t stop. Instead I feverishly research them online for any signs of superiority. None were pre-approved on my months-long mission to compile the ultimate Rome hitlist, cross-referencing recommendations from friends with what I had found online.Not one review is screaming “molto delizioso” and my patience with myself wanes, far sooner than my girlfriend’s. Our final destination is one of desperation: a chain supermarket where we buy cherry tomatoes (insipid), mozzarella (waterlogged) and bread (surely yesterday’s) for a 4pm panini lunch at the Airbnb.My girlfriend, who was happy with the first bakery, eats in silence. I lament breaking my “no bad meals” rule so early in our holiday and start mapping out a solid plan for the next day.If you don’t see yourself in me, a genuine congratulations. If you do, commiserations.Am I turning the heavenly holiday I’ve been pining for into a living hell of my own creation?As Type A travellers, we might think we’ve reached peak planning. But there’s always another mountain. Despite living in the post-wanderlust era, aspirational travel content is increasingly inescapable, with suggestions for what to eat, drink, do and see bombarding us from all sides of the internet. So it doesn’t take much to buy into the more-is-more mentality, looking to emulate the endless highlights reels on social media and believing you really can’t go to [insert city] without visiting [insert viral food spot]. I imagine those wired like me, who grew up in the Lonely Planet heyday, had a similarly toxic dependence, not on their smartphone but on their brick-sized travel bible.Coming in to the air-con after inhaling that self-made panino – almost certainly inferior to those sold at the countless eateries we bypassed along the way – it gets me thinking: is the never-ending quest to better my holiday actually making it worse?View image in fullscreen‘I swear the algorithm knew I was going to Rome before I did.’Photograph: Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesDoes arriving in a new place with more pins dropped than total days away make for a higher stakes to-do list than if I stayed at work? Am I turning the heavenly holiday I’ve been pining for into a living hell of my own creation?When things go well, the answer is no. There’s nothing more vindicating than when an overseas restaurant you’ve set an alarm in the middle of the night to book exceeds your expectations, or a street-food vendor you’ve queued an hour for is worth the hype.But when things inevitably go south? That’s another story. My cousins will never let me live down a day in New York when I made them schlep from the Lower East Side to the Upper East Side, on foot, to a diner supposedly revered for its cheesecake, which, as it turned out, was a rubbery, extortionately priced doorstop with strong notes of fridge.How I learned to travel without depending on my iPhone | Sarah DittmoreRead moreI blame my TikTok “For You” page – I swear the algorithm knew I was going to Rome before I did – for this new frontier of being over-informed to the point of over-planning.It wasn’t always this way. Some of the most memorable travel experiences I’ve had have been completely spontaneous: life-altering bún chả on a roadside in Hanoi, knock-your-socks-off Thai (both in spice and spectacularity) in a suburban strip mall in Los Angeles and a tagine for the ages at a random rooftop deep in the medina of Fez, Morocco.Seeking to recapture that magic changed everything on the aforementioned Italy trip. The tyrannical tour leader (me) retired and a truly extraordinary week in Tuscany ensued.Following our noses – not my notes – led us to the kind of hidden hilltop restaurant that epicurean dreams are made of, and we somehow weaselled a walk-in table. But also to a god-awful osteria where each dish managed to resemble genitalia. Instead of it landing as an epic fail though, it was one of the funniest nights of my life.So if I’ve learned anything as a recovering Type A traveller it’s do less. Take a punt. Live in the moment. And don’t let a subpar sandwich ruin your day. Or your relationship.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleItaly holidaysNew York holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I saw it as liberatingWhen my rheumatoid arthritis became more aggressive, I clung to the idea of still being a ‘walking person’. Letting go of that gave me more freedom than I could have imaginedJulia KellyWed 26 Feb 2025 01.55 ESTShareIt started like any normal day – or normal for us, at least. My partner, Stewart, helped me out of bed and on to the wheeled office chair I kept next to it. Then I propelled myself to the top of the stairs before leaning precariously on my crutches as I made my way down, slowly and dangerously, with lots of swearing at the pain (I find it helps). Then, on the way out to the car, I missed my footing and fell.Not for the first time, Stewart was caught between concern and frustration. Wasn’t it time, he asked, for me to consider using a wheelchair? Once again, I rejected the suggestion.I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in my 20s, but, after an aggressive flare-up, it disappeared. However, in 2005, when I was 37, it returned, worse than before. Over the following years, movement and mobility became more and more painful and challenging, but I was determined to stay on my feet – to still be a “walking person”. I clungto an illusion of mobility and the person I had always been.But, slowly, walking unaided became impossible. I used crutches and leaned on them so heavily that I developed lasting problems with my elbows and shoulders, as well as significant pain and exhaustion. Eventually, the only walking I did was from the car to my desk at school, where I worked as an A-level English teacher, and back again.The morning after my fall, the truth of what Stewart had been saying hit me: trying to stay on my feet was disabling me further. My perspective shifted and I admitted what felt, at the time, like defeat. At 46, I decided to get a wheelchair.View image in fullscreenJulia Kelly, pictured with her son Calum in 2004, a year before the rheumatoid arthritis returned.Photograph: Julia KellyThe moment I saw it, I hated the wheelchair. I hated its clinical, clunky appearance and, in an unexpected blow to my vanity, I hated how I looked in it. Suddenly, having been tall (5ft 10in), here I was, sitting at the height of most people’s crotches. My hips and bum began to widen from sitting down all the time and I gained weight as a result of my lack of movement. I felt deeply unattractive and unsexy. Rheumatoid arthritis twisted and changed my body – my arms no longer straightened, my hands became severely disfigured, my knees locked at 90 degrees. Every single joint had become stiff and painful, meaning that I moved in a way that looked unnatural, too.Suddenly, having been tall, here I was, a ‘disabled person’, sitting at the height of most people’s crotchesThe first outing Stewart and I made with me in my wheelchair was, to my surprise, quite wonderful. We went to Hay-on-Wye, where I went from bookshop to bookshop without painfully leaning on crutches; I sat in a cafe without worrying about how I was going to stand up afterwards. In short, it felt like freedom. Initially, I was hopeless at manoeuvring the chair, careering down shallow ramps and into walls, unable to navigate kerbs. But, gradually, I developed the skills I needed to go out with my children, or go on holiday, and started doing both much more than I was able to during the years of trying to stay on my feet.Being more visibly disabled has had other silver linings, too. People are kind. Although not every disabled person appreciates being offered help, I am never offended and it often feels as if I am seeing the very best of human nature. It makes me think of Danusha Laméris’s poemSmall Kindnesses, in which she calls these moments “the true dwelling of the holy, these / fleeting temples we make together”.Everything I do still takes an age – putting on makeup, tidying my desk, making something simple to eat – but I have developed a dogged determination to complete even simple tasks, a spirit of perseverance that I may never have otherwise known. I have become more committed, more focused on the things that matter in my life: my family and friends, writing and getting out into the countryside.A moment that changed me: I took my husband for granted – until I met three single women at a partyRead moreDuring the early days, when I hated the wheelchair, I would look at it by my bed and see it as a stark reminder of what I had lost. I would feel terrible grief and anger. Now, when I look at it, I see the imprint of myself on it, how its shape has adapted to me, and mine to it, and I feel a greater acceptance: it is a part of me now. I give its form function, and it gives me a life I thought I had lost. We live in a sort of symbiosis.Of course, I long to walk and dance and, as in a recurring dream I have, to run, but I am learning to live with my disability. Using a wheelchair can be challenging, but it has also proved hugely liberating; together, it feels as if we are on the brink of a whole new adventure.The Fisherman’s Gift by Julia Kelly is published on 6 March (Harvill Secker, £16.99).

Clearly I wasn’t alone, because Swiss public health experts were later forcedto issue reassurance– thankfully, the only risk here is overindulgence.Prep10 minCook15 minServes4320g emmental, or similar (see step 1)480ggruyère, or similar¼ reblochon(about 150g), or similar1 garlic clove, peeled and very finely chopped (see step 5)300ml high-acid white wine(see step 6)2 tsp kirsch(optional)Nutmeg, to grate to taste, or a pinch of cayenne pepperBaguette, or stale bread, cubed, to serveBoiled potatoes, to serve (optional)Cornichons and pickled onions, to serve (optional)Charcuterie, to serve (optional)Green salad, to serve (optional)1 A note on the cheese …In the course of testing this recipe, I went through a number of different cheeses, and while the combination above is my favourite – emmental for its melting properties, gruyère for its nutty flavour and reblochon, now sold in some supermarkets and all good cheesemongers, for its creaminess – feel free to vary it according to availability and budget.View image in fullscreen2 … and on the right mix of cheeseThe only tricky thing about fondue, apart from gluttony, is preventing it from splitting, which is more likely if you use only hard cheeses such as gruyere (or beaufort, comté or abondance) that have a low moisture content. To make life easier for yourself, I’d suggest including something younger such as emmental or edam in the mix, too.3 … and on the creamy cheeseI also like to add a creamy cheese – taleggio, raclette, port salut, brie or even, dare I say it, cheese triangles are all options, but you may prefer to ring the changes with blue cheese, goat’s cheese or even a flavoured cheese, or simply use only equal parts of gruyère and emmental if you prefer.View image in fullscreen4 Prepare the cheeseTrim off anddiscardthe rinds from the hard cheeses (they’re not poisonous, but they won’t add anything to the flavour of your fondue), then coarsely grate the cheeses. Please avoid those tempting bags of ready-grated cheese, though, because their starchy, anti-clump coating will give your fondue an unpleasantly floury consistency. Cut off and discard the skin of the reblochon and chop the rest into cubes.5 A note on the garlicTraditionally, a cut garlic clove is wiped around the insides of the fondue pot, but because I make mine in a pan and transfer it to a bowl, I prefer to add the garlic to the cheese mix (if you’re using a bespoke fondue pot, however, you may wish to revert to the old way). Put the minced garlic in a deep, heavy-based saucepan.View image in fullscreen6 Add the wineAdd the wine to the pot – traditional Swiss and Savoie whites aren’t that widely stocked in the UK, so if need be go for a high-acid and fairly fruity alternative, because, somewhat counterintuitively, the acids in the wine will help stabilise the emulsion of melted cheeses and help to prevent them separating. Picpoul de pinet, riesling or muscadet are all good bets.View image in fullscreen7 Now melt the cheeseSet the pan over a very low heat (ideally, with a heat diffuser underneath, if you have one) and bring the wine to a simmer. Gradually add the emmental or melting cheese a little at a time, whisking or stirring vigorously and leaving it to melt fully before adding more. Repeat with the gruyère, followed by the reblochon. Keep stirring until the mix is very smooth.View image in fullscreen8 Add the remaining flavouringsStir in the kirsch, if using (some recipes prefer herbal liqueurs such asgénépi), followed by a good grating of nutmeg, or a pinch of cayenne pepper, if you prefer. Transfer the cheese mix to a fondue set, a heatproof bowl set over tea lights or a slow cooker – anything that will keep the fondue warm and liquid for the time it takes you to eat it.View image in fullscreen9 And, finally, the accompanimentsAt their simplest, cheese fondues are served simply with cubes of baguette or slightly stale bread for dipping (a fork works well if you don’t have a fondue set), but I’d recommend also supplying small boiled potatoes (skin-on) and a selection of cornichons and pickled onions, some charcuterie and a green salad alongside. Plus the remaining wine, naturally.Explore more on these topicsCheeseFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodStarterMain courseFrench food and drinkWinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was not allowed to sleep or eat or drink. They tied my arms to the chair very painfully and when they were beating me they would put their hands or legs on my chest to bend my back.After about a month I was transferred to Ofer camp in Ramallah. The whole transfer process was one of the worst things I remember. When you first go into a new prison, as someone from Gaza, you are subjected to a special campaign of torture and humiliation. That day there were four of us doctors – and none of us are young men and it was hard to bear it.Frankly, no matter how long I talk about what I experienced in detention, it is only a fraction of what truly happened. I am talking about being clubbed, being beaten with rifle butts and being attacked by dogs.At night I was put back in my cell but they don’t let you sleep ever; the air conditioner is on and they don’t turn the lights off. There are cameras in the cell filming you. It is terrifying. All night you hear the voices of people around you screaming.I saw people who were dying there. Every day is a humiliation, every day is degradation.DrIssam Abu Ajwasketch of an older bearded manIn detention you would have to sleep on the floor which they covered with small, sharp rocks with your hands and legs tied and your eyes blindfolded. They would pour cold water on you and put fans on and bring powerful air conditioners. They would play loud music 24 hours a day.In interrogations it would be dark and my hands and feet would be bound. They made me stand on my tiptoes for two or three hours and [would] then throw me to the floor and spray me with water. Then three or four guards would beat me.View image in fullscreenDr Issam Abu Ajwa before and after detentionComposite: Getty/HandoutAfter months in detention, they transferred me to Negev prison in the desert. It was summer and very hot. They locked us inside tents. We had to ask for permission to use the bathroom, but the sick weren’t allowed to go and were told to soil themselves.We contracted scabies because we hadn’t washed or changed our clothes in six months. Your body felt like it was burning, but they wouldn’t give us treatment.We could only drink hot water from the pipes once a day. We didn’t have shoes and they would make us stand on the asphalt with bare feet for two or three hours in 37C [99F] heat. The food was just yoghurt and a bit of rice. I lost half my body weight. They never charged me with anything and I didn’t get to see a lawyer during seven months of imprisonment.DrKhaled Serrsketch of a middle-aged manOn 25 March we were in Nasser hospital, which had seen severe destruction after attacks by the Israeli army, when they stormed the hospital. They ordered us to evacuate through loudspeakers mounted on drones. We left the hospital, where Israeli armoured vehicles and soldiers were stationed pointing their rifles and tank cannons at us.We were ordered to completely remove our clothes and were then taken in a line to a pit that had been prepared in advance next to the hospital. All the medical staff were put in the pit [then] we were thrown into a military vehicle and taken across the border from the Gaza Strip into Israel.Throughout this period, while we were being transferred, we were given severe, brutal beatings all over our bodies. I suffered bone fractures on my right side, which affected me greatly all the way through the first three or four months of detention. I never got any medical care.After two or three hours we arrived at the prison. Our names and numbers were taken and we were led, with our eyes covered and our hands chained with metal handcuffs, into Sde Teiman detention camp.I was taken to an open space surrounded by metal bars, like a warehouse. We were given a mat that was no more than half a centimetre thick and then we had to sit in the same position from 5am until 10pm. It was absolutely forbidden to speak. We were blindfolded the whole time with our hands in metal cuffs.I was in a state of shock, in complete denial of being inside that prison and tried to avoid anything that would mean a punishment. However, on the third day an Israeli prison repression unit stormed the prison with dogs and batons. We were ordered to lie on the ground. If anyone raised their head they would be subjected to severe beating. I was beaten where I lay and heard the screams of prisoners [who had been] singled out. Many suffered permanent disabilities.DrBassam Miqdadsketch of a middle-aged bearded manIn Gaza we are used to war but this time it was different. At the hospital [during the war] you would begin to lose your soul because of the horrors we saw every day. Things that are difficult to describe or put into words because they were so awful. Day after day, the exhaustion and the work increased. I was constantly on the edge of breaking down.I was pulled out of the line at a checkpoint when I was with my family trying to leave Khan Younis, which was under siege. They told me to take off my clothes except my underwear and I left everything else on the ground – my ID, even my socks, and I had to walk barefoot.They asked me my name and my profession and when I said I was a doctor they handcuffed and blindfolded me. I didn’t know what was happening. All around me I could hear people screaming. Then I began to be beaten by a group of soldiers.We were all put in a transport vehicle where we were beaten with sticks. They urinated on us. They used curse words that I can’t bear to repeat. In the transport vehicle you are in a pile, people are lying on top of you. We were all still blindfolded and handcuffed. I was told to jump down and I fell and fractured my ankle but I had to get up and walk with this injury with my back tilted back at 90 degrees.DrMahmoud Abu Shehadasketch of a middle-aged bearded manAll the medical staff were lined up between the administration building and the old Nasser building. They made us take off our clothes. Then we were moved to the maternity building, where they checked our identities. We were handcuffed behind our backs, blindfolded and taken to the ground floor of the building. They humiliated and degraded us and we were subjected to severe beatings. From late Friday night to the early hours of Saturday morning, we were left cold and naked, with cold water thrown on us.Early in the morning at dawn time on the 17th, we were loaded into large, open trucks and transferred to detention facilities [in Israel]. They threw water on us and beat us badly during this transfer.We were later transferred to Ofer camp, which consisted of rooms, each housing 15 to 20 detainees. There, we continued to be beaten and humiliated. Groups of soldiers would enter the room wearing masks. They would take our food and water and throw it outside.I spent almost three months in Ofer. The food they gave us were small pieces of bread with a small amount of yoghurt and a spoon of jam. It was not enough to keep us going.DrSaid Maaroufsketch of a middle-aged bearded manWhen the war started, I kept working. There were many injuries and disease was widespread but there were very few of us doctors. I was at the Kamal Adwan hospital and stayed there until we received orders from the Israeli army to leave the hospital. I left and went to al-Ahli hospital, which was where I was arrested.I was arrested at my hospital along with my son, who is a medical student in the first year of university. Right from the beginning we were tortured. For 45 days I was under great oppression and was starved of food in Sde Teiman detention camp. By this point I was exhausted and sick. They didn’t give us any medical treatment. I lost 25 kilos. I couldn’t stand, eat or move.DrSaleh Eleiwasketch of a young bearded manI was arrested at the Netzarim checkpoint and I was held for a total of 138 days. The first two days were spent at the Sde Teiman camp, after which I was transferred to the Ofer camp where I remained for 130 days.The torture and mistreatment I endured included forced stripping, starvation, solitary confinement and deprivation of basic hygiene rights, such as bathing or changing clothes. We were subjected to daily beatings, denied access to medical treatment and refused necessary medication. Even detainees with chronic illnesses who were taken to see a doctor were often beaten by the doctors themselves. The interrogations were relentless, continuing around the clock.DrAhmad Mhannasketch of a middle-aged manI was taken to a military barracks where I spent 21 days. During this period, they took me to what they called the “Disco” – an interrogation room with deafening music and freezing temperatures. I slept on gravel, wearing only a thin tracksuit. They told me I would be released that day, but instead, I was sent to Naqab prison.There, the humiliation worsened. They insulted my family and my religion. They used to let the dog drink from a bowl of water and then pour the rest over me. I fell to the ground because my legs were shackled. They laughed and kicked me in the side.At one point, they forced me to stand for six hours in the cold, arms raised and shackled, before interrogating me. I told them the same thing every time: “I am a doctor. I do not belong to anything else.”Medical care was nonexistent. If I had a fever at night, they refused to give me a painkiller. Skin diseases were rampant. Fruits and vegetables were almost entirely absent. We were given a quarter of a cucumber or carrot, never more. Every day was a battle against degradation.Testimony taken from a letter to Mhanna’s family dictated to his lawyerIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: “During the fighting in the Gaza Strip, suspects of terrorist activities were arrested. The relevant suspects have been taken for further detention and questioning in Israel. Those who are not involved in terrorist activity are released back to the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.”The IDF said it provided each detainee with suitable clothing, a mattress, regular food and drink, and that they had access to medical care. It also said that handcuffing of detainees was carried out in accordance with IDF policies. It said it was aware of incidents where detainees had died in detention and that investigations were conducted for each of these deaths.“The IDF acts in accordance with Israeli and international law in order to protect the rights of the detainees held in the detention and questioning facilities,” it said.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDoctors in detentionIsraelPalestinian territoriesTortureMiddle East and north AfricaGlobal healthHuman rights (Law)featuresShareReuse this content"

It’s terrible.”Bikes v cars: backlash after Ontario premier threatens to tear up cycling lanes in TorontoRead moreFord, a blunt-spoken, burly populist with a “limestone head” and a knack for politics, sensed opportunity in the devastation. He called a snap election, telling voters he needed the “largest mandate in Ontario history” to combat an existential threat to the province’s economy. The move was derided as opportunism by other party leaders who accused Ford of “answering chaos by creating more chaos”.Despised among progressives for the province’s crumbling healthcare system, underfunded schools anda scandal that could have put billions in the pocket of land developers, Ford has now fashioned himself as “Captain Canada” – even leaving the campaign trail twice to lobby leaders in Washington.Now, as millions of Ontarians prepare to cast their ballot on Thursday for the province’s next leader, the stunning rise of Ford as a dominant political force – not just in Ontario but across the country – has put the 60-year-old populist in uncharted territory.No Ontario leader has ever won three successive majorities, with each one larger than the last. If Ford accomplishes this, it will reflect a unique political acumen which includes empathy and ruthlessness.For years Doug toiled in the shadow of his late brother Rob, whose scandal-ridden tenure as mayor of Toronto was notorious for his use of crack cocaine.When Rob contracted cancer and was unable to continue his mayoral campaign in 2014 it was Doug who ran in his place. He lost, but the bid positioned Doug as the heir to a brash, populist movement that appealed to disaffected suburban voters and affluent, pro-business supporters. AfterRob died in 2016, Doug set his sights higher, and in 2018, after a hard-fought race, he was elected to become Ontario’s premier with a commanding legislative majority.Ford has cultivated a reputation as a leader preoccupied by the daily frustrations of residents. Like Rob, he is famous for handing his phone number out to anyone who asks. During snowstorms, he shovels driveways and helps stranded motorists.“The thing about Doug Ford is that he really cares about people. And I know every politician supposedly says that, right? That’s cliche, but with him, I truly believe it’s sincere – and he wants to do good things and do right by people,” said Fred DeLorey, a senior adviser for the premier’s 2025 election campaign. “I’ve known him as a political opponent and someone I’ve worked with for years and I can honestly say I’ve never seen anyone like him.”Ford’s father, Doug Sr, won a seat in the Ontario legislative assembly in the early 1990s, and the family – who run a lucrative label-making business – became a mainstay of conservative politics.Dave Bidini, the publisher of Toronto’s West End Phoenix newspaper, grew up in Etobicoke, the same Toronto suburb as the Ford family, and says the brothers’ reputation cast a long shadow. “There was a notoriety to a lot of the families in that neighbourhood: a lot of bad behaviour, a lot of wealth, a lot of privilege, lot of early fast cars,” he said.And, according to reporting from the Globe and Mail in 2013, Doug dealt hashish in the 1980s.“Most people didn’t approach Doug looking for product. You went to the guys that he supplied,” one former dealer told the Globe. “Because if Doug didn’t know you and trust you, he wouldn’t even roll down his window.”Ford has repeatedly denied the allegations and his lawyer says the Globe’s reporting is the “height of irresponsible and unprofessional journalism given the gravely serious and specious allegations of substantial criminal conduct”.Early in his tenure as premier, Ford won praise for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, following public health messaging – and at times breaking with other conservative leaders. When a report revealed the “horrific” state of the province’s long-term care homes during the crisis, Ford broke down at a press conference as he demanded accountability.To his critics, however, he governs like a vengeful leader bearing a grudge against Toronto, the city that has never supported him. “People call him a populist but when you look at it, his politics are just so petty and vindictive,” says Bidini.Ford has repeatedly clashed with residents and activists over plans to remove bike lanes from downtown Toronto, plans for a controversial private spa on public lands, a decision to shutter the city’s beloved science centre, and teacher strikes over class sizes.View image in fullscreenDoug Ford at a campaign stop in Milton, Ontario last week.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/Shutterstock“When he was a councillor at city hall, he just caused chaos,” Bidini said. “And I don’t necessarily think that was a strategic move. I just think that that’s just kind of who he is. And you can see that now – a lot of his politics are just trying tosee what he can get away with.”In 2022, Ford found his government embroiled in a deepening scandal over a controversial multibillion-dollarland swapdeal.The plan, which opened 7,400 acres of protected land, dubbed the Greenbelt, for development, would have given windfall profits to developers. The premier eventually reversed course, but the scandal cost him a pair of cabinet ministers, two damning reports from government watchdogs and public outrage.At a somber press conference, Ford said it was “mistake” to allow development in the green belt around Toronto. “I made a promise to you that I wouldn’t touch the green belt. I broke that promise. And for that, I am very, very sorry,” he told reporters. Canada’s federal police are currently investigating the issue, but Ontario’s ethics commissioner cleared Ford of any wrongdoing.Still, Ford has largely resisted the partisan nature of modern politics, breaking with other Conservative premiers and cultivating close friendships with key figures in opposing parties like Chrystia Freeland, then federal finance minister.“Above all, Ford is a pragmatist. He’s clearly intent on achieving and maintaining office. But I do think he has a core commitment to the ‘little guy’ and that really seems to drive a lot of his decisions,” said Andrea Lawlor, an associate professor of political science at McMaster University. The result is a conservative leader able to pull support away from progressive parties and successfully court some union endorsements.“And in an era of deep political polarization, especially from party leaders, Ford has largely defied that approach. He doesn’t dig in on ideology or wear the partisan stripes. He appears to have sidestepped that.”With those skills, Ford emerged as one of the strongest pro-Canada voices against the backdrop of a looming trade war, at times drawing praise across the political aisle. He is a fixture of American television news, where he makes the case against possible tariffs.Ford’s rise fills a perceived vacuum of national leadership, following the resignation of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in early January.Before a high-stakes meeting with Canadian leaders in preparation for American tariffs, Ford, strode into the summitwearing a Maga-style hat with the message: “CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE”.“We will never be for sale,” Ford told the Guardian last month. “We don’t want to retaliate. We really don’t. But if it comes down to it, [the Americans] are going to feel pain.”DeLorey, a senior adviser on the campaign, says Ford’s “Captain Canada” branding reflects Ford’s instinct for leadership. “He’s genuinely very concerned about the province, and about where, what the impact tariffs will have on us.”Bidini, however, described Ford’s latest midwinter election gamble as a calculated move to hold on to power in the face of a wary, demoralized electorate.“He called this election in the dark depths of winter. People in my neighbourhood don’t even know who’s running because the ground is so frozen you can’t stake a sign in it. The sidewalks are slippery and covered in snow and there it’s bitterly cold out,” he said.“It’s hard to mount a campaign when you’re up against the elements. It’s the perfect conditions for a person like Ford to get the win that he wants and to perfect his narrative.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There was also a bit of snark: “bonus points to anyone who responds that they spent their government subsidy on hookers and blow,” one worker said.Within hours, the network had agreed on a recommended response: break up the oath federal employees take when hired into five bullet points and send them back in an email: “1. I supported and defended the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”“2. I bore true faith and allegiance to the same,” and so on.It was only the latest effort by a growing and increasingly busy group banding together to “expose harmful policies, defend public institutions and equip citizens with tools to push back against authoritarianism”, according to Lynn Stahl, a contractor with Veterans Affairs and a member of the network. Increasingly, the group is also trying to help its members and others face the thousands of layoffs that have been imposed across the federal government.Calling itself #AltGov, the network has developed a visible, public-facing presence in recent weeks throughBluesky accounts, most of which bear the names or initials of federal agencies, aimed at getting information out to the public – and correcting disinformation – about the chaos being unleashed by theTrump administration.With 40 accounts to date, their collective megaphone is getting louder, as most of the accounts have tens of thousands of followers, with “Alt CDC (they/them)” being the largest, at nearly 95,000 followers.The network has also formed a group and a series of sub-groups onWire, the encrypted messaging app, to share information and develop strategies – as played out on Saturday.View image in fullscreenA post from the #AltGov account for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Composite: Alt CDC (they/them)/BlueskyThe #AltGov hashtag has roots in the first Trump administration, perhaps most famously through the “ALT National Park Service” account on what was then Twitter, according to Amanda Sturgill, journalism professor at Elon University, whose bookWe Are #AltGov: Social Media Resistance from the Insidedocuments the earlier phenomenon. (Thataccount, with its 774,000 followers, has since moved to Bluesky. Its online presence is parallel to and separate from the #AltGov network.)The original #AltGov Twitter accounts were dedicated to “sharing information about what was happening inside government – which usually doesn’t get covered as much, because it usually works”, Sturgill said. Examples included the firstTrump administration’s deletion of data and separation of families through immigration policies, she said.The people behind those accounts also banded together to “provide services the government wasn’t providing” – like helping coordinate hurricane relief and distributing masks during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Those efforts were often coordinated in Twitter group chats.It was “a movement, more than an organization”, Sturgill said – and the same could be said of the current version, which moved its social media presence from X (formerly Twitter) toBluesky“because of the Elon mess”, said Stahl, referring to Musk’s 2022 purchase of the app. “It’s not safe to organize [on X] anymore,” she added.The current iteration has not been reported on to date, but the numbers of the Bluesky #AltGov accounts have doubled in recent weeks without media attention, Stahl said. The group internally vets all members “to make sure people work where they say”.View image in fullscreenAn #AltGov account compiles potential answers to Musk’s request for workers to list five things they accomplished in the past week.Photograph: Alt Fish and Wildlife Service/Bluesky“#AltGov dates from the firstTrump administration, but it’s even more needed now,” said an employee at Fema, the disaster response agency, who requested anonymity to avoid being targeted at work. She recently launched an #AltGov Fema account on Bluesky. With nearly 13,000 followers, the account says it’s dedicated to “helping people before, during, and after (this democratic) disaster”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everything is going on behind closed doors.”As an example, she mentioned the moment nearly two weeks ago when Trump and Musk brought attention to her agency, claiming that Fema was spending $59m on housing immigrants in New York hotels. The administration fired four Fema employees. So she turned to Bluesky andpostedon the #AltGov Fema account:Fiction: FEMA paid $59 million last week for illegal immigrants to stay luxury hotel rooms in NYCFact: FEMA administered funds allocated by Congress via the Shelter and Services Program (for [Customs and Border Protection]) which reimburses jurisdictions for immigration-related expenses. FEMA just sends the payments.“The official story the federal government was telling was a lie!” the #AltGov member told the Guardian. “Of course they didn’t throw CBP under the bus – because to them, those are the people who lock up immigrants.”‘We’re being treated as grifters or terrorists’: US federal workers on the fear and chaos of their firingsRead moreStahl, the federal contractor, said that #AltGov members are also increasingly turning their attention to what she called “action plans” for everyday citizens, such as calling members of Congress and attending town halls. “The idea is to get regular people aware of what’s happening … [and] maybe even inspire some people to run for office,” she said.And as Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) swings its “chainsaw” through federal payrolls and piles up layoffs, #AltGov members also are using encrypted chats to figure out how federal employees can help one another. “[A]re we thinking of gathering resources for terminated folks?” one #AltGov member recently asked on Wire. “We are gonna need food bank info and benefits and anything the [federal] unions don’t cover.” Others weighed in on building a website to cover such information.Sturgill said the first go-round of #AltGov was “interesting … [because] it kind of stood up a different way of governing by putting it in direct contact with people – a ‘government with the people’. Whether this [version] can take it further depends on how much of the government is left.”This article was amended on 26 February 2025.

Water on Great Blasket comes from a spring and must be boiled, while electricity for phones and head torches comes via batteries charged from a small wind turbine.The couple, who got married last summer, were selected from hundreds of applicants to run five holiday cottages and a coffee hatch for day-trippers.View image in fullscreenGreat Blasket island with ruined and restored houses up the hill from the beach, Trá Bán.Photograph: Alice Hayes“I genuinely think we will fall in with the rhythm of our new life and sense of freedom,” said Hayes, who himself has only been on the island once. “We won’t have the responsibilities of our jobs or day-to-day life, so it’s a chance to live a simpler life.”Viewed from the mainland’s Coumeenoole Beach, the setting for stormy scenes in the movie Ryan’s Daughter, the islands are renowned for their rugged beauty and marine life, including basking sharks and dolphins.But the weather can be unforgiving, with howling winds, driving rain and powerful waves that can turn Trá Bán (white beach) into a rapidly shifting landscape.“I just love coming out here and fixing things up. You just get a sense of satisfaction. You know you can just watch the seals and the beach and the wildlife and enjoy the solitude and how untouched it all is,” said Billy O’Connor, whose grandfather, local solicitor Peter Callery, and Peter’s brother Jim bought part of the island in the 1980s.It was O’Connor and his partner, Alice Hayes, who picked the new caretakers.View image in fullscreenAlice Hayes, Billy O’Connor and their two children at Great Blasket.Photograph: Alice Hayes“I just love being here. It is almost like stepping back in time. There are not many places in the world you can go and have totally pristine lands and water and totally switch off.” April, he said, is one of the most magical times to visit, with the great white beach blackened with thousands of seals.Last year’s caretakers spoke of 2,000 seals and theseabirds that “screeched eerily at night” and rested on the hill behind the house during the day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have now capped the number they consider at 300.“First we try to put them off because if anything it is quite romanticised; the island, the sunsets and the beautiful places. But during the season it can be quite intense for the caretakers,” said Alice Hayes, who is no relation to James Hayes.“Most people when they finish work go home to their safe haven and relax. But I often say to people going out there that they won’t have that,” she said. “You close the half door where you were serving coffee and you are home.”View image in fullscreenLooking west from Gearhane towards Cruach Mhárthain, Mount Eagle and the Blasket Islands on the Dingle peninsula.Photograph: Colm Kingston/Alamy“But I think the attractive thing is that pure sense of switching off. You are surrounded by nature and beautiful scenery. Even when it is miserable out there, it is still so stunning and there is just something about it that brings people to it.”James, who trained and worked as an architect in London, met his wife on the Burren in County Clare, another area of outstanding beauty and wilderness, where Camille was finishing her studies in arts and business.Further cementing their love of nature, they got engaged on another storied island, Inis Mór of the Aran Islands, off the coast of Galway, and ever since they have dreamed of doing the Blaskets job.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Musk had demanded federal workers email his office with five things they did the week prior to justify their positions.Donald Trump defended Muskfrom a mounting backlash in his own administration after some cabinet members – including the FBI director, Kash Patel, and Tulsi Gabbard, the national intelligence director – told their employees to ignore the demand and refrain from emailing a response.Here are the biggest stories inUS politicson Tuesday, 25 February.More than 20 Doge staffers resign over Musk bid to 'dismantle critical public services'More than 20 civil service employees resigned on Tuesday fromElon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services”.

After delivering his cargo of stone to Bangladesh’s Kutubdia Island, the marine engineer was due to head home in March 2024 to disembark at Thoothukudi port, India.But that month, the rusting tug, the Navimar 3, which was being operated by Middle East Marine (MEM), was detained by the authorities in Bangladesh due to unpaid fees. For almost a year, Vihaan has become a virtual prisoner on board, he says, forced to work without pay to keep the vessel safe, amid strong currents where it is anchored off the island in the cyclone-prone bay. His passport and certification documents are being held by a local agent for the Dubai-based company. With no means of getting home, no visa to disembark and without supplies, he has to rely on food and water from charities and unions.Vihaan, who has 25 years’ experience in the industry, says he has had “nothing but empty promises” from the Dubai company that he will be paid and allowed to leave. Screenshots of increasingly desperate messages between the engineer and the company attest to this. He longs to see his wife and 14-year-old daughter but says he is “losing hope with every day that passes”. Since his abandonment, his family, who depend on his wages, have incurred debts that threaten to swallow 20 years of savings, and risk his daughter’s dreams of studying to become a military doctor. His wife has had to postpone hospital treatment.Seafaring has become more dangerous in recent years as conflicts have seen innocent workers targetedSteve Trowsdale, ITFWhen the Guardian spoke to Vihaan earlier this month, he was coughing and said he felt weak and feverish. There is no medicine on board, he says. He keeps working, because, despite everything, he needs to keep the crew and vessel safe, he says. The Maritime Labour Convention defines “abandonment” as two months without contractual wages, maintenance and support, or cost of repatriation.Vihaan’s case is far from isolated. Thousands of seafarers, the backbone of the global shipping trade, are left abandoned in what the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) describes as a “cancer” of the industry. Cases have surged by 135%, from 132 vessels in 2023 to312 last year, affecting more than 3,000 seafarers according to a jointInternational Labour Organization (ILO)/International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.The Middle East region had the most abandoned vessels, at 108, while the port state with the highest number is the United Arab Emirates, with 42 abandoned vessels in its waters in 2024. The second highest was Turkey, with 25. UEA companies are also responsible for the largest proportion of all abandonments. The Federal Transport Authority in the UAE was approached for comment but did not respond.Seafarers in the ILO/IMO database have often been left with little or no food and dirty drinking water, while wages owed to them worth $20m (£16m) went unpaid in 2024, of which the ITF has recovered $10.4m so far, it says. Things became so bad for one distressed crew member that they were admitted to hospital after a failed attempt to take their own life, ITF says.View image in fullscreenMembers of the exhausted and abandoned crew on board the Navimar 3.Photograph: ITFThese seafarers are in a catch-22: with no means of returning home, they stay on board in deteriorating conditions, hoping employers who owe them wages will pay up, as once they leave the ship, the chances of them receiving unpaid wages diminishes.Most abandoned vessels are sailing under a“flag of convenience”country such as Panama or Palau, ITF says. This system, of allowing a shipowner to register a vessel in a country other than their own, with often less stringent labour laws, makes it more difficult to take legal action against shipowners.A further disturbing aspect of the industry is the increasing danger to seafarers unwittingly caught up in conflicts. This was highlighted in November 2023, when the 25-strong crew of the cargo ship, the Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader, were taken hostage by Yemen’s Houthis at the start of a campaign of attacks in the Red Sea linked to the war in Gaza. They werereleased last monthafter the ceasefire.And last July, 16 seafarers found themselves abandoned in a conflict zone on board the Captain Tarek cargo ship during Israeliairstrikes on Hodeidah port, in Yemen, which reportedly killed three people and wounded 87.Satya Rahul, the second officer on the Tarek, from Delhi, says he had feared for his life and the life of the crew: “I was too much afraid. My life was in danger during the strike. I was doing my watch duties … because [at sea] we can’t leave responsibility on others. If anything goes wrong, then anything can happen with the life of all crew.”The Life at Sea 2024 photography awards: a rare glimpse into the highs and lows of seafaringRead moreRahul, 31, says he was forced to work for seven months unpaid. The crew of the Tarek, eight Indians and eight Syrians, had to live on one portion of noodles or rice every one or two days and a litre of water a day between them, he claims. They had no electricity and no fuel, he says. Rahul is now home, along with five of the other Indian seafarers and the eight Syrians, who sought help from the ITF.Steve Trowsdale, the ITF’s head of inspectorate, says: “Seafaring has become more dangerous in recent years as conflicts have seen innocent workers targeted.”Sandra Bernal, the Asia Pacific region coordinator at ITF who has been dealing with Vihaan’s case, says that ITF has now repatriated two separate crews of the Palau-flagged Navimar. A third crew, from Indonesia, boarded this month, Vihaan claims.MEM operates tugboats such as the Navimar 3 via a “bareboat” charter, which allows it to use ships owned by a third party. AD Ports Group, a state-owned organisation in Abu Dhabi, is the beneficial owner of the Navimar 3, via subsidiaries. The beneficial owner is whoever exercises effective control over the vessel, though they can lease it out via subsidiaries. AD Portsmade 1.36bnUAE dirhams (£300m), in profit in 2023, according to its accounts.Last month, after pressure from the ITF, Vihaan received his first good news in a year – he received half of the wages owed to him. He is still owed $27,000 (£21,000), according to Bernal.Mohamed Arrachedi, ITF’s flag of convenience coordinator in the Arab world and Iran, has dealt with many distressing cases over his career. “We cannot normalise abandonment,” he says. “It is immoral, inhumane. It is like modern slavery.”In the time since he was interviewed for this piece, Vihaan has moved onshore, but is still awaiting his unpaid wages. Middle East Marine was approached for comment. When contacted, AD Ports suggested the Guardian’s information was out of date but it hasn’t been possible to contact them since. The Guardian also made extensive efforts to identify the owners of the Captain Tarek but without success.* Name has been changed. Seafarers fear reprisals and blacklisting by employers for speaking outThis article was amended on 26 February 2025 to correctly refer to the ILO/IMO Joint Database on Abandonment of Seafarers. An earlier version referred to it as a “joint ITF/ILO database”; while the ITF is a key contributor, the database is hosted by the ILO and jointly managed with the IMO.Explore more on these topicsWorkers' rightsSeascape: the state of our oceansShipping industryHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Henry Dyer reportsLord David Evans of Watford, 82, offered access to ministers during discussions about a commercial deal, an undercover investigation can reveal.Lord Evans was recorded explaining to Guardian undercover reporters – who were posing as property developers looking to lobby the government – on how to approach Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary.An online meeting with Lord Evans took place six days before Christmas. It followed weeks of messages and two earlier Zoom calls with his son, Richard Evans, about the sponsorship.During these earlier discussions, Richard, 56, proposed creating opportunities, alongside the event, to meet ministers in parliament. He made it clear the payment of £25,000 to his company for the sponsorship had to happen first.Henry Dyer, an investigations reporter for the Guardian, tellsHelen Piddabout the investigation, which is part of a wider series calledthe Lords debate.In response to the investigation, Lord Evans said: “To my knowledge, I have not broken anyHouse of Lordsrules and I have NOT taken any personal benefits.”He added: “I would NOT and I do NOT accept payments for hosting any House of Lords events.” He said he had never approached Rayner to speak at any event.Richard Evans said the venture was not “profit-driven” but a “commitment to strengthening the construction industry”.ALabourspokesperson said that Angela Rayner was not aware of the activities of these individuals or involved with them in any way.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodComposite: Guardian Design/EPA/ParliamentExplore more on these topicsHouse of LordsToday in FocusLabour"

She has attempted to protest outside Downing Street for an hour each weekday to keep her son’s cause in the minds of ministers.Soueif was taken to hospital on Monday after her hunger strike led to a dangerous fall in her blood sugar levels. Her doctor said there was an “immediate risk to life including further deterioration or death” and that she was “in particular at high risk of sudden death with continued fasting”.She is under observation at St Thomas’ hospital in central London.Fattah, who has been jailed repeatedly by the regime of the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, completed his current five-year sentence last September, if his two years in detention before sentencing are taken into account as is specified by Egyptian law.It appears that Keir Starmer has been unable to secure a phone call with Sisi to discuss Fattah’s fate, despite making requests to do so.Starmer has twice written to Sisi, and the UK’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva raised Fattah’s unlawful detention at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Egypt is refusing to provide even British consular access to Fattah as it does not recognise dual national status.A family member said: “It seems extraordinary that the whole of the British government machine is unable to secure a call. Laila has always said her fast is about securing some sign of progress in the release of her son, but so far she has nothing and feels she cannot stop her hunger strike.”Soueif was admitted to hospital when blood sugar levels dropped to 2.0 mmol/L and she recorded a low blood pressure reading of 75/45. Her blood sugar levels have previously recovered but are no longer doing so, prompting the deep levels of concern.She is not taking glucose treatment because of her hunger strike but due to low sodium readings of 131 mmol/L she has been put on a saline drip.Starmer met the family a fortnight ago but Downing Street has disclosed little about what he is willing to do to secure Fattah’s release.The Foreign Office has been looking at what incentives it could provide to the financially strapped Egyptian government to convince it that it would be in Egypt’s economic interests to show clemency.In November 2022, David Lammy, then the shadow foreign secretary, described a £4bn trade partnership with Egypt as “tremendous leverage”.In March last year, the World Bank announced it was providing $6bn to Egypt over three years, and it is likely the UK will be involved in providing some financial support.The family are also frustrated that there is no cross-government policy to make contracts with the Egyptian government contingent on progress with Fattah’s release.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyEgyptAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

More than 200 people were arrested the night before for violating the nighttime curfew, authorities reported.In some parts of the country, such as the town of Maipú south of Santiago, thousands of people waited anxiously for power – and drinking water – to return to their homes.And some commuters on Wednesday still struggled to navigate city streets without functioning traffic lights. Tohá said more security forces would be deployed on city streets to help ward off traffic chaos.The blackout was the most significant to hit Chile since 2010, whena destructive 8.8-magnitude earthquake and tsunamicut off power and knocked out communications for most of the country.Leftist president Gabriel Boric pointed his finger at energy transmission companies and vowing that authorities would investigate the firms involved. The faulty transmission line was installed by energy transmission company ISA InterChile, he said.“It is not tolerable that the daily lives of millions of Chileans are affected by the responsibility of one or several companies,” Boric said in a televised address late on Tuesday. “It’s the state’s duty to hold them responsible.”Critics encourage the state to take a more active role in planning electric infrastructure in Chile, where private companies have operated electricity – and other key services – since the 1973-90 military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Liberals have overturned a 26-point deficit in six weeks, and run advertisements comparing Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, to Donald Trump.The Conservative strategy had long been to attack the unpopular prime minister,Justin Trudeau, but he said last monthhe was resigningafter more than nine years in power.The Liberals, who will choose a new leader on 9 March, steadily picked up support after the US president threatened to impose tariffs on almost all imports fromCanadaand said he wanted to annex Canada as the 51st US state.Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chanceRead more“The Conservatives are facing headwinds from rising anti-Trump sentiment and anticipation surrounding the Liberal party’s new leadership,” Ipsos said in a release.The next election must be held by 20 October but could come much sooner than that. The new Liberal leader has the option of calling an election immediately.A Leger poll released on Tuesday put the Conservatives on 38% public support with the Liberals on 35%, compared with 43% and 21% respectively in December. And an Ekos poll, also released on Tuesday, put the Liberals on 38% and the Conservatives on 37%.The results of the three polls indicate that if an election were held now, the Liberals and Conservatives would both fall well short of a majority in the 343-seat House of Commons and could only take office with the support of smaller parties.Such minority governments are less stable and rarely last more than two years. During the second of two Liberal leadership debates on Tuesday night, the major contenders called for tough countermeasures against the US and said the Conservatives’ Poilievre would not save Canada.“Who’s the worst person to stand up to Donald Trump? It’s Pierre Poilievre. He worships the man. He uses his language. He’s not the right person for our country at this crucial time,” said theformer central bank governor Mark Carney.Poilievre’s office was not immediately available for comment.The former finance minister Chrystia Freeland told the debate that “Trump is posing the gravest challenge our country has faced since the second world war”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasJustin TrudeaunewsShareReuse this content"

It’s terrible.”Bikes v cars: backlash after Ontario premier threatens to tear up cycling lanes in TorontoRead moreFord, a blunt-spoken, burly populist with a “limestone head” and a knack for politics, sensed opportunity in the devastation. He called a snap election, telling voters he needed the “largest mandate in Ontario history” to combat an existential threat to the province’s economy. The move was derided as opportunism by other party leaders who accused Ford of “answering chaos by creating more chaos”.Despised among progressives for the province’s crumbling healthcare system, underfunded schools anda scandal that could have put billions in the pocket of land developers, Ford has now fashioned himself as “Captain Canada” – even leaving the campaign trail twice to lobby leaders in Washington.Now, as millions of Ontarians prepare to cast their ballot on Thursday for the province’s next leader, the stunning rise of Ford as a dominant political force – not just in Ontario but across the country – has put the 60-year-old populist in uncharted territory.No Ontario leader has ever won three successive majorities, with each one larger than the last. If Ford accomplishes this, it will reflect a unique political acumen which includes empathy and ruthlessness.For years Doug toiled in the shadow of his late brother Rob, whose scandal-ridden tenure as mayor of Toronto was notorious for his use of crack cocaine.When Rob contracted cancer and was unable to continue his mayoral campaign in 2014 it was Doug who ran in his place. He lost, but the bid positioned Doug as the heir to a brash, populist movement that appealed to disaffected suburban voters and affluent, pro-business supporters. AfterRob died in 2016, Doug set his sights higher, and in 2018, after a hard-fought race, he was elected to become Ontario’s premier with a commanding legislative majority.Ford has cultivated a reputation as a leader preoccupied by the daily frustrations of residents. Like Rob, he is famous for handing his phone number out to anyone who asks. During snowstorms, he shovels driveways and helps stranded motorists.“The thing about Doug Ford is that he really cares about people. And I know every politician supposedly says that, right? That’s cliche, but with him, I truly believe it’s sincere – and he wants to do good things and do right by people,” said Fred DeLorey, a senior adviser for the premier’s 2025 election campaign. “I’ve known him as a political opponent and someone I’ve worked with for years and I can honestly say I’ve never seen anyone like him.”Ford’s father, Doug Sr, won a seat in the Ontario legislative assembly in the early 1990s, and the family – who run a lucrative label-making business – became a mainstay of conservative politics.Dave Bidini, the publisher of Toronto’s West End Phoenix newspaper, grew up in Etobicoke, the same Toronto suburb as the Ford family, and says the brothers’ reputation cast a long shadow. “There was a notoriety to a lot of the families in that neighbourhood: a lot of bad behaviour, a lot of wealth, a lot of privilege, lot of early fast cars,” he said.And, according to reporting from the Globe and Mail in 2013, Doug dealt hashish in the 1980s.“Most people didn’t approach Doug looking for product. You went to the guys that he supplied,” one former dealer told the Globe. “Because if Doug didn’t know you and trust you, he wouldn’t even roll down his window.”Ford has repeatedly denied the allegations and his lawyer says the Globe’s reporting is the “height of irresponsible and unprofessional journalism given the gravely serious and specious allegations of substantial criminal conduct”.Early in his tenure as premier, Ford won praise for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, following public health messaging – and at times breaking with other conservative leaders. When a report revealed the “horrific” state of the province’s long-term care homes during the crisis, Ford broke down at a press conference as he demanded accountability.To his critics, however, he governs like a vengeful leader bearing a grudge against Toronto, the city that has never supported him. “People call him a populist but when you look at it, his politics are just so petty and vindictive,” says Bidini.Ford has repeatedly clashed with residents and activists over plans to remove bike lanes from downtown Toronto, plans for a controversial private spa on public lands, a decision to shutter the city’s beloved science centre, and teacher strikes over class sizes.View image in fullscreenDoug Ford at a campaign stop in Milton, Ontario last week.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/Shutterstock“When he was a councillor at city hall, he just caused chaos,” Bidini said. “And I don’t necessarily think that was a strategic move. I just think that that’s just kind of who he is. And you can see that now – a lot of his politics are just trying tosee what he can get away with.”In 2022, Ford found his government embroiled in a deepening scandal over a controversial multibillion-dollarland swapdeal.The plan, which opened 7,400 acres of protected land, dubbed the Greenbelt, for development, would have given windfall profits to developers. The premier eventually reversed course, but the scandal cost him a pair of cabinet ministers, two damning reports from government watchdogs and public outrage.At a somber press conference, Ford said it was “mistake” to allow development in the green belt around Toronto. “I made a promise to you that I wouldn’t touch the green belt. I broke that promise. And for that, I am very, very sorry,” he told reporters. Canada’s federal police are currently investigating the issue, but Ontario’s ethics commissioner cleared Ford of any wrongdoing.Still, Ford has largely resisted the partisan nature of modern politics, breaking with other Conservative premiers and cultivating close friendships with key figures in opposing parties like Chrystia Freeland, then federal finance minister.“Above all, Ford is a pragmatist. He’s clearly intent on achieving and maintaining office. But I do think he has a core commitment to the ‘little guy’ and that really seems to drive a lot of his decisions,” said Andrea Lawlor, an associate professor of political science at McMaster University. The result is a conservative leader able to pull support away from progressive parties and successfully court some union endorsements.“And in an era of deep political polarization, especially from party leaders, Ford has largely defied that approach. He doesn’t dig in on ideology or wear the partisan stripes. He appears to have sidestepped that.”With those skills, Ford emerged as one of the strongest pro-Canada voices against the backdrop of a looming trade war, at times drawing praise across the political aisle. He is a fixture of American television news, where he makes the case against possible tariffs.Ford’s rise fills a perceived vacuum of national leadership, following the resignation of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in early January.Before a high-stakes meeting with Canadian leaders in preparation for American tariffs, Ford, strode into the summitwearing a Maga-style hat with the message: “CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE”.“We will never be for sale,” Ford told the Guardian last month. “We don’t want to retaliate. We really don’t. But if it comes down to it, [the Americans] are going to feel pain.”DeLorey, a senior adviser on the campaign, says Ford’s “Captain Canada” branding reflects Ford’s instinct for leadership. “He’s genuinely very concerned about the province, and about where, what the impact tariffs will have on us.”Bidini, however, described Ford’s latest midwinter election gamble as a calculated move to hold on to power in the face of a wary, demoralized electorate.“He called this election in the dark depths of winter. People in my neighbourhood don’t even know who’s running because the ground is so frozen you can’t stake a sign in it. The sidewalks are slippery and covered in snow and there it’s bitterly cold out,” he said.“It’s hard to mount a campaign when you’re up against the elements. It’s the perfect conditions for a person like Ford to get the win that he wants and to perfect his narrative.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They are taking advantage of the government’s disorder to strengthen themselves, fight amongst themselves and take more territory,” he said.Santos’s peace deal with the Farc –at the time, the most powerful guerrilla insurgency in the western hemisphere– led to 7,000 combatants laying down their rifles and gave Colombians the hope of a more peaceful chapter in their country’s bloody history.The following year was the least violent in five decades but Santos’s conservative successor, Iván Duque – who campaigned on a promise to kill off the peace process – refused to implement the accord’s agreements.Since then, dozens of new groups have sprung up to fill territory once controlled by theFarcand are warring with each other to control the cocaine trade, illegal mining and extortion rackets.View image in fullscreenJuan Manuel Santos.Photograph: Jose Gomez/ReutersA handful of groups have retained elements of revolutionary ideology but most are little more than local mafias.When he was elected in 2022, Petro – Colombia’s first ever leftwing leader and a former urban guerrilla himself – pledged to launch talks with every major armed group as part of his “Total Peace” strategy.Butnegotiations have yielded little progressand the government has been repeatedly forced to break off talks as rebels refuse to stop kidnapping and killing civilians.In the past two months, Colombia has seen a wave of violence across the country, from the far southern state of Amazonas to the Pacific coast.The worst of the violence has been concentrated near the north-eastern border with Venezuela, where Colombia’s largest armed group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) launched an offensive in January that has killed at least 80 people and displaced 85,000.Last weeka million people in the border city Cúcuta were put under curfewafter ELN fighters attacked police stations and toll booths with car bombs and machine guns.“We thought Petro was going to correct course. He promised that in the campaign, but he has not delivered. We are now worse off than we were two and a half years ago,” said Santos.‘All hell broke loose’: Colombia rethinks ‘total peace’ plan as violence grips northRead moreAnalysts warn that armed groups are growing unchecked in the Colombia countryside as the military, confused by the government’s stop-start efforts to negotiate with each group separately, is unable to hatch an effective strategy to combat them.Kidnapping has increased 79%since Petro came into office,child recruitmenthas increased 1,000%in the past four years and data from Colombia’s human rights ombudsman shows that criminal groups are seizing territory quicker than they were under Duque.Petro broke off talks with the ELN on 17 January, and contacts with all other major groups have also either been terminated or suspended. Only one ceasefire, with a dissident Farc faction, remains active.But although he has described the recent bloodshed as a “national failure”, Petro has insisted he will not drop the Total Peace strategy – even as members of his own cabinet have publicly asked if the peace process is unravelling.View image in fullscreenA security official works in the area where several bombs exploded on a highway tollway on the Colombian-Venezuelan border in Cúcuta last weekPhotograph: Mario Caicedo/EPASantos said that negotiating with armed groups requires tact, extensive research and planning, but Petro’s strategy appears to have been improvised.“You need to know what your objectives are. You need to know what your red lines are. And you need to know what you want to achieve. None of that was present. It was improvised, there was no planning and they had no idea who they were negotiating with,” he said.Santos said he warned Petro’s team that its ambitions to convince more than a dozen armed groups to disarm simultaneously were overly optimistic; it took four years to negotiate a deal with the Farc – which although it had more than 13,000 members had a clear top-down structure and hierarchy.“I told them: ‘You might be Superman, you might be the most intelligent person in the world, but if you think you are able to negotiate with 14 different groups at the same time that would be a failure.’ And that is what has happened.”And with each ceasefire, as the military eased off pressure, the armed groups have taken advantage to recruit new members and expand their control.The country’s rights ombudsman says the number of municipalities the ELN is active in has increased 23% since 2022; for therightwing Gulf Clanthat figure is 54%View image in fullscreenPresident Gustavo Petro holds a ceremony to formally begin a six-month ceasefire with the National Liberation Army (ELN) in Bogotá on 3 August 2023.Photograph: Iván Valencia/APMeanwhile, the number of identified armed factions across the country has grown from 141 to 184.Negotiating with many of the smaller non-political groups has “given them legitimacy”, Santos said.“You cannot simply say I’m going to negotiate with every armed group because then many appear simply to take advantage of a negotiation – and that is in some ways what has happened.”The Santos government’s peace deal with the Farc was lauded across the world, receiving lavish praise from state leaders, the UN secretary general and the pope.Uncharacteristically for a former Colombian statesman, Santos has largely withdrawn from national politics and focuses on advocacy for global issues such as nuclear arms reduction.The 74-year-old hinted he may regret his non-interventionist stance given how quickly his successors – in particular his immediate replacement – have squandered peace gains in the last eight years.“We did not foresee that Duque was going to be such a disaster, unfortunately,” he said.The sweeping agreement with the Farc was drawn up after 2,800 meetings with local communities and the final document spanned 310 pages. The plan was to transform the countryside with land reform, development and security, finally bringing the state to areas abandoned for centuries.View image in fullscreenPresident Juan Manuel Santos, left, and Timoleón Jiménez, of the Farc, exchange pacts while Cuba’s President Raúl Castro witnesses in Havana in 2016.Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock“These communities felt part of the process and that’s why they’re so frustrated now. The expectations were so high, they were so enthusiastic, but six years on very little has been implemented,” Santos said.More than 300 ex-Farc combatants have been killed since the peace deal.“I think we did what we could do with the political limitations we had,” Santos said when asked if he had any regrets given the withering peace process. “I wish I had had more time to implement the agreement during the end of my administration,” he added.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasFarcnewsShareReuse this content"

I was so excited and happy when I discovered it,” Guo said. “The puppy’s posture is like it’s drinking water, or it’s looking at some fish. It also looks like it’s quietly protecting the Yangtze River.”Guo’s post on the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, received 120,000 likes in 10 days. The hashtag #xiaogoushan, Chinese for “puppy mountain”, also drew millions of views on the media platform Weibo.Dog owners started to post pictures of their pets to see which one had the closest resemblance. Many people traveled directly to the location to see the mountain for themselves and some brought their dogs to take photos.View image in fullscreenZhang Yali poses with her dog Little Cotton in December 2023 near what has now become known as Puppy Mountain.Photograph: Tan Yuanyi/AP“Puppy Mountain here I am!” one social media user wrote on RedNote along with photos of the mountain. “Just stroke the puppy’s head and then everything will be OK.” Another commented: “We all need the eyes to see the beauty in this world.”Yang Yang, who lives about an hour and a half from the location, drove there with her friends and her two-year-old grey poodle, Yang Keyi. “I was really happy to see the mountain,” she said. “I always travel with my dog if possible, so Puppy Mountain and my own little dog really match.”The mountain is in Yichang’s Zigui county, where it can be seen from an observation deck.After Guo’s photo went viral, many people shared photos of the view they had previously taken from the deck, many saying they had not realised it looked like a dog. Some discussed how the dog’s appearance had changed over the years.Shi Tong, a Yichang resident, said he knew he had seen the mountain before, and posted a photo he took of the location in 2021.“After I saw the Puppy Mountain photo online, I tried to look up where it is. And then I realised that I have been to this place before. I thought it looked like a dog at that time, too.”Explore more on these topicsChinaSocial mediaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The number of births last year was 238,300, an increase of 8,300, or 3.6%.South Korea thinktank suggests girls start school earlier to raise birthrateRead moreWhile the country wrestles with a prolongedpolitical crisis, government attempts to persuade more young people to marry and have children appear to have had a positive – if limited – effect.South Koreahas one of the world’s longest life expectancies and itslowest birthrate– a combination experts have warned will lead to population instability and pose a threat to its status as a regional economic power.The rise in the birthrate has come from a very low base and remains far below the 2.1 births per woman needed to stabilise the population without large-scale immigration.Since 2018, South Korea has been the only OECD country with a rate below 1.0 – a level the government says it hopes to achieve by 2030.But it has struggled to tackle factors experts believe are behind the reluctance to have larger families, including the high cost of living and education, a tough job market and growing opposition among women totraditional gender roles.In response, the conservative administration of the impeached president,Yoon Suk Yeol, has spent billions of dollars on measures to arrest the decline, including financial incentives for newlyweds and expanded childcare assistance.Yoon, whose fate is now in the hands of the constitutional court following his short-lived declaration of martial law in December, has described the low birthrate as a “national crisis” and said he planned to create a new ministry to address it.Park Hyun-jung, an official from Statistics Korea, said the rise in the number of marriages seen after since the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions had continued.The number of marriages – considered a reliable indicator of expected births in a country where few children are born out of wedlock – jumped 14.9% last year, the biggest rise since data was first released in 1970.“There was a change in social values, with more positive views about marriage and childbirth,” Park told a briefing, adding that a rise in the number of people in their early 30s had also been a factor.“It is difficult to measure how much each factor contributed to the rise in new births, but they themselves had an impact on each other too,” she said.South Korea’s overallpopulationis in decline, however, with deaths outstripping births by 120,000 last year – the fifth consecutive year of natural shrinkage.The population, which peaked at 51.83 million in 2020, is expected to shrink to 36.22 million by 2072, according to the latest projection by Statistics Korea.Officials have argued that South Korea needs to accept more migrants if it is to stand a chance of tackling population decline.“Rather than putting the policy focus only on how to boost the birthrate, we now need a more comprehensive perspective and to devise solutions such as attracting more foreigners,” Joo Hyung-hwan, vice-chairman of a presidential committee on ageing and population, said this week, according to the Yonhap news agency.The number of foreign residents stood at 2.65 million in 2024, accounting for about 5% of the total population.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaPopulationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Defence were first notified by a civilian aircraft that was itself warned by the Chinese vessels when it flew within radio range. It took an hour for theNew Zealandnavy, which was monitoring the Chinese vessels at the time, to notify the ADF.Outside estimates, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, insisted the civilian and military notifications on the live-fire drill were contemporaneous.“At around the same time, there were two areas of notification: one was from the New Zealand vessels that were tailing … the [Chinese] vessels in the area. So that occurred and at the same time through the channels that occur when these things occur, Airservices got notified as well.”2:35Chinese warships could sail through Great Australian Bight, Senate estimates told – videoAlbanese said he had been in contact by phone with the New Zealand prime minister, Christopher Luxon, as the two navies cooperatively shadowed the Chinese vessels.But the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, accused Albanese of “ducking and weaving and failing to answer basic questions”, on the timeline of Australia’s knowledge of the live-fire drills.“I hope that the prime minister can come out and give an honest account of what the government knew and when in relation to [these] naval ships that are off our coastline, what warnings the government had,” he said.The Chinese flotilla – the frigate Hengyang, the cruiser Zunyi, and a replenishment vessel Weishanhu – is now 250km south of Hobart, inside Australia’s exclusive economic zone, sailing south-west.“The fact that they are currently south of Hobart and proceeding south-west suggests that it is more likely now that they may proceed through the Australian Bight,” Johnston said.Asked tocomment on reportingthat the ships were probably accompanied by a nuclear submarine, Johnston said he could not be categoric.“I don’t know whether there is a submarine with them. It is possible: task groups occasionally do deploy with submarines, but not always. I can’t be definitive on whether that’s the case.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what we must do | John BlaxlandRead moreJohnston said the Chinese flotilla had undertaken two live-fire drills in the Tasman Sea on Friday and on Saturday. He was critical that, while the drills were conducted in international waters and in accordance with international law, there was insufficient notice before the live-fire drills started.But estimates confirmed that there was in fact no notice given, and that the Australian defence force only learned of the live-fire drill nearly 40 minutes after it had started, and via a pilot flying a commercial flight near the Chinese ships.Johnston confirmed defence was notified of the live-fire drill through Airservices Australia, which had been notified by a commercial pilot who had flown into close proximity to the vessels while the live-firing window was open.At 9.58am on Friday morning, a Virgin commercial pilot was contacted by radio by the Chinese vessels and warned – in English – that there was a live-fire drill under way.The Virgin flight had flown within about 250 nautical miles – potentially within line of sight – of the Chinese vessels when it was warned to stay clear.Airservices Australia issued a hazard alert within two minutes, establishing an 18km exclusion zone around the flotilla, extending to a height of 45,000 feet, at 10am.The aviation safety agency then notified the ADF’s Joint Operations Command Headquarters, 10 minutes after the initial contact from the Virgin pilot.Twenty-minutes after the initial contact, at 10.18am, a separate commercial flight operated by Emirates was in radio contact with the Chinese warships, which informed pilots that the live-fire exercise had begun at 9.30am and would conclude at 2pm.It was 11.01am – another hour – before the New Zealand navy, which had been shadowing the Chinese flotilla, informed Australia of the live-fire exercise through military channels, estimates heard.Johnston said the lack of notice was potentially dangerous.“The absence of any advance notice to Australian authorities was a concern, notably, that the limited notice provided by the PLA could have unnecessarily increased the risk to aircraft and vessels in the area,” he told estimates.The shadow minister for defence, Andrew Hastie, told an ABC radio interviewChinawas undertaking “the biggest peacetime military buildup since 1945”, and working to send a strong message that it is a global power.Hastie said he believed China was “testing US allies as Donald Trump resets relationships in Europe”.“We’re seeing a flotilla of three warships conduct live fire exercises off our coast.

He also did not provide details about when exactly the British firm had restarted its hunt.MH370’s disappeared from radar shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur airport in March 2014. It was bound for Beijing, with 12 crew and 227 passengers on board. The plane has never been found, and the reason for its disappearance is unknown.“We’re very relieved and pleased that the search is resuming once again after such a long hiatus,” Malaysian Grace Nathan, 36, who lost her mother on the doomed jet, told AFP.Jaquita Gonzales, 62, wife of MH370 flight supervisor Patrick Gomes, said she hoped the resumption of the search would bring her family much-needed closure.“We just want to know where it is and what happened,” she said. “Memories come back like yesterday, it’s fresh in our heads.”Marine tracking website Marinetraffic.comshowedthat the Ocean Infinity vessel was in the south Indian ocean as of 23 February.Timeline of the search for MH370 – a visual guideRead moreMalaysia agreed to resume the search in December 2024, with Ocean Infinity conducting the search on a “no-find-no-fee” basis. Lokesaidthe government would sign a contract for 18 months, in return for which Ocean Infinity would receive $70m if the wreckage was located and verified. The search would cover 15,000 sq km, Loke said.On 8 March 2024, on the tenth anniversary of the disappearance, Australia offered the Malaysian government support for a renewed search. Eight Australians were on board the flight. But on Tuesday a spokesperson for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said that Australian authorities were not involved in the renewed search.Flight MH370, a B777-200 aircraft, departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time on 8 March 2-14, bound for Beijing. The plane was last seen on military radar at 2.14am, heading west over the strait of Malacca. Half an hour later, the airlineannounced it had lost contact with the plane, which was due to land at its destination about 6.30am.The families of those on board are still waiting for answers about what happened to their loved ones. Sometravelled to Madagascar in 2016to comb the beaches there for debris: pieces of the planehad been foundoff the Tanzanian and Mozambican coasts.In January 2017, after nearly three years of searching 120,000 sq km in the southern Indian Ocean, Australian authoritiesended the underwater huntfor the wreckage. On 3 October that year, Australian investigators delivered their final report on the disappearance, saying the inability to bring closure for victims’ families was a “great tragedy” and “almost inconceivable” in the modern age.Among the questions that remain is why the plane made a seemingly controlled turn off course towards the Indian ocean and, critically, why two pieces of key communication and tracking equipment on the plane went silent.Theories of what happened haveranged from a pilot “gone rogue” to sabotageand conspiracies that the flight was shot down or “disappeared” by a nefarious government agency and landed at a dark site, either because of sensitive cargo or a politically significant passenger.Data recovered from a home-built flight simulator owned by the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah,showed that someone had plotted a course to the southern Indian Ocean.Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsMalaysia Airlines flight MH370MalaysiaPlane crashesAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

She said this meant he could face up to two years on remand due to potential delays in the matter.Police have alleged Gibson-Burrell was the sole person behind the infamous signature cartoon-like bird which has been graffitied across Melbourne and Geelong on property and heritage buildings including theFlinders Street station clock.Gibson-Burrell has indicated he plans to contest all the charges.His lawyer, Peter Matthews, SC, said on Tuesday his client had two jobs lined up, including at a Wendouree-based warehouse for an online clothing label and a Geelong painting and property company.The defence had also called Gibson-Burrell’s grandmother, Joan Bell, who said she was willing to have her grandson live with her in East Geelong and support his bail conditions.“It’s my house, my rules,” she said.She told the court she had previously worked in a security role and at a backpackers hostel and had a reputation of being “very firm but fair”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sen Const Scott Nicholls told the court that Gibson-Burrell could “wreak havoc” on the state’s streets if released. He said Gibson-Burrell was “gaining more validity” and alleged he had demonstrated a disregard for bail.Police also laid an additional charge of intentionally causing injury after Gibson-Burrell allegedly stabbed a man in January, the court heard.Metcalf had earlier this monthdenied Gibson-Burrell bail, arguing there was an unacceptable risk he would commit a serious offence that would risk the public safety.At the time, she said there was a risk he would continue to target prominent locations to boost his social media notoriety if released.Police had also argued Gibson-Burrell’s alleged abseiling off tall structures endangered the public because it was a risk to anyone below the buildings.The police investigation into Gibson-Burell included officers spending more than 200 hours after the accused, alongside more than 100 hours of CCTV footage, the court heard previously.Gibson-Burrell is due to appear before the Melbourne magistrates court on 6 June for a committal mention.Explore more on these topicsMelbourneStreet artVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

Of the alleged victims, 256 were under the age of 15; the youngest was a year old.The court has heard of the omertà that seemed to exist in the Le Scouarnec family, where acts of incest and abuse were known about but not reported.Earlier in the trial, the second of Le Scouarnec’s sons, now aged 42, told how he had been repeatedly abused by his paternal grandfather as a child aged five, nine and 10.“I will have the images in my head all my life,” he said. “It happened several times, in the bedroom, at home, in the kitchen, in front of the television, sitting on his knee …”The presiding judge, Aude Buresi, asked if he had confronted his grandfather or reported the abuse to the police. “No. I ask myself why every day. I even went to his funeral,” he said.Le Scouarnec’s brother, Patrick, 70, addressed the court, saying the brothers had been close as children but Joël had had few friends and was “always solitary”. He told the court that Le Scouarnec’s former wife, Marie-France, must have known of the alleged abuse. “She was aware of her husband’s actions and she did nothing,” he said.Marie-France has insisted she was not aware of his alleged abuse. However, a letter she wrote to a friend seven years before he was arrested by police and shown to the court on Tuesday, read: “I ask you to save my son, the only one who doesn’t know about his father’s past.”On Wednesday, Marie-France later told the court she “suspected nothing”, saying: “There’s nothing to make me think this. Nothing, nothing, nothing … I never had any doubts.”Le Scouarnec kept detailed handwritten notes documenting his alleged abuse, including victims’ names, addresses, dates and where the abuse happened. He was allowed to continue practising at hospitals in Brittany and the west of France despite a 2005 conviction for possessing child abuse images for which he was given a four-month suspended sentence.In 2020, he was given a 15-year jail sentence after being convicted of assaulting four children.On the opening day of his current trial, Le Scouarnectold the court he had done “hideous things”.On Wednesday, several victims walked out of the room where the trial is being retransmitted – the court is too small for all to be present – after one of Le Scouarnec’s only friends dismissed the abuse allegations as “histoires de braguette”, akin to sexual “tittle-tattle”.Judge Buresi denied a request for the hearing to be suspended, saying there were likely to be more difficult moments to come.The trial is expected to last four months.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

Both leaders are expected at a defence summit in London on Sunday.But hanging over Starmer’s talks with Trump will be pressure to extract asecurity backstop. The prime minister is expected to spell out that any British boots on the ground would be contingent on the US providing support including air, logistics and communications.“The security guarantee has to be sufficient to deter Putin from coming again, because my concern isif there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious for all to see,” he said on the flight to Washington.The decision to commitBritish troops to any peace-keeping force, which could put them on the frontline of a conflict with Russia, was “not taken lightly”, he said. “It’s a considered decision. We are still in discussions as to what that might look like.”Ahead of his own visit to Washington, President Zelenskyy confirmed that a deal to share some of Ukraine’s mineral wealth with the US had been agreed, although he added the initial agreement was more of a framework and that he also still needed American security guarantees.However, the US president appeared to immediatelyreject demands for a backstop. “I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. We’re going to have Europe do that, because we’re talking about Europe as the next-door neighbour,” he said.“But we’re going to make sure everything goes well. As you know, we’ll be really partnering with Ukraine in terms of rare earth. We very much need rare earth. They have great rare earth.”UK officials played down expectations of a breakthrough on the issue during the White House talks, stressing that this was just the beginning of a process with very little already agreed and talks set to continue for weeks.“When there’s a Trump presidency the rhetoric is always very destabilising, but if you zoom out you can see what’s going on. The president has been very clear he wants to end the war. We just need to focus on how,” one said.In recent weeks, Trump has upended the transatlantic alliance and the western consensus on Ukraine, alarming European nations by aligning the US with Moscow including at the United Nations. Yet Starmer is going into the talks with a clear message that Putin is the aggressor, after the US president falsely claimed Ukraine had started the war.“There’s one aggressor here and that’s Russia, in clear breach of the UN charter. Russia can end this conflict tomorrow by withdrawing and stopping their aggression,” Starmer told the Guardian.“All the discussion that follows about talks, about security guarantees, has to be seen in that context. They are the aggressor. They have invaded and occupied a sovereign country in Europe, and they bear full responsibility for the conflict.”However, despite some of Trump’s more far-fetched claims over Ukraine, Starmer said there was “no issue” between them on the approach to Putin. “Of course, the president has been very clear about the peace that he wants. He’s right about that. We all want peace. The question is, how do we make sure it’s a lasting peace? There’s no issue between us on this.” He was certain the US president could be trusted, he added.In a surprise speech on Tuesday, Starmer announced thebiggest increase in UK defence spendingsince the end of the cold war. The budget will rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – three years earlier than planned – and with the ambition to reach 3%, paid for by cutting aid spending, a decision that has dismayed many Labour MPs.The prime minister, asked whether he could reassure the British people over the prospect of further conflict, said the government was taking the “necessary measures” to keep the country safe. “Because Putin has already caused insecurity in our country, in our waters, and air, in cyberspace,” he added.Starmer will be accompanied at the White House byDavid Lammy, the foreign secretary, Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, and Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff. The new UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, is also likely to be there.He is expected to urge Trump not to impose damaging trade tariffs on the UK, arguing that the two countries have balanced trade, which means Britain should be spared.“We’ve got a balanced book as it were, when it comes to trade,” he said. “We’ve got strong trade, millions and millions of pounds either way with the US. It’s pretty balanced in terms of surplus and deficit, and obviously I will act in our best economic interests.”He was expected to meet US business leaders who are investing in the UK on Wednesday, in an attempt to strengthen the bilateral trading relationship which is already worth about $400bn (£315bn).The deal for the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands is also likely to be discussed, with Lammy telling ITV’s Peston show that “if President Trump does not like the deal, the deal will not go forward”.Starmer is set to dangle the prospect of a second state visit to the UK for Trump. “He’s very fond of the royal family, as you know,” he said. A No 10 spokesperson added: “President Trump has a great and deep respect for the royal family and has met King Charles on several occasions. The prime minister would absolutely welcome a visit by President Trump to the UK in the future.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerDonald TrumpEuropeDefence policyRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

He later admitted he was taking revenge on “you [westerners] who kill Muslims every day”.Armed with a kitchen knife, Aouissaoui almost decapitated 60-year-old Nadine Devillers, stabbed Barereto Silva, a 44-year-old Franco-Brazilian care worker, and slit the throat of Vincent Loqués, a 55-year-old church worker, at the Notre-Dame basilica.He was convicted of the three murders and six attempted murders.On Wednesday the court made the rare decision to give him the maximum sentence of life imprisonment with almost no chance of parole for the attack described in the trial as one of “unusual savagery”.The presiding judge, Christophe Petiteau, described the murders as “very violent” and said the sentence reflected the judges’ verdict that Aouissaoui presented a “too high risk” of reoffending.Petiteau described Brahim Aouissaoui as “an extremely dangerous man” whose “intention to kill could not be disputed”. His actions could not be described as being the result of a spontaneous “mad act”, the judges added.The investigating magistrate said Aouissaoui had described France as “a country of miscreants and dogs” and said he was determined to “sow terror”.The court was told that Aouissaoui had dropped out of school in Turkey at the age of 13 and was drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis at the time. He was radicalised at the end of 2018.In a closing address to the special court, the counsel for the national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said Aouissaoui was “locked into his totalitarian and barbaric fanaticism”. He added: “The attack was in reality the culmination of a jihadist commitment born in Tunisia.”It took seven police officers to arrest Aouissaoui, who was shot several times. Afterwards, officers said he was carrying a copy of the Qur’an, three knives and two mobile phones.‘Tell my children I love them’: the victims of the Nice attackRead moreAccording to the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office there were “many indications that at the time he left Tunisia … the accused intended to carry out an attack in France”.A national day of mourning was held forthe three victims. The killings came two weeks after the history-geography teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded near his secondary school north-west of Paris by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee angered at reports he had shown pupils caricatures of the prophet Muhammad in a lesson on freedom of speech.Aouissaoui had crossed the Mediterranean from Tunisia to Italy a month before the attack and then entered France overland.Explore more on these topicsFranceIslamReligionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The judgment becomes final after the expected appeal process.Dodik and his lawyers weren’t in court during the sentencing. He has said he would disobey any conviction and threatened “radical measures” in response, including eventual secession of the Serb-run entity in Bosnia called Republika Srpska from the rest of the country.Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join neighbouring Serbia,which prompted the Biden administration to impose sanctions against him and his close allies. Dodik was also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies.Dodik’s separatist threats have stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war erupted when the country’s Serbs rebelled against independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a mini-state with the aim of uniting it withSerbia. About 100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced.The US-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war and created two regions, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, which were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Serb and Croat members.Dodik has repeatedly clashed with the top international envoy overseeing the peace, Christian Schmidt, and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska. The Dayton peace agreement envisages that the high representative can impose decisions and change laws in the country.Bosniak official Camil Durakovic said the verdict against Dodik showed that “no individual is above the state and that everyone will be held accountable for their actions”.Dodik, a supporter of Donald Trump, spoke on Wednesday to thousands gathered in the Bosnian Serb administrative capital, Banja Luka.“They say I am guilty, but now people here will say why I am not guilty,” Dodik told the crowd after the verdict was announced. “There is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations.”In Serbia, its populist president, Aleksandar Vučić, called an urgent session of the national security council, then flew to Banja Luka to support Dodik. He described the verdict as “shameful, unlawful, antidemocratic and designed to break down Republika Srpska and the position of the Serb people”.Dodik is unlikely to be sent to prison for now because he enjoys the full support of Vučić, who can provide him shelter in Belgrade.Dodik told the crowd he spoke by phone with Hungary’s prime minister,Viktor Orbán, whom he called a friend.“The political witch-hunt against President @MiloradDodik is a sad example of the weaponization of the legal system aimed at a democratically elected leader,” Orban said on X. “If we want to safeguard stability in the Western Balkans, this is not the way forward!”Explore more on these topicsBosnia and HerzegovinaSerbiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Fendis celebrated 100 years in fashion with a show that began with a cameo by Dardo and Tazio, seven-year-old great-great-grandsons of house founders Edoardo and Adele. The twins’ jewellery designer mother, Delfina, designed the snake chain bracelets and shimmering fountain earrings in the show; their grandmother, Silvia, artistic director of accessories and menswear, presided over the evening as master of ceremonies.Fendi is now owned by LVMH. “So I’m not here because I own it – I don’t,” said Silvia backstage before the show. “But nothing changed for me when we sold. This is still my home.”This night was both business – over 1,000 guests, more than 100 new outfits which will soon be on sale, a stellar cast including British models Yasmin Le Bon, 60, and Penelope Tree, 75 – and sentiment. The role of womenswear designer is now vacant, after the departure of Kim Jones last year. Recruitment for his successor has been on ice during the centenary to give the Fendi family their flowers as they celebrate their milestone.Silvia Venturini Fendi is no ordinary nepo baby. In 1997, three years after she joined the family business, she designed the Baguette handbag. So named because of a svelte profile that allowed it to be tucked under an arm like a French loaf being carried home from the boulangerie, the Baguette became Fendi’s foremost product, namechecked in Sex and the City. Sarah Jessica Parker was at this show in honour of that pop culture moment.View image in fullscreen‘Fendi-ness’: Silvia Venturini Fendi described the spirit behind the centennial collection as ‘something alchemic’.Photograph: Luca Bruno/APThe anniversary collection was steeped in the codes of the 1960s and 1970s, soundtracked to Barry White. The catwalk was carpeted in the brick-red shade that Silvia remembers from the Rome atelier where her mother, Anna, worked when she was little. “I went there a lot because my mother was working very long hours, and she didn’t have a driving licence, so I would go with my father in the car in the evening to pick her up.”“We call it the Fendi-ness,” was Silvia’s name for the spirit of the show. “ It’s something alchemic. An obsession with quality. Luxury, a bit of fun, and a lot of incredible women.”The clothes were steeped in fashion history to reflect a grand heritage. Edoardo and Adele started out selling handbags and fur stoles, and the house still sells fur. There were grand greatcoats and precious lingerie evening dresses, soft Chantilly lace and tiny fingernail sequins. Ribbed knit dresses dissolved into lettuce hems.Silvia Fendi said she wanted a collection rich in memories, not a forensic trawl through the archive. Invitations for the show came in the form of exquisite accordion-style leather-bound, saddle-stitched photo albums, with tiny black and white portraits showing a five-year-old Silvia and a 1960s snap of her mother, Anna, and her four sisters Paola, Franca, Carla and Alda, magnificently beehived in the Rome atelier.Explore more on these topicsMilan fashion weekFashion weeksItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is an overreach of authority to rule an entire area of academic study out of bounds.”Palestine studies has grown as an academic discipline in response to the campus protests that rocked the US after 7 October attacks and Israel’s ensuing bombardment of Gaza.But the Cuny listing sparked immediate and intense backlash from Jewish groups and pro-Israel activists. Several critics, including watchdog groups, argued that the language describing the position “promotes antisemitism”.StopAntisemitism, a pro-Israel group, described the listing as part of a “antisemitic blood libel” at Cuny in apost on X.Pro-Palestinian professor says she was forced out of Columbia UniversityRead moreCuny wasa focal pointfor thepro-Palestinian proteststhat roiled campuses last year during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, resulting in dozens of arrests and prompting pushback from both the university administration and the state.The Nationreported earlier this month that Cuny is investigating members of its student government for their participation in protests and for promoting boycotts of Israel.In September of last year, Jonathan Lippman, a former state judge, submitteda reportto governor Hochul “noting an alarming number of unacceptable antisemitic incidents targeting members of the CUNY community” and arguing for an overhaul in how the university deals with antisemitism allegations.The controversies at Cuny are playing into broader debates about when anti-Zionism crosses over to antisemitism. “The Lippman report is a serious attack on the movement for Palestine,” one Cuny doctoral studentwrotewhen it came out. “Throughout this year, Jewish people, including organizations like [Jewish Voice for Peace], have played a central role in pointing out that anti-Zionism is not antisemitism and speaking out against the genocide. Yet, this report repeats this false equivalence.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkKathy HochulUS universitiesPalestinian territoriesUS educationUS campus protestsIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Relatives said he was killed while trying to collect some winter clothes for his family.He had fled with his children and grandchildren a week earlier when Israeli troops moved into the camp and ordered residents out within an hour. They scrambled to gather documents, valuables and phones, and had little time to pack clothes.“He went to get some things we need, but he was shot before he even got into the house,” said his daughter Samia Lahlouh, 45. “The grandchildren ask us: ‘Grandpa was old, and didn’t do anything bad, why did they want to kill him?” She didn’t have an answer.The Lahlouhs are among 40,000 people forced out of their homes in refugee camps across the occupiedWest Bankthis year, the largest displacement since Israel seized the territory in 1967.View image in fullscreenWaleed Lahloul’s daughter Samia, left, with one of his grandsons and daughters-in-law.Photograph: Emma Graham-Harrison/The GuardianThe Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that “evacuated” Palestinians would not be able to go back home this year, and sent three tanks to Jenin.Palestinians who have lost homes and loved ones over the past month have described Jenin as a “little Gaza” because of the scale of destruction, death and displacement.The same comparison is made inside Israel, with some cabinet members demanding the use of military tactics from Gaza, as domestic critics warn against the “Gazafication” of the West Bank.The far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has called for Palestinian cities there to be emptied and destroyed, as a pre-emptive strike to prevent attacks on Jewish settlers. “Nablus and Jenin need to look like Jabaliya,” hesaid in January, referencing one of theworst-hit areasof Gaza.At least seven Palestinian children have been killed by Israeli forces since the operation began in January, including a two-year-old girl shot dead in her home just outside Jenin, the UN said. Other victims include aheavily pregnant womanshot at a checkpoint.Lahlouh was a gentle, playful taxi driver born and raised in Jenin camp, who for decades poured his energy and money into educating his eight daughters, Samia said. All of them went to university, two became headteachers and one completed a doctorate.View image in fullscreenIsraeli forces in Jenin.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHe would visit their homes every Friday, bringing a plate of freshly made hummus and other local favourites for breakfast. Then he would gather his grandchildren round for reading and spelling contests, with prizes for the winners, focused as always on education.The day he was killed, Lahlouh got up early and left before anyone was awake. The family is crowded into the home of a relative in a village outside Jenin, separated from the camp by a few small rolling hills, but close enough that drones and planes buzz constantly overhead.His son, Sami, 40, rang to check in with him. “He told me: ‘I’m having coffee with my sister, then I’m going to the camp.’ I told him not to go, the [Israeli] army are there.”Lahlouh told Sami there was a break in the fighting so he wanted to collect a few warm things for everyone and check on the house.He had lived through multiple raids on Jenin camp, and fled his home once before, during the second intifada. He had seen neighbours killed and buildings razed by Israeli troops, and watched the death toll from Israeli attacks in Gaza climb toward 50,000.So he was wary of the Israeli military. But he didn’t believe soldiers would open fire on an old, unarmed man in broad daylight. “He thought it would be safe,” Samia said.A neighbour who worked as a medic called the family later that morning to break the news that Lahlouh had been picked up, badly injured. By the time the family reached the hospital, he was dead.“He was in front of the house, the paramedic told us. He never made it inside,” said Sami. “He so much wanted to go back home.” There was just one shot, medics told the family, which went through his abdomen.View image in fullscreenA woman carries her personal belongings as she walks past damaged buildings in Jenin.Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty ImagesIsraeli forces barred the family from burying him that day, which is required by Muslim tradition, and blocked all but one relative from attending. Sami – Lahlouh’s only son – was ordered to do a brief, solitary interment at 6.30am, driving from the hospital to the cemetery along a route fixed by Israeli forces.“We were given one hour for the journey and burial; they asked us to leave very fast,” he said. “They prevented his daughters, his sisters, his other relatives from coming to bury him. We were not granted this basic right.”The Israeli military said forces had killed Lahloul when they “carried out the standard suspect arrest procedure”. They fired warning shots at “a suspect” moving towards troops, then aimed at Lahloul, a spokesperson said.The military permitted only “a limited burial ceremony to take place under IDF escort and security” because the graveyard was an active combat zone, they said.Operation Iron Wall was announced on 21 January by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, “to defeat terrorism in Jenin”, a new objective in the multifront war Israel has been fighting in Gaza and across the region, including in Lebanon.The last major military operation across the West Bank was during the second intifada, more than two decades ago, when Israeli forces moved in to crush a coordinated uprising across the occupied territories and in a series of suicide attacks inside Israel.Jenin camp is a dense urban area settled by families expelled from homes in what is now northern Israel during the war surrounding the state’s creation in 1948. It has long beena centre of armed resistanceto the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and has been repeatedly targeted by Israel.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers take positions in the Jenin camp for Palestinian refugees on Monday.Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty ImagesIn 2002, after a 10-day operation in Jenin camp, a UN envoy described the situation as “horrific beyond belief”.Operation Iron Wall has already lasted longer than that campaign and displaced residents on a scale not seen since 1967. At least 44 Palestinians have been killed, including seven children, since it began.Many of those killed were unarmed and posed no imminent threat,the UN said, describing their deaths as part of a “continuously increasing number of apparently unlawful killings documented by the UN Human Rights Office”.The statement condemned the operation and called for an “immediate halt to this alarming wave of violence and mass displacement”.The Israeli military had loosened their rules of engagement, with troops allowed to shoot to kill anyone “messing with the ground”, Haaretz newspaperreported.The Israeli military denied changing open fire rules.Homes in Jenin have also been demolished in mass detonations, a new tactic amplifying an old strategy. In 2002 much of the camp was razed, and the army has used armoured bulldozers and other military vehicles to destroy homes, but they move at a slower pace.Hassan Amin, 50, had a home at the edge of one demolition zone. Now he shares a small apartment with 20 relatives in a village just outside Jenin.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises from Jenin refugee camp during an Israeli raid.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesLike the Lahlouhs, Amin said they were ordered to leave by loudspeakers on drones, and told which route to follow out of the camp. “We left against our will,” he said. “They gave us a certain route to follow, with checkpoints. As we walked there were drones over our head. Children, women and the elderly were all terrified.”The exodus on foot felt terrifyingly similar to all the reports about forced evacuations inside Gaza, Amin said, and what followed seemed copied from there, too.Katz said he had ordered Israeli forces “not to allow residents to return” in the coming year.The Israeli military said: “The IDF does not evacuate the population in [the West Bank]. However, the IDF has allowed local residents who wish to distance themselves from combat areas to leave safely through designated crossings secured by the forces.”Barred from returning home, Amin spends his days alternating between immediate worries about how to feed his family and longer-term fears they will never go home.His day-rate work has dried up, after the operation effectively shut down Jenin. Israeli military convoys have turned even the outskirts into a ghost town, with shops shuttered and usually crowded streets almost empty of cars.Schools are not opening, so his frightened and anxious children are at home all day, slipping behind on education.With the camp off-limits, he has spent long hours looking through Israeli military videos from Jenin for any clues as to whether their home survived. He spotted it, damaged and surrounded by rubble, briefly captured as a soldier walks past.“This is all we saw: part of our home is destroyed,” he said, freezing the frame on the video for a second. “We don’t know what happened.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An Israeli autopsy report ruled the children had been murdered by their captors and then mutilated to simulate wounds from bombing.The funeral was held in the town of Tzohar, near the border withGazaand the kibbutz of Nir Oz, where the family lived. The ceremony was private but mourners lined the road from the central city of Rishon LeZion holding Israeli flags and yellow banners, symbol of the hostage families and supporters, to watch the cortege go by.The children and their mother were to be buried alongside Shiri’s parents, who were killed in the Hamas attack on Nir Oz and other Israeli communities on 7 October 2023. Her husband and the boys’ father, Yarden, was also taken hostage in the Hamas attack, but was released under the ceasefire deal earlier this month, and discovered only then that his family had been killed.View image in fullscreenYarden Bibas embraces loved ones when he was released on 1 February.Photograph: Israel Defense Forces/ReutersThe Bibas family have denounced Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his government for making public graphic details of the two boys’ deaths. “This is outright abuse of a family that has already been enduring hell for 16 months,” Ofri Bibas, Yarden’s sister, said.Describing the funeral procession on Wednesday, she said. “Through the car window, I see a broken country; we won’t recover until the last hostage returns home.”View image in fullscreenPeople gather in Tel Aviv to watch a livestream of the Bibas family funeral.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAIn her address at the funeral, Ofri was bitterly critical of the Netanyahu government for prioritising the destruction of Hamas over an earlier negotiated hostage release. “Our disaster as a people and as a family should not have happened, and it must not, must not happen again,” she said. “They could have saved you and preferred revenge.”There had been fears that the ceasefire might collapse at the weekend, when Hamas released six Israeli hostages but Netanyahu’s security cabinet delayed freeing 602 Palestinian detainees due to be exchanged. Israel accused Hamas of violating the terms of the deal by staging propaganda ceremonies each time hostages were handed over. In response, Hamas said it would break off mediation talks and cancelled the scheduled handover of the bodies of four hostages on Thursday.View image in fullscreenPeople wave Israeli flags and yellow banners, the symbol of the hostage families and supporters, in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAA senior Hamas official said on Wednesday that there would be no public ceremony in the latest exchange.Overnight, Israeli officials confirmed to reporters Egyptian press reports that a deal had been done to exchange the bodies for the Palestinian prisoners, but added that the Palestinians would be transferred in stages.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Named the “Riviera of the Middle East” plan, the proposal has been criticised as a blueprint for ethnic cleansing.Footage shows the strip transformed into a Dubai-style resort with skyscrapers and luxury yachts. Children play on the beach as money rains down and bearded bellydancers gyrate on the sand.Trump, who says he wants the US to “own”Gaza, is presented as a revered icon in the footage. A boy walks along holding a golden balloon of the president’s head and a towering, dictator-style statue of Trump overlooks a city street.Elon Musk, Trump’s billionaire backer, appears several times, eating flatbread and later dancing as dollar bills fall from the sky. Musk’s Tesla electric cars cruise through the glossy streets.After the 78-year-old president shared the footage – which includes the caption “Gaza 2025 … what’s next?” – he faced a backlash on his social media platform.One Truth Social user wrote: “I could not be a bigger supporter of President Trump but this particular video is in very poor taste. Very poor taste, indeed!” Another wrote: “I hate this. I love our president, but this is horrible.”The video might have gone down particularly badly with Trump’s Christian supporters, with several comments referencing the idolatry of the golden statue, and others lamenting a scene showing Trump in a nightclub alone with a woman dressed as a bellydancer as a crowd looks on.“Only one deserves the glory and the honor, Mr President,” wrote another user. “The statue is a symbol of the antichrist, please humble yourself to God. Jesus is king and only Him.” Other users described the video as “sick” and “filth”.One account, with the name Kainoa P, wrote: “You’re doing great Mr President. But don’t let it get to your head. God put you in that position for His glory, not yours.”It was not immediately clear who had made the video, although it had been shared online previously by other accounts unrelated to the White House. Trump shared it without comment.What appeared to be AI-generated lyrics accompanied the images: “Donald’s coming to set you free, bringing the light for all to see, no more tunnels, no more fear: Trump Gaza’s finally here.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He filed a lawsuit against PVR Inox, India’s largest cinema multiplex chain, stating that: “The complainant could not attend other arrangements and appointments which were scheduled for the day and has faced losses that cannot be calculated in terms of money as compensation.”‘I thirst for you’: the inside story of Badnam Basti, India’s first queer filmRead moreThe lawsuit also accused multiplex cinemas of prioritising advertising revenue over their customers, and forcing them to sit through adverts against their will.In a ruling in February, the consumer court proved highly sympathetic to Abhishek MR’s case and ordered for the cinema to grant him 50,000 INR (£450) for wasting his time and 5,000 INR (£45) for mental agony, as well as cover his legal expenses.“In the new era, time is considered as money, each one’s time is very precious,” the court ruling stated. “Twenty-five to 30 minutes is a considerable amount of time to sit idle in the theatre and watch unnecessary ads. People with tight schedules do not have time to waste.”The cinema had defended itself, arguing it was legally required to show public service announcements. However, it was found that most of the adverts shown before the film had been commercial.Cinema is seen as a highly effective medium for advertising in India, and its share of the advertising sector is on the rise. Unlike western cinemas, in India, adverts are shown both before the film and during a 15-minute ad break in the middle of the feature.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

In a letter to British lawmakers on Wednesday, she wrote that the UK government’s order for Apple to create a “backdoor” to iCloud users’ accounts is a “clear and egregious violation of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties”.“Any information sharing between a government – any government – and private companies must be done in a manner that respects and protects the U.S. law and the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens,” Gabbard wrote.Gabbard’s letter comes after the US senator Ron Wyden and the representative Andy Biggs sent her a letter on 13 February with their concerns about what such a demand would mean for US residents’ online safety and privacy. Gabbard echoed their worries, saying that the order would “open up a serious vulnerability for cyber exploitation by adversarial actors” and could violate a bilateral agreement between the US and the UK.News of the UK government’s order first surfaced earlier this month when the Washington Post reported thatthe Home Office had issueda “technical capability notice” under the Investigatory Powers Act, which requires companies to help British law enforcement uncover evidence in investigations. The government demanded Apple build a backdoor into its cloud service that would allow access to people’s iCloud accounts, even when their information was encrypted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company said it had been given no choice and that it was disappointed at being forced to eliminate Advanced Data Protection. Apple has made a point of publicly fighting back against government requests for user data. It famouslyrefused to create a backdoorfor the FBI related to a terror attack in San Bernardino, California, in 2015.Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.In her letter, Gabbard said she was not aware of the UK government’s order until it was reported on in the media. She said that she’s requested her counterparts in various US security agencies, including the CIA, FBI and NSA, provide insights into UK’s actions. She added that US national security lawyers are working on a legal opinion about the implications of such a demand.The US and UK have entered into bilateral agreement called the Cloud Act that, Gabbard said, prohibits the UK from issuing demands for data of US residents or any persons located inside the country. The converse applies to the US government under the agreement.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAppleEncryptioniPhoneiCloudnewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking to broadcasters on Wednesday, Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, said that while it was “devastating” to cut aid, the cabinet was “united that the number one responsibility of any government is to keep its citizens safe”.Starmer’s proposal to raise defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, three years earlier than planned, with the ambition to reach 3%, comes in the context of a continued threat from Russia and the decision by Donald Trump’s government to edge back from the US’s decades-long pledges to protect European Nato members.In this context, it has been difficult for ministers or evenLabourMPs to express their views publicly. However, MPs from several wings of the party told the Guardian they were deeply worried at the plans.“It’s incredibly disappointing,” one said. “Reducing our foreign aid budget reduces our soft power and support for developing countries, which will impact us; it will make migration more likely.”Another said: “The increase in defence spending is absolutely right but they could have done it another way. The aid programme, if directed, can play a crucial role in future conflict prevention and is also crucial for climate migration in some of the world’s most climate-stressed places which, if not supported, will mean millions will have to leave their homes as they are uninhabitable.”Graph showing Norway is the proportionally largest development donor.The link between aid and migration is even more pertinent given that nearly a third of the existing aid budget is already used in supporting refugees who have come to the UK and are claiming asylum. While ministers hope to cut these costs by processing more cases, it is unclear what overseas projects will remain once the overall budget is cut further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We believe in foreign aid – but we have to make cuts. We must keep the UK safe | David LammyRead moreThis month, David Lammy warned that aid cutscould allow China to step inand further its global influence. Speaking to ITV’s Peston show on Wednesday, the foreign secretary said the aid cut was regrettable but also one of “the hard-headed decisions you make when you are in government”.Lammy said: “I’m saddened that we have had to reduce our development budget. But let’s be clear, this was not an ideological decision in terms of development.” It was, he argued, the sort of decision on defence and security you would expect a nation like the UK “to deploy at this most difficult of times”.Asked if there had been an impact assessment of the cuts, Starmer’s official spokesperson pointed to a review of ODA [overseas development assistance] spend, “which will ensure that every pound of development assistance is spent in the most impactful way”. He said aid would still reach conflict-hit areas including Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, but gave no further examples.Starmer faced some internal scrutiny of the decision at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday when the Labour veteran Diane Abbott said moving money from aid to defence “makes people less safe, not more safe because the desperation and the poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter”.Starmer stressed that it was not a decision he took lightly or wanted to take. “I want to be clear: we do of course want to go back and increase that funding as soon as we are able to do so,” he responded.Later in the day, Starmer said: “That is not a decision I wanted to take. That’s not a decision I’ve taken lightly. It does not mean we’re pulling out of the global stage, far from it.“And China actually hasn’t been giving that much in aid in any event.“But we’re not pulling away. I’ve been really clear about Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, because obviously they are conflict zones at the moment.“We’re not pulling out. Obviously we want to restore and increase overseas aid as soon as the economic circumstances allow us to do so.”Some Labour MPs, speaking privately, said they were concerned that the plan to increase defence spending had been made before the completion of the strategic defence review, which is examining what needs to be spent and where. One MP said it was “putting the cart before the horse”.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyDefence policyLabourAidEd MilibandKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

It consists of an edited clip from a Times Radio interview where Vince is asked: “Is a terrorist attack from Hamas Palestine defending itself?”“I think one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter, right? That’s how it works,” replied Vince, who claims the clip was used to imply that he supported the terrorist acts of Hamas.He has already forced the Daily Mail and GB News to apologise and pay damages to him over stories about the comments. He has been suing Staines, the editor-in-chief of theGuido Fawkeswebsite, and Tice, who tweeted in reference to the clip.After a high court judge’s ruling on early issues in the case, Vince said: “The court ruling today makes clear that I was seriously defamed by Paul Staines and that left him with no real prospect at a full hearing. He has therefore conceded.”Staines has agreed to pay damages of £9,995 and is also liable for Vince’s legal costs, which are expected to be in the region of £100,000.Vince added: “Whether Richard Tice wants to go all the way, I don’t know. I want him to accept that what he said was wrong, that it was defamatory as the judge has ruled today, and I would be happy with an apology, a correction and to move on. If he loses it will mean significant damages and costs.”Tice said: “The judge agreed at the hearing with me that my tweet was an opinion … which is a key defence to libel, that of honest opinion. Thus I won the hearing in respect of me, and it is almost impossible for Mr Vince to succeed in his claim. I expect to be awarded costs in my favour.”Explore more on these topicsDale VinceGuido FawkesRichard TiceMedia lawnewsShareReuse this content"

It also reported $0.89 in earnings a share on Wednesday, beating expectations of $0.84.Investors were on the lookout during the chipmaker’s earnings call for signs of slowing demand for its semiconductors, a potential indication of an end to the AI-fueled market boom that has propelled the company to a stratospheric valuation of $3.1tn. Nvidia’s financials gave no such signal.This earnings call was the first look at the company’s production and sales since China’sDeepSeek AIintroduced an AI model that beat many of those made in the US while requiring a fraction of the training and investment. The introduction of DeepSeek initially sent Nvidia’s valuation tumbling by hundreds of billions because the Chinese AI seemed to show that new models did not necessarily need to rely on the company’s most expensive, top-of-the-line graphics processing unit (GPU), as most cutting-edge models out of the US do.AI ‘godfather’ predicts another revolution in the tech in next five yearsRead moreIn his initial comments, the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that appetite for Blackwell, the company’s top-of-the-line GPU, remained strong.“Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law – increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,” said Huang. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter. AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.”While analysts expected Nvidia to maintain its leadership position as the maker of the AI industry’s favorite chips, recent news has presented new potential challenges to the company’s ownership of the market.Most recently, analysts at TD Cowenpublished findingsearlier in the week that Microsoft, one of Nvidia’s biggest customers, was cancelling leases with private data center operators. Investors expressed concerns about the sustainability of mass investment into AI infrastructure, including Microsoft’s $80bn, which would mean less spending on Nvidia’s wares.Nevertheless, neitherDeepSeeknor cancelled leases made an immediate impact on the company’s data-center revenue. Nvidia, which controls more than 90% of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs), reported a data-center revenue of $35.6bn for the final quarter of FY 2025. Wall Street had projected $34.09bn. The company also predicted it would bring in $43bn in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.Huang said DeepSeek has actually stoked enthusiasm for Blackwell because reasoning models, like the model that DeepSeek showcased, require 100 times more computing power, he said.“We designed Blackwell for this moment,” he said.Huang emphasized on the analysts call that the company expects demand for AI infrastructure to continue to grow as the technology continues to evolve. “Near-term, midterm and longterm” all signs point to increased demand, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI.”Following the earnings report, analysts said Nvidia’s continued success was evidence that “market jitters over DeepSeek” have not materialized.“Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides,” said Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst at eMarketer. “Blackwell generating ‘billions in sales’ validates Nvidia’s top position just as the market is expanding on the agentic and physical AI fronts. Short-term volatility is still on the horizon but Nvidia’s market command remains unmatched.”But some analysts say market reactions have been neutral because the company is now expected to blow Wall Street projections out of the water.“Nvidia’s latest quarterly sales are bigger than its entire annual revenue from just two years ago ... but with the stock already reflecting sky-high growth expectations, investors were hoping for an even bigger beat,” said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Markets. “Some analysts had anticipated a guidance figure north of $45bn and while Nvidia delivered strong numbers, it wasn’t the ‘blowout’ some were hoping for.”The company also said it was still unclear how Donald Trump’s tariff proposals would impact its business.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaDeepSeekArtificial intelligence (AI)ChinanewsShareReuse this content"

His predecessor had recommended resentencing the pair, arguing they had paid their debt to society.Mark Geragos and Cliff Gardner, the brothers’ attorneys, praised Gavin Newsom’s decision.Los Angeles DA opposes new trial for Menendez brothers over parents’ deathsRead more“This initial step reflects the governor’s considered decision to at least obtain the information required to make a fair decision as to whether Erik and Lyle, after 35 years in prison, have done the hard work necessary to have a chance at a life outside prison,” the attorneys said.The development represents the latest twist and turn in the legal saga of the Menendez brothers, who have said for decades that they killed their parents in self-defense after years of sexual, physical and psychological abuse by their father.Erik and Lyle were convicted in 1996 of the murders of José, a prominent entertainment executive, and Kitty. They shot their parents multiple times as they watched television in their Beverly Hills home in August 1989. Prosecutors said there was no evidence of abuse, and argued they killed their parents in order to receive a multimillion-dollar inheritance. The brothers were ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms each.View image in fullscreenErik and Lyle Menendez.Photograph: California corrections department/APIn recent years, the case – particularly the brothers’ accounts of abuse – have attracted significant new attention. Last year, they were the subject of adocumentaryand a popular, albeitcontroversial,Netflix series, and received a torrent of support from criminal justice reform advocates, includingKim Kardashian.InOctober, George Gascón, then the Los Angeles county district attorney, announced he was recommending that theMenéndez brothersbe resentenced, citing he believed they were “subjected to a tremendous amount of dysfunction … and molestation” and in the time they spent in prison they had been on a “journey of redemption and rehabilitation”. Family members praised the decision, describing it as “recognition of the abuse” the brothers suffered. Supporters hoped that they might be released in time for the holidays.But Gascón lost his seat in November to Nathan Hochman, who had argued the timing of the announcement was a political move that put a “cloud over the fairness and impartiality of his decision”.Last week, Hochman said he did not believe the brothers deserved the new trial that they petitioned for in 2023, and cast doubt on new evidence of abuse, while urging the court to deny a habeas petition from the brothers. He also said that Newsom had “unilateral” power to commute the brothers’ sentence that he could exercise immediately. The governor, however, has said he will not make a decision until Hochman completes his review.The Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS crimeLos AngelesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” Bezos said.“We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.”Bezos’s decision to inject more regular and weighty conservative theming will also see the departure of opinions editor David Shipley, although it was not immediately clear if he was fired for resisting Bezos’s direction, or chose to resign.Shipley had been in discussions over the content of the opinion section of the paper for several weeks, according to theNew York Times. The dialogue began in January when Will Lewis, the chief executive of the Post, sent a memo to Shipley outlining Bezos’s new vision.Shipley pushed back against the idea, arguing that restricting content in the way Bezos proposed would lose the breadth of viewpoints aired in Post opinion, the Times reported.Shipley joined the Washington Post in 2022 as editorial page editor and was in that job when Bezosblocked the Post’s editorial boardfrom publishing an endorsement for Kamala Harris,Donald Trump’s Democratic opponent, before last November’s presidential election, sparking outrage.But he defended the Post’s decision in January not to publish a satiricalcartoon by Pulitzer prize winner Ann Telnaesthat depicted Bezos and other billionaire media company owners kneeling at the feet of a giant figure of Trump, offering bags of money.Telnaes resigned, one of a growing number of departures of senior Post employees during a tumultuous time for the newspaper. Itlost 250,000 subscribersafter Bezos blocked the Harris endorsement, and a slew of star writers joined rival publications.In his message on Wednesday, Bezos emphasized that he’s “for America, and proud to be so” and that he offered “David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter.“I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no.’ After careful consideration, David decided to step away… I respect his decision,” he wrote.Bezos also shared the letter to staff directly on hisX page.Bezos’s extraordinary rightward shift prompted a scathing response from the paper’s legendary formereditor Marty Baron. Baron called the billionaire’s intervention “craven” in an interview by the online outletZeteo.“He’s basically fearful of Trump. He has decided that, as timid and tepid as the editorials have been, they’ve been too tough on Trump,” Baron said.He later told the Guardian via email on Wednesday: “What Bezos is doing today runs counter to what he said, and actually practiced, during my tenure at The Post. I have always been grateful for how he stood up for The Post and an independent press against Trump’s constant threats to his business interest. Now I couldn’t be more sad and disgusted.“Bezos argues for personal liberties. But his news organization now will forbid views other than his own in its opinion section,” Baron continued, noting that only a few weeks ago, the Post described itself in an internal mission statement as intended for “all of America”.“Now, its opinion pages will be open to only some of America, those who think exactly as he does.”Baron, who was the top editor of the Post from 2012 until he retired in 2021, added: “At a time when we’re talking about freedom and democracy, he is saying there will not be freedom and liberty on our own pages.”At the time Baron made those comments the Post was still being published with the slogan: “Freedom dies in darkness.”In the aftermath of Bezos’s email, Jeff Stein, an economics reporter for theWashington Post, spoke out about the billionaire’s edict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Users of the highway network within the [central business district] tolling area have already financed the construction and improvement of these highways through the payment of gas taxes and other taxes.”Shepherd further wrote in her letter: “The secretary’s letter stated that the FHWA will contact the New York state department of transportation and its project sponsors, Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and New York City department of transportation to discuss the orderly cessation of toll operations under the [central business district tolling program].”The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is responsible for public transportation in the New York City metropolitan area, and a New York bridge authority have filed suit to block the administration’s action.The US transportation department’s decision to stop New York City’s implementation of the program is intended to put ahalt to the city initiativethat imposes a $9 fee on drivers who enter Manhattan below 60th Street between 5am and 9pm on weekdays and a lower fee from 9am to 9pm on weekends.After last week’s letter from Duffy, Trump, who hasvowed to endthe program, prompted widespread backlash when he took to his Truth Social platform and wrote: “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD.

Only in acourt filing late on MondaydidRussell Vought, the CFPB’s acting director, clarify it would continue to exist – albeit in a “more streamlined and efficient” form – under the new administration.With the CFPB incapacitated by layoffs, work stoppages and widespread confusion over its future, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who played a key role in setting up the agency, held a forum on its future on Capitol Hill on Tuesday alongside other Senate Democrats.Lorelei Salas, who resigned as the CFPB’s director of supervision earlier this month, came with a stark message for consumers: the agency is “no longer able” to defend them. The threat of another financial crisis has risen, she cautioned.“You, your family and the economy itself has become less safe, secure and stable,” said Salas. “Your parents are more likely to see their retirement threatened by scammers and fraudsters. Your kids are more likely to be ripped off, or given the runaround by their student loan company.“Your sick spouse is more likely to be harassed by a debt collector for a medical bill they do not even owe. Your nephew who’s getting ready to be deployed overseas is more likely to be targeted by a predatory lender that sees them as just another dollar sign in a uniform.“These are hard things to hear, but it is the truth. Millions of Americans are more likely to get ripped off because the CFPB was essentially fired from doing the job Congress gave it.”The White House and the CFPB were approached for comment.The CFPB has returned more than $21bn to consumers since 2011. But the agency attracted critics on the right, who accused it of overreach. “We’re trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse,” Trump told reporters earlier this month.The way Trump officials are treating the CFPB “could be one of biggest cons in recent history”, claimed Warren, who described it as “the theft of billions of dollars from American consumers”.The agency is processing thousands fewer complaints each day since Trump took office, according toanalysisreleased by Democrats on the Senate banking committee.“Elon Musk and Donald Trump are going all out to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and make it easier to cheat people out of their hard-earned money,” said Warren. “President Trump ran on lowering costs for families on ‘Day One’ – those were his words.“But instead of trying to lower costs, he and his co-president Elon Musk are putting an end to the millions of dollars this little agency delivers every single day for working people. For everyone who gets scammed or cheated because the CFPB cops have been taken off the beat, costs have gone up – not down.”In interviews with the Guardian, former insiders questioned why Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) had targeted the agency. “I think it’s basically a waste of taxpayer money, to throw out what’s been built all these years,” said Peggy Twohig, a veteran federal official who helped establish the CFPB.Recent layoffs “will have serious consequences on the bureau’s ability to do its work”, David Silberman, a former associate director of the CFPB, said. “If they want to keep the CFPB functioning, it’s going to be a whole lot harder without the people and the contractors they’ve let go.”Twohig, who worked for decades in government and was assistant director for supervision policy at the CFPB until 2021, said she struggled to understand how an agency created to stand up for individual consumers had become such a target for conservative figures.“It’s protection for the little guy against the big overreaches,” she said. “I believe in the fair market system, and competitive practices, but often in the race for profits there is a push or overreach.”In the early 2010s, Congress decided “there is a role for a regulator whose mission is to focus on consumer protection and to prevent markets from running amok”, said Silberman. “I personally share that view.”But “reasonable people” can debate the merits and pitfalls of its actions over the years, added Twohig, who noted that different administrations can shift the CFPB into new directions.“That’s very different to completely shutting down the agency, which I would argue is a complete waste to all this effort over the past years to create this agency which has brought a very good change to the regulatory landscape to help protect consumers.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationConsumer affairsElon MuskUS politicsShareReuse this content"

There was also a bit of snark: “bonus points to anyone who responds that they spent their government subsidy on hookers and blow,” one worker said.Within hours, the network had agreed on a recommended response: break up the oath federal employees take when hired into five bullet points and send them back in an email: “1. I supported and defended the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”“2. I bore true faith and allegiance to the same,” and so on.It was only the latest effort by a growing and increasingly busy group banding together to “expose harmful policies, defend public institutions and equip citizens with tools to push back against authoritarianism”, according to Lynn Stahl, a contractor with Veterans Affairs and a member of the network. Increasingly, the group is also trying to help its members and others face the thousands of layoffs that have been imposed across the federal government.Calling itself #AltGov, the network has developed a visible, public-facing presence in recent weeks throughBluesky accounts, most of which bear the names or initials of federal agencies, aimed at getting information out to the public – and correcting disinformation – about the chaos being unleashed by theTrump administration.With 40 accounts to date, their collective megaphone is getting louder, as most of the accounts have tens of thousands of followers, with “Alt CDC (they/them)” being the largest, at nearly 95,000 followers.The network has also formed a group and a series of sub-groups onWire, the encrypted messaging app, to share information and develop strategies – as played out on Saturday.View image in fullscreenA post from the #AltGov account for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Composite: Alt CDC (they/them)/BlueskyThe #AltGov hashtag has roots in the first Trump administration, perhaps most famously through the “ALT National Park Service” account on what was then Twitter, according to Amanda Sturgill, journalism professor at Elon University, whose bookWe Are #AltGov: Social Media Resistance from the Insidedocuments the earlier phenomenon. (Thataccount, with its 774,000 followers, has since moved to Bluesky. Its online presence is parallel to and separate from the #AltGov network.)The original #AltGov Twitter accounts were dedicated to “sharing information about what was happening inside government – which usually doesn’t get covered as much, because it usually works”, Sturgill said. Examples included the firstTrump administration’s deletion of data and separation of families through immigration policies, she said.The people behind those accounts also banded together to “provide services the government wasn’t providing” – like helping coordinate hurricane relief and distributing masks during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Those efforts were often coordinated in Twitter group chats.It was “a movement, more than an organization”, Sturgill said – and the same could be said of the current version, which moved its social media presence from X (formerly Twitter) toBluesky“because of the Elon mess”, said Stahl, referring to Musk’s 2022 purchase of the app. “It’s not safe to organize [on X] anymore,” she added.The current iteration has not been reported on to date, but the numbers of the Bluesky #AltGov accounts have doubled in recent weeks without media attention, Stahl said. The group internally vets all members “to make sure people work where they say”.View image in fullscreenAn #AltGov account compiles potential answers to Musk’s request for workers to list five things they accomplished in the past week.Photograph: Alt Fish and Wildlife Service/Bluesky“#AltGov dates from the firstTrump administration, but it’s even more needed now,” said an employee at Fema, the disaster response agency, who requested anonymity to avoid being targeted at work. She recently launched an #AltGov Fema account on Bluesky.

Everything is going on behind closed doors.”As an example, she mentioned the moment nearly two weeks ago when Trump and Musk brought attention to her agency, claiming that Fema was spending $59m on housing immigrants in New York hotels. The administration fired four Fema employees. So she turned to Bluesky andpostedon the #AltGov Fema account:Fiction: FEMA paid $59 million last week for illegal immigrants to stay luxury hotel rooms in NYCFact: FEMA administered funds allocated by Congress via the Shelter and Services Program (for [Customs and Border Protection]) which reimburses jurisdictions for immigration-related expenses. FEMA just sends the payments.“The official story the federal government was telling was a lie!” the #AltGov member told the Guardian. “Of course they didn’t throw CBP under the bus – because to them, those are the people who lock up immigrants.”‘We’re being treated as grifters or terrorists’: US federal workers on the fear and chaos of their firingsRead moreStahl, the federal contractor, said that #AltGov members are also increasingly turning their attention to what she called “action plans” for everyday citizens, such as calling members of Congress and attending town halls. “The idea is to get regular people aware of what’s happening … [and] maybe even inspire some people to run for office,” she said.And as Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) swings its “chainsaw” through federal payrolls and piles up layoffs, #AltGov members also are using encrypted chats to figure out how federal employees can help one another. “[A]re we thinking of gathering resources for terminated folks?” one #AltGov member recently asked on Wire. “We are gonna need food bank info and benefits and anything the [federal] unions don’t cover.” Others weighed in on building a website to cover such information.Sturgill said the first go-round of #AltGov was “interesting … [because] it kind of stood up a different way of governing by putting it in direct contact with people – a ‘government with the people’. Whether this [version] can take it further depends on how much of the government is left.”This article was amended on 26 February 2025.

It’ll be 25%,” he said.The EU vowed to respond “firmly and immediately” to “unjustified” trade barriers, signaling that it stands ready to retaliate swiftly against new tariffs.The bloc is the US’s third largest trading partner alongside China. Trump has said he will impose 25% tariffs on the US’s two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, next week.Trump did not give further details but mentioned carmakers and said the levies would be applied “generally”. “And that’ll be on cars and all other things,” he said.AEuropean Commissionspokesperson said: “The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, including when tariffs are used to challenge legal and non-discriminatory policies. The EU will always protect European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified tariffs.”Trump has made a series of announcements about imposing tariffs on the US’s largest trading partners but has repeatedlydelayedimposing the levies on Canada and Mexico.Earlier this week, Trump defended his tariff threats and said foreign cars, drugs and semiconductor chipswould be hitwithin weeks.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, met with Trump in Washington this week and had appeared confident that he had talked Trump out of a trade dispute with the EU and to concentrate instead on his dealings with China.“Come on, you cannot have a trade war with China and Europe at the same time. I hope I convinced him,” MacrontoldFox News after the meeting.According to Bloomberg, Trump’s tariffs could hit as much as $29.3bn (€28bn) of the bloc’s exports. The EU haspledged to retaliateimmediately if the US imposes tariffs on its member countries’ exports. “The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures,” the bloc’s executive body said earlier this month.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, has said the EU should do all it can to avoid “totally unnecessary and stupid tariff wars”.Many economists and even conservative publications, including theWall Street Journal, have warned that Trump’s plans risk hurting the US economy. On Wednesday, Trump took to Truth Social, his social media platform, to attack a Journal editorial that argued his tariffs on Canada and Mexico would backfire, hurting the US economy.Calling the argument “soooo wrong”, Trump wrote: “The tariffs will drive massive amounts of auto manufacturing to MICHIGAN, a State which I just easily one [sic] in the Presidential Election,” he wrote.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationEuropean UnionUS politicsEuropean CommissionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He had promised to shrink the company’s fossil fuel production to about 1.5m barrels a day and make BP a net zero energy company by 2050.Auchincloss said BP would instead focus on strengthening its production portfolio by starting up 10 large-scale oil and gas projects by 2027 and a further eight to 10 projects by the end of the decade.No need for countries to issue new oil, gas or coal licences, study findsRead moreHe said: “Our optimism for a fast [energy] transition was misplaced, and we went too far, too fast.”There has been growing pressure from investors for BP to shrug off its green pledges, which initially won praise from green groups buthave since been dilutedas BP’s share price fell.BP has lost almost a quarter of its market value in the past two years while the market value of its rivals Shell and ExxonMobil has increased as they pursued greater oil and gas production.The company also faces an existential threat from the activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which in recent monthshas amassed a stake in the oil company worth almost £3.8bn, or 5% of its shares.The New York hedge fund is widely expected to use its grip on the 120-year-old company to demand sweeping changes, including a potential breakup, to rescue its flagging market value.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arne Slot’s relentless side stretched theirPremier Leaguelead to 13 points with 10 games to play courtesy of an assured victory over Newcastle. The strongest team in the league is improving while so-called title rivals falter, and Anfield knows what is coming.At 9.22pm news filtered through ofArsenal’s draw at Nottingham Forestin the earlier kick-off. The first chant of “Liverpool, top of the league” emerged from the Kop. Alexis Mac Allister soon added to Dominik Szoboszlai’s first-half goal with an emphatic finish of his own and the title-winning atmosphere cranked up. Anfield was denied the chance to roar home league championship No 19 due to the pandemic. The procession towards No 20 affords Liverpool supporters plenty of time to make amends. The run-in is turning into a lap of honour.Arne Slot claims Liverpool players have silenced doubters with ‘mental strength’Read moreNewcastle signalled the end of a demanding sequence of five games in 15 days for the Premier League leaders. It was portrayed as a defining period in the title race and so it has proved. Liverpool have emerged in a more commanding position than they started, the doubts that followed Everton, Wolves and Aston Villa convincingly dispelled. Eddie Howe must hope key players return from injury and confidence is not too badly affected when the two clubs meet again in the Carabao Cup final in 18 days’ time. The Newcastle manager praised a display that was vastly improved on the previousaway game at Manchester City, yet his team never laid a glove on their impending Wembley opponents.Slot sat at the back of the directors’ box having been handeda two-match touchline banfor improper conduct following the recent Merseyside derby. With his assistant, Sipke Hulshoff, also banned for two games for his behaviour at Goodison Park it fell to a former Everton player, John Heitinga, to direct Liverpool from the technical area. In keeping with Slot’s entire Anfield reign, it was a seamless transition.There was no let-up from aLiverpoolteam that enjoys a clear view from the Premier League summit. Their work rate and desire were again exemplary, confidence understandably high. Luis Díaz was a tireless presence who Tino Livramento struggled to contain.Mohamed Salah thought he should have had an early penalty when, attempting to reach Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cute pass inside Lewis Hall, the Newcastle left-back tumbled in front of him and sent the forward sprawling. Salah was aghast when penalised for a foul on Hall. Slot was not impressed by the referee Stuart Attwell’s decision either, judging by his reaction in the stands. Better to keep a distance sometimes.Slot was soon celebrating in the posh seats, however, when Szoboszlai steered home a polished finish for the second successive game. Díaz was the architect of the breakthrough, attacking Livramento and flicking the ball back to the unmarked Liverpool midfielder when approaching the byline. Szoboszlai’s shot lacked power but sailed between the legs of Sandro Tonali and flicked off Dan Burn to beat an unsighted Nick Pope down the centre of Newcastle’s goal. The Hungary captain has been under instruction to shoot more and has clearly taken Slot’s message on board. The goals atManchester City on Sundayand against Newcastle were reward for relentless shifts from the increasingly influential midfielder.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai unleashes the shot which flicks off Dan Burn (centre) to put Liverpool ahead.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PANewcastle’s task had become more complicated before kick-off, in fairness, when Alexander Isak joined Joelinton and Sven Botman on the sidelines with a groin injury. The loss of his leading striker forced Howe to hand Callum Wilson a first league start of the season and adjust to a 4-4-1-1, with Anthony Gordon playing off the recalled forward. Wilson’s lack of match sharpness showed when he was twice played through on Alisson’s goal and twice fluffed the finish. The first, from Gordon’s piercing pass, would have been ruled out for offside anyway but Wilson was onside when Burn’s long ball caught out Ibrahima Konaté. His shot sailed well wide of the Kop goal.There was more belief in Newcastle’s second-half display but Liverpool ensured there was no way back in devastating fashion. The leaders’ second goal was another demonstration of Mac Allister’s intelligence and Salah’s vision.The Argentina international seized on a loose pass by Sandro Tonali and drove at the visiting defence before finding Salah. Liverpool’s prolific marksman was crowded out yet, with his route to goal closed off, he worked space for a return pass to Mac Allister. The midfielder swept an emphatic first-time shot into the top corner of Pope’s goal and Salah had his 22nd assist of the season in all competitions. A sublime cross with the outside of Salah’s left foot almost produced another but Díaz poked wide at full stretch at the far post.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But his actions were interpreted by many as traitorous amid heightened nationalism asDonald Trumpthreatens a trade war and muses about making Canada the 51st state.Canada’s ice hockey win over Trump’s America was her soft power laid bare | Colin HorganRead moreRegardless of Gretzky’s reputation, some observers say the reactions are proof that many Canadians could be looking for their sports heroes to take a stronger stance on Trump.“Observers of Canadian hockey look at Wayne Gretzky as essentially an immortal, a god, right? But the truth is, his relationship to the Canadian hockey public has been very different than say it was in 2002,” says Taylor McKee, an assistant professor of sports management at Brock University in St Catharines, Ontario.In 2002, Gretzky was the executive director of Canada’s gold medal-winning Olympic hockey team in Salt Lake City. There he was considered “MrCanada,” says McKee. Canadians who want that version of him to emerge at a time when there are external threats to the country, were left disappointed by Gretzky, he says.“They wanted a guy who was willing to stand up there and take bullets for the team,” he says. “Instead, they got the guy they saw essentially as a saboteur, or certainly someone they couldn’t trust.”Trump has insisted he will levy a 25% tariff on goods from Canada,set to be implemented next week. There have also been threats to annex the country and rumors of Gretzky as a possible prime minister under a Trump regime. All of it fueled thetensions that ran high in the crowdin Boston last week.Canadian singer Chantal Kreviazuk sang O Canada amid a smattering of boos from the Americans in the crowd. That came after the Canadian crowd in Montreal had loudly booed the US national anthem at their 4 Nations game against Finland on 13 February.View image in fullscreenWayne Gretzky, right, Team Canada’s honorary captain for the 4 Nations Face-Off, shakes hands with Auston Matthews of the United States during the pre-game ceremonies ahead of last Thursday’s final.Photograph: Brian Babineau/4NFO/World Cup of Hockey/Getty ImagesAt the final, Kreviazuk alsochanged the lyrics of the anthemfrom “in all of us command” to “that only us command” as a response to Trump’s annexation threats.Canada’s sudden-death overtime win in the final on Thursday, which became symbolic of the geopolitical fight, led to huge celebrations in cities and towns across the country in a way that was previously unexpected when the tournament was planned, says McKee.To fans, the game itself became important in a way not seen since the 1972 Summit Series,between the USSR and Canada, he explained. That all heightened Gretzky’s blunder through this moment.Aaron Ettinger, an associate professor at Carleton University in Ottawa who specializes in international relations and sports, agrees. “I’m not surprised people are so angry about it,” says Ettinger. “It’s the combination of the immediacy of the Trump problem and the slow, long-term erosion of the love affair with Wayne Gretzky over the last 25 years.”Gretzky’s coaching stint with the NHL’s Phoenix Coyotes in the mid-2000s was considered a failure and his political affiliations with then-prime minister Stephen Harper in 2015 ended up latching him to a sinking ship as Harper lost the election – which may have affected his image, says Ettinger. A continued affiliation with the US (where he has been a longtime resident) rather than Canada has been a contribution to some Canadians’ further souring on him over the years.Grant Prete, an 31-year-old Edmonton resident and hockey fan, says it’s Gretzky’s previous actions that led him to question the so-called Great One – but Trump’s threats toward Canada and the former hockey star’s continued affiliation with the president were the final straw. Gretzky has visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Florida residence on several occasions and attended his inauguration last month.Last week, Prete launched a petition to remove Gretzky’s name from a highway in the city where he shot to stardom on the Edmonton Oilers. It’s received more than 9,000 signatures and counting.“Gretzky has been silent on his entire stance with the annexation part of Trump’s political platform. … He’s just known to be very close and affiliated to Donald Trump,” says Prete. “I feel like it reaches a point where his silence on this topic becomes a response in itself.”Prete says he was already upset with Gretzky – for not making the effort to receive his promotion to Companion of the Order of Canada that was issued in 2009. But it hasn’t been an easy decision for him to create the petition. He said his older friends in particular have been upset at his criticism of Gretzky.BREAKING: The greatest hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky attended Donald Trump’s victory party at Mar-a-Lago.pic.twitter.com/iraCVi0xg6— Ian Jaeger (@IanJaeger29)November 9, 2024The generation gap is probably a factor with the current backlash. That’s because younger people may not have the same emotional connection with Gretzky, who has lived outside Canada for years and ended his NHL career in 1999, says Peter Donnelly, a professor emeritus of sports policy and politics at the University of Toronto.“Gretzky’s absence in Canada means that his fame and face value in Canada has an age limit. Few children know who you are talking about, and it’s difficult even to use him as an example with students, without adding an explanation,” he says.But it’s important to understand the Gretzky backlash is not tied to a political awakening for hockey in Canada, says Courtney Szto, an associate professor at Queen’s University in Ontario, who specializes in sports and injustice.Hockey players are not typically asked to reveal political affiliations. The anger toward Gretzky’s association with Trump is about threats to Canadian national identity – not about other human rights issues under the Trump administration, she says.“It’s more this notion of becoming the 51st state … not the deportation of immigrants. Our politics are not that different [from the US], it’s really just a fight about nationalism and loyalty.”When it comes to Gretzky’s future though, Ettinger says the reaction from his compatriots has shown his status in Canada is changing for good.“I can envision a situation where [Alexander Ovechkinbreaks NHL’s goalscoring record], everybody gives Wayne Gretzky … a standing ovation, we say thank you for all the memories and then we go our separate ways,” he says.Explore more on these topicsIce hockeyCanadaDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Jets ranked 29th out of 32 teams in the overall report card, falling eight spots from last year’s rankings.“They talked about the culture – it’s a problem, top down,” NFLPA chief strategy officer JC Tretter said of Jets players’ responses to the survey. “[They said,] ‘It’s a culture of fear here.’ And I think that stood out in those grades.”Players cited concerns that Johnson was not willing to invest in improvements, did not contribute to a positive workplace culture, and did not commit to building a competitive team. He ranked dead last among owners in the survey. The Jets slumped to a 5-12 record in the 2024 season, fired their head coach,were dogged by reportsthat Johnson’s teenage son Brick had a say in team decisions and missed the playoffs for a 14th successive season.While the Jets’ workplace situation worsened, theWashington Commanderssaw a drastic turnaround following the forced sale of the franchise by Daniel Snyder in 2023. New owner Josh Harris vowed to change the team’s reputation after last year’s NFLPA report graded the Commanders as the league’s worst workplace.The NFL’s next dynasty: from the Bills to the Eagles to post-imperial chaosRead more“I’m not an F-minus guy,” Harris said after acquiring the team.He delivered on that promise, as Washington jumped from 32nd to 11th in the overall rankings. First-year head coach Dan Quinn received an A+ grade from his players after leading the team to a surprising 12-5 record and an NFC Championship Game appearance. The Commanders also significantly improved their food services, travel accommodations, and family support, earning a B grade this year. Players for the Atlanta Falcons, Minnesota Vikings, Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions and Miami Dolphins also gave their head coaches an A+.The Super Bowl championPhiladelphia Eaglessaw an improvement in their workplace standing as well. After finishing 14th last year, they climbed into the top 10, benefiting from continued investment in their facilities and staff. Players praised the team’s commitment to performance and player well-being, reflecting the organization’s winning culture on and off the field.View image in fullscreenThe Washington Commanders, under new owner Josh Harris and new head coach Dan Quinn, saw a drastic turnaround following the forced sale of the franchise by Daniel Snyder.Photograph: Jess Rapfogel/Getty ImagesFor the second straight year, the Dolphins were ranked the NFL’s best workplace. They were followed by the Vikings, Falcons, Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers. The Falcons made the biggest leap, jumping from 25th to third, thanks to major facility upgrades, a new strength staff, and first-year head coach Raheem Morris’s A+ grade. The Houston Texans, Green Bay Packers, and San Francisco 49ers rounded out the top eight.At the bottom of the rankings, the Arizona Cardinals were rated as the worst team for workplace conditions, followed by the New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns, Jets, and Pittsburgh Steelers.While the league saw overall improvements in working conditions – including the resolution of past issues like dirty shower water, rats, and unstable weight room floors – the Falcons reported a ventilation issue in their locker room that caused “major complaints” about odor.Now in its third year, the NFLPA’s report card survey gathered responses from 1,695 players – 77% of the union’s active and practice squad members. Players awarded their teams 41% more A-minus or better grades than last year, while D-plus ratings fell by 51%.“What initially seemed a shame campaign is really, ‘How do we improve working conditions for our guys?’” NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell said. “It doesn’t mean you have to build a new building, but we’re saying, ‘Be responsible.’ And I’m seeing they are.”Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York JetsPhiladelphia EaglesWashington CommandersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Canada will play Mexico in one semi-final on 20 March with the US and Panama playing each other on the same day, raising the possibility that the two nations will play each other in either the Nations League final or third place game on 23 March.Trump’s comments on Canada prompt surge of patriotism – in a Canadian wayRead moreTrump has repeatedly antagonized Canada in comments and through official policy proposals like tariffs during his second term. On multiple occasions he has said that Canada could become “the 51st state” of the United States and has proposed tariffs that experts predict would kick off a trade war between the countries.Trump’s comments have already resonated in the sports world. The US national anthem was booed repeatedly at NHL and NBA games in Canada, while the countries’ meeting at the NHL’s 4 Nations Face-Off became an overtly political spectacle. In the final of that tournament, the Canadian national anthem singer changed the song’s lyricsin a direct rebuke to Trump, before Canada set off wild celebrationswith a victory.Marsch, the former Leeds United, RB Leipzig, RB Salzburg and New York Red Bulls head coach, said on Wednesday that international tournaments like the Nations League “mean something different now” given the current political climate, and said he finds the 51st state discourse to be “unsettling and frankly insulting.”“Canada is a strong, independent nation that’s deeply rooted in decency, and it’s a place that values high ethics and respect, unlike the polarized, disrespectful and often now, hate-fueled climate that’s in the US,” Marsch said. “It’s one of the things that I’ve enjoyed the most about our team, is that they exemplify this as human beings and as a team … So for me right now I couldn’t be prouder to be the Canadian national team coach. I found a place that embodies, for me, the ideals and morals of what not just football and a team is, but what life is, and that’s integrity, respect and the belief that good people can do great things together.”Canada, who appeared in their first men’s World Cup in 36 years in 2022, hired Marsch in 2024 and have continued to thrive. The team progressed to the third place game at the 2024 Copa América, anddefeated the US 2-1in a September friendly later that year. A win against Mexico at the Nations League finals would stretch the team’s unbeaten run to six games since the Copa América.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a different game. Sometimes, I don’t know what I was doing. I’m just glad it’s over, honestly.”The Mavs are on fire after the Dončić trade. Don’t expect them to put it outRead moreDončić was warmly greeted his former teammates, but also glared at the Mavs’ bench a few times during the night. He posted his first triple-double in a Lakers uniform, but also missed 11 of his 17 shots and was wild from three-point range. He made a dozen sublime passes and at least that many big defensive plays, yet he could only score two points in the fourth quarter of a tight game. That said, the 25-year-old capped a superb playmaking performance with an assist to LeBron James for a clinching layup with 32 seconds left.“It was so weird,” Dončić said. “There were moments I felt like I don’t know what I was doing. I’m glad we got a win.”James helped his new teammate by scoring 16 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter while Los Angeles held on for their third straight win and their 13th in 16 games.“We understood as his teammates that we wanted to try to get this win for him,” James said. “Obviously, we know what transpired not too long ago. As his teammates, we wanted just to back him in any way, shape or form. Happy that I was – along with my teammates – able to make a couple of plays down the stretch to get him this win. I know he probably won’t say it, but I think it means something to him for sure.”Kyrie Irving scored 35 points and Klay Thompson added 22 for the Mavericks.“It was awkward, but at the same time, it was fun,” said Irving, Dončić’s good friend. “We got a chance to feel like we were in practice all over again, going at each other. That was a good reflection point, and then just seeing the crowd cheer for him and just get him going and see him make some of the tough shots that I’ve seen him make thousands of times, that probably made it even more awkward. But it was fun. It’s fun competing.”Dallas general manager Nico Harrison,who is reviled by many Mavs fansfor making the trade was serenaded by Lakers fans chanting “Thank you, Nico!”Mark Cuban, who sold controlling interest in the Mavericks 14 months ago, also watched the game from courtside. The billionaire jokingly booed Dončić a few times before the player replied with a grin: “Shut up, Mark!”Davis is injured but still attended the game, and he got a standing ovation in the first quarter when the Lakers aired a lengthy tribute video to their longtime center, who waved his arms in gratitude.The next game between the teams should be even more intense. The Lakers visit Dallas on 9 April, and Mavs fans alreadyhave been extraordinarily vocalin their displeasure with Harrison and the Dallas ownership group.Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićDallas MavericksLos Angeles LakersNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Hamilton has always been a star but, entering his 19th Formula One season with a new start at Ferrari, he is now burning even brighter.In the chill wind of an ­unseasonably cold Bahrain for pre-season testing, Hamilton is a man anew as he takes on a challenge with theScuderia, reinvigorated as perhaps he has not been since last he struck out on his own course whenleaving McLaren for Mercedes in 2013.Christian Horner unhappy that Max Verstappen was booed at F1 curtain-raiserRead moreHe was the centre of attention from the moment he emerged from ­Ferrari’s hospitality area before climbing into the new SF25 in front of the horde of photographers who had gathered early, encamped outside his garage. Hamilton looked relaxed and at ease, with his new helmet, in the bright Modena yellow ofFerrari, setting off the distinctive overalls in the team’srosso corsa.Indeed, so at home has Hamilton made himself and so familiar he already looks interacting with his ­Ferrari teammates in Bahrain it seems hard to imagine that for so long he has been clad in Mercedes silver. It illustrates how quickly the world ofFormula Oneturns and how adept Hamilton is at assimilating and accommodating change.Previously there was at least some continuity, but this is the first time in his career that he has not driven with a Mercedes engine and that too was part of the learning process as he pounded round the Sakhir circuit, coming to terms with how the new horses hum.Hamilton, who usually dislikes testing, displayed no such lack of enthusiasm here. He has long not wanted to go out on the first run but was front and centre for the opening session. Just as well, as the second stint was halted for an hour and five minutes because of a power ­outage at the circuit and subsequently extended, with the times topped by McLaren’s Lando Norris.With it being the first serious run of the season, for much of the opening session the teams are assessing initial data from the car, not least in whether real life is living up to the computer and wind‑tunnel simulations. To that end, Hamilton and the majority of teams ran with the aero rake device early on, the ungainly collection of metal spars which sits, like an angry expressionist Meccano kit, behind the front wheels to assess the airflow.Once it was removed, however, the Ferrari cut quite a dash against the bland backdrop in Bahrain. The car sports a white streak across the engine cover which may irk the ­purists but it has elegant lines and from trackside it looked quick, even in these tentative steps.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton puts his new SF25 Ferrari through its paces on the circuit in Bahrain.Photograph: David Davies/PAHamilton duly nailed down 70 trouble-free laps and was fifth ­fastest in a session headed by the driver who replaced him at Mercedes, the rookie Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, although timings at this stage are all but meaningless. There was a minor run wide toward the end at turn four, likely coming as the seven-time champion began to push his new ride and get a feel for where its limits lie.Cautious optimism was his mood afterwards. “Everything feels good,” he said. “There’s more to do over the next few days to get through our programme and understand the car to the best of our ability, but right now I’m looking forward to getting out there again tomorrow.”These are then still early days at Ferrari but alongside the serious faces of mechanics and engineers who have to pack an awful lot of work into three short days, there is also a palpable sense of optimistic zeal around theScuderia. Hamilton referred to it as a “magic” possessed by the team but it is impossible that they too have not been inspired by the ardour of the seven-time champion.He has spoken repeatedly of how motivated he is, not least by the dual challenge of a new team and a steely eyed determination to win the ­championship with them. It is ­notable that he is framing it not as securing his record-breaking eighth title but rather as one of taking ­Ferrari’s first drivers’ ­championship since 2007. It is significant that ­Hamilton has the team goal as a ­central target and this will not have gone unnoticed at Ferrari.Intriguingly, Hamilton’s car too had caught the eye, not least of the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, whose cars have dominated the sport since the regulation changes of 2022. “Into this cycle of regulations it’s clear the cars have converged and they look very, very similar,” he said. “Ferrari is the standout as probably being a differentiator.”It is still too early to tell whether ploughing a singular furrow will pay off but they do already have ­Hamilton, who has proved to be an effective differentiator himself and who is now champing at the bit to be given the tools to get the job done. Two more days of putting in the laps in the desert then and he at least will have a good idea if Ferrari have risen to match the boundless verve with which he has embraced his new task.Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in Spring Training this year, players can ask technology for a little helpHannah KeyserWed 26 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 05.04 ESTShareFor the first time ever this month, major league players who disagree with an umpire’s rendering of the strike zone can do something about it. Somethingother thanan exaggerated pantomime of disbelief or a testy reply liable to get them thrown out of the game entirely. They can do something effectual, productive, process-based. They can appeal to a higher power, one that has become revered within the sport for its ability to optimize anything and everything: Technology.Major League Baseball is testing the challenge system version of theAutomated Ball-Strike System(ABS) in roughly 60% of Spring Training games this preseason. In layman’s terms: this spring, players can ask robot umps to review pitch calls.“It’s fucking great,” says one major league coach. “The best thing sincethe pitch clock.”The New York Yankees’ repeal of their facial hair policy is simply businessRead moreHere’s how it works: Human umpires call balls and strikes as usual, but Hawk-Eye technology – which will already be familiar to fans of sports such as soccer, tennis and cricket – measures each pitch relative to the strike zone. Each team starts the game with two challenges. The batter, catcher, or pitcher can challenge if they disagree with a call – challenges must be issued within seconds and without input from teammates and coaches – by tapping their head. Hawk-Eye then confirms or rejects the challenge. Successful challenges are retained; if the umpire’s call is confirmed, the team loses a challenge.A single pitch – for example, a called third strike to end an inning with the bases loaded – can swing the trajectory of a whole game. Now, if that moment hinges on a missed call, there’s recourse to right any human error. But it’s still very much in the hands of human actors.To the league’s credit, testing of the ABS system has been meticulous and incremental – starting nearlysix years ago in the independent Atlantic League. Along the way, as trials moved into and up through affiliated ball, the consternation has largely been around getting the strike zone exactly right. For instance, it may seem like the strike zone is a three-dimensional space, but a ball that drops below the zone as it crosses the plate may just barely knick the very front edge of a 3D ABS zone without ever really being hittable. Through trial and adjustment, MLB settled on a two-dimensional rectangular zone positioned over the middle of home plate. The zone also varies in size depending on the height of the batter. In service of this, MLB employed atwo-step system of measuring every playerearlier this spring to calculate individual strike zones.But, if we can make every call perfect, why not have ABS judge every pitch? As recently as the start of last season, Triple-A – the highest level of minor league baseball – was using full ABS half the week and the challenge system the rest of the time. But the challenge system emerged as the definitive favorite andMLBopted midseason to commit to it.Why? First of all, it’s a useful incremental step: it’s easier to ramp up the use of robots rather than retract it, if and when MLB ultimately implements ABS in meaningful major league games. Beyond that, full ABS wouldradically reshape the role of catchers, with ramifications for the look and feel of the game. And, perhaps most interestingly for fans, as the sport trends toward prescriptive optimization, the game-within-a-game introduced by the challenge system adds back new opportunities for strategy – and new pitfalls for imprudence.View image in fullscreenArizona Diamondbacks catcher Gabriel Moreno challenges a call.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/AP“Some teams probably said, ‘Hey, just do whatever you want,’ but we definitely had a strategy going in,” says Mick Abel, a pitcher in the Philadelphia Phillies system who has experience of ABS when playing at lower levels.What was the strategy?“Be smart; don’t blow them in the first few minutes.”Anything else?“Use your brain. Don’t let the emotions overcome what you think is right. Just stay neutral about it.”And since it’s hard to be totally unbiased about your own work, that often means letting catchers handle challenges for the defense.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis seems to be an early consensus in spring:pitchers shouldn’t challenge. Even after he successfully challenged one of his own pitches in an appearance for the Pittsburgh Pirates over the weekend, Caleb Ferguson decided, “I think, in the long run, I’m going to leave that to the catcher.”In some ways, though, Spring Training is an imperfect test for establishing that kind of understanding of the system. Team priorities are not exactly aligned with the league’s – while MLB would like to see how players use the challenge system in a competitive environment, the teams know a little too well what is (and is not) at stake.“Why work on a strategy we’re not going to use?” Cincinnati Reds managerTerry Francona saidabout why he’s told big leaguers tonotchallenge at all since it won’t be available in the regular season this year.Rob Thomson, the Philadelphia Phillies manager, came to a similar conclusion for a more subtle reason. He doesn’t want his established guys – for whom spring training is an important warm up but not determinative of whether they make the team – burning challenges that could be used by fringe players, the guys who need every at bat to prove themselves.“Try to save those challenges for guys who are trying to make the club,” he says, “or [it’s their] first year in the organization, they’re trying to impress.”If itwasimplemented in meaningful games, it would be easy enough to adjust that strategy.“You’d probably try to save one [challenge] for the end, if you can, and big situations. Bases loaded, one out, two-strike pitch with [Bryce] Harper at the plate. Challenge it,” Thomson says. He would like to see teams that burn both challenges earlier in the game get another one in the ninth inning specifically for that reason.At some point, if the challenge systemisin a position to affect meaningful games, front offices will get more involved in analyzing how and when to best deploy them. In the same way they run similar cost-benefit analysis for attempting a stolen base in different situations, they’ll calculate the optimal leverage opportunity to be worth the risk of a borderline challenge.And like stolen bases, it’s something players could learn to excel at, new ground to eke out a competitive edge. In that way, the addition of robots doesn’t necessarily wrest any of the game away from the people on the field, it just gives them more tools.Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After the play Awaziem, a Nigeria international, complained to referee Pierre-Luc Lauziere, seemingly pleading with the official to take some sort of action. The match was paused for around five minutes as the referee engaged in discussions with Awaziem, Palencia, his fellow officials and both teams’ coaches. He then allowed play to continue with no discipline handed out. Awaziem later confronted Palencia after the final whistle.Lionel Messi cracker lifts Miami over Sporting KC into Champions Cup last-16Read moreAfter the match, Rapids head coach Chris Armas confirmed that Awaziem alleged that Palencia had used a derogatory term.“Awaziem was pretty clear and upset at a derogatory term,” Armas told reporters. “He was clear about what was said. Our club, myself, we’re fully behind our player to support him with an investigation into what exactly what went down. He was pretty upset.”LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo said as much, telling reporters that “One of Colorado’s players had heard something, a word, that bothered him. He thought that it was directed towards him.”Cherundolo later said he did not hear the alleged incident, and that “if players hear something and they can’t play, we want to support the players. We’ll let the referees and Concacaf figure that out.”Concacaf has said it will investigate the allegations. The nature of the alleged derogatory term is not yet known.“Concacaf has initiated an investigation into a reported incident between players Chidozie Awaziem of Colorado Rapids and Sergi Palencia of Los Angeles FC during last night’sConcacaf Champions Cupmatch,” a Concacaf spokesperson said. “The investigation will involve a thorough review of the match officials’ reports, available match footage, and the respective positions of both clubs.”The Rapids said in a statement later on Wednesday that they “fully support” Concacaf’s investigation, while LAFC said in its own statement that they are “cooperating fully” with the inquiry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were energetic and incisive, threatening to tear Tottenham apart. Erling Haaland was back after injury and his 20th goal of the Premier League season – and 28th overall – was scant reward for their dominance.City’s previous visit to this stadium in late October had brought their first defeat of the season –in the Carabao Cup– and it is remarkable to consider how they have fared since then. Before kick-off here and taking in that result, their record showed 14 losses in 27 games in all competitions. They looked set to make a more coherent statement.Maguire heads Manchester United past Ipswich despite Dorgu’s red cardRead moreThen the second half happened and we were reminded of why City have sunk so far. The conviction evaporated in the face of Spurs showing plenty of it themselves – aggression, too – and the equaliser looked on. Ange Postecoglou’s team were a different beast, pressing hard and they had the chances.The big one came at the very end and what a story it would have been if Pape Sarr, on as a Spurs substitute, could have adjusted his body to head home after Son Heung-min, who had also come off the bench, had flicked on a Pedro Porro cross. Sarr nodded over. There were 98 minutes on the clock, well over the additional four that had been signalled because of what happened immediately before – a lengthy VAR check on a Haaland effort that stood to make it 2-0. It was ruled out on the field for handball, too hastily according to Pep Guardiola.Haaland seemed to have gained an advantage with his upper arm to set himself after a touch from another substitute, Phil Foden. The VAR officials could find nothing conclusive to overturn the decision. And so Spurs went straight up to the other end for a moment of high drama. Sarr could not quite bring the house down.The Spurs support could tell everyone beforehand that they had always won against City in the league at their rebuilt stadium when they had wanted to win. Remember the weirdness aroundthis fixture last season– and the implications of them helping Arsenal to secure the title if they had not lost. Spurs, though, were poor in the first half.View image in fullscreenTottenham’s Pape Sarr (in white) heads over Ederson’s goal late on.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersCity were in the mood, bristling with attacking intent. Omar Marmoush, up alongside Haaland, caught the eye again while Jérémy Doku was electric on the left. Savinho was a danger on the other flank. All four were involved in the goal and it had been coming, Haaland having swiped at a chance moments earlier.Marmoush got City moving when he rolled away from Kevin Danso and Savinho found Haaland, who went left to Doku. Haaland made for the middle and when Doku crossed low, the ball deflected and fell for the City No 9. He was close in and never going to miss.Doku sent chills down spines in the South Stand when he ran with the ball. He worked Guglielmo Vicario with one effort, while he teed up Savinho for a glorious opportunity; the finish was high and wasteful. There was also the moment on the half-hour when Doku set up Haaland, who shot too close to Vicario.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is virtually a tradition when their team are behind. They had seen precious little, save for a looping Danso header that Ederson tipped over. From the corner, James Maddison played it short and loose, allowing Doku to intercept and City to break. Spurs were lucky that Matheus Nunes overhit the final pass.O’Brien dives to Everton’s rescue and extends Moyes bounce at BrentfordRead moreCity should have been home and dry but, when the tide turned, it was easy to feel we had seen this movie before. Spurs were better with the ball in the second half, they played with pace and slickness. They looked more like the best version of themselves. Maddison was booked for a horrible tactical foul; he practically rugby-tackled Savinho to stop the break. But the midfielder was otherwise instrumental while Postecoglou’s introduction of Sarr, Son, Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson in one fell swoop made a difference. It was a show of strength; a clear sign that his injury crisis has eased.Wilson Odobert could not stretch enough to convert a Porro cross and Spurs had other openings. The transformation was stark. City wobbled. Destiny Udogie was close to setting up Mathys Tel. Sarr could not finish after a surge by Spence. Son extended Ederson from a Johnson cross. And then, at the very end, we had Sarr again. Guardiola could smile this time. Did he feel that the old City had returned in the first half? “Never will this season be the old City,” he replied. “The old City was too good.

But a win for the European champions against theWorld Cup holders Spainto put them level on points with Portugal in their Nations League group lifts a pressure that perhaps shouldn’t be there.England 1-0 Spain: Women’s Nations League – liveRead moreThe England manager has repeatedly cautioned against expectations of a clean run of wins in the European Championship in Switzerland this summer. “The game has changed,” she has said, the introduction of the Nations League elevating the level of opposition the Lionesses meet on a regular basis.No game is easy anymore, it’s a cliché but it’s a fact. A 0-0 draw against Olympic champions USA, a 4-3 defeat by Germany (a wild anomaly of a game) and a1-1 draw against Portugalon Friday have pockmarked their record recently. Against Portugal, England thrilled in the first half and struggled in the second, a formation change and fresh personnel frustrating Wiegman’s charges and producing the leveller. How would England fare when swapping a team ranked 22 for the World Cup holders and No 2 team on the planet?It turns out, incredibly well. The opening 15 minutes were nervy for the home team but they weathered the red storm around them, holding their shape and composure against a team that can bamboozle the best players with their guile and possession-laden football. Salma Paralluelo posed a threat on the left and slithered into the box evading both Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson before Millie Bright powered the ball away.Less than five minutes later, the former Manchester United forward Lucía García capitalised from a corner to clip the ball off the underside of the bar. Had that gone in, the game could have been very different. Instead, the Lionesses grew into the game, Bronze and Lauren James particularly effective on either flank.This was a streetwise performance from the Chelsea duo and their England teammates, a display described later by both Bright and Williamson as “properly English”. Bronze’s grin after she had hustled and harassed the two-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí to put the ball out for a corner symbolic of that.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson leads from the front as England’s defence kept out the world champions.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIn the 23rd minute England registered their first real chance and James was the instigator, getting the better of Ona Batlle deep into England’s half before releasing Niamh Charles on the left. The full-back was taken down by the Spain captain, Irene Paredes, and James stung the hands of goalkeeper Cata Coll from the resulting free-kick.James got a chance on the other side soon after, latching on to Bright’s cross-field ball from deep before attempting to chip Coll from close range, but the keeper was ready.The home team were rewarded for their patience and persistence just after the half-hour. Grace Clinton found Alessia Russo, who spun and drove into the box, her holdup play exceptional, with the forward’s shot coming off the foot of Paredes and turned in by Jess Park via the leg of the World Cup final goalscorer Olga Carmona.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Much like the opening 15 minutes, Spain had chances early in the second half but England looked more settled and assured under pressure.There was a moment for pause and tactical tweaks in the 50th minute as the floodlights failed, allowing both sides to crowd round their respective dugouts. But after the lights out interlude, play resumed with the same intensity and Wiegman made a double attacking change past the hour, introducing Nikita Parris and Chloe Kelly to maintain the energy out wide as they sought to lift the tension a narrow margin ensures.Still, the indomitable James, who had looked quite out of sorts against Portugal, was England’s livewire, forcing a fingertip save from Coll at one end one minute and crowding out Paralluelo with Bright and Williamson the next.There was a late push for an equaliser but bodies were put on the line as England clung on to a morale-boosting victory. This is not the Spain of the World Cup, they are a different beast and have been through a lot on and off the pitch, but they still maintain a grit that was evident in their recent late comeback win against Belgium.They were out-gritted under the temperamental Wembley lights though, England making a statement before the European Championship with the most solid performance across 90 minutes since the summer.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Nations LeagueEngland women's football teamSpain women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In a tumultuous time of further redundanciesand free lunches endedfor many remaining staff, the head coach’s declaration that United’s players are in the “bubble” of trying to turn fortunes around was borne out on a night that began in incessant rain and ended with a precious win.Amorim will talk to Garnacho about angry reaction to early substitutionRead moreAmorim talks about “surviving” this season; the Portuguese needs to do so. But a best asset was on show here: a doughty spirit which, even when his side goes a player down, finds a way.Less than four minutes were needed for United – actually Dorgu – to shoot themselves in the proverbial. Amorim spoke of sticking to the gameplan and nothing in that has United’s new arrival knocking the ball past the on-rushing goalkeeper André Onana to allow Jaden Philogene to tap home. The calamity derived from Dara O’Shea’s hoof upfield and the left wing‑back aimed recriminations at his goalkeeper. But this was his fault.Ipswich, with a solitary point in 2025, were cock-a-hoop, United dismayed, Amorim in shoulder-slump mode. A reply came via Harry Maguire’s header, from Bruno Fernandes’s corner, which Alex Palmer flew left to claw out. The next time United’s captain stroked in a dead ball, he fashioned the equaliser.A 22nd-minute free-kick was arrowed over from the left, up went a melee of home and Ipswich players and at close range the hapless Sam Morsy headed into his own net.Set piece No 3 from Fernandes had United taking the lead. Once more a corner was flighted over from the left and once more Maguire rose to head. The ball careered about, Palmer saved Diogo Dalot’s shot and Matthijs de Ligt smashed into the roof of the net.View image in fullscreenPatrick Dorgu walks off in despair after his tackle on Omari Hutchinson was deemed a red card by referee Darren England after consulting the pitchside monitor.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PATwo goals in four minutes reversed emotions for the home faithful and gave United what they lack: a swagger that featured Leny Yoro, Dorgu, Fernandes and Garnacho punching the ball about, and Joshua Zirkzee drawing a Morsy booking for an ankle clip.For a passage United enjoyed control, a rarity for this Amorim side, and Dorgu’s fierce effort almost earned redemption for the Dane but Palmer beat it away. Then, Dorgu’s night became a certifiable shocker as he was sent off, Darren England raising the red card after viewing the monitor. The referee’s decision was fair: when the ball was played for Omari Hutchinson, Dorgu’s right foot missed it, and administered a heavy blow to the player’s left shin. After treatment, Hutchinson continued but the challenge was clearly dangerous play.On came Noussair Mazraoui, with Garnacho sacrificed, the latter heading straight for the tunnel to the disquiet of Amorim. “I’m going to talk obviously with Garnacho about that,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again, Philogene was the scorer and Onana definitely the villain this time. Philogene swept in a hopeful diagonal from the right, United’s goalkeeper hesitated, De Ligt and Liam Delap did not touch the ball, and in it bounced.Amorim’s anger was transformed to a rosier emotion when Maguire’s forehead gave United the lead again, the defender beating Palmer at yet another Fernandes corner, this from the right just after half-time.The former captain was delighted and the question was simple: how long could his team protect their advantage? They might have stretched it at a clever free-kick dinked along the sideline but Rasmus Højlund chose to pivot rather than cross and he slipped and was dispossessed.Once more United’s No 9 fed off scraps. Amorim recognises this and how it causes the Dane to lose his cool. An illustration came in the pass he spiralled beyond Zirkzee and straight out, but at least this was a second touch in as many minutes. A third touch should have come when Yoro performed a quasi-Cruyff turn along the left and rolled the ball over but instead of taking aim Højlund dummied and Ipswich escaped.Casemiro replaced Højlund as Amorim valiantly defended what the 10 men fought for: a first league win in four games. And Mazraoui’s shove of Delap after the latter’s disagreement with Manuel Ugarte was a welcome further sign of togetherness.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Arsenal, in second place but trailing Liverpool by 13 points, are resigned to Champions League qualification;Nottingham Forest, in contrast, are intoxicated by the prospect.Arsenal’s title challenge was limping anyway as their striking department fell into the treatment room in mid-winter but gaining one point from two gamesagainst West Hamand Forest over the past five days seems to have killed it off.Arteta admits Arsenal ‘lacked spark’ but face wait for Saka and Martinelli returnRead moreWith the second-string midfielder Mikel Merino again obliged to deputise up front, in the absence of the injured Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bakayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli,Arsenallacked the killer instinct as Forest returned to their resolute and robust role as the great underdogs in this challenge for a first return to Europe’s premier competition since 1980.This was the first goalless draw at the City Ground in thePremier Leaguesince 1998 but was greeted with huge roars by the home supporters.After uncharacteristically conceding at least two goals in five of their previous six games, includingfour in the first halfat Newcastle on Sunday, Forest defended for their lives once again, with Murillo outstanding. “The most important thing was to realise how we do things, how we play and our strengths. Today it was there,” Nuno Espírito Santo, their head coach, said.“We were compact and didn’t allow Arsenal too much. Arsenal had chances, of course, because they are a very good team. But at the same time, we were compact, solid and aggressive.”Arsenal thought they had broken through eight minutes from time when Martin Ødegaard was released inside the penalty area by Leandro Trossard and not once but twice had his efforts cleared from off or near the line. But the flag had gone up to indicate Trossard was offside. It typified Arsenal’s frustrating night.The early stages of the game all seemed to hinge around Riccardo Calafiori. The Italian left-back, who might not have started but for Myles Lewis-Skelly’s suspension for his red card against West Ham, was booked for an early foul on Callum Hudson-Odoi, leading to his substitution at half-time. Arsenal fans’ hearts were in their mouths when the winger, switched to the right flank for this game, then burst past the Italian, into the area and stumbled over after light contact. Andrew Madley deemed it no penalty; the video assistant referee agreed.Calafiori regularly roamed forward as in inverted left-back and, midway through the first half, bent a shot against the inside of the far post, Matz Sels catching the rebound.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First Merino, Arsenal’s saviour in the East Midlands with the two goals that did for Leicester City 11 days earlier, found freedom at the back post to head Declan Rice’s delivery goalwards, Sels parrying superbly at point-blank range; then Kieran Tierney worried his way in at the near post to thud his effort just wide. Arsenal looked to be tightening the screw. “We generated more [chances from corners],” Arteta said. “It’s been so helpful, especially when we lost so much threat in the attacking options [injured players]. We couldn’t open [the game] up even with that and so we’re very disappointed.”Forest’s role as top-four interlopers was represented by their xG of 0.06 as the hour mark passed and Nuno called for Ryan Yates and Danilo to stiffen up the midfield. After three defeats in four, a point was a good one as the City Ground retained its ferocious hostility.Finally Chris Wood chiselled in down the inside-left channel and fired off a fine shot that David Raya had to save. Then William Saliba was obliged to pull out a superbly timed last-ditch tackle to deny Forest’s topscorer from breaking in on goal. After their FA Cup visit from Ipswich on Monday, Forest could confirm their position as the most unlikely favourites for a top-four finish if they can keep out Manchester City – also only one place away from them in the table but a million miles distant in resource and aspiration – here a week on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We dominated the game. We tried in many different ways. We persisted but lacked that spark, that final pass to unlock a well-organised team. We have to generate more shots on target.”Blunted Arsenal grind to a halt in grating stalemate at Nottingham ForestRead moreSaturday’s home defeat by West Hamleft Arsenal almost needing snookers, despite having a game in hand on Liverpool, who have beaten Manchester City and Newcastle United in the past four days.Arteta added: “[We produced a] very different standard [to the West Ham defeat]. We defended with energy, purpose, fight, willingness to make things happen. It wasn’t because we lacked that. We tried until the end but weren’t able to do it.”The Arsenal manager said he has a meeting with his medical staff today [Thursday] to get updates on his hamstrung wingers but neither Martinelli nor Saka is likely to be available before April.“Let’s see how they evolve in the next few weeks to make the right steps,” he said. “They’ve been out for a long, long time, so we’re going to have to integrate them as well, probably gradually. Gab has probably a chance before Baya to come in, but how soon that is, we will have to see.”Arteta said Arsenal will not lack motivation despite the yawning gap to Liverpool. “It was same a week ago, two weeks ago, three months ago. The only thing we can do is win our matches and see how many points we get.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I want us to be ready for Tuesday.”Nuno Espírito Santo, in contrast, was gratified at the manner in which his Forest team responded to going 4-1 down by half-time at Newcastle United on Sunday before rallying to lose 4-3 and taking that momentum into this game.“We responded well at half-time at St James’ Park,” the Forest head coach said. “The team realised how bad it was and tried to revert.

David Moyes’s resurgent side secured a third draw in four games and extended their unbeaten run in the league to seven, despite their recently red-hot Portuguese striker’s failure to find a way past Mark Flekken with any of three superb chances.Instead it was Jake O’Brien – the 23-year-old whose promotion by Moyes to the first-team coincided with the start of their current run – who rescued a point with his first goal for the club after Yoane Wissa had putBrentfordahead in the first half. With Ipswich losing at Old Trafford, Everton, who were a single point above the relegation places when Moyes was appointed last month, now stand 15 clear with relegation worries a distant memory.Blunted Arsenal grind to a halt in grating stalemate at Nottingham ForestRead moreSo, too, is Brentford’s last home win, and this result means at least three months will have elapsed between their last victory here and their next. In truth that is a reflection of the quality of their opponents and a bit of bad luck rather than anything more concerning, and Thomas Frank was probably correct in asserting that “we’d be out of sight, we win” if only Keane Lewis-Potter had scored when picked out by Mikkel Damsgaard’s excellent reverse pass in the 70th minute. Wissa turned the ball in when it broke to him off Jordan Pickford but he was three yards offside.Frank insisted that this was “probably a fair result” and that “in the second half we controlled them, they had nothing”; Moyes said his side “were terrific in the second half” and “we’re very disappointed not to take all three points”. With proper finishing they would have done so.Ethan Pinnock’s slip allowed Beto to run clear on goal in the 39th minute, but in attempting to lift the ball past Flekken the forward succeeded only in chipping it into the goalkeeper’s arms.Three minutes later Carlos Alcaraz’s headed through-ball sent the forward, author of five goals in his previous five games, sprinting clear again, but this time his shot deflected wide off the keeper. Then in the 88th minute Pinnock went to ground again in an attempt to cut out a through-ball but succeeded only in diverting it a little wider than Beto would have liked, and again Flekken saved.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Yoane Wissa jumps in the mix to head in the opener.Photograph: Tony O Brien/Reuters“I know it sounds crazy when he got three one‑on-ones but we actually controlled him in open play,” Frank said.Brentford had started the game brightly before losing steam towards the end of the first half, at which point they took the lead. It was a goal that would have infuriated anyone who shares Moyes’ enthusiasm for effort and organisation: Schade’s long throw from the right was allowed to bounce in the area, Mbeumo was unimpeded as he headed it against the bar, and even then there were three defenders better placed to reach the rebound than Wissa, who sprinted past them all to crash it into the net from barely a yard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everton will now be rewarded for their hot streak with some actual heat, on a training break in the United Arab Emirates.“The players have worked really hard and had a lot of rubbish to deal with, so we’re going to have a period in the sun,” Moyes said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The man, who works in the Premier League but is protected by a court anonymity order, is being sued for damages by a woman for rape and sexual assault, which allegedly took place at his home in the 1990s when she was 15.His lawyers said he denied raping her but admitted initiating a “cash for sex” arrangement with her when she was “16 or just 17”.In court filings, first reported by the Athletic and seen by the PA news agency, lawyers for the woman claimed that the figure “was aware” that the woman was 15 at the time of the alleged rape, and that the “disgusting and traumatising” experience left her “inevitably humiliated and stigmatised”.They alleged the incident took place after she was dropped off at the man’s home by her parents and that afterwards he gave her “£150 in three £50 notes” which left her feeling “inevitably violated and ashamed”. They continued: “The claimant was fearful of disclosing the fact of the index sexual assaults at the time, as she was aware of the power that the defendant held.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.They added: “She feared that she would suffer repercussions and also feared that she or her family may come to some harm if she disclosed what the defendant had done to her.”The filings stated that the woman suffered from “consequential psychological symptoms”, including “complex post-traumatic stress disorder” and “recurrent depressive disorder”. She reported the incident to the police in 2021 but was later told that no further action would be taken.The man has denied that the alleged rape took place, with his lawyers describing the claim as “wholly unfounded” and the accusations as “dishonest and malicious”. They admitted that the pair had a “cash for sex” arrangement while the woman was aged 16 or 17, but that she “continued to enjoy a friendship” with him for many years.The documents read: “The defendant had asked the claimant if she wanted to earn some cash for sex, to which she readily agreed. The defendant’s request was not made whilst the claimant was at his home, and having accepted the request, she then travelled to his home under her own steam.”They claimed that the pair had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse “up to about 15 occasions in total … for which he rewarded her with cash payments, in line with her expectations”.In a separate document, the woman admitted through her legal team that she had sexual intercourse with the man when she was 17, but “expressly denied” that she “readily agreed” to the cash-for-sex arrangement, and added that she believed he would “provide her with a career” if she “complied with his sexual demands”.In April last year, Judge Amanda Stevens ruled that the man should be anonymised in the civil proceedings, as it was “necessary to secure the proper administration of justice” and that “there is no sufficient countervailing public interest in disclosure”.A further hearing in the case is expected to be held at a later date.Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday night,they let in another four, while only creating one chance of note in a game where their goalkeeper performed more heroics and Cole Palmer spurned at least three chances the cold-eyed Chelsea assassin would normally dispatch in his sleep. And while Football Daily has no wish to riff, bebop and scat all over the ongoing pain of a Saints fanbase who probably had a fair idea the Premier League jig was up for their promoted side before a ball had even been shanked into the St James’ Park stands on the opening weekend, it is a measure of just how routinely awful and uncompetitive they are now that 4-0 scorelines actually flatter them. The only thing they have left to play for this season is the acquisition of three points that, notwithstanding a potentially record-breaking points deduction for Manchester City, will ensure they aren’t saddled with the ignominy of failing to overtake 2007-08’s Derby County and becoming feted for beingthe Premier League’s worst-ever team.Despite not being terrible for as many as 35 minutes until Pedro Neto scored Chelsea’s second, Southampton were well and truly beaten at Stamford Bridge, the 15th time in the top flight this season they have shipped three or more goals. One suspects that even with 11 uninterrupted days in which to train before their next game, a trip to Anfield, with an unfair wind Ivan Juric’s side could finally be subjected to the record-breaking 10-goal shellacking two previous iterations of their team have narrowly avoided. While there is no shame in a team not being good enough to compete in the Premier League, at the very least fans expect to see the players try their best. Cast adrift at the bottom, the current Saints crop appear to have given up the ghost, while Tyler Dibling,the lone floweremerging from the brambles of the current shambles, is apparently no longer good enough to get into their awful side.“It is a big lesson for all of us to create something stronger and better than this,” blathered Juric, who replaced optimism’s Russell Martin in December and arrived with a reputation for forging defensive solidity in his sides that he has carefully kept under wraps. “We have a lot of young players. They want to grow up. They are really good guys. Maybe they are playing in the Premier League for the first time. It is not easy. But I am not scared. If they work hard, we will keep going.” While Juric’s team may well do this, their ultimate destination remains unclear as they’re showing far less fight or spirit than the Luton side who got relegated from the top flight last season and are currently plotting a course for League One.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Taha Hashim at 7.30pm (all times GMT) for Tottenham Hotspur or Spurs 2-1 Manchester City, Nottingham Forest 1-1 Arsenal, and more in his Premier League clockwatch; Will Unwin will be on hand at 8.15pm for updates on Liverpool 3-1 Newcastle; and Emillia Hawkins will be all over England 1-2 Spain in the Women’s Nations League from 8pm.QUOTE OF THE DAY25 February, 10pm:“It’s my hometown club and I’m never going to walk away at any point.

Mainly to ourselves, but also of course when you play such an intense game, I think the fans who were in the stadium enjoyed the game.”Wiegman was particularly pleased with the “fight” England showed in their battling defensive efforts, as she added: “The fight and togetherness is the most important thing. It was an absolute team performance. We fought for every yard on the pitch, against a very good opponent.“We played in-possession well, in moments of the game. Of course against Spain you also know you have to defend really well to keep the ball out of the net and we did that well. Of course, they did get a couple of opportunities but, overall, I’m really happy how the team stood up and how we worked so hard to get this over the line.”The result means England end the February international break with four points from two games to sit joint-top of their Nations League group alongside Portugal, who were 1-0 winners away against Belgium.Spain, who had fought back from 2-0 down to beat Belgium 3-2 on Friday, spurned several opportunities in front of goal, including two clear chances for the Arsenal midfielder Mariona Caldentey.The Spain head coach, Montse Tomé, said: “I do think that Spain deserved more from the game, particularly with the situations we created in the final third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This prompted Amorim to introduce Noussair Mazraoui for Garnacho but the latter’s upset at the decision moved him to head straight for the dressing room. It is unclear if Garnacho reappeared for the second half.Maguire heads Manchester United past Ipswich despite Dorgu’s red cardRead moreWhen asked if he was unhappy with the Argentinian, Amorim referred to the falling-out with Marcus Rashford that caused his loan to Aston Villa in the winter window. “It was cold and wet, maybe?” Amorim said.“You are making a connection with Rashford, right? I know, I know. What I’m saying is I’m going to obviously talk with Garnacho about that. So I will talk about that if you want in the next press conference.”Both Garnacho and Rashford were initially dropped for the match‑day squad for the win at Manchester City in December, with Garnacho restored for the following trip to Tottenham.“We have to choose someone to go out, we have to think about set pieces also, so it was Garnacho,” the United manager said. “The thinking was we’d play more in the 5-3-1. I know that is a risk because you are taking one – maybe the only player who has one‑against‑one pace. But I felt the team was OK in controlling the game.”In a chaotic match at Old Trafford Ipswich took the lead through Jadon Philogene, before Sam Morsy’s own goal and Mathijs de Ligt’s finish gave United the lead. After Dorgu’s sending-off, in first-half added-time Philogene scored a second, before Harry Maguire’s 47th-minute winner.Following news of further redundancies at the club, Amorim hailed the victory. “It is really important, well deserved. The fans’ support was amazing,” the Portuguese said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their defeat by Afghanistan, following the loss against Australia last Saturday, made it a third consecutive tournament failure under Buttler’s leadership.England crash out of Champions Trophy after nail-biting defeat to AfghanistanRead moreAsked if he will now weigh up the role he inherited from Eoin Morgan in 2022 – one that began with initial silverware at the T20 World Cup that year – Buttler replied: “Yep. Obviously the results aren’t where they need to be. We need to consider all possibilities and get England cricket back to where it needs to be.“I’ve got to work out personally, am I part of the problem or am I part of the solution?I’m not going to make any emotional decisions right here, right now. The guys at the top – they’re in charge and they will have their own views as well.”Regarding the match, in which his side were bowled out for 317 with a ball to spare chasing 326 to win, their heads still spinning from Ibrahim Zadran’s remarkable 177, Buttler said: “We’re obviously gutted. We had our chances. It has been a familiar theme. A more firing and confident team would have got over the line.”Both Rob Key, England’s team director, and Richard Gould, the England and WalesCricketBoard chief executive, have been on the ground in Pakistan but are due to return to the UK on Thursday. Given the pair only recently made Brendon McCullum the all-format men’s head coach in a final attempt to help Buttler, any decision may well be out of the captain’s hands.“I know lots of people think being captain doesn’t sit well with me,” said Buttler, who has overseen 22 defeats from 34 ODIs since replacing Morgan. “But I really do enjoy it. Results are tough and weigh heavy at times. You want to be leading a winning team. We haven’t been that for a while now.

This came after the council approved a plaque commemorating the city library’s 50th anniversary. Writ largest on the plaque are the words “Magical Alluring Galvanizing Adventurous” – an acrostic of Maga.Kluwe ranked among the NFL’s top punters while playing for the Minnesota Vikings in the early 2000s. During his career he was as well known for calling outNFLimmorality and championing civil rights causes like same-sex marriage and racial justice as he was for pinning the opposition against their own goalline with his booming right leg.Retirement hasn’t dampened the 43-year-old’s impassioned rhetoric. “Maga stands for resegregation and racism,” he said in hiscouncil address. “Maga stands for censorship and book bans. … Maga is a profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy and most importantly, Maga is explicitly a Nazi movement. You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat but that is what it is.”Former NFL player Chris Kluwe arrested after attacking ‘corrupt’ Maga movementRead moreAfter dropping the mic to cheers from the gallery, Kluwe stepped forward from his public podium toward the city council dais and gave himself up as police swarmed to arrest him. He was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for disrupting an assembly.“I had seen at previous city council meetings that this city does not listen to its community,” Kluwe said in a phone interview two days after his arrest, with characteristic wryness. “They want attention so that they can get more power. But they don’t want to do the actual work of making the community better.”He assumed that his booking would be fairly straightforward, but the police held him for two and a half hours, “because they were waiting for something to charge me with”, he says. “Now I have a court date in April, so we’ll see what happens. There’s a possibility the ACLU might get involved. Some people have been telling me they’re looking to challenge this because they think it might not be legal.”View image in fullscreenChris Kluwe at the city council meeting on 20 February. ‘Maga stands for resegregation and racism,’ he said.Photograph: ZUMA via AlamyKnown as “the surfing capital of the world”, Huntington Beach is 40 miles down the coast from Los Angeles in Orange county – California’shistorically conservative heartland. Kluwe, who grew up in nearby Seal Beach and has called Huntington Beach home for the past 15 years, has seen the town’s political attitude shift with the tides. “Skinheads and‘surf Nazis’were a known part of Huntington Beach,” he says. “But the government wasn’t necessarily like that. They were conservative. But it was small-c, don’t want to pay taxes or build new houses conservatism. But then [in the past decade] you saw the community start shifting more leftwards. When I moved back here, this was a cool beach community, a good place to live.”But in the last few years, the community has been jerked back to the right as Maga Republicans have overtaken city politics. The former city attorney, Michael Gates, stepped down from that position this year to join Donald Trump’s justice department. Maga candidates swept last November’s elections to lock out all seven of Huntington Beach’s city council seats. After their victory they posed for pictures inside city hall wearing “Make Huntington Beach Great Again” red caps and dubbed themselves the “Maga-nificent 7”.“A lot of people thought that Maga would help them, and they trusted the city council to look out for their best interests. They didn’t realize that this council is only here to make themselves famous and try to move upwards in the political echelon,” Kluwe says.One of the new Maga cohort is Gracey Van Der Mark, the former mayor who won a city council seat in November. As mayor, she spearheaded a slew of initiatives including prohibitive voter ID laws, resisting California’s Covid mandates and eliminating references to hate crimes in the city’s declaration on human dignity. To regulate the city library, she pushed a resolution for a “parental advisory board” to pre-screen library books, and even considered privatizing the library’s operations. Both proposals were met with considerable backlash from the city’s liberal, independent and anti-Trump Republican residents. The library plaque includes an unattributed quote – “Through hope and change, our nation has built back better to the golden era of Making America Great Again” – which mashes up slogans from Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump’s presidential campaigns. But the overall tone of the tribute makes clear whose vision of America is most prized.“The library’s name is in the smallest font on the plaque,” Kluwe says. “So, to me, it’s like, what are you really celebrating?”It’s up to us to show the world that the 25% of people who cast their votes for him do not represent the American peopleKluwe was bound to figure in the Huntington Beach resistance. During the 2011 NFL lockout, he called Peyton Manning, Drew Brees and other star members of his players union “greedy douchebags” for reportedly seekingindividual carveouts from the leagueat the expense of a collectively bargained agreement. Two years later, Kluwe joined up with the Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo to file a supreme court amicus brief expressing their support of the challenge to California’s Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage. When the Vikings cut Kluwe in spring 2013, he wrote a Deadspin article attributing his release to his support of same-sex marriage and called his positions coach, whom he accused of repeatedly using homophobic language, a bigot. (After a months-long internal investigation, the Vikings settled with Kluwe by making a sizable donation to LGBTQ+-focused organizations.)After retiring from football, he advocated for NFL players’ right to protest during the social justice movement and vocally supported Colin Kaepernick. All the while, Kluwe made a smooth transition into a career as a memoirist and sci-fi author.But he says he’s finding the current administration stranger than fiction, particularly when he saw thephotoshopped magazine cover of Trump wearing a crownthat was posted on the White House’s official Instagram account. “I cannot think of anything more profoundly un-American than a picture of an American president with a crown,” he says. “That goes against everything this country stands for.”Kluwe hopes his protest will inspire other concerned citizens across the country to take a stand and motivate Democratic lawmakers in particular to fight harder. “Right now, the Democratic party is contributing nothing to trying to defend our nation,” says Kluwe, who had been on the phone with party operatives before clicking over to talk to me. I asked whether he was interested in running for office himself, but he said he was more interested in the power of civil disobedience.He hopes his stand against the Huntington Beach city council will be a reminder to the rest of the world of the many Americans whodidn’tvote for Trump. “These countries have been our friends and allies for decades. It’s up to us to show the world that the 25% of people who cast their votes for him donotrepresent the American people, nor do they represent the American dream, which is one of inclusion, diversity and respect, both home and abroad. We may not always achieve it, but I think it is an ideal worth striving towards.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS politicsDonald TrumpNFLUS sportsWest CoastTrump administrationinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The company could face 10% tariffs on its devices, many of which are assembled in China before being imported into the US.The maker of the iPhone did manage to secure some waivers on tariffs levied on China during Trump’s first term.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, more than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Damon Albarn and Annie Lennox,released a silent album in protest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also reported $0.89 in earnings a share on Wednesday, beating expectations of $0.84.Investors were on the lookout during the chipmaker’s earnings call for signs of slowing demand for its semiconductors, a potential indication of an end to the AI-fueled market boom that has propelled the company to a stratospheric valuation of $3.1tn. Nvidia’s financials gave no such signal.This earnings call was the first look at the company’s production and sales since China’sDeepSeek AIintroduced an AI model that beat many of those made in the US while requiring a fraction of the training and investment. The introduction of DeepSeek initially sent Nvidia’s valuation tumbling by hundreds of billions because the Chinese AI seemed to show that new models did not necessarily need to rely on the company’s most expensive, top-of-the-line graphics processing unit (GPU), as most cutting-edge models out of the US do.AI ‘godfather’ predicts another revolution in the tech in next five yearsRead moreIn his initial comments, the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that appetite for Blackwell, the company’s top-of-the-line GPU, remained strong.“Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law – increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,” said Huang. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter. AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.”While analysts expected Nvidia to maintain its leadership position as the maker of the AI industry’s favorite chips, recent news has presented new potential challenges to the company’s ownership of the market.Most recently, analysts at TD Cowenpublished findingsearlier in the week that Microsoft, one of Nvidia’s biggest customers, was cancelling leases with private data center operators. Investors expressed concerns about the sustainability of mass investment into AI infrastructure, including Microsoft’s $80bn, which would mean less spending on Nvidia’s wares.Nevertheless, neitherDeepSeeknor cancelled leases made an immediate impact on the company’s data-center revenue. Nvidia, which controls more than 90% of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs), reported a data-center revenue of $35.6bn for the final quarter of FY 2025. Wall Street had projected $34.09bn. The company also predicted it would bring in $43bn in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.Huang said DeepSeek has actually stoked enthusiasm for Blackwell because reasoning models, like the model that DeepSeek showcased, require 100 times more computing power, he said.“We designed Blackwell for this moment,” he said.Huang emphasized on the analysts call that the company expects demand for AI infrastructure to continue to grow as the technology continues to evolve. “Near-term, midterm and longterm” all signs point to increased demand, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI.”Following the earnings report, analysts said Nvidia’s continued success was evidence that “market jitters over DeepSeek” have not materialized.“Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides,” said Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst at eMarketer. “Blackwell generating ‘billions in sales’ validates Nvidia’s top position just as the market is expanding on the agentic and physical AI fronts. Short-term volatility is still on the horizon but Nvidia’s market command remains unmatched.”But some analysts say market reactions have been neutral because the company is now expected to blow Wall Street projections out of the water.“Nvidia’s latest quarterly sales are bigger than its entire annual revenue from just two years ago ... but with the stock already reflecting sky-high growth expectations, investors were hoping for an even bigger beat,” said Jacob Falkencrone, global head of investment strategy at Saxo Markets. “Some analysts had anticipated a guidance figure north of $45bn and while Nvidia delivered strong numbers, it wasn’t the ‘blowout’ some were hoping for.”The company also said it was still unclear how Donald Trump’s tariff proposals would impact its business.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaDeepSeekArtificial intelligence (AI)ChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Almost nine out of 10 (88%) in the 2025 poll said they used tools such asChatGPTfor their assessments, up from 53% last year.The proportion using any AI tool surged from 66% in 2024 to 92% in 2025, meaning just 8% of students are not using AI, according toa reportpublished by the Higher Education Policy Institute and Kortext, a digital etextbook provider.Josh Freeman, the report’s author, said such dramatic changes in behaviour in just 12 months were almost unheard of, and warned: “Universities should take heed: generative AI is here to stay.“There are urgent lessons here for institutions,” Freeman said. “Every assessment must be reviewed in case it can be completed easily using AI. That will require bold retraining initiatives for staff in the power and potential of generative AI.“Institutions will not solve any of these problems alone and should seek to share best practice with each other. Ultimately, AI tools should be harnessed to advance learning rather than inhibit it.”Students say they use genAI to explain concepts, summarise articles and suggest research ideas, but almost one in five (18%) admitted to including AI-generated text directly in their work.“When asked why they use AI, students most often find it saves them time (51%) and improves the quality of their work (50%),” the report said. “The main factors putting them off using AI are the risk of being accused of academic misconduct and the fear of getting false or biased results.”One student told researchers: “I enjoy working with AI as it makes life easier when doing assignments; however, I do get scared I’ll get caught.”Women are more worried about these factors than men, who show greater enthusiasm for AI, as do wealthier students and those on science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) courses.According to the report, half of students from the most privileged backgrounds used genAI to summarise articles, compared with 44% from the least privileged backgrounds. “The digital divide we identified in 2024 appears to have widened,” the report concluded.Students generally believe their universities have responded effectively to concerns over academic integrity, with 80% saying their institution’s policy is “clear” and 76% believe their institution would spot the use of AI in assessments. Only a third (36%) of students have received training in AI skills from their university.“They dance around the subject,” said one student. “It’s not banned but not advised, it’s academic misconduct if you use it, but lecturers tell us they use it. Very mixed messages.”Dr Thomas Lancaster, a computer scientist at Imperial College London who researches academic integrity, said: “Students who aren’t using generative AI tools are now a tiny minority.“I know some students are resistant to AI, and I can understand the ethical concerns, but they’re really putting themselves at quite a competitive disadvantage, both in education, and in showing themselves as ready for future careers.”A spokesperson for Universities UK said: “To effectively educate the workforce of tomorrow, universities must increasingly equip students to work in a world that will be shaped by AI, and it’s clear progress is being made.“But they need to balance this with the challenges posed by a rapidly developing technology. This survey shows that universities and students are alive to the potential risks posed by AI tools in the context of exams and assessment.“All have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own and they engage students from day-one on the implications of cheating.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTDeepSeekStudentsHigher educationComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

But the generosity of the autocrat is always potentially lethal.”On Wednesday,Donald Trumpheld hisfirst full cabinet meeting. The mood was warm and convivial and, some might say, generous. Housing secretary Scott Turner offered a prayer that included: “Thank you, God, for President Trump.”Was it just an accident that the TV camera framed the scene as the antithesis of DEI? Viewers could see seven men in suits with Trump in the middle, then another row of seven men in suits sitting behind. Nearly all of them were white. (Yes, there were women and people of colour at the meeting – but not many.)The Vice-president,JD Vance, was in attendance but there was no doubt whom this emperor had appointed as consul. Trump invitedElon Musk, the tech billionaire running the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), to speak before any of his cabinet secretaries after claiming that everyone present was supportive.Outcry as White House starts dictating which journalists can access TrumpRead moreWearing a black “Make America great again” cap, Musk jokingly referred to himself as “humble tech support” – people laughed dutifully – and claimed that his haphazard efforts to take a chainsaw to the federal government can save a trillion dollars and dig the country out of debt. “It’s not an optional thing, it’s an essential thing,” he said. “If we don’t do this, America will go bankrupt.”It sounds fine in theory. But Doge,mostly consisting ofyoung male software engineers fuelled by pizza and Red Bull, has been a disaster. It fired the people who oversee the nuclear weapons stockpile then hastily tried to rehire them, only to find they were hard to contact because they could not access their work email accounts. It claimed to have saved $8bn on a terminated contract that was actually worth only $8m. Musk falsely stated that the US spent $50m on condoms for Gazans. And it emerged this week Doge quietlydeleted the top five itemsfrom its public ledger of alleged savings after they turned out to be nothing of the sort.Musk – who brought similar unholy chaos to Twitter when he bought it – admitted to the cabinet that Doge will make mistakes, but said it will fix them quickly. “So, for example, withUSAid, one of the things we accidentally canceled briefly was Ebola prevention. So we restored the Ebola prevention immediately, and there was no interruption.”Not reassuring.Then came the most autocratic episode of the meeting. Trump, both generous and lethal, asked his cabinet: “Is anybody unhappy with Elon? If you are, we’ll throw him out of here.”To the crocodiles? Or as his pal Vladimir Putin favours, from a high window? From this assembly of fawners, flatterers and flunkies, there was nervous laughter and applause.Triumphant, the president assured reporters: “They have a lot of respect for Elon, that he’s doing this, and some disagree a little bit but I will tell you for the most part I think everyone’s not only happy – they’re thrilled.”Game respects game. Musk, a fan boy of far-right movements all over Europe, showed an impressively instinctive feel for totalitarianism.He said: “President Trump has put together I think the best cabinet ever, literally, and I do not give false praise. This is an incredible group of people. I don’t think such a talented team has ever been assembled. I think it’s literally the best cabinet the country’s ever had … ”Then came a telling slip from the world’s richest man: “I think the company [sic] should be incredibly appreciative of the people in this room.”The cabinet on which Musk lavished such praise includesPete Hegseth, a former Fox News host accused of sexual assault and alcohol abuse, andRobert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine conspiracy theorist who once dumped a dead bear cub in New York’s Central Park. Less Marvel’s Avengers thanStar Wars cantina.Kennedy was asked by reporters about a measles outbreak in Texasin which a child reportedly died, the first measles fatality in the US for a decade. His lackluster response: “It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.”Canada’s American coach Marsch ‘ashamed’ of Trump’s 51st state commentsRead moreThe whole meeting was yet another sorry exercise in worshipping an authoritarian and normalising a bully. Musk tried to defend the emails he sent to government employees, asking what they did last week, as not a “performance review” but a “pulse check review” because some people on the government payroll are dead.Trump rounded off the meeting by observing: “The country’s got bloated and fat and disgusting and incompetently run.”Yet as Jon Stewartnoted this weekon Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, Doge will not touch the $3bn in subsidies given to oil and gas companies, a hedge fund loophole worth $1.3bn a year, or the $2tn given to defence contractors to build a fighter jet that will soon be obsolete. “This is where the real money is,” Stewart said.Not even a functioning democracy ever did much about those. So hopes for a country run by a wannabe Caesar and his oligarch pal are not high.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsThe US politics sketchTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskRobert F Kennedy JrPete HegsethnewsShareReuse this content"

There was also a bit of snark: “bonus points to anyone who responds that they spent their government subsidy on hookers and blow,” one worker said.Within hours, the network had agreed on a recommended response: break up the oath federal employees take when hired into five bullet points and send them back in an email: “1. I supported and defended the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”“2. I bore true faith and allegiance to the same,” and so on.It was only the latest effort by a growing and increasingly busy group banding together to “expose harmful policies, defend public institutions and equip citizens with tools to push back against authoritarianism”, according to Lynn Stahl, a contractor with Veterans Affairs and a member of the network. Increasingly, the group is also trying to help its members and others face the thousands of layoffs that have been imposed across the federal government.Calling itself #AltGov, the network has developed a visible, public-facing presence in recent weeks throughBluesky accounts, most of which bear the names or initials of federal agencies, aimed at getting information out to the public – and correcting disinformation – about the chaos being unleashed by theTrump administration.With 40 accounts to date, their collective megaphone is getting louder, as most of the accounts have tens of thousands of followers, with “Alt CDC (they/them)” being the largest, at nearly 95,000 followers.The network has also formed a group and a series of sub-groups onWire, the encrypted messaging app, to share information and develop strategies – as played out on Saturday.View image in fullscreenA post from the #AltGov account for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Composite: Alt CDC (they/them)/BlueskyThe #AltGov hashtag has roots in the first Trump administration, perhaps most famously through the “ALT National Park Service” account on what was then Twitter, according to Amanda Sturgill, journalism professor at Elon University, whose bookWe Are #AltGov: Social Media Resistance from the Insidedocuments the earlier phenomenon. (Thataccount, with its 774,000 followers, has since moved to Bluesky. Its online presence is parallel to and separate from the #AltGov network.)The original #AltGov Twitter accounts were dedicated to “sharing information about what was happening inside government – which usually doesn’t get covered as much, because it usually works”, Sturgill said. Examples included the firstTrump administration’s deletion of data and separation of families through immigration policies, she said.The people behind those accounts also banded together to “provide services the government wasn’t providing” – like helping coordinate hurricane relief and distributing masks during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Those efforts were often coordinated in Twitter group chats.It was “a movement, more than an organization”, Sturgill said – and the same could be said of the current version, which moved its social media presence from X (formerly Twitter) toBluesky“because of the Elon mess”, said Stahl, referring to Musk’s 2022 purchase of the app. “It’s not safe to organize [on X] anymore,” she added.The current iteration has not been reported on to date, but the numbers of the Bluesky #AltGov accounts have doubled in recent weeks without media attention, Stahl said. The group internally vets all members “to make sure people work where they say”.View image in fullscreenAn #AltGov account compiles potential answers to Musk’s request for workers to list five things they accomplished in the past week.Photograph: Alt Fish and Wildlife Service/Bluesky“#AltGov dates from the firstTrump administration, but it’s even more needed now,” said an employee at Fema, the disaster response agency, who requested anonymity to avoid being targeted at work.

But all the information is old and it’s so padded out it’s the TV equivalent of a Zoom call that could have been an emailHannah J DaviesWed 26 Feb 2025 11.46 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 11.49 ESTShareWho is Satoshi Nakamoto? It’s a mystery that has vexed the internet since long before crypto went mainstream, via Silicon Valley bros and that weird period where celebrities got really intoNFTs.Finding out the identity of the person who designed bitcoin – the decentralised, multitrillion-dollar currency – would be a big (and potentially dangerous) deal. Think WikiLeaks, if Julian Assange was also a potential kidnapping target with a handsome digital ransom fee. It is also – you may be unsurprised to hear – a mystery that this digital two-parter from Channel 4 does not get to the bottom of. At the outset, its journalist host,Gabriel Gatehouse(known for the BBC’s Trump podcast,The Coming Storm), warns viewers that: “The film you’re about to watch – in fact, this whole series – consists almost entirely of middle-aged white guys talking about tech”, as their middle-aged, white-guy faces flash up on screen. That wouldn’t be so much of an issue if any of these “cypherpunk” pioneers – or Gatehouse himself – had anything to say that hadn’t already been debunked on Reddit.It’s not the interviewees’ fault. Gatehouse blames a possible omertà code for their silence, but with Satoshi potentially a target for all manner of cartels, criminals and governments, why would any of these computer scientists – namely fellow Briton Adam Back, who ducks and dives away from Gatehouse at a conference in Miami – give anything away? In lieu of revelations, we get anAdam Curtis-inspired visual treatment to distract us – all film noir clips juxtaposed with old cartoons and animations of faceless automatons marching in lockstep.Satoshi isn’t interesting because he invented a new type of money, says Gatehouse, but because of what he was trying todowith it. We don’t exactly nail down what that is, either, but we do get lots of tangents into transhumanism, and theBryan Johnson-esque bros fuelled by gene therapy injections, who want to run countries like private businesses. Manbunned nepo baby Patri Friedman – grandson of Milton, the Nobel prize-winning economist – is one such bro, who thinks humans should live for 80 to 160 years, and says that anyone who thinks otherwise is “advocating for mass murder”. He meets Gatehouse at a libertarian city powered by bitcoin and populated by “international frontier tech entrepreneurs”, off the coast of Honduras. There’s a story about how they got there – via a corrupt, drug-pushing president – that sounds enticing, but it’s one Gatehouse doesn’t dwell on.But hold on – what’s all this got to do with Satoshi? It’s not until halfway through the second episode that we get back to that big mystery: just who is the bitcoin creator, and could Satoshi even be a collective of tech nerds who banded together to further obfuscate their identities? There’s another suspect, Len Sassaman, but – like many of the people mentioned in this series – he’s already dead and, er, was unlikely to have the technical nous to pull it off. The trail runs cold again.Gatehouse seems like a lovely man, and it brings me no pleasure to lay into a show he has clearly laboured over. But Seeking Satoshi is unmistakably thin, the TV equivalent of a Zoom call that could have been an email. At one point, Gatehouse even recruits his mum to give him a pep talk. She, too, seems lovely. But she is not Satoshi. Not only has a lot of this material been raked over by the internet, but unluckily for Gatehouse it was also raked over very recently by HBO. Its bitcoin documentary, Money Electric, wasn’t much better, but it at least illuminated a key question those of us coming to the topic with limited knowledge might appreciate: namely, how does bitcoin actually work? Here, the technical explanations feel tacked on, neglected in lieu of pursuing another reluctant interviewee on a travelator.As the second episode ends, we circle back to that search for immortality, with a visit to a cryonics facility where the frozen head of one of the suspects, Hal Finney – who died in 2014 – is preserved in liquid nitrogen. I was worried that Gatehouse was going to ask to unfreeze Finney for an interview, but thankfully he stopped short of that. Instead, we are treated to another tangent about the wild things the wealthy will do for eternal life. As we close with stock footage of Trump and Elon Musk and a warning that “the future belongs to them” (that is, the cypherpunks, who are also increasingly influential in the world of politics), it feels less of a gripping hunt and more a depressing bump back down to earth.Seeking Satoshi: The MysteryBitcoinCreator is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionBitcoinCryptocurrenciesreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s a death knellMargaret Sullivan‘I couldn’t be more sad and disgusted,’ says former top editor Martin BaronWed 26 Feb 2025 15.10 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 21.20 ESTShareOwners and publishers of news organizations often exert their will on opinion sections. It would be naive to think otherwise.But a draconian announcement this week by Jeff Bezos, theWashington Postowner, goes far beyond the norm.Thebillionaire declaredthat only opinions that support “personal liberties” and “free markets” will be welcome in the opinion pages of the Post.“Viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” he added.The paper’s top opinion editor, David Shipley, couldn’t get on board with those restrictions. He immediately – and appropriately – resigned.The ‘Gulf of America’ feud is about something bigger: Trump wants to control the media | Margaret SullivanRead moreEspecially in light of the billionaire’s other blatant efforts to cozy up to Donald Trump, Bezos’s move is more than a gut punch; it’s more like a death knell for the once-great news organization he bought in 2013.It’s unclear what will happen to such excellent left-of-center columnists as Catherine Rampell, Eugene Robinson and EJ Dionne. And it’s unclear to what extent this ruling eventually will affect the paper’s hard-news coverage, which so far has been unbowed in covering the chaotic rollout of the new Trump administration.Whatisclear is that Bezos no longer wants to own an independent news organization. He wants a megaphone and a political tool that will benefit his own commercial interests.It’s appalling. And, if you care about the role of the press in America’s democracy, it’s tragic.“What Bezos is doing today runs counter to what he said, and actually practiced, during my tenure at the Post,” Martin Baron, the paper’s executive editor until 2021 and the author of the 2023memoirCollision of Power: Trump, Bezos and the Washington Post, told me in an email Wednesday.“I have always been grateful for how he stood up for the Post and an independent press against Trump’s constant threats to his business interest,” Baron said. “Now, I couldn’t be more sad and disgusted.”Bezos is sacrificing the Post’s reputation and any hope for its financial stability on the altar of personal gain. Recall that the company lost some 300,000 subscribers a couple of months ago after Bezos forbid the publication, just before the presidential election, from publishing a planned editorial endorsing Trump’s Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.More recently, the Post refused to publish Ann Telnaes’s cartoon that showed American oligarchs, including Bezos, bowing to Trump; in protest, she resigned from the Post, where she had worked since 2008.This latest move certainly will mean more Post subscribers will flee, partly in protest and partly because the paper – at least on its opinion side – no longer does the job.Having worked at the Post myself as its media columnist for six years, until 2022, I know the paper’s readership well.Post subscribers are well-informed, smart and savvy; they know and appreciate the paper’s history, including the way it bravely stood up to presidential power during the Pentagon Papers and Watergate eras when the Graham family were the owners.These readers span the traditional political spectrum from liberal to old-school conservative. And they understand the sometimes adversarial relationship between government and the press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I foresee a mass subscriber defection from an outlet already deep in red ink; that must be something businessman Bezos is willing to live with.He must also be willing to live with hypocrisy.“Bezos argues for personal liberties. But his news organization now will forbid views other than his own in its opinion section,” Baron pointed out, recalling that it was only weeks ago when the Post described itself in an internal mission statement as intended for “all of America”.“Now,” Baron noted, “its opinion pages will be open to only some of America, those who think exactly as he does.”It’s all about getting on board with Trump, to whose inauguration Bezos – through Amazon, the company he co-founded – contributed a million dollars. That allowed him a prime seat, along with others of his oligarchical ilk.“There is no doubt in my mind that he is doing this out of fear of the consequences for his other business interests, Amazon [the source of his wealth] and Blue Origin, [which represents his lifelong passion for space exploration],” Baron said. Now, Baron added, he is prioritizing those interests and, in so doing, “betraying the Post’s long-standing principles to do so”.As a Post loyalist myself – drawn into my career by the courageous journalism I admired as a teenager in the 1970s, thrilled to join its ranks in 2016 – I’m crushed to see its precipitous decline.Bezos set out to save the Washington Post from financial ruin when he bought it, and, for a time, he did that and more.But the best thing he could do now would be to sell it to someone who understands the stewardship of a national treasure.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionWashington PostJeff BezosUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, on Monday, a federal judgerefusedto immediately strike down the White House’s retaliatory treatment of the AP. But the case is far from over.Granting access to the White House on the suppressive conditions set by theTrump administrationis a blow to the first amendment and the free press. If the retaliation against the AP is allowed to stand, more restrictions on the press are certain to follow, creating Kremlin-like conditions that will affect all Americans who might question, or be suspected of questioning, the Trump party line.This is why a seemingly trivial issue – what to call the Gulf – is freighted with importance. Trump’s renaming of the Gulf unmistakably delivers his“America first” message. He has every right to his message. But he doesn’t have the right to turn the press into his messenger.The controversy began on Trump’s first day back in office, when he issued a unilateral order that an international sea,known for centuries as the Gulf of Mexico, henceforth be named theGulf of America. Certain organizations, such as Google, immediately complied bychanging the Gulf’s name on Google Mapsand redirecting searches for “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America”.However, the AP, along withseveral other news organizations, resisted. Noting that the Trumporder had no effect outside the US, the AP made an editorial judgment that its status as an international reporting agency was best served by continuing to refer to the Gulf by the name known to global readers.Trump has every right to his message. But he doesn’t have the right to turn the press into his messengerThe Trump administration retaliated bybarring AP reportersfrom the press pool that covers media events at the White House or on Air Force One, and on Tuesday it went further,announcing it would determinewhich organizations had access to the pool – traditionally the job of the White House Correspondents’ Association. While limited seating capacity may give the White House some discretion about who gets to be in the press pool, the first amendment does not permit that discretion to be used to punish the press or to limit access to outlets favorable to Trump. As the AP stated in itscomplaint: “The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government. The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech” by controlling access.As tempting as it is to followShakespearein shrugging the shoulders at “what’s in a name,” we should turn to history to learn what follows when authoritarian leaders start out with seemingly harmless verbal imperialisms. One of the first actions Hitler took after seizing power in 1933 was to scrub streets and public spaces of names thatreflected Jewish influence or Weimar republicanismin favor of tributes to National Socialism. Stalin celebrated his own greatness by changing Tsaritsyn, now Volgograd, to “Stalingrad”. Before Stalingrad, there was the switch from Petrograd toLeningrad. In today’s China, the name “Tibet” hasdisappeared from Chinese mapsin favor of the Mandarin name, “Xizang”.It is hard to know how seriously to take Trump’s flagging of territorial, as well as verbal, imperialism. He has suggested the US reclaim thePanama Canal Zone,buy Greenlandfrom Denmark,incorporate Canada as a 51st state, andtake over the Gaza Stripfor resort real estate development. Even if these are mere paper ambitions, the disdain Trump shows for international law is already doing irreparable harm.Appealing to his Maga base with the “America first” rhetoric in the Gulf, he isselling out Ukraineto Putin’s Russia in ways reminiscent of the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain’s infamousappeasement of Hitler in 1938by ceding parts of Czechoslovakia to the Nazis. Ignoring this lesson of history – in Munich of all places – this month, JD Vance stopped short of endorsing the neo-NaziAlternative for Germany partyby name, but made clear that the Trump administration would be happy if Europe adopted the same anti-immigrant policies that Trump’s renaming of the Gulf signaled.Trump called the press ‘the enemy of the people’. Now it’s time to defend ourselves | Jodie GinsbergRead moreThe ripple effect of Trump commandeering global waters reaches beyond the sea to all Americans. His actions must be considered alongside his other executive orders on his first day back in office, declaring the arrival of immigrants at the southern border an“invasion” and suspending grants of asylum, no matter how dire the situation of refugees. When we let Trump scapegoat vulnerable immigrants for this country’s – and the world’s – problems, we are in fascist territory. That is why Trump’s renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America is no laughing matter. It expresses a level of disrespect for Mexico that could well be a precursor for how strongmen treat peoples whom they first strip of dignity. Substitute Jew, Catholic, Turk, Armenian, Arab, gay or transgender for Trump’s talk of an invasion of aliens across the Gulf, and you get the point.What the Gulf needs is not more nationalistic power grabs but international cooperation to tackle its most pressing problems – worsening pollution, rising sea levels from the climate crisis, intensifying hurricanes, crumbling infrastructure, and loss of shoreline and habitat. Far from squabbling over what to call the Gulf, the US and Mexico should recognize thatno one owns the Gulf; it belongs to nature.In Romeo and Juliet, Juliet made her “what’s in a name” speech to declare love for Romeo even though he bore the family name of her family’s blood enemy. It didn’t turn out well for Juliet, and it won’t turn out well for us if we let Trump intimidate the AP because its editors had the courage to stand up to his bullying.Jeffrey Abramson is author of Minerva’s Owl: The Tradition of Western Political Thought.

Here’s a strategy to win over the rightErin BurnsIt’s time to rethink how climate action succeeds. The key is to acknowledge that it’s never the sole force driving political decisionsWed 26 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 12.55 ESTShareWe are witnessing the most devastatingclimate disasterson record: wildfires ravaging Los Angeles, deadly floods in North Carolina, and global temperature records shattered month after month. We have officially surpassed 1.5C (2.7F) of warming, a critical threshold scientists have long warned against. At the same time, the US is scaling back policies, freezing critical programs and shifting priorities away from climate action.But now isn’t the time to give up on climate action. Instead, it is high time to rethink how it succeeds.The reality is that the United States has never had a true, comprehensive climate policy. Unlike other countries that have enacted economy-wide regulations, the US approach has been fragmented, focused on supporting specific technologies rather than tackling climate change holistically. That has especially been true for carbon removal technologies and practices that remove existing carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere and an essential tool for meeting global climate goals.Instead, we have federal direct air capture policy, federal agriculture policy, and federal forestry and oceans policy. Each of these exists within distinct legislative and political frameworks, driven not by national political divides but by state-level economic interests, policy mechanisms like tax credits or R&D funding, and the coalitions that support them.This distinction is crucial. Over the past few years, bipartisan support has helped unlock billions of dollars for carbon removal. But that does not mean carbon removal itself is bipartisan. Direct air capture has bipartisan support, as do soil carbon programs, reforestation efforts and ocean-based carbon removal. Almost every piece of legislation supporting a pillar of carbon removal has sponsors from both parties, but that is because they align with localized economic and political priorities – not because of broad bipartisan agreement on climate action.Now is not the time to water down our message or repackage our work for short-term political convenienceSo, how do we make progress over the next four years? By acknowledging that climate action is a key consideration in policy, but is never the sole driving force shaping decisions. Take California’s decision to implement cleaner car standards. Yes, the state acted because the climate was in a bad spot, but also because smog was choking cities, making it harder for people to breathe. The policy wasn’t just about the long-term benefits of reducing emissions; it was about protecting public health in the immediate term. People supported action because they could see the direct, personal consequences of pollution in their daily lives.This is the lesson for carbon removal and broader climate solutions. Some climate advocates have suggested that, in order to navigate the shifting political landscape, we should build our political pitches around the economy rather than climate itself. But the path forward isn’t about removing climate from the conversation, because we will never build champions by pretending the world isn’t burning. Instead, it’s about “climateand… ” Climateandeconomic growth. Climateandpublic health. Climateandenergy security. When we talk about and implement carbon removal, we need to prioritize the co-benefits beyond climate not because of who sits in the White House, but because these benefits are real and essential to securing long-term support from a broader bench of champions.Long-term public policy requires durable political coalitions. That means we must stop pretending climate action is only about climate. We need to ensure that communities hosting projects see tangible benefits–because without that, these projects won’t happen.‘The path forward is clear’: how Trump taking office has ‘turbocharged’ climate accountability effortsRead moreI don’t say this only as someone who has worked in federal climate and energy policy for nearly 15 years, but as someone who grew up in the heart of West Virginia’s coal country. My community has lived through the rise and fall of a fossil fuel economy. We understand better than most the benefits and costs of an industry-dependent future. We also know that when economic transitions happen without real planning and investment in local communities, they leave devastation in their wake.This is why focusing on co-benefits isn’t a concession; it’s the only viable path forward. We need to defend existing climate and carbon removal policies based on the real, tangible benefits they provide. And we must build coalitions that last beyond election cycles, ensuring that climate progress is not derailed by shifting political winds.To those working on bipartisan climate solutions: now is not the time to water down our message or repackage our work for short-term political convenience, but to shore up our political capital for the long game. We need to secure immediate policy wins over the next four years, but we must also lay the groundwork for the next hundred. That means being honest about why we do this work, articulating both the benefits and trade-offs, and building trust – not just with policymakers, but with the communities that will host these projects.The political landscape will shift, but our commitment to a just, sustainable future must remain unwavering.Erin Burns is executive director of Carbon 180, a climate NGO seeking to reverse two centuries of carbon emissionsExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionTrump administrationUS domestic policyUS politicsFossil fuelsExtreme weathercommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, her energy has been poured into monetising her statusWed 26 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShare(Wide-brimmed) hats off to Melania Trump, who has got herself one of the cushiest gigs in existence. Technically, she is the US’s first lady, but she has made it very clear that she has no interest in any of the tedious duties that normally accompany the role.The former model was hands-off during her husband’s first term and it seems she intends to be even more detached from public life now; no shaking hands with commoners or kissing screaming babies. She has been noticeably absent from Washington in the past month, so much so that when she finally reappeared at the White House on Saturday, for an annual dinner with state governors, the mere fact that she showed upmade headlines.It wasn’t just the first lady’s presence that got people’s attention; it was also her outfit. Trump has always liked to make a statement through fashion. (Who can forget theI REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?jacket she wore to a children’s detention centre?) For the National Governors Association shindig, she wore a svelte tuxedo that looked a lot like the get-up she had on forher official portrait. I am not a fashion critic, butVogue notedthat the portrait made her look “more like a freelance magician than a public servant”.While that assessment may have been a tad unfair, Trump certainly seems to have lots of tricks up her sleeve. She may not be pulling rabbits out of hats, but she has conjured up a lot of cash from sycophantic billionaires and corporations: according to theWall Street Journal, the first lady will get more than $28m (£22m) of the $40m Amazon has shelled out to make a documentary (or, perhaps more accurately, puff piece) about her life. Not content with that payout (which will barely buy you a dozen eggs these days), Trump has also apparently been shopping “sponsorships” for the film. “The pace and volume of the family’s moneymaking efforts so far are unprecedented, surpassing even the activity of Trump’s first term,” the Journal notes.As for the freelance magician’s next trick? Let’s hope she gets her husband to disappear.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But businesses know multiculturalism is good for the economyWed 26 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 06.08 ESTShareFor people who believe that the world should be run by straight white men, these are heady times. Probably the most powerful social conservative on the planet occupies the White House again, and seems determined to drive“immoral” and “discriminatory”diversity policies out of American life.Two years ago, the US supreme court banned theuse of affirmative actionin university admissions. A growing list of American and British companies, from Ford to BT toGoldman Sachs, appear to be reducing their commitment to the once fashionable corporate principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Meanwhile,Reform UK promisesto “scrap DEI rules that have lowered standards and reduced economic productivity”. In politics, commerce and education, a huge, potentially lasting counterrevolution seems to be under way.“The death of DEI is finally here,” wrote the columnist Michael Deacon in the Telegraph last year, “and it’s a joy to behold … A radical progressive ideology that, in recent years, has held countless western institutions in its miserable grip … is finally loosening.”For many companies,promoting diversityhas only been a priority for a few years, since the surge of anti-racist activism set off around the world by Black Lives Matter in 2020. And in some ways the inclusive values of DEI and the winner-takes-all ethos of capitalism have always been an awkward fit. For all but the most ethical businesses, hiring and employing people in a more egalitarian way is less fundamental than maximising profits.In many supposedly diverse companies, progress towards a truly representative workforce, especially in senior positions, has been slow and far from complete. From rightwing and leftwing perspectives, it can be argued that diversity policies have just been a cynical experiment: yet another attempt to polish corporate capitalism’s increasingly tarnished public image. Now that the political climate has changed, the experiment is being unceremoniously abandoned.But is the situation really that clearcut? One of the key features of current rightwing populism is a desire to escape complicated social realities, and so it is with the revolt against diversity. Thanks to globalisation, immigration and trends in birthrates, Britain and the US, like most other rich countries, are much more multicultural than they were in the 1980s – the last time there was a big conservative pushback against diversity policies. Between 1980 and 2019, the minority ethnic proportion of the US populationdoubled to 40%. In England and Wales, the proportion of people who didn’t describe themselves as white Britishdoubled between 2001 and 2021alone: from one in eight to one in four. During these decades of flux, there were also profound shifts in how millions of Britons and Americans thought about feminism, gender, sexuality and disability.None of these socially embedded trends is likely to be completely reversed, however much rightwing populists rail against them. In a speech last week, Kemi Badenoch describeddiversity policies as “poison”, but the Conservatives have their ownequal opportunities policy, with her face on the document’s first page. It commits the party to being “a supportive and inclusive environment where … the diversity of people’s backgrounds and circumstances will be positively valued … [and] where the party will also continue to work towards its dedicated goal of encouraging and promoting equality and diversity”. It’s easy to see these commitments as insincere or hypocritical, but they are also a sign of how far DEI ideas have spread.Back in the 1980s, the last transatlantic campaign against diversity policies was led by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Her government caricatured Labour councils that helped minorities as “loony left”, and then took many of their powers away. Meanwhile, in the US, Ronald Reagan aimed to abolish the federal government’s affirmative action programme, which he saw as “bureaucratic” social engineering. He alsoreduced fundingfor the agency that enforced equal opportunities employment law, drastically reducing the number of cases it brought against companies.But his counterrevolution got no further. Strong opposition – hard to imagine now – came from relatively liberal senior figures in the Republican party. More relevant to today, further support for diversity policies came from big business. “When Reagan sought to tear down affirmative action,” wrote the American sociologist Frank Dobbin in his 2009 book, Inventing Equal Opportunity, “corporate America stood together to oppose the [president’s] idea.”Businesses argued that diverse workforces made the best use of the country’s range of talent and were more creative and productive, and more able to understand a broad spectrum of customers at home and abroad. Shrewdly, businesses also rebranded affirmative action in more neutral, less political language, as “human resources management”. Reagan’s attempt to abolish affirmative action was quietly abandoned.Let’s be clear – the US never had moral supremacy. With Trump, it’s not even pretending any more | Owen JonesRead moreMight today’s war on diversity fail in a similar way? The forces of white male supremacy have a more relentless rightwing media on their side than in Reagan and Thatcher’s day.Donald Trumpand other reactionary populists also seem less likely to compromise in culture wars than their more pragmatic conservative predecessors.Yet with multiculturalism now deeply entrenched, rooting out diversity policies will be harder than Trump’s confident executive orders suggest. Legal oppositionis building, and there are already signs that business is hiding its diversity programmes behind euphemisms again. On Tuesday, Apple shareholdersvoted againstending the company’s diversity programme. “DEI is beingrebranded – not disbanded,” complained the rightwing New York Post recently. It pointed out that some companies widely thought to have dropped DEI continued to promote it on their websites in slightly modified language. If diversity policies increase profits – and according to the president of the British Chambers of Commerce,Martha Lane Fox, “Businesses that embed diversity have 25% higher financial results” – then even the most determined anti-DEI campaign is unlikely to totally prevail.Moreover, what the reactionaries want is less clear and coherent than it first seems. Do they want to restore a society utterly dominated by straight white men, which is almost certainly impossible? Or do they accept the existence of a diverse society, as long as it isn’t actually shaped by diversity policies? On these questions, conservatives are divided.Even Trump sometimes acknowledges American diversity’s permanence and importance. In his inauguration speech,he boastedof his “increases in support from … young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans …” Social conservatives around the world may be feeling triumphant now, but their revolt against diversity has probably come too late.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My own journey, shaped by decades of renting, highlights the stark realities of a market that prioritises wealth generation over tenant security and affordability.Born in the mid-1950s, my first home was a small van beside Myall Creek in Queensland. When I was still a baby, my parents secured public housing through sheer determination. My mother, pregnant and desperate, refused to leave her local MP’s office without keys to a government-owned house. That act of defiance granted my family 17 years in stable, affordable housing. This was part of a postwar commitment to providing homes for working-class Australians – in an era when public housing was considered an essential service.However, my experience as an adult renting in the private market has been vastly different. After sharing houses in Brisbane as a young professional, I eventually married and had children, continuing to rent while studying and working in the not-for-profit sector. Despite my postgraduate qualifications, my income as a community worker remained lower than my mother’s in her role as a government-employed cleaner. My divorce left me with no assets, minimal child support, and no superannuation (it was not yet compulsory).View image in fullscreenMaggie Shambrook is a founding participant of the Housing Older Women Movement in AustraliaPhotograph: Maggie ShambrookIn the mid-1990s, the federal government began shifting away from public housing. Under John Howard, tax concessions encouraged private investment in rental properties, yet regulation remained minimal. Today, around 30% of all residential rental properties are owned by investors, but this system is designed to maximise their wealth rather than provide a secure rental service for tenants.Over the past 70 years, my personal contribution to landlords through rent is modestly estimated at $900,000 across 14 properties – nearly a million dollars invested, not in my own security but in the wealth accumulation of landlords. Had those funds been directed toward a mortgage or an alternative housing model, I would have been able to secure stable housing for life. Instead I, like many others, remain caught in the rent trap – continuously funnelling money into a system that offers little in return, particularly if you rent at the lower-cost end of the market.Many women of my generation attempted to climb the property ladder but were stuck in a vicious cycle. They have bought and sold multiple homes, often due to life circumstances such as divorce, caregiving responsibilities or financial instability. Each sale left them with fewer assets until home ownership became unattainable. These women represent the “missing middle”– too wealthy to qualify for public housing but too financially strained to afford long-term private rentals or access mortgage finance due to ageist lending practices.The aged pension is designed based on the assumption of home ownership, leaving renters – particularly older women – without adequate financial support. Many must deplete their savings within a few years to affordrising rents. This leaves them in a dire position, often facing homelessness or enduring years-long waits for public and community housing, where eligibility criteria have become increasingly restrictive.Retirees who rent ‘really struggling’ financially, researchers say – and the problem is getting worseRead moreThe structural inequalities baked into Australia’s housing system disproportionately harm women, particularly those like me who have spent years in unpaid caregiving roles or in lower-paid, insecure employment. Other factors that contribute to women’s housing insecurity include the gender pay gap, financial exclusion, and domestic violence and financial abuse– many women have lived their lives without legal protection from such abuse for decades. Long-term injuries including brain damage mean some women spend long periods of time in recovery, trying to remain invisible so their perpetrators cannot find them.Policies designed to encourage home ownership among younger generations fail to address the growing crisis among older Australians who will never own property. As a society, we owe older women more than a precarious rental market that drains their savings and forces them into homelessness.Governments must build more social housing and introduce stronger rental protections. They could also invest in affordable housing models such as tenant-managed and cooperative housing initiatives that provide secure housing alternatives outside the speculative market. Targeted financial support, such as adjusting pension rates and rental assistance to reflect the realities of older renters, and changes to the taxation systemto make the system fairer for women who have lived with gender inequality over their lifetimes, could help address this crisis. And governments could address older women’s specific economic disadvantages through targeted support, such as loan (including equity) schemes and housing grants.For generations, women have contributed unpaid labour to support families, workplaces and communities. As they age, they deserve safe, affordable homes where they can continue to participate in their communities. Without urgent reform, more older women will find themselves at risk of homelessness – an unacceptable outcome for a country that once prioritised housing as a public good.Maggie Shambrook is a founding participant of theHousingOlder Women MovementExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionGenderRentingWomenPersonal financecommentShareReuse this content"

His career was about to be over. The body of the socialist deputy and his bitter foe,Giacomo Matteotti, had been discovered in a shallow grave near Rome and mounting evidence pointed to Mussolini’s responsibility for his murder. With the king, the old liberal democratic elite, the left and many of his own party pressing for his dismissal, Mussolini declared that everything – the fascist violence, the immorality, the turmoil into which Italy had sunk – was his fault, “because I, I alone, created it”. By the same token, he alone was the man “capable of dominating the crisis”. Parliament, stunned, sat silent. There was no voice of protest. The dictatorship was saved.Based on the first volume in a trilogy of the same name by Antonio Scurati and garlanded with praise by Italian critics, the television dramaMussolini: Son of the Centurycovers just six years in Mussolini’s life, from his days as a brawling but highly effective journalist in Milan to his assumption of total power. Joe Wright, better known for his gentle approach and light touch in Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, has produced a series that is loud, provocative and violent. The music that accompanies it is throbbing, incessant and often intrusive, with occasional snatches of Verdi and Puccini. All is dark, deeply gloomy and sepia-coloured.The series is presented as a “biographical historical drama” – that is to say, with considerable licence to play about with the facts. It would be fair, however, to say that for the most part the narrative keeps close to the broad sweep of Mussolini’s rise. The gerarchi, the fascist leaders such as the flying ace Italo Balbo and the gross and vituperative Roberto Farinacci from Cremona, are portrayed in their greedy, strident, vulgar colours; and his mistress, the art criticMargherita Sarfatti, is rightly seen as a considerable influence on fascism’s emerging ideology. Rachele, Mussolini’s long-suffering wife, is relegated to the shadows, and Bianca Ceccato, mother of one of his illegitimate children, is made to stand for the many others he impregnated.But the details niggle. It is highly unlikely that Quinto Navarra, Mussolini’s valet, saw Matteotti’s bloodstained wallet in the drawer of his employer’s desk. The blackshirts never staged a vast, orderly rally along the Appian Way and Mussolini surely never flung himself backwards into the arms of his yelling, flame-throwing followers. Cesare Rossi, the regime’s press and propaganda man, is shown here as the Duce’s main confidant – when that role was in fact occupied by his brother, Arnaldo.View image in fullscreen‘Luca Marinelli gives a convincing performance as the narcissistic, bombastic, insecure Mussolini.’Photograph: Andrea Pirrello/Sky ItalyDoes this matter?Luca Marinelligives a convincing performance as the narcissistic, bombastic, insecure Mussolini who, when not addressing Rossi or a vast bust of himself in the Palazzo Venezia, speaks directly to the camera, to us, his audience. There are very few scenes in which he is not present, filmed a little from below, glowering over us, confiding his thoughts, his triumphs, his contempt for his companions. This is fascism as theatre, hectoring and loud. More important than the details, perhaps, is the lack of subtlety, the crude juxtaposition between the sanity represented by Matteotti and the noisy, inarticulate barbarity offered by the fascists.There are few moments of respite. This series is not for the faint-hearted. Many people were indeed bludgeoned, dosed with castor oil and killed by the fascists, but not on this vast, orgiastic scale. The March on Rome was, in fact, concluded not in widespread bloodshed, as the series suggests, but remarkably peacefully. In Milan, Turin and Parma, where opposition was expected, the fascists took control quietly and smoothly. Rome, on the day the king lost his nerve and offered Mussolini the prime ministership, has been described as being in a “fever of delight” and florists ran out of flowers.Some of the more interesting wider perspectives have been lost. Mussolini won friends abroad: by 1923, Sir Ronald Graham, British ambassador to Rome, was reporting to London that Mussolini was a “statesman of exceptional ability and expertise”. And you get little sense ofItalyitself in the early 1920s, a country that felt betrayed by the allies, but was full of clever, articulate people, such as the historian Gaetano Salvemini and the philosopher Benedetto Croce, highly intelligent anti-fascists who, like Matteotti, fought hard to save the country from the dictatorship.Italian neofascists display banner celebrating Mussolini’s march on RomeRead moreThe miniseries aired in Italy before the UK release, and has attracted a great number of viewers, many of them admiring. In contemporary Italy, Mussolini is never far away. At the end of the war, the allies planned to rid the country of all visible signs of the dictatorship. They discovered that Mussolini had successfully imprinted fascist ideology on to the landscape, stamping his mark on to houses, sports stadiums and entire towns.Predappio in Emilia-Romagna, where he grew up, remains a place of pilgrimage for Italians who descend on the anniversary of the March on Rome, to raise their arm in the fascist salute and buy replicas of the Duce’s various helmets and berets. On Lake Garda, where he had his last government, the villas in which he and his mistress Clara “Claretta” Petacci lived are now five-star hotels. The rooms that bear their names are booked out years in advance. Books about him, his family and the fascist leadership never stop appearing. Mussolinismo, as the cult is known in Italy, is not illegal. Not surprising, then, that whenGiorgia Meloni, a former member of the neofascist MSI, was made prime minister, there was much talk of Mussolini’s legacy.It would be hard to watch the series today without being conscious of the warning it contains. When Mussolini boasts that his plan is to “make Italy great again”, his words resonate.Caroline Moorehead is a writer and historian.

It is hardly a big impost, more the question should be why, given how little it will cost, hadn’t it been done already?Talk of how we will pay things always comes up when the government intends to spend money on things that helps low and middle-income earners.Peter Dutton says public service cuts will fund his election promises. But he can’t say how they’ll be madeRead moreWe don’t seem to worry as much when it comes to spending on things such as defence, or things that only serve to make the rich richer.This brings us to Peter Dutton, whoaccording to Nine newspapershas owned 26 properties over the past 35 years.Dutton has said that he is proud of what he has achieved and that he “didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth”.But the reality is that the overriding reason anyone born before the mid-1970s got into the housing market was they were born before the mid-1970s.The Nine report suggests that he bought his first property in the Brisbane suburb of Yeronga in September 1990 for $93,000. At the time, the average male full-time earnings in Queensland was equivalent to $33,820 a year. This means that the property cost 2.75 times the annual average full-time wage.Currently, average male full-time earnings in Queensland are $112,200 a year. So a property 2.75 times that amount would cost just $308,527.I will now pause while you go searching for a three-bedroom apartment inYeronga for that price, where the median three-bedroom apartment is now $877,500.From 1970 to when Dutton entered parliament in 2001, property prices across Australia rose just 1.3 times faster than housing income. Since then they have risen 2.3 times faster.If the graph does not display click hereThis is, of course, not an accident.In September 1999 the Howard government changed the way capital gains (ie the profit you make on an investment) was taxed – giving those who sold the asset after more than a year a 50% discount on their tax.Make a $2m profit? Great you only pay tax on $1m.It turned the housing market into a casino with the added benefit of making negative gearing work because it made it easier to make up for the “losses” you incurred while negative gearing.We don’t know precisely how many members of parliament and senators negative gear, because the ATO only provides data for “legislators” which mostly count local councillors who have an average total income of $84,413.But as MPs have an average income of $288,973, it would be very unusual if they were not big time negative gearers:If the graph does not display click hereAnd this costs the government a lot of money.The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that the CGT discount and negative gearing cost $12.2bn a year – $7.2bn of which goes to the richest 10%:If the graph does not display click hereBut the issue is not just negative gearing and the capital gains discount, it’s that the entire tax system is geared in such a way that benefits the rich.Company tax is lower than the top income tax, and at 25% the tax on a small business is even lower than the 30% paid by big businesses, and superannuation funds have now become tax reduction vehicles.AnAFR reader this weekwondered how she and her husband were going to cope in retirement with just $2m each in their superannuation funds – “what should our annual expenditure be to ensure our money doesn’t run out? We are debt-free.”While you scream bitter tears of rage, remember that the government’s attempt to reduce the tax break on earnings in super balances above $3m from 30% to 15% is currently blocked in the Senate by crossbenchers. And even if those laws passed, that couple writing to the AFR would not be affected as neither of their super balances is above $3m.That is the perfect encapsulation of the glorious horror of Australia’s tax system.A system that refuses to lower the tax breaks to a couple with $2m each in their super, but where nearly a quarter or retirees live in poverty and where more than half of Australians in their early 30s do not own a home, and where cries of how will you pay for it are made when a government spends just over $2bn to increase bulk billing.The superannuation benefits, as with capital gains tax discounts and negative gearing, mostly go to the richest and are very costly:If the graph does not display click hereAs for trusts, the Treasury does not calculate how much revenue is foregone due to their use, but they know who uses them – and again, it is overwhelmingly the richest.If the graph does not display click hereSo you are worried about how the government will pay for $8.5bn over four years? How about the fact the richest 10% will get $27bn this year in tax breaks from the capital gains tax discount, negative gearing and the superannuation tax concessions:If the graph does not display click hereIt’s a broken system and it is high time we started asking what is the cost not just to the budget but to society when the richest are helped to get richer, housing affordability declines and any attempt to provide services to those on low and middle incomes is painted as a big cash splash.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsBusinessGrogonomicsEconomicsHousingAustralian politicsPeter DuttoncommentShareReuse this content"

And, you know, to survive a little bit.These past three years of our lives have been referred to in many ways: Putin’s war, the Russo-Ukrainian war, the full-scale invasion, the conflict. Now some of the media are starting to call it simply the Ukrainian war or the Ukrainian crisis. US envoys have startedobjecting to the phrase“Russian aggression” in G7 communications. And we are being dragged into a paradigm in which the war crimes of the Russians will soon be called “those events” or “this situation”.The world is trying to understand how Ukrainians feel about all this, and I have been having chats with foreign journalists. Almost everyone asks whether it is possible to get used to living in a war. Judging by their questions, it seems as if the world has long since grown used to the idea that there is a war in Ukraine and that this is simply the way it is now. One more shelling. That’s just how things are over there.I don’t know, I tell them, how one can get used to the reality of war. Every night, the Russians launch dozens of deadly Shahed drones targeting energy and civilian infrastructure. Right now, when it’s -10C outside. A strike this month on a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv, in the south of the country, left100,000 Ukrainians without heat. And after the latestassault on Odesa, the Russians have left 14 schools, 13 kindergartens, a children’s hospital and250,000 residentswithout electricity and heating. Every night, Kyiv is shaken by explosions. Every day, Russians occupy new settlements. This week it was Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region that became agrey zone.View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian serviceman is reunited with his daughter after a prisoner-of-war exchange between Russia and Ukraine, 30 December 2024.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APUkrainian servicemen and women are defending the borders of our country around the clock. Years of grief without the opportunity to grieve, tragedy that cannot be lived through but is simply compounded by the next airstrike.A foreign journalist asked me if I had ever felt real hatred towards Russians and dreamed of killing them one by one. I said it was an inappropriate question. I understand that you are doing your job, but please do not squeeze emotions out of us just to give yourself a headline for your report. The journalist said it was just that, when the enemy did this to your people … I said, please, hatred is destructive. Anger is a more constructive feeling that gives you strength and opportunity to at least somehow act.A major international media outlet asked me recently to join its educational platform. I had to record a video message in English and talk about my experience of serving in the armed forces of Ukraine, so children around the world could learn English from these videos and accompanying materials. I recorded it and did everything according to their instructions.I got a cheerful message the other day from the editorial office, saying: “We’ve launched!” I opened the presentation and had a panic attack. The lesson was structured around eight speakers, each talking about their war experience: four Ukrainians (including me) and four Russians. A Russian journalist and armed forces “deserter”. A Russian teacher. A Russian medical director. Another Russian journalist. The lesson ended with a slide. The Russian flag was at the top. The Ukrainian flag at the bottom. The question proposed for discussion: “What similarities and differences did you notice when listening to the experiences of people from Russia and Ukraine?”The emotional negligence of this makes me want to scream. Over the years, we have been turned into research material. I am sickened by how my story has become an ideological tool to equalise the experience of the defender and the attacker. I am losing my subjectivity. Still, I must pack my screams, nausea and despair into diplomatic phrases and requests to the international media outlet, asking them to remember that the experience of Ukrainians and Russians in this genocide is not something that can be compared.I’ve been living with the acute feeling that the world is tired of restraining its unquenchable love of Russia. The west wants to believe in the Cinderella story, that one day the dictatorship will fall and a wonderful democratic world will emerge.Instead of imposing further sanctions and restrictions on Russia, the west is ready to crown the film Anora withall the awards, despite the fact that the Russian actor Yura Borisov, who appears in the film, also starred in a biopic of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47, which waspartly filmed in Crimeaafter its annexation.The world is ready to listen to Russia again: a UK television channel last year released the filmUkraine’s War: The Other Sideby Sean Langan. The film doesn’t just give the other side a voice; it gives a human dimension to the stories of the occupiers and repeats the narratives of Russian propaganda. This is as consistent with journalistic standards as asking an executioner, how are you feeling as you do this, and do you miss your family who are waiting for you at home?View image in fullscreenOhmatdyt, Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital, after a Russian missile attack in Kyiv, 8 July 2024.Photograph: Oleksandr Ratushniak/ReutersI accepted long ago that I should not expect justice for myself and my family. Our home wasdestroyed by a Russian shellin the first week of the invasion. My parents spent almost three weeks under occupation in Bucha. Our traumas are our own business.But all these years I have lived with a keen sense of the need for justice for others. Am I being naive, wondering every day why the crimes of Russians remain unpunished? Or is it easier for the world to forget all this and pretend that none of the following events happened?The massacre in Bucha. The siege of Mariupol and the deadly shelling of the local theatre. A missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station. Mass graves in Izium. Torture chambers in Kherson. A rocket attack on a children’s hospital in Kyiv. Destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Nearly a quarter of the country occupied. Crimea. Parts of Donetsk and Luhansk. Hundreds of destroyed towns: Vuhledar, Bakhmut, Avdiivka. Now Pokrovsk. Kostiantynivka is next.Thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russians. Thousands of missing Ukrainian soldiers. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed. Thousands in Russian captivity. Dozens of executionscaptured on camera, when Russians killed those who surrendered.Every Russian war crime has a perpetrator. Someone who pulled the trigger, someone who equipped the missiles. Someone who supplied parts for their weapons. Someone who stole the children. Someone who settled in the occupied Ukrainian cities. And now, in addition to Russian and Iranian shells (and support from about 20 countries around the world) we are being attacked by the military from North Korea.Now justice is under threat. Right before our eyes, a world order is being formed in which truth as a category does not exist. Donald Trump says, look, here is my truth. There is your truth. But my truth is on top. That was not a Nazi salute at the inauguration celebrations. Belief is not a fact. Tribunals are impossible. The rule of law is irrelevant.If during the first term of Trump’s presidency we talked of the post-truth era, now we find ourselves in a world in which the truth is taken out, tortured and shot. This means that there will be no justice. This means that anything goes.Russia has been living like this for centuries. But now the two macho presidents, both in their 70s, one with an arrest warrant from the international criminal court, and the other the first US president to have a mugshot taken after being criminally charged, seem to be getting along well.The world is looking at the body of truth that is dying and bleeding before our eyes. I beg you, if you can’t stop the bleeding, at least don’t turn away from the sight of blood.I am Ukrainian, and I am scared. Yet there is a unity among Ukrainians that I have not seen for a long time. We will survive. Together. Because the truth exists. And we know that it is worth fighting for.Translated by Maryna GibsonOleksandr Mykhed is the author of The Language of War and member of PEN UkraineExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Now it must do it in opposition to TrumpWed 26 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 08.49 ESTShareThree times in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, its chancellors have made strategic choices that opened the door to a better future for Europe. Today there’s not just an opportunity but an urgent need for a fourth such historic moment. If the country’s new coalition government underFriedrich Merzmanages to seize the chance of this crisis, both Germany and Europe will go forward. If it fails, then by the end of the 2020s both may have fallen backwards farther and faster than most of us could have imagined in our worst nightmares.The big difference with those three earlier pivotal moments is this: in 1949, 1969 and 1989 the Federal Republic’s policy was fundamentally aligned with that of the United States. This time, Germany has to build up a stronger, free, democratic and Ukraine-supporting Europeagainstthe current policy of the US. The most staggering moment of Sunday’s election evening was when the lifelong Atlanticist Merz declared that Europe must “really achieve independence from the US”. (When compared with Emmanuel Macron’s almost British sycophancy in the White House the next day, Germany’s prospective chancellor is sounding more robustly Gaullist than the French president.)The 1949 choice of Konrad Adenauer, the Federal Republic’s great founding chancellor, to integrate the western half of his divided country firmly in the emerging transatlantic geopolitical west, and into a more integrated Europe, was in tune with the post-1945, cold war orientation of the US and the new state’s key European partners, France and Britain. Chancellor Willy Brandt’s 1969 opening to the east, his Ostpolitik, chimed with detente policies being pursued by Washington, Paris and London. Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s 1989 determination to embed German unification in further steps of European unification, including a common European currency, was welcomed by the US and opened the door to French acceptance of German unity. In all three cases, there were big reservations in one or other western capital – the most shortsighted of them being Margaret Thatcher’s opposition to German unification – but in the broad sweep of history, Germany’s big strategic choices were aligned with those of a US-led geopolitical west.Today no more. So long as Donald Trump is in the White House, there will be no “west” as a single geopolitical actor. On Monday, the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we had the scandalous spectacle of the US voting with Russia against a British-European UN resolution in support of Ukraine. The US has now joined the transactionalgreat and middle powers of the Bricsin assaulting what’s left of the liberal international order that America itself built. The international relations scholar John Ikenberry once described the US as aliberal leviathan. Today, the liberal leviathan has become a rogue elephant.The free Europe we have built since 1949 is therefore under attack from inside and out, and the two kinds of threat are intertwined. An anti-liberal, populist nationalist Europe is gaining ground everywhere. The chancellor candidate of the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), Alice Weidel, was not wrong, from her point of view, to describe her party’s election result – one fifth of the overall vote,clear election winner in eastern Germany, second-largest party in the new Bundestag – as a “historic success”. Shockingly, it was supported from Washington. US vice-president JD Vance’s rant at the Munich security conference was in effect an election speech for the AfD. On Sunday evening, Merz caustically observed that the interventions in German democratic politics from Washington were “no less dramatic than those from Moscow.”After Germany’s unification in 1990, we celebrated the fact that Germany had become a “normal” European country. Now, in a sense, we must mourn it. For to be a normal European country today is to be one in which the liberal centre is drinking in the last-chance saloon. If the liberal centre doesn’t make the changes that will win voters back from the populist extremes, Marine Le Pen will become French president in 2027, the AfD will win the German elections in 2029 and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK will overtake the Conservatives at the ballot box.The good news is that there’s growing clarity across mainstream German and European liberal democratic parties about what needs to be done. Europe has to save Ukraine. We must rapidly build a much stronger common European defence, including Britain. All of us, but especially Germany, have to restore economic dynamism, without reversing the green transition, and also address the concerns about socioeconomic and geographical inequality that have driven voters to the populists. We must control irregular migration yet make a success of the integration of large numbers of immigrants, which is the only way to address our acute demographic challenge.How to do it? How to pay for it? The obstacles inside Germany are immense. A country famous for its automobile engines is now most notable for its brakes – including a constitutionally anchored“debt brake”. Yet it’s also true that a German chancellor has immense possibilities to steer the country in a new direction if, like Adenauer, Brandt and Kohl, they have the will and the skill to do so.Traditionally, the forthcoming coalition talks between Christian Democrats and Social Democrats would result in a set of compromises involving each party getting slices from a large and growing cake. But what if the cake is shrinking and two large new slices – more investment in defence and in the country’s neglected infrastructure – must be cut out of it? Obviously Germany must somehow ease that debt brake, but if this is really to be a moment of strategic change – a trueZeitenwende– then Merz will have to follow his two great Christian Democratic predecessors, Adenauer and Kohl, and take a further big step towards a stronger Europe. For security, the defence industry, energy, the green transition and AI, Europe needsscaleto hold its own in this world of bullying giants. The solutions don’t always have to involve classic Brussels-type integration, but they can’t just be national.The biggest German brake of all is a state of mind – a curious mix of being at once too comfortable and too fearful. As a lover of German compound nouns, I was delighted to see the German political scientist Karl-Rudolf Korte capture this brilliantly by characterising Germany as aWolferwartungsland(a country constantly expecting the wolf to arrive). But today the wolves are actually there: two big ones at the door, Vladimir Putin andDonald Trump, and one small one, the AfD, already inside the hen coop.To see off those wolves, Germans need one quality above all: courage. Let them take advice from their national poet. “Property lost,” wrote Goethe, “something lost! … Honour lost, much lost! … Courage lost, everything lost!”Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionFriedrich MerzEuropeDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

I was in a bad psychological state because I was separated from my children, but at the same time it was a kind of privilege because I was learning things it’s not possible to learn without being in that situation. Everything is much more intense. Sharing a small space with someone – in a week you know more about them than their mother. You know everything: when she is happy, when she cries, when she goes to the toilet, when she has a shower. You see everything.”Born and based in Mali, she is one of the most inventive and adventurous female artists in Africa; a singer who can switch from delicate acoustic styles to rock, powered by her bluesy electric guitar work. As well as putting out six studio albums she has toured the UK with the Africa Express project, collaborating with Damon Albarn, Paul McCartney and John Paul Jones. She has been an actor, performing, singing and writing the songs forDesdemona, a 2011 Toni Morrison-penned stage project in which Shakespeare’s tragic heroine was given an African perspective. She has won awards including the French equivalent of a Grammy, and in 2015 she was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Their stories were much more troubling than my storiesShe seemed unstoppable, but she hasn’t released an album since 2016’sNé So. Her life was then transformed by a bitter custody battle with her former partner, the Belgian theatre director Jan Goossens, which led to her being jailed in France, Italy and Belgium. “I was really sad,” she says of her time inside, speaking by phone from Paris, where she has been living since her release on 22 January. She sounds cheerful, and happy to talk at length, but is clearly angry about her experiences. “It was difficult for me not knowing when it would all be over and I could be with my children again.”The dispute with Goossens was over their daughter, who was born in Belgium in 2015 but went toMalito live with her mother when she was four months old. In 2019, after the relationship had ended, Goossens demanded custody through a family court in Brussels and was granted it – though a court in Mali had already granted sole custody to Traoré. After she failed to produce her daughter in the Belgian court, a European arrest warrant was issued, accusing her of “kidnapping and hostage taking”.In March 2020, as she passed through Paris on her way to a concert at the Bolshoi theatre in Moscow, Traoré was arrested and jailed. She went on hunger strike in Fleury-Mérogis ( “the worst prison in France”, she says) but was released after six weeks because of the Covid pandemic. She was told to remain in France awaiting extradition to Belgium, but used her diplomatic passport (a common perk for African stars) to fly back to Mali on a private jet. Traoré said she was concerned about the welfare of her daughter, and her son from an earlier relationship, during the pandemic.View image in fullscreenDynamic … performing at Africa Express.Photograph: Polly Thomas/AlamyBack in Mali, she couldn’t find work. The security situation in the country had deteriorated, with attacks by armed Islamic groups seriously damaging tourism and the local music scene, and a military government taking over in August 2020. Because of the kidnapping charge against her, international funding for herFondation Passerellecultural centre had stopped. “So I had to use my own resources to help the few artists we have,” she says. “I’m not one that spends much money. The most expensive thing in my life is my children’s education.”After four years in Africa she attempted to restart her career in Europe, although in October 2023 the Belgian court sentenced her to two years imprisonment in her absence. On 20 June last year she flew into Rome for a concert at the Colosseum, and was arrested, held in prison for eight months, then transferred to a jail in Brussels. Some of her fellow inmates there had been convicted of violent offences, but she says she “wasn’t fearful of someone who had killed someone. High-level criminals didn’t scare me.”Her release in January came after she signed a confidential agreement with her daughter’s father, validated by the court. Later in the year, the court will reconsider the case – this time with Traoré and her lawyers present.During Traoré’s incarceration, her daughter was in Mali and had never been separated from her for so long. Her son was just starting university in Paris, but it was hard for Traoré to sort out payment for his accommodation. She survived, she said, by spending much of her time writing. Not songs, but a journal in which she chronicled the lives of the women who were locked up with her.Traoré says she heard “stories that were much more troubling than my stories. Of course I was worried about what was going to happen to me, but my fears were nothing compared with theirs. It left me time to think about their cases and forget about myself. In a way it made it easier to pass the time, writing about the others. Being in jail destroys you, and you don’t understand what’s happening to you, but I made it a constructive experience.”She wrote about the way prison conditions varied across Europe. Italy was best, she says, not because of the state of the prisons but the attitude of the authorities. The guards were more respectful and lawyers talked openly about the large number of prison suicides, a subject discussed far less in France and Belgium. And in Italy, unlike Belgium, prisoners were allowed to draw up petitions over their grievances. She signed two, which were both successful: “One of them was about missing medicines the prisoners needed, and the following week all the missing medicines were there.”View image in fullscreenTragic tale … in Toni Morrison’s Desdemona.Photograph: Herwig Prammer/ReutersIn Belgium, the prison was new and prisoners were allowed TV and a phone, “which was very good”, but there were complaints of long waits to see a doctor and many prisoners couldn’t understand how to use the computerised appointment system. “I made two demands for my cellmates, and neither had been answered by the time I left.”All of which made her question what the prisons were hoping to achieve. “There’s no point in being in jail if it’s not for the person to repair something inside, to understand that what they did was bad, and learn things that would be useful when they start a new life. But what happens in jails is not like that.” She says it seems as if “people are there to be broken, to feel fear and pain and sadness. It’s about so many things – except reconstruction”.In all three prisons, she says, “some women got very close to me and supported me and talked to me as a friend. And the few times I was really sad they supported me, saying, ‘Don’t cry. You are going to be out, because you are different from us, you did nothing. But please, when you are out, talk about us – about our needs to see our children, to be treated as normal people when we are out.’”It’s hard to restart life after prison – it can’t be the same as it was beforeSo she is doing just that, planning a book and a stage show based on her prison experiences. The live project will be “a piece of musical theatre, as I used to do in the past”, and will include monologues taken from the book, along with new music. She says the music will encompass both the classical Mandinka music of west Africa and “probably something more modern showing the connection between Mandinka, blues and classical styles”.The approach sounds similar to that ofDamou, her 2012 words-and-music project in which she demonstrated her compelling storytelling in a reworking of the Epic of Soundiata, a poem from Mali’s ancient oral tradition. For the new project, she has yet to decide if she will perform all the spoken and musical passages herself or be joined by another musician. Titled À Huis Clos, the show will open in France, where Traoré has been discussing staging and choreography with Moïse Touré, director of the company Les Inachevés. An English version, titled In Camera, will follow.But for all that she is keeping busy, and remains a well-loved and successful artist, Traoré says that, like other former prisoners, she is still anxious about her return to the outside world. “Because even for me, it’s hard to restart life after prison. It can’t be the same as it was before. The fact that you have been in prison impacts on all your life.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Bad art is lifeless, good art is alive and great art is supervital. And it’s a supervital masterpiece I am looking at right now. Face as sharply hewn as a Congolese mask, with a flesh-coloured pullover melting into the shadows of his loins, Peter Lacy dominates the room, captured in a gold-framed portrait by his loverFrancis Bacon.That room is the Colony Room Green in London, not the original Colony Room but a bar nearby that lovingly recreates, with the precision of an art installation or stage set, the bohemian drinking den run byMuriel Belcherwhere Bacon would order drinks all round with his famous toast: “Champagne for my real friends and real pain for my sham friends!” Its green walls are covered with art and memorabilia, including a wanted poster made by artist Lucian Freud to recover his own lost portrait of Bacon.So how has Peter Lacy, who seems an immense, baroque phenomenon propped up in the middle of these cosy confines, made his way home ? He is on “day release”, explains Jago Cooper, director of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia – as in a day out from prison. The Sainsbury Centre has declared that all the artworks it owns are alive: “Art is alive and animate, waiting to be communicated with by anyone with a soul.” So, Cooper wondered, where would a living work of art want to go if it had a brief escape from the jail of the museum?It’s a pretty good guess that a Bacon painting would choose to return to its creator’s old haunt, or at least this replica. The burningly intense painting holds court at the centre of the room. You half-expect it to start dropping acid one-liners to the cackling delight of drunken ghosts – all the Soho monsters and reprobates hovering in the afternoon shadows, drinks in their skeletal hands. It’s a lovely bar, but if you do visit the new Colony Room, you won’t, sadly, find Bacon’s painting. This really is just a day release, although it is all being recorded for a film to be shown from April at the Sainsbury Centre, with actors playing gay men from Bacon’s generation and from today, comparing experiences.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lightning visit by a masterpiece to a drinking den where the public can’t see it except on film? Let’s not use the dread words “publicity stunt”. Instead, let’s wonder whether it really is meaningful to claim that a work of art is a living thing, with a mind of its own and opinions about where it would like to go.Anyone who has ever loved a work of art knows this to be true. It is fundamental to art’s power and magic. The Bacon in the bar is electrifying proof. Every smoky brushstroke, every matted smear of black or pink, simmers with life. Lacy is a sentient being, and behind him, you feel the vital presence of the artist himself, the warm blood coursing through his painting hand.Five centuries ago, the Renaissance writer Giorgio Vasari praised the Mona Lisa thus: “In the pit of the throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating of the pulse.” In fact, art has been experienced by most people in the majority of places throughout human history as animate: that is, as sacred objects in which a divine or magical force is infused. In southern Italy, you can still see statues weep, come to life, process at festivals. In this pleasantly claustrophobic little bar, I am getting that same uncanny feeling about Peter Lacy. Is he about to reach out of the painting and hit me,as he was wont to hit Bacon?Francis Bacon: Human Presence review – ‘This whirligig of horrors is the best Bacon show I’ve ever seen’Read moreIt’s a reverence that was replaced in most parts of Europe by the 18th century with a more secular, rational spirit of aesthetic admiration. Works of art – or objects designated as such – were torn from religious or ritual settings and placed in museums. Or imprisoned, to continue the “day release” image. There we sometimes struggle to feel their magic power, their life.The Sainsbury Centre is trying to reclaim that intoxicating belief in art, not just through its day-release programme but in its displays, which urge you to encounter artworks as living beings, from carved masks of the Pacific Northwest to Picasso drawings. Its app tells you not the “history” of an artwork, but its “life story”; not when it was made, but when it was “born”.Gimmicky? Not to me. Either you believe art is alive, or it means nothing to you. Do yourself a favour. Believe.The Living Art collection displays can be experienced atSainsbury Centre, University of East Anglia, Norwich.Explore more on these topicsFrancis BaconArtPaintingNorwichLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like the Mennonites and the Amish, they emerged from the Radical Reformation in central Europe in the 1500s, but unlike them they live communally, with all goods and property shared among members of the community. Today, Hutterite colonies mostly exist on either side of the US-Canada border, where there are more than 500 of them.In 2009, I was driving through Canada’s Manitoba prairies in search of interesting photos for the newspaper I work for,the Brandon Sun, when I spotted some women working in the garden at Deerboine Colony. I knew a little about the Hutterites but not a lot, and pulled over to ask if I could make some pictures. The women were friendly and agreed, and I spent the afternoon chatting and photographing them.One of the young women took a flip phone out and took some pictures of me while I was working. Until then, I would have assumed Hutterites avoid modern technology in much the same way Amish and many Mennonite communities do. But this woman had almost exactly the same phone as I did, and that’s what hooked me. I had a series of discussions with the colony’s minister, Tom, who was open to me coming back to learn more and take further photographs. At the time I thought: “Here’s a personal project I can sink my teeth into outside of my job and freelance work, and maybe spend a year on.” I’ve now been visiting Hutterite colonies for more than 15 years – a few dozen of them so far. I remain fascinated by their way of life, and want to show it in as nuanced a way as possible.People in mainstream society can be uncomfortable with the thought of where their food comes fromThe colonies are very self-sufficient. Their members grow and raise the overwhelming majority of the food they eat. Deerboine has a poultry barn, and the life of an egg-laying chicken is about nine months. Every year there’s a turnover as new hens are brought in for peak egg production and the last batch are slaughtered. When this photograph was taken, in 2015, I think they had around 11,000 chickens, and every able-bodied person in the community helped out in the two days of butchering.The first timeIapproached Tom to ask whether I could photograph the process, he made a deal with me. He said: “If you help out in the morning, you can photograph in the afternoon.” The chickens are stunned with an electric rod, then decapitated, then they go in a big drum that removes all the feathers before the carcass goes down a sort of assembly line to be cleaned and packaged to be frozen. I helped out with the cleaning part. I was vegetarian at the time, so it was an interesting experience, but it was fascinating to see how everyone worked.Justin Hofer, who you see here, really stood out. Seeing him covered in blood, I wanted to make a portrait that showed this is hard work, and not pretty. About 80 to 90% of my Hutterite work is fly-on-the-wall documentary stuff, just waiting for things to happen, while the portraits tell the story a bit differently, giving more of an insight into individuals. They also terrify me, because I’m a fairly socially awkward person.This portrait drawsviewersin: you want to know the story behind it. Why is this young man covered in blood? It’s a little shocking, and people in mainstream society can be uncomfortable with the idea of where their food comes from. Justin has since left the colony, as young Hutterites occasionally do, although some later return. They tend to do very well in the outside world as they have a reputation for being intelligent and hard-working. But there’s clearly a huge draw to the kind of community life Hutterites practice – that closeness, not having to worry about losing wages if you get sick, or who’s going to take care of you. There’s a lot of joy and laughter. I can definitely see the appeal of Hutterite life.Tim Smith’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Ottawa, Canada 1978.Trained:Journalism and photography at the Western Academy ofPhotography, Victoria, Canada.Influences:“So many documentary photographers. Amy Toensing was the first photographer whose work I really connected with. Lynn Johnson, Ami Vitale, Stephanie Sinclair, Natela Grigalashvili, Lucas Foglia, Terra Fondriest, Larry Towell – too many others to name.”High point:“Any moment I get to spend photographing people who are gracious enough to share their lives with me, and especially when I’m out at a colony. I’m always happy there.”Low point:“The deterioration of photojournalism as a viable career, especially in Canada, feels like a continual low point that gets lower every year. Making a mistake while doing my job also always feels pretty low, even if it’s as simple as spelling a name wrong in a caption.”Top tip:“Invest in time over any other aspect. Gear doesn’t matter.

Our guides to thebest picture,best actorandbest directorracesCatherine ShoardWed 26 Feb 2025 05.59 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 06.02 ESTShareDemi Moore forThe SubstanceView image in fullscreenAn irresistible comeback … Demi Moore in The Substance.Photograph: Christine Tamalet/© Universal StudiosCareer wins and nominations:After a career marked more bybox office recordsthan silverware – bar a Golden Raspberry win – Moore, 62, has been hoovering up a lot of trophies forThe Substance. She missed out on theBaftaearlier this month, and the independent spirit award, but won theGolden Globefor leading actress in a comedy or musical, as well as the Critics’ Choice trophy and theSag award.Who she plays: Fading 50-year-old celebrity Elisabeth Sparkle, who turns to a black market drug to create a younger version of herself, after being abruptly fired from her TV aerobics show due to her age. But the drug comes with unexpected side effects.How’s she doing in the Oscars race:Frontrunner, just. Most money is still on Moore, but the gongs she’s lost have been to the same person –Mikey Madison– whose film, Anora, has benefited from a last minute surge of momentum. But at this stage, it’s still Moore’s to lose.Whatthe Guardiansaid:It’s flawed and overlong but there’s a genius bit of casting in Demi Moore who is a very good sport about the whole thing.Why she should win:Moore’s is an irresistible comeback narrative – and she knows it. “I’ve been doing this a long time– like over 45 years – and this is the first time I’ve ever won anything as an actor,” she said on the podium at the Golden Globes.“Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me I was a popcorn actress and, at that time, I made that mean this wasn’t something I was allowed to have. That I could do movies that made a lot of money, but that I couldn’t be acknowledged, and I bought in and I believed that.”Moore said this thought “corroded” her to the extent that she “thought a couple of years ago that maybe this was it, maybe I was complete, that I had done what I was supposed to do”.The actor said she was “at a low point” whenCoralie Fargeat’s script for The Substancefound its way to her. “The universe told me, ‘You are not done.’”Moore is well-liked across the industry, and her legacy of getting bums on seats through the 80s and 90s still fondly recalled. She has won further fans for her gracious support of former husband Bruce Willis – with whom she has three children – as his health declines. Her2019 memoirdetailed a childhood strikingly heavy on trauma and upset, which she has also handled with poise and dignity.The role is also helpful: Fargeat’s satire taps into America’s fear of middle-aged women and its squeamishness about celebrities looking their age at a moment of particularly abrasive patriarchy at the top. Hollywood’s opportunities for demonstrating their distaste with the reality TV star in the White House are not enormous this year – but a victory for Moore in this role would sort of count.Why she may not win: The Substance is not without its decriers – or those who find it simply too gory to enjoy. Horror has a patchy record at august awards. And a lot of people are really wowed byMikey Madison.Further reading:‘We can be violent to ourselves.

So far, she’s taken the Independent Spirit prize for best actress, and, most notably so far, theBafta. She’s been nominated for a clean sweep of major gongs.Who she plays: The titular sex worker inSean Baker’s comedy/romance/dramaabout her fling with an immature son of a Russian billionaire.How’s she doing in theOscarsrace:A strong second favourite. Had she won the Sag award last weekend, she would have moved to favourite.Whatthe Guardiansaid:It is a terrific performance from Madison, who owns the screen.Why she should win:A lot of voters really, really like Anora – and Madison’s performance is the heart of the film (there’s barely a scene without her). It’s an astonishing breakthrough from a relative unknown – a fairytale Hollywood eagerly embraces – and it happily reclaims a profession from the nonsense of Pretty Woman. Baker’s film won thePalme d’Or at Cannes, and followed that a fortnight ago with major wins at guild awards in the US – the WGA and the PGA. Both the latter are reliable bellwethers of Oscars glory.Why she may not win: She’s just too young, and too unknown to be readily distinguishable from the role (which was written for her). Moore’s almost-40-years of fame gives her an unbeatable edge. Some findAnoraa touch shallow.Further reading:Mikey Madison: from Tarantino bit part to hot tip for an Oscar playing a sex workerWhy Anora should win the best picture OscarHow to watch Mikey Madison in AnoraAus: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsUK: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsUS: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsFernanda Torres for I’m Still HereView image in fullscreenHeartfelt … Fernanda Torres in I’m Still Here.Photograph: Alile OnawaleCareer wins and nominations:The Brazilian veteran won best actress at Cannes in 1986 for Love Me Forever or Never but until I’m Still Here her awards have mostly come from Latin America. For Walter Salles’s movie, however, she took theGolden Globefor best actress in a drama, making her the first Brazilian, Latin American, and Portuguese-speaking actor to do so. Her Oscar nomination is only the second ever given to a Brazilian actress in that category; the first was her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, for Central Station 26 years ago.Who she plays: Eunice Paiva, the activist coping with the forced disappearance of her husband, the dissident politician Rubens Paiva, during Brazil’s military dictatorship in the early 1970s. Salles’s film is based on the memoir by one of their children, Marcelo.How’s she doing in the Oscars race:Middling. Unlikely to win, but the most likely of the three remaining to pull an upset by doing so.Whatthe Guardiansaid:Torres is effectively the still centre of a heartfelt but also somehow numbed and sometimes even strangely placid story.Why she should win:I’m Still Hereis a major hit, with vocal and committed fans. It’s broken box office records – and Torres’s nomination is a landmark in itself. She’s acting royalty in Latin America and the story told is one which will strike a particular chord with liberal creatives in Hollywood troubled by Trump. The Golden Globe win was a major coup.Why she may not win: The Globes are, however, voted for by about 300 international journalists – very few of whom (if any) will also be able to vote at the Academy Awards. Torres’s campaign was faintly damaged by another nominee (see below) accusing hers of sabotage, and by nepo-baby discourse.Further reading:Brazil film portraying notorious crime during dictatorship strikes chord: ‘It hasn’t been overcome’How to watch Fernanda Torres in I’m Still HereAus: in cinemasUK: in cinemasUS: in cinemasCynthia Erivofor WickedView image in fullscreenOverpowering star presence … Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in Wicked.Photograph: Giles Keyte/APCareer wins and nominations:The most highly decorated contender this year, Erivo is one Oscar short of anEGOT, having already bagged a daytime Emmy, a Grammy and a Tony. This is her third Academy Award nomination – following song and performance nods for 2019’s Harriet. She’s also been nominated for two Baftas, four Golden Globes and four Sag awards.Who she plays: Elphaba Thropp, green-skinned, much-maligned and the futureWickedWitch of the West, in the first part of Jon M Chu’s adaptation of the Broadway hit set in pre-Dorothy Oz.How’s she doing in the Oscars race:Badly. No one is tippingErivofor the gong.Whatthe Guardiansaid:It’s a sugar-rush fantasy with the overpowering star presence ofCynthia Erivo; it basically dunks you face-down in a hyperreal ball pit of M&Ms for two and three-quarter hours.Why she should win best actress:Wickedis one of only two certified blockbusters in contention this year, the other beingDune: Part Two. Hollywood is conscious of the need to reward movies people actually want to go and watch, and to doff their cap to the tastes of the young. Erivo is a massive talent and the soul of the film. She’s been impeccably gracious through the press tour, while also taking no prisoners (see her outrage at a fan poster which minimised her role). The film is an overt push-back to prejudice and discrimination, albeit via maligned green-skinned witches and talking animals, and Erivo is a superb advocate of this message.Why she may not win: There’s no real momentum behind the campaign – and the film doesn’t need gongs. Erivo might be becoming a bit of an awards bridesmaid, but at 38, there’s still plenty of time – and the second part of Wicked is slated for later this year …Further reading:Cynthia Erivo on fame, fear and not fitting in: ‘I’ve never talked about how tough my journey has been’Why Dune: Part Two should win the best picture OscarHow to watchCynthia Erivoin WickedAus: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsUK: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsUS: in cinemas, buy/rent on digital platformsKarla Sofía Gascónfor Emilia PérezView image in fullscreenControversial … Karla Sofía Gascón in Emilia Pérez.Photograph: Shanna Besson/PAGE 114/WHY NOT PRODUCTIONS/PATHÉ FILMS/FRANCE 2 CINÉMACareer wins and nominations:Along with herEmilia Pérezco-stars, Gascón won the best actress award at Cannes, before solo winning the European Film award for best actress. She is the first outtrans actor ever nominated for an Oscar, and was the first nominated for a leading Golden Globe film award and a Bafta.Who she plays: The titular star of Jacques Audiard’s daring musical about a Mexican cartel boss who fakes their own death and medically transitions.How’s she doing in the Oscars race:Initially, brilliantly.Emilia Pérezwas everyone’s favourite Cannes breakout – even more, perhaps, than Anora. It remained a favourite of awards voters even when gay, trans and Mexican communities voiced their disquiet. The fairytale around Gascón was a dream: an international unknown, whose previous experience was mostly telenovelas, and the first ever trans actor up for an Oscar. She had it in the bag!Whatthe Guardiansaid:Gascón carries it off with queenly flair.Why she should win best actress:Few people could play that role convincingly and Gascón is one of them. Opportunities for trans actors are rare, and Hollywood is ever eager to celebrate them – especially as the new administration seeks to clamp down on their rights. A 52-year-old Hispanic trans newcomer would, you’d imagine be unbeatable.‘They chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her’: has the Emilia Pérez backlash gone too far?Read moreWhy she may not win: Er … let’s put it this way: if Gascón does win, it would be the biggest story ever at the Oscars, including the envelopes, the slap and the streaker. Gascón’s campaign imploded afteroffensive tweets, most pretty recent, many racist and some attacking the Oscars themselves, were unearthed. The star was repentant and apologetic but was shunned by her studio, director, co-stars – and assorted politicians. Netflix said they would no longer fund her expenses to attend any awards or events and hastily removed the star of their film from publicity about it.A mild backlash to the backlash followed, which saw Audiard extend an olive branch, saying at the Baftas that he “kissed” the absent star, despite reporting the previous week that he hadn’t spoken to her and didn’t want to. With less than a week to go before the Academy Awards, Netflix U-turned, and said they would pay for her to go to both the Césars in Paris on Friday and the Oscars on Sunday.

Butterfly, the girl who gives up her religion and ultimately her life for the love of a western sailor, becomes Mariposa, a young male sex worker who transforms himself completely to try to win the heart of Preston (the Pinkerton character). It’s a strong idea – the sacrifice of the self in the desperate desire to be loved – but this production by UK-based, Gran Canarian choreographer Carlos Pons Guerra still needs some honing in the execution.Poor Mariposa (Harry Alexander) is lost from the very beginning, wandering the Havana docks. Alexander is a tall, exquisite dancer best known for work with Michael Clark and Jules Cunningham, both notable for their exactingly technical and thoroughly un-dramatic work. So this is a huge departure, a role that asks almost too much in acting terms: a deeply layered inner world, and a complex connection between Mariposa and his stiff, repressed sailor lover (Daniel Baines), who is going home to get himself a wife. You can appreciate Mariposa’s vulnerability, you can feel it, but a character needs more than just tragedy across three acts.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe mood is like a once-pretty fabric with all the colour faded from it; a night-time world where the sun barely rises. But there are some shifts in tone. Pons Guerra finds some very inventive ways to show Mariposa at work with his clients (while still keeping their clothes on) – comical but grim, underlining the transactional nature of it all. And Elle Fierce brings spiky personality and glamour to the role of the brothel owner.The show could do with a lot of tightening, but there is something potentially very powerful here, with rich ideas such as the use of the pointe shoe as a loaded symbol of femininity, and a surprisingly redemptive ending. The music by Luis Miguel Cobo features a few warm Spanish songs and a lot of darkly ominous rumblings, but the best bits are when snippets of Puccini’s melodies break through with their sweetly yearning, haunting beauty, and the drama momentarily transcends.Atthe Place, London, until 26 February.

In 2021, after releasing an impressive experiment with the idea of interactive film inBlack Mirror: Bandersnatchin 2018 and a free Stranger Things game in 2019, Netflix began expanding more fully into interactive entertainment.The streamer’s gaming offering, for a long time, was its best-kept secret. Whoever was running it really had an eye for quality: award-winningly brilliant and relatively little-known indie games comprised the majority of its catalogue, alongside decent licensed games based on everything from The Queen’s Gambit to the reality dating show Too Hot to Handle. Subscribers could play games such as Before Your Eyes, a brief and touching story about a life cut short; Spiritfarer, about guiding lost souls to rest and Into the Breach, a superb sci-fi strategy game with robots v aliens. The company bought or invested in several game studios known for making critically acclaimed work, including London-based Ustwo games (which was behind Monument Valley). It also established a studio in California to work on blockbuster games, staffed by veteran developers.But it seems things are changing. That blockbuster studio has been closed, as first reported byGame File, before it could ever release a game. Its latest tie-in game, Squid Game Unleashed,absolutely sucks– it’s constructed around the celebration of slapstick violence, making it a terrible fit for a satirically violent show about capitalist exploitation. Funding a bunch of indie darlings and hiring big-name talent from the likes of Blizzard and Bungie for its game studio gave the impression that Netflix really was keen on becoming a part of the gaming industry, and doing it properly. Now that is very much in question.The company has made layoffs across its gaming divisions, including at Night Studio – makers of weird-fiction supernatural teen horror series Oxenfree. It has cancelled plans forseveral forthcoming gamesthat were due to join the service, including indie hits Thirsty Suitors and Don’t Starve Together, and promising-looking hobbit game Tales of the Shire. What’s going on?View image in fullscreenNetflix has laid off staff across its gaming divisions, including those behind the teen horror series Oxenfree.Photograph: Netflix/NightSchoolThere have been several changes of leadership. Christopher Lee, a former EA executive who was made the company’s first head of games in 2016, left to join Xbox in 2022. Mike Verdu, another former executive at EA and Oculus, became head of game development in 2021 but has since been replaced by Alain Tuscan, hired from Epic (the makers of Fortnite). Meanwhile, the firm’s head of developer relations Leanne Loombe – who presumably has excellent taste, having brought so many wonderful indie games to the service since joining in 2021 – left earlier this year.These significant strategic changes have happened in the past six months since Tuscan took over. Current co-CEO Greg Peters said in an earnings callearly this yearthat Netflix was refocusing its gaming efforts. “Based on all our learnings and under the leadership of Alain Tuscan we are refining our strategy.” Peters described how the streamer would focus on narrative games based on Netflix intellectual property such as party and couch co-op games, saying: “We think of this as a successor to family board game night, or an evolution of what the TV game show used to be … games for kids, no ads, no payments … and more recognisable mainstream titles.”None of that looks great for any of the studiosNetflixhas bought over the past few years, all of which were lauded for their original, creative and unusual games.The inevitable conclusion is that Netflix is retreating to a safe, predictable gaming strategy, which is immensely disappointing for anyone who hoped that the streaming giant might be a much-needed source of investment in gaming creativity. In the earnings call, Peters kept reiterating how successful thatSquid Gametie-in had been: depressingly, it is the company’s most successful game, despite being as thin and transparent as a piece of wet tissue. It looks as if we can expect much more of that in future.I had once worried that,like Google before it, Netflix would simply exit the gaming space as soon as it became evident that it is a really expensive, unpredictable and difficult business to break into. It seems that the streaming giant is keen on sticking around, but no longer so keen on investing in creativity and quality. I would urge whoever takes up the$1.3m jobas Netflix’s next face of games to remember that these things are not mutually exclusive. By investing in originality alongside those nailed-on licensed games and big names, you will ensure that Netflix has a real future in games. One can fund the other, and the one eternal truth of the games business is that quality really, really matters – and gamers know when they’re being condescended to.What to playView image in fullscreenDramatic and exciting … Monster Hunter Wilds.Photograph: CapcomThe latest in Capcom’s superb action series,Monster Hunter Wilds, is out this week. I’ve played these games for almost 20 years, and about 12 of those were spent trying to convince people that theydoget good eventually, after you get past the initial boring gathering quests and steep learning curve.Monster Hunter World, from 2018, made the series a lot friendlier, though, and Wilds makes it friendlier still: its 15-hour single-player story is full of dramatic and exciting fights against awe-inspiring, intimidating creatures.It’s like an extended tutorial on what makes Monster Hunter brilliant. After the first couple of quests you will need no further convincing, even if you’ve never played one of these games before.Available on:PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XEstimated playtime:15 hours for the story, then potentially 100 more hours of hunting funskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As his uncle, and as a game designer, I want to fuel his passion, but I respect her boundaries.

Shehas cautiously asked me to recommend some appropriate games. Top of my list are Mario, Zelda and Animal Crossing.Since you’re a mother and a gamer, are there any in particular you’d recommend?”You can’t go far wrong with Nintendo’s games in terms of safety and child appropriateness. (I also appreciate that the Switch doesn’t have a YouTube app, or an easily accessible web browser.) For a 10-year-old, it’s going to come down to what he’s interested in: is he into adventure stories? If so,Zeldais the thing (BOTW is a 12 but if your sister is strict about that, Link’s Awakening is 7-plus). My animal and dinosaur-obsessed boy lovedPokémonpassionately (Sword and Shield are the best Switch picks). Mario is a huge hit in my house with both my kids. Despite their very different personalities, they both adoreMario Party Jamboree– I think as adults we often dismiss these casual-ish party games but there’s tremendous variety and creativity in the 100+ different minigames.Minecraft(offline!) is also obviously a mainstay for that age group, too.Nintendo Labois also a parent-pleasing option due to all the cardboard crafting, if your sister is coming around from a belief that video games are inherently bad.I’ve had many versions of this conversation with other parents who aren’t enmeshed in gaming themselves. It has reminded me that when parents try to ban something, we often create problems that we’re not aware of. Your nephew is fascinated by video games, but he’s playing the least nourishing versions of them possible through the only means he has. My parents restricted my own game-playing time to weekends only when I was wee, hoping to put the brakes on my passion for them. (That worked out brilliantly.) Where possible, I think we’re often better off engaging with the things our kids enjoy, while also helping them moderate themselves and keep to our boundaries. It’s time-intensive, but worthwhile.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterNetflixSquid GamefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a film about families, adoptive families and ersatz families; the director is famously the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola and a cousin to producer Matthew Shire, who is married to the film’s screenwriter Karen Gersten, but this is a film with more than nepo status.Jamie Lee Curtis is forthright and humorous as Shelly’s pal Annette, a former dancer who got out years ago and is now a cocktail waitress with a gambling problem: she has a great, almost semi-hallucinatory setpiece rocking out solo on the casino floor to Bonnie Tyler’s Total Eclipse of the Heart. (Maybe the film should have been all about her.) Dave Bautista is Eddie, the show’s lighting director, a big, gruff guy who can’t easily talk about his feelings for Shelly. Kiernan Shipka and Brenda Song are Jodie and Mary-Ann, two young dancers who are angry and hurt when Shelly rejects the quasi-mom role they insist on creating for her – andJason Schwartzman(another Coppola cousin) plays the cruel director for whom Shelly must humiliatingly audition to get another job.Coppola and cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw create interestingly ruminative outdoor sequences for Shelly, brooding in the harsh sunshine of the Vegas strip in the daylight that doesn’t get let in on the magic – although the big confrontation scenes with Hannah and Eddie are a little contrived, as is their implied final reconciliation. It is a strong turn from Anderson, though, whose fans are entitled to wonder if it is she, and not Demi Moore, who deserves this year’s “comeback queen” crown.The Last Showgirl is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 February and in Australian cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPamela AndersonJamie Lee CurtisJason SchwartzmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

There were some very difficult moments and I often questioned my decision. But as we got better I thought, ‘OK, this is really good.’ We proved Wings could be a really good band. To play to huge audiences in the same way the Beatles had and have an impact in a different way. It was a huge buzz.”Formed in 1971, Wings released seven studio albums, a live album and a compilation album over the ensuing decade, including Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, and At the Speed of Sound. Alongside McCartney, the band’s core members were his wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.“Wings was about love, family, friendship and artistic growth, often in the face of tremendous adversity”, said Widmer, who was a speechwriter in the Clinton White House.Described as an “oral history”, the book will remember Wings’ songs, collaborations and performances, drawing on interviews with McCartney and others in the band’s orbit. Organised around nine Wings albums, the book “sheds new light on the immediate aftermath and seismic global impact of the Beatles’ break-up”, according to its publisher, Penguin imprint Allen Lane.“The narrative follows the various incarnations of the band as they survive a mugging in Nigeria, appear unannounced at UK university halls, tour in a sheared-off school bus with their children, while producing some of the most indelible and acclaimed music of the decade,” Allen Lane added. The volume will also feature more than 100 photographs, many of which have never been seen before.Paul McCartney and Wings: One Hand Clapping review – restored rockumentary is pure pleasureRead moreThe book is part of a wider re-examination of the band’s catalogue, which has included the theatrical release last year of performance filmOne Hand Clappingand its accompanying album, 50th anniversary editions of Band on the Run (released last year) and Venus and Mars (released next month), and a forthcoming documentary about McCartney’s solo and Wings-related work of the 70s by film-maker Morgan Neville.Explore more on these topicsMusic booksBiography booksPaul McCartneyThe BeatlesAutobiography and memoirnewsShareReuse this content"

Their statement said: “Henry will be sorely missed by his friends and family, including his partner Karolyn Shindler, their son, Alexander, Henry’s daughter, Siobhan and her mother, Marjorie.”Kelly, born in Athlone but brought up in Dublin, started his career as a journalist on the Irish Times. He became the paper’s northern editor in 1970 at the height of the Troubles, after being sent there on a week’s holiday cover in 1969 as a reporter.The following four years in NorthernIrelandwere among his “proudest”, his daughter told the paper on Wednesday. “He always held the Irish Times very firmly in his heart and was very proud of the work he did in Northern Ireland and the time he spent there. I think probably looking back that was his proudest time.”Kelly left the Irish Times and joined the BBC in 1976, working as a reporter and presenter for Radio 4’s The World Tonight, but he still wrote occasionally for the paper.He also wrote books, including the 1970s work How Stormont Fell, about the events that had hit the Northern Irish parliament, and co-authored the 1990s collection Classic FM Musical Anecdotes, Notes And Quotes with John Foley.But 10 years and several books later, he made a career switch into light entertainment and followed other stars including Terry Wogan and Eamonn Andrews across the Irish Sea to London.There he landed a job co-hosting Game for a Laugh, made by London WeekendTelevision, which was then the powerhouse of Saturday night entertainment and a springboard for many TV and political figures including Peter Mandelson, Greg Dyke and John Birt, who went on to be BBC director generals, and the veteran political interviewer David Frost.He then got the opportunity to join the new breakfast TV show TV-am, taking over Michael Parkinson’s weekend duties in early 1983.After four years he left TV-am and returned to gameshows, hosting Going for Gold, a lunchtime quizshow on the BBC, where he remained for almost a decade.During the 1990s he was one of the stalwarts of the radio station Classic FM and later LBC, where he presented the drivetime show, one of the most listened-to slots in a radio station’s schedule.He lived in Hampstead in north London with his partner, Karolyn, a historian, and loved strolling in the heath and visiting his local Bull and Bush pub.His sense of humour was one of his hallmarks, along with his sense of place and modesty. When an interviewer in the Ham & High newspaper asked him what he would say if he had to write his own epitaph, he responded: “Who was he?”Explore more on these topicsIrelandTelevisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This is the follow-up tohis debut Slow West, and as with that film it is shot by Robbie Ryan with music by Jed Kurzel (director Justin’s brother and collaborator). I have to admit, though, that this does not quite have the energy or the fluency of that previous film, perhaps not the same production resources either – and by comparison it is more strenuously contrived. Yet the pure strangeness of the movie commands attention and there is a charismatic lead performance by Japanese actor-musician Mitsuki Kimura, or Kôki.She plays a dancer called Tornado, who travels around what looks like utterly empty terrain with her impresario father Fujin (Takehiro Hira) in a covered wagon, putting on a samurai show. They perform with puppets, whose little lopped-off heads and limbs squirt out fake blood with tiny ingenious pumps; they also demonstrate samurai sword-twirling combat themselves. They appear to have once been part of a travelling circus encamped elsewhere. And who do they perform to? A crowd of people show up out of nowhere, having presumably walked many miles from the (unseen) villages where they live.Among this crowd is a sinister, motley gang of violent thieves led by Sugarman – a solidly uningratiating and menacing performance from Tim Roth – and his quasi-son (or perhaps actual son) Little Sugar (Jack Lowden), whom he bullies mercilessly. They are so diverted by Tornado’s show that a little kid steals two bags of stolen gold at their feet, and so they set out on a brutal expedition to reclaim their loot and punish the kid, which leads into a violent confrontation with Tornado whose samurai skills and martial arts moves are not just for show.It really is a weird drama, made the weirder for a timeline-shuffling effect at the beginning for an episode that takes us to the local manor house, whose laird is played by Alex Macqueen. Many scenes are played out to the accompaniment of high, sometimes almost gale-force winds. And the gang themselves do not travel by horseback: they simply walk everywhere, a disturbing itinerant caravan of bandits on foot who never need to eat or sleep or take shelter. In some ways, they are the evil version of the travelling players whom they are pitted against and the confrontation has the quality of a peculiar lucid dream. It’s a puzzle of a film in many ways, but it shows that Maclean has his own film-making language.Tornado screened at the Glasgow film festival and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsPeriod and historical filmsThrillersScotlandTim RothJack LowdenreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ali is vulnerable; Ed is charming. Ali is desperate to be loved; Ed is ready to love her.And Ed is a predator. Ali is prey.Julia Raeside’s debut novel, Don’t Make Me Laugh, begins like a romcom, and ends like a different kind of fantasy: the kind in which people get what they deserve. In between, though, it feels painfully, precisely, beat-for-beat accurate. Sleazy Ed and bedraggled Ali are both so believable you could Google them. Until said denouement, there is nothing here that doesn’t ring absolutely true: famous men behaving badly? Famous men behaving very badly? Famous men taking advantage of their fame, and powerful men taking advantage of their power?The difficulty with this as a novel is that itdoesfeel so true: none of it is new; none of it is even really shocking. In a world where a sexual predator is in the White House for the second time, Harvey Weinstein has appealed his convictions, and Louis CK won a Grammy for his post-cancellation return to standup, it feels strangely naive for a character to fume over “heels, the patriarchy … underwire, the patriarchy … everything, the patriarchy”, as if naming it might make it go away. Remember when you had just learned about the patriarchy, and you thought knowing about it would give you the power to fight against it? Remember when we thought that we could turn this ship around?Ali can ‘remember her first time as a sex object like it was yesterday’, but it doesn’t stop her falling for someone who is bad newsAli can “remember her first time as a sex object like it was yesterday”, but it doesn’t stop her falling for someone who, from the start, is obviously bad news.Many women faced with Ed’s dismissive, days-later response to a nude shot (“delightful pic x”) might be tempted to block and move on. Ali’s desperate lack of self-esteem may make a certain kind of sense, but it also makes for uncomfortable reading.“Any man would be lucky to rape you,” she tells a friend who feels unattractive: it’s hard to escape the fact that this is a book that focuses not on the male emotional violence it purports to unpick, but on the bodies of those who bear the brunt of it.Women’s bodies come in for special attention, but the men are also scrupulously observed. The novel opens with a description of the “generous round” of Ed’s “belly, hanging over his jeans”; the epilogue makes sure to let us know that Ed’s shirts no longer fit him, and he is now forced to wear something that “looks like a nightie”. Weight is a constant and uneasy preoccupation: Ali charts her own weight loss meticulously, and she observes other women’s bodies with the same laser-focused gaze. Her internalised misogyny makes it difficult, sometimes, to tellthisgaze apart from the infamous male gaze. It’s as if the rot goes so deep that the plot frequently comes second to the pain. Does the accurate duplication of suffering act as a tool to dismantle the structures that shaped it, or is it just … more of the same?This is the fine line that Raeside attempts to walk, and one that is managed deftly in the novel’s best passage. Ali opens a computer folder to find “a palette of peach tones … like the stained glass at Coventry Cathedral”: every nude picture Ed has ever received from women, including her own. There are so many that they become mere pixels of “cream and pink and beige”. Ali zooms in to find “piercings, tattoos, fat rolls, stubble … stretch marks, loose skin draping, stomachs spilling over elastic, bones jutting from hips”. She imagines “rows of shelves, jars filling every horizontal, in each jar a specimen”. She dreams, and feels gills in her own neck. It is Ali’s bad luck to be both specimen and scientist, and the bad luck of tackling this particular subject that reading Ali’s thoughts on other women – other specimens – should feel so unsettlingly brutal.Ali’s self-loathing is so much bigger than herself. Her best friend, Ava, has “swapped fancying comedians for 30 plants a week and mindful drinking”, moving to the countryside with newborn IVF twins, an act that Ali views as “almost aggressive”. Ava plays no real role in the novel, except as an example of the kind of woman Ali disdains. Ali’s mother, also, is the wrong kind of woman; as is a stranger eating a boiled egg (the white caught “in the bristles on her top lip”), a life model (no signs of “inner life”), anyone who has ever sent a nude (“get some self-respect”), anyone who Ali perceives as “achieving hairlessness without pain or ugliness” (“all other women”), anyone who Ali perceives as “wearing things based on who they wanted to be that day” (again, all other women), an ageing radio presenter (her once “neat and silky” body now besmirched by “plump features … like modern extensions to an old house”), a model in an advert for self-tanner (described in painstaking detail alongside ketchup dripping off a burger bun) and a dead girl. Ali can’t decide if she envies the dead girl or not; she certainly envies the attention the dead girl gets. The dead girl, of course, has died having liposuction in Turkey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But it doesn’t delve seriously enough into still-debated issues to sway interested fence-sitters, let alone diehard carnivores that must be converted if animal agriculture’s carbon footprint is to be reduced to sustainable levels; this latter is surely the most universally compelling argument in the vegan arsenal.Co-directors Dan Richardson and Giles Alderson, also appearing front of camera, initially present the film as a fanfare for veganism’s recent growth and new acceptability. But with the film skating superficially through various locations – a vegan fair in Croatia, a sanctuary farm in South Africa, vegan mecca Los Angeles, a Super Size Me-style 30-day challenge in the UK – there’s no real history of how this turnaround happened. So while the broad-brush ideas about meat-eating’s environmental and health impacts are bandied about, there’s no real examination of why underlying attitudes shifted, and how further inroads can be made.Apparently started pre-pandemic, the film also feels slightly dated, with no reference to thereported recent slowdownin veganism’s great leap forwards, along with the headwinds currently being encountered by the alternative-meat sector. Plant protein outfit Beyond Meat appear here, but there is little digging into significant questions on which the future success of this business rests, such as the processed nature and the cost of their products.This is typical of the film-makers’ breezy approach – designed not to alienate, but which perhaps underestimates an audience they claim is ready for the message. Two former cancer patients appear claiming to have recovered thanks to overhauling their diets. Intriguing, but it would have been good to have bolstered this scientifically. And as for the opposition, only in barbecue-loving South Africa do Alderson and Richardson touch on the cultural entrenchment that maintains meat-eating around the world – but not how to address it. As a film, this is an appetising-looking but bitty starter.Foodfor Thought is on digital platforms from 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsVeganismFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

Why the quest for perfection could be ruining your holiday – and your relationshipsTomas Telegramma’s endless quest to optimise his holiday was doing the opposite. Here’s how he learned to put down the to-do list and love uncertaintyTomas TelegrammaWed 26 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Feb 2025 20.24 ESTShareRome. Late summer. The crowds aren’t easing, nor is the sun, and it’s about to sear a hole in my relationship. Hot, hangry and hungover – a diabolical combination – we’re our own kind of ancient ruins, skulking aimlessly in what feels like a black hole: an area nowhere near any of the 50-odd places I’ve saved on Google Maps for our four-day stay.A bakery appears. Then a panini bar. Then a trattoria. Then another. We don’t stop. Instead I feverishly research them online for any signs of superiority. None were pre-approved on my months-long mission to compile the ultimate Rome hitlist, cross-referencing recommendations from friends with what I had found online.Not one review is screaming “molto delizioso” and my patience with myself wanes, far sooner than my girlfriend’s. Our final destination is one of desperation: a chain supermarket where we buy cherry tomatoes (insipid), mozzarella (waterlogged) and bread (surely yesterday’s) for a 4pm panini lunch at the Airbnb.My girlfriend, who was happy with the first bakery, eats in silence. I lament breaking my “no bad meals” rule so early in our holiday and start mapping out a solid plan for the next day.If you don’t see yourself in me, a genuine congratulations. If you do, commiserations.Am I turning the heavenly holiday I’ve been pining for into a living hell of my own creation?As Type A travellers, we might think we’ve reached peak planning. But there’s always another mountain. Despite living in the post-wanderlust era, aspirational travel content is increasingly inescapable, with suggestions for what to eat, drink, do and see bombarding us from all sides of the internet. So it doesn’t take much to buy into the more-is-more mentality, looking to emulate the endless highlights reels on social media and believing you really can’t go to [insert city] without visiting [insert viral food spot]. I imagine those wired like me, who grew up in the Lonely Planet heyday, had a similarly toxic dependence, not on their smartphone but on their brick-sized travel bible.Coming in to the air-con after inhaling that self-made panino – almost certainly inferior to those sold at the countless eateries we bypassed along the way – it gets me thinking: is the never-ending quest to better my holiday actually making it worse?View image in fullscreen‘I swear the algorithm knew I was going to Rome before I did.’Photograph: Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesDoes arriving in a new place with more pins dropped than total days away make for a higher stakes to-do list than if I stayed at work? Am I turning the heavenly holiday I’ve been pining for into a living hell of my own creation?When things go well, the answer is no. There’s nothing more vindicating than when an overseas restaurant you’ve set an alarm in the middle of the night to book exceeds your expectations, or a street-food vendor you’ve queued an hour for is worth the hype.But when things inevitably go south? That’s another story. My cousins will never let me live down a day in New York when I made them schlep from the Lower East Side to the Upper East Side, on foot, to a diner supposedly revered for its cheesecake, which, as it turned out, was a rubbery, extortionately priced doorstop with strong notes of fridge.How I learned to travel without depending on my iPhone | Sarah DittmoreRead moreI blame my TikTok “For You” page – I swear the algorithm knew I was going to Rome before I did – for this new frontier of being over-informed to the point of over-planning.It wasn’t always this way. Some of the most memorable travel experiences I’ve had have been completely spontaneous: life-altering bún chả on a roadside in Hanoi, knock-your-socks-off Thai (both in spice and spectacularity) in a suburban strip mall in Los Angeles and a tagine for the ages at a random rooftop deep in the medina of Fez, Morocco.Seeking to recapture that magic changed everything on the aforementioned Italy trip. The tyrannical tour leader (me) retired and a truly extraordinary week in Tuscany ensued.Following our noses – not my notes – led us to the kind of hidden hilltop restaurant that epicurean dreams are made of, and we somehow weaselled a walk-in table. But also to a god-awful osteria where each dish managed to resemble genitalia. Instead of it landing as an epic fail though, it was one of the funniest nights of my life.So if I’ve learned anything as a recovering Type A traveller it’s do less. Take a punt. Live in the moment. And don’t let a subpar sandwich ruin your day. Or your relationship.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleItaly holidaysNew York holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The writer Thomas Hardy grew up in the thatched cottage at the end of this track. His earliest poem, Domicilium, describes the house as it was in 1800 when his great-grandfather built it. The gardens were wilderness and the lane “a narrow path shut in by ferns”. This cottage, where Hardy wrote Far from the Madding Crowd, is the starting point for a 220-mile hike, theHardy Way. I’ve walked round much of Dorset on this literary footpath, but I’m here now on a more personal pilgrimage.Dorset mapThe last time I visited this cottage near Dorchester was with my mother,Kim Taplin, who died last year. This month, Dorset-based Little Toller publishes a new edition of her first book,The English Path.It’s about footpaths in English literature. Exploring the work of nearly 200 authors and artists, Kim shows the cultural importance of paths in connecting us to each other and to nature. Paths were crucial for work, love, worship and inspiration. “Without them,” she says, “Hardy could not have written, nor Constable painted, what he did.”At Hardy’s cottage there are interactive elements: you can play the violin, darn socks by the parlour fire and eat apple and clove compote in the kitchenA love of Hardy was one of the reasons Kim moved to Dorset, where she spent her final years. He is one of six writers she singles out as a rich source of footpath imagery. Since she died, I’ve been following paths linked with these writers as a kind of footsore memorial: tramping through Cambridgeshire bluebell woods near Helpston, where the poetJohn Clarelived, and climbing the long grassy banks ofMaiden Castle, a huge iron age Dorset hill fort that inspired the novelist John Cowper Powys.Hardy’s cottage, in the tiny hamlet of Higher Bockhampton, opens from March to October. Inside the simply-furnished rooms where the author grew up there are interactive elements: you can play the violin, darn socks by the parlour fire and eat apple and clove compote in the white-washed kitchen. The independently runUnder the Greenwood Tree cafein the nearby visitor centre serves homemade comfort food.View image in fullscreenThe long grassy banks of Maiden Castle, the huge iron age Dorset hill fort that inspired the novelist John Cowper Powys.Photograph: Mark Andrews/AlamyAround the cottage, there are flashes of colour in the wintry woods: pale yellow primroses, a blue and coral nuthatch, a scarlet-capped goldfinch. There’s a smell of fallen leaves and fresh wild garlic. In a chapter of The English Pathcalled Sounds and Scents and Seeings, my mum writes about the sensory pleasures of walking. Climbing throughThorncombe Wood, I pass beech and holly. Hardy’s early novel Under the Greenwood Treestarts with the voices of different trees: “the holly whistles as it battles with itself; … the beech rustles while its flat boughs rise and fall”. Carved on a bench by hilltop Rushy Pond is the word “Listen” with onomatopoeias on upright posts: yaffle, churr, buzz, warble… The trees around are full of robins and badger-striped twittering coaltits.The hamlet of Whitcombe looks suitably Hardyesque. Sheep are grazing on the mounds of a deserted village near the thatched shearing barnWalking on, there are patches of gnarled heather and coconutty gorse. This heathland appears in Hardy’s novels, especially The Return of the Native where Egdon Heath is a brooding almost-sentient force “like man, slighted and enduring”. Across the brown and purple heath, he writes, “the white flints of a footpath lay like a thread”. The landscape is dotted with bronze age burial mounds, known locally as rainbarrows, ancient markers with a view across the vales among pines and wild ponies.Theloop of pathsI’m following, partly on the Hardy Way, passes two rural churches. The poet William Barnes (1801-1886), another of Kim’s path-rich writers, was vicar here for several decades. The hamlet of Whitcombe, five miles meandering south from Higher Bockhampton, looks suitably Hardyesque. Sheep are grazing on the mounds of a deserted village near the thatched shearing barn.InsideWhitcombe church, there are bat droppings and medieval murals: a faded mermaid combs her hair near a wayfaring St Christopher. Posters of Barnes’s dialect poems decorate the walls. Competing with the road outside I can still hear “naisy-builden rooks”, chattering sparrows, and a “blackbird, whisslen in among / The boughs…” A mile west, over chalky fields, Barnes is buried by the littlechurch at Winterborne Came. TheWilliam Barnes Societyholds events in both churches.View image in fullscreenAn exhibition at Dorset Museum in Dorchester.Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty ImagesHardy’s poem The Last Signal marks the death of Barnes, his friend. The poem opens on the track I’m climbing now, where the mud is pitted with deer prints: “Silently I footed by an uphill road.” Near the Celtic cross that marks Barnes’s grave are banks of budding daffodils, furled garlic leaves and ivy-smothered trees where woodpeckers are drumming.On the outskirts of Dorchester, I reachMax Gate, the house Hardy built and lived in for his last 43 years, writing Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Jude the Obscure and The Mayor of Casterbridge in its pine-shaded study (open March to October, £11, children £5.50). Casterbridge was Hardy’s name for Dorchester, where the author’s presence is inescapable. Heading back into town, there’s theTrumpet Majorpub and suburban roads with names such as Bathsheba Terrace and Farfrae Crescent. On Dorchester’s High East Street, Hardy fans could stay at theKing’s Arms, with its handsome Georgian bow windows, now stylishly revamped (doubles from £94.50, room-only). Hardy often dined here and I eat an excellent Sunday lunch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Near the end of the road, an elderly bronze Hardy sits among verdigrised ferns.Kim Taplin obituaryRead moreNext day, I head out to Stinsford to visit the church where Hardy’s heart is buried (the rest of him is in Westminster Abbey). Through the rushy water meadows where Tess meets Angel Clare, I reach atmosphericSt Michael’swith its Saxon saint and stained-glass Hardy memorial. There are words carved by the church door from Hardy’s poem A Darkling Thrush, which contrasts bleak winter twigs with the bird’s “full-hearted evensong / Of joy illimited”. A mossy waterside stroll from the church leads to the formal gardens ofKingston Maurward(free, open daily) and there’s time for tea in the Barn & Cafe before my bus to the station.I’ll be back next month, with my brother, to walk more Dorset footpaths, from my mum’s old bungalow in Bridport to the field near Beaminster, where she lies buried. There, among cowslips and flowering blackthorn, we can look out at the wide green view and listen to the birdsong. Kim led the way in loving paths and poetry. In the last photo I took of her, a month before she died, she is walking on the Dorset coast beside a misty sea with a long line of footsteps stretching out across the beach behind her.Some transport was provided byGWRThe English Path by Kim Taplin is published by Toller Books (£14).

And, while it wasn’t my biggest concern back in February 2020, a world that couldn’t come together over molten cheese still seemed a bleak prospect. Clearly I wasn’t alone, because Swiss public health experts were later forcedto issue reassurance– thankfully, the only risk here is overindulgence.Prep10 minCook15 minServes4320g emmental, or similar (see step 1)480ggruyère, or similar¼ reblochon(about 150g), or similar1 garlic clove, peeled and very finely chopped (see step 5)300ml high-acid white wine(see step 6)2 tsp kirsch(optional)Nutmeg, to grate to taste, or a pinch of cayenne pepperBaguette, or stale bread, cubed, to serveBoiled potatoes, to serve (optional)Cornichons and pickled onions, to serve (optional)Charcuterie, to serve (optional)Green salad, to serve (optional)1 A note on the cheese …In the course of testing this recipe, I went through a number of different cheeses, and while the combination above is my favourite – emmental for its melting properties, gruyère for its nutty flavour and reblochon, now sold in some supermarkets and all good cheesemongers, for its creaminess – feel free to vary it according to availability and budget.View image in fullscreen2 … and on the right mix of cheeseThe only tricky thing about fondue, apart from gluttony, is preventing it from splitting, which is more likely if you use only hard cheeses such as gruyere (or beaufort, comté or abondance) that have a low moisture content. To make life easier for yourself, I’d suggest including something younger such as emmental or edam in the mix, too.3 … and on the creamy cheeseI also like to add a creamy cheese – taleggio, raclette, port salut, brie or even, dare I say it, cheese triangles are all options, but you may prefer to ring the changes with blue cheese, goat’s cheese or even a flavoured cheese, or simply use only equal parts of gruyère and emmental if you prefer.View image in fullscreen4 Prepare the cheeseTrim off anddiscardthe rinds from the hard cheeses (they’re not poisonous, but they won’t add anything to the flavour of your fondue), then coarsely grate the cheeses. Please avoid those tempting bags of ready-grated cheese, though, because their starchy, anti-clump coating will give your fondue an unpleasantly floury consistency. Cut off and discard the skin of the reblochon and chop the rest into cubes.5 A note on the garlicTraditionally, a cut garlic clove is wiped around the insides of the fondue pot, but because I make mine in a pan and transfer it to a bowl, I prefer to add the garlic to the cheese mix (if you’re using a bespoke fondue pot, however, you may wish to revert to the old way). Put the minced garlic in a deep, heavy-based saucepan.View image in fullscreen6 Add the wineAdd the wine to the pot – traditional Swiss and Savoie whites aren’t that widely stocked in the UK, so if need be go for a high-acid and fairly fruity alternative, because, somewhat counterintuitively, the acids in the wine will help stabilise the emulsion of melted cheeses and help to prevent them separating. Picpoul de pinet, riesling or muscadet are all good bets.View image in fullscreen7 Now melt the cheeseSet the pan over a very low heat (ideally, with a heat diffuser underneath, if you have one) and bring the wine to a simmer. Gradually add the emmental or melting cheese a little at a time, whisking or stirring vigorously and leaving it to melt fully before adding more. Repeat with the gruyère, followed by the reblochon. Keep stirring until the mix is very smooth.View image in fullscreen8 Add the remaining flavouringsStir in the kirsch, if using (some recipes prefer herbal liqueurs such asgénépi), followed by a good grating of nutmeg, or a pinch of cayenne pepper, if you prefer. Transfer the cheese mix to a fondue set, a heatproof bowl set over tea lights or a slow cooker – anything that will keep the fondue warm and liquid for the time it takes you to eat it.View image in fullscreen9 And, finally, the accompanimentsAt their simplest, cheese fondues are served simply with cubes of baguette or slightly stale bread for dipping (a fork works well if you don’t have a fondue set), but I’d recommend also supplying small boiled potatoes (skin-on) and a selection of cornichons and pickled onions, some charcuterie and a green salad alongside. Plus the remaining wine, naturally.Explore more on these topicsCheeseFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodStarterMain courseFrench food and drinkWinefeaturesShareReuse this content"
