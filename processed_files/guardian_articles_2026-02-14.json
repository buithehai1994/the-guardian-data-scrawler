Now she’s as frank as everCharlotte HigginsSat 14 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThere is a long buildup before I get to seeTracey Emin– her two cats, Teacup and Pancake, preceding her like a pair of slinky sentries as she walks into the white-painted basement kitchen of her huge Georgian house in Margate. The lengthy overture is because – though I’ve been invited for noon – Emin is a magnificently late riser. Her average working day, her studio manager Harry tells me, runs from about 6pm to 3am. And so, while the artist is gradually sorting herself out, Harry takes me on a tour through her home town in the January drizzle, the sea a sulky grey blur beyond the sands.At last, Harry is ringing the doorbell, and Emin’s lovely housekeeper, Sam, is sitting me down in the kitchen, then finally here she is, dressed in loose dark trousers and top, with those faithful cats. Emin is recognisably the same as she’s ever been – the artist who scandalised and entranced the nation in the 1990s with her tent embroidered with the names of everyone she’d ever slept with; with her unmade bed and its rumpled sheets and detritus. She still has that sardonic lip, those arched brows, those flashing eyes. But these days she is surprisingly calm, slow moving, her greying hair swept back into a loose bun. This is the Emin who has worked hard, survived a great deal and, somewhat unpredictably, ended up a national treasure.She pours out cups of green tea – once, it would have been vodka and a fag, but there’s been no alcohol for nearly six years now, and she quit her 50-a-day habit a long while back. In the past few years, death almost claimed her and she clawed herself back to life again: in 2020, she was diagnosed with a vicioussquamous cell cancer, requiring dramatic surgery. “I had to have my bladder removed. I had a full hysterectomy. I had my lymph nodes removed, I had half my vagina removed, I had my urethra removed, part of my bowel removed,” she says, ticking off the losses. She is contained, quiet-spoken, and there are none of the flashes of anger she was once famous for, though she’s exacting as we talk, correcting me if she thinks I’m on the wrong track. Seven hours and more, the operation took. She also had a urostomy – surgery to create a stoma (hole in the abdomen) so urine can pass out into a collection bag. She often has hers beside her in a tote bag.View image in fullscreenEmin working in her studio in Margate, 2024.Photograph: Harry WellerLife without a bladder is “pretty heavy”, she tells me. Today, for example, when she got in the shower, she had a lot of bleeding from her stoma. Then there’s the whole business of the bag, which needs emptying into a loo maybe “every 15 to 20 minutes, or it might be OK for an hour. For a lot of people with urostomies, they don’t go to theatre, they don’t go to cinema,” she says. If you can’t get to a loo in time, it can overfill and burst, which isn’t great, especially if it happens in a public place. If she wants to do something as simple as take a nap at home, she says, even that’s tricky. “It wakes you up because of the pressure” and, worst case, “The bag will just fly off, and then all the urine will go everywhere. It’s 500ml of urine in a small bag, which doesn’t sound like much.” (It sounds like plenty, to me.)She has bowel problems on top of everything else. “You’ve got the blood, you’ve got the shit, you’ve got the pills – it really can get you down, because you can’t be free. Nothing can be improvised. Nothing can be spontaneous. When I go away, half my suitcase is full of medical supplies.” She’s not moaning, she keeps telling me: she knows she’s lucky. But it’s hard work. She got really upset, she says, about what to wear for her investiture as adamelast year. She had her bag strapped to her leg, which was OK, but uncomfortable. “I didn’t want to do my photos with the king holding a bag of urine,” she says.I reckon I was going to die, then they (she glances heavenwards) said, ‘I don’t think she’s all bad. Let’s give her a second go’Then there are the infections – urinary tract one day “that can go to a full-blown kidney infection the next. And then, if I’m really unlucky, a blood infection.” She had sepsis in September, she says: “And it took me about three months to get well again.” She’s on antibiotics much of the time for one thing and another. She worries about getting a cold or flu – there are no friendly hugs and kisses any more. “And I get so fatigued.” She is clearly extremely vulnerable, physically. But she gleefully shows me her lifeline: “It’s pretty strong, and goes right round into infinity,” she says, tracing it as it disappears round her wrist. “I reckon that I was going to die and then they, whoever they are” – she glances heavenwards – “they said, ‘I don’t think she’s all bad. Let’s give her another go, see what she can do.’”This is, then, her second life – andSecond Lifeis also the title of her forthcoming show at Tate Modern, her largest to date. Her brush with death changed everything – it was the spur to relocate permanently to Margate, to set up afoundation, to put in place things that could give back to her home town and carry on after her eventual death. There are still houses in London and Provence – but Margate is home now. Aside from her roomy painting studio, on his tour Harry shows me the high-rise where Emin has bought flats for artists to live in at low rent; theart schoolshe has created, where a second intake of students, nine of them, are working away; the artists’ studios she’s renting out at low cost; the building she’s going to convert into another 10; the former morgue that’s atraining kitchenfor long-term unemployed people; then there’s the derelict building along the coast that’s going to become a cafe and communitybathing club. Hers is a philanthropic property empire. Harry also shows me the hideaway Emin used to go to at weekends, before she moved into the big house in December. With a flourish, he opens a door from the bedroom and a sizeable toplit indoor swimming pool is revealed, like Narnia from the back of a wardrobe. Later, Emin worries about me mentioning it,because she thinks Guardian readers won’t approve – though speaking for myself, I was more dazzled than disapproving.View image in fullscreenMy Bed, 1998.Photograph: Tracey Emin. Photograph courtesy The Saatchi Gallery / Prudence Cuming Associates LtdThe Tate Modern exhibition is going to be huge, ranging right across her 40-year career. But she’s not calling it a retrospective – not least because the first work in the exhibition is the spikily titled My Major Retrospective 1963-93, made when she was 30 for her first solo show, at White Cube gallery. It consisted of photographs of the paintings she had made at art school and then destroyed – one of the turbulent chapters of her relationship with the medium. Among the more recent works will be a series of photographs she has taken of her own post-operative body – the blood, the stoma, the reality of life in a battleworn female body – shown opposite photos of her body she took as a young woman. There will be her installation My Bed – her soiled sheets, the environs littered with bottles, fags, condoms, all the self-revealing fragments of a chaotic life – which caused an uproar when it was shown as part of her Turner prize exhibition in 1999.Emin was a paradox – wildly successful, hugely famous, but also damned for her supposed self-absorption and narcissism. Looking back, some of this criticism looks plain sexist. A woman, especially a working-class woman, making art about her emotions and body was not seen as respectable, back then. Now, I think, the world has caught up with her. She tells me about what people made of one of her early films,Why I Never Became A Dancer(1995), which will be in the Tate exhibition. “At the time, people were saying, ‘Oh, it’s just Tracey prancing around.’ No! Listen to what I was saying,” she says vehemently, as if she’s slipped back 30 years and is confronting her critics. “See what the film’s about. Understand it.” The film tells a story of her adolescence – how she left school at 13, how she had a lot of sex with a lot of men in their 20s. And then, in 1978, at 15, she entered a disco championship. She was on the dancefloor, owning it, she was going to win – “And then they started: ‘SLAG, SLAG, SLAG.’” Most of the people taunting her were men she’d slept with. She ran out of the room in tears. But the film ends with her dancing – seizing joy from the men who tried to bring her down.When I see a 13-year-old girl now, I think, ‘Oh, my God, imagine someone having sex with that person. What the fuck is wrong with them?’“We’re talking about grooming, we’re talking about bullying,” she says now. “And, of course, you know, the ‘Slag, slag, slag’ didn’t just happen on the dancefloor. It happened in the high street. I was raped when I was 13. Then after that, about six months later, I started having sex with all these people – because I wanted to be in control. But, of course, I wasn’t. It was terrible. When I see a 13- or 14-year-old girl now, I think, ‘Oh my God, imagine someone who’s 20 or 25 having sex with that person. What the fuck is wrong with them?’” Her refusal of shame reminds me ofGisèle Pelicot’s stance: “Shame must change sides.” I ask Emin how she manages not to care what people think of her. “What makes you think I don’t? I do care, immensely,” she says.There are two rooms in the Tate Modern show devoted to works on abortion – Emin had two in the 1990s, the first almost killing her, after it turned out she had been pregnant with twins and one foetus was left inside her. It wouldn’t be easy to show such works in the US now, I suggest. Even though, for example, her filmHow It Feels(1996) doesn’t take a campaigning position, but simply does what the title implies. Emin tells me she has pulled a version of the Tate Modern show from the Guggenheim in New York, after the exhibition space available was, she says, reduced. “It was made impossible for me to do it because the space was getting smaller and smaller, and then it meant that my Tate show wouldn’t actually fit.” It would be a question of making the show smaller – but then, she says, “What work would they take out? The abortion work?” Was that what was discussed? “I don’t know,” she admits. “I just know I’m not doing a show there any more.” (The Guggenheim was approached for comment.) “If I have a show in New York,” she says, “it’s got to be exactly as I want it to be.”There’s an account in her book,Strangeland, published in 2005, of her rape when she was 13 – she was pushed into an alley by a man while walking home after a New Year’s Eve party. When she got home, her mum dusted her off and no more was said. It was kind of ordinary: the girls she knew used the phrases “broken in” or “broken into” when they’d been forced to have sex for the first time. When I express horror at how commonplace sexual violence seems to have been, how surely things have changed for the better, Emin laughs at my naivety. “It’s happening all the time. It’s happening around the corner … Right now, somewhere, not very far away, someone is either being beaten, locked in a cupboard, being raped, being abused, being coerced into something they don’t want to do.”Art is probably one of the last good things we’ve got left as human beingsAnd then, of course, there are the myriad ways in which being a young girl in the age of social media is even worse than it was in the 1970s. Her take on misogynist horrors such as Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok, which had been used todigitally “undress”and otherwise humiliate real women and girls, is, she says, “luddite”. “I keep telling young people: keep a diary, get a camera, learn to print your own photos. Don’t put it all in your phone, because everything in your phone belongs to someone else. And if you want to write a secret to someone, send a letter. There’s nothing wrong in slowing down and stepping everything back.” Taking your time, that’s what’s important, she says. It’s like looking at a painting. You have to do it slowly. “Art is to me, now, probably one of the last good things we’ve got left as human beings. And it was the same in the caves in Palaeolithic times.View image in fullscreen‘Making a beautiful painting isn’t about making power. It’s empowering yourself to feel something.’ Emin in her studio at the Royal College of Art, 1989.Photograph: David Dawson“There’s something about making something from ourselves which is beautiful and otherworldly as well. And we need all of those things right now to remind us that we can be good-spirited, that we don’t have to make corruption, we don’t have to make greed, we don’t have to make power,” she says. “Making a beautiful painting isn’t about making power. It’s empowering yourself to feel something, and then if you’ve done it correctly, other people look at it and feel something, too.”Emin had a turbulent childhood. Her Turkish-Cypriot father, Enver, had another family and was only around a few days a week. Then his hotel business collapsed and he abandoned Emin, her mum and twin brother Paul, plunging them into poverty. I wonder how, despite all that, she has such a positive relationship with Margate now. It was actually her mum’s death, in 2016, that was the first turning point, she says: it was then she decided she wanted to continue to have a connection with the place. And now, “even though my mum’s not here, I sort of feel she’d be really so happy to see what I’ve done. She was worried I’d gone up my own arse and become a bit of a twat, which I had at some points. I’m just trying to recalibrate what’s important in life.Artis the most important thing to me – and I know other things are more important to other people, but it’s art for me. So now I just live art, work art, do art, facilitate other people to do art … There’s a sense of peace. I’ve gone full circle in my life. I’ve come home. That is one of the nicest feelings in the world.”Margate has some of the highest rates of child poverty in the country. Emin tells me proudly about how art and culture are making a difference to the struggling local economy. There’s the huge success of the major gallery in the town,Turner Contemporary, and she’s involved in a pop-up arts festival that took place a few weekends ago, calledOff Season, which gets shops and restaurants buzzing in the dead of winter. But Kent county council is now run by Reform. In August, union flags went up overnight in the town, as they did around a lot of the country, part of a campaign linked to the far right. “I wanted to hire a cherrypicker and cut them down,” Emin says. “And then we realised that probably, if I tried to get a cherrypicker, it could be the same cherrypicker they hired to put them up.View image in fullscreenTracey Emin, Self-portrait 12-11-01 2001.Composite: © Tracey Emin.

Courtesy the Tracey Emin Archive“I like to reclaim things,” she adds. “Like duringCool Britannia[in the late 1990s], the flag was used as a positive thing for everyone.” When Emin had a bigshowin 2011 at the Hayward Gallery in London, there was a billboard poster for it showing her running down the street naked, trailing a union flag. “I got a phone call from what would have been Ukip at the time and they said, ‘We’ve noticed your poster holding the union flag – you’re a woman from our hearts, and we’d really like to meet up with you.’ And I said, ‘Yeah, obviously you didn’t notice how brown my arse is, did you?’ And I just put the phone down.” She adds, “My dad came here in 1948 from Cyprus, and he’s really dark skinned. My great-grandfather was from Nubia [modern Sudan]. My mother’s family were Gypsies. So as far as I’m concerned, I’m the most amazing British person you can have.”Ukip wanted to meet me and I said, ‘Yeah, obviously you didn’t notice how brown my arse is, did you?’She’s voted Labour all her life, she says – apart from twice forDavid Cameron’s Tories, in 2010 and 2015. (“Well it wasn’t that I was voting Tory,” she clarifies, “it was that I was voting for certain ministers that were supporting the arts” – though culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and arts minister Ed Vaizey failed to prevent huge cuts to the arts imposed by then chancellor George Osborne as part of his “austerity” measures.)The current political tone on immigration appals her – and she loathes Reform with a passion. “If the far right get in in this country, we are doomed. And everybody has to understand the significance of it. When friends say they’re not voting Labour because of what’s happened in the last two years, I say, ‘Then vote Tory, vote anything, vote Green, but don’t let Reform get in.’” She adds, “The immigration from asylum seekers in this country is minuscule, minor. Britain could take care of people wanting to come here, people could be processed and people could be working … Instead, we’ve got a country now that’s bordering on neo-Nazi rhetoric, which I find really abhorrent.”We speculate for a moment on what a potential Reform government might bring the arts. “Art institutions may not survive, but art will always survive. If you had Farage pushing down all the arts, saying things were degenerate, getting rid of it all, like Trump is doing now, you will have this bubble, bubble” – her voice rises like something out of Macbeth – “bubble of all the arts, that you will never be able to stop, ever. And they will rise up like the biggest fucking volcano these people have ever seen.”For Emin, the solution to poverty and lack of opportunity is always education – despite her own schooldays not being a success. She didn’t get on with academic work, and stopped going to school at 13. “My mum wasn’t around. She left home for quite a while. My nan would come sometimes. People would drift in and out.” She defends her mum fiercely. “It wasn’t my mum’s fault. Out of choice, she wouldn’t have left us – end of story.” At one point, Emin was caught stealing from Woolworths: “Really badly caught shoplifting. I got caught for nicking a pair of navy blue socks.” They were school socks, of course. “What the school should have done at that point was said, ‘Why is she stealing school uniform? What is going on?’ But people didn’t notice things like that, back then.”View image in fullscreenEmin teaching at her Margate studio.Photograph: Harry WellerWhen she was 15, she was effectively forced back to school by social services a couple of days a week, where she mostly sat in the art room, drawing. There, for the first time, she was encouraged, mentored – and she flourished. By sheer force of will, she got herself into art school despite not having O-levels or A-levels, battling people’s low expectations of her all the way. “It took me a long time to get to the Royal College of Art, but I did it. And now, you can’t go to art school unless you’re loaded.”I wonder if she has any regrets. As one childless woman to another, for example, does she regret not having kids? “I’m really, really, really happy about not having children,” she says. “You know how people are really happybecausethey have children? I’m really happy because Idon’t. And I’ve got lots of young people around me as well, which is really good, people who are creative. And I have really made my life as full as possible, behaving and doing things that someone with children couldn’t do.”Whatareher regrets then? “Number one: smoking. Number two” – she suddenly starts giggling – “taking it up the wrong hole.” Tracey, do you mean anal sex? We’re both cracking up now. “I mean that metaphorically as well … although I don’t even regret it because some of it was quite good.” She pulls herself together. “What I mean is a sensibility about understanding what I wanted and what my needs were. I should have taken much better care of myself, but I let myself get blown around, and that was silly.” Most of all, though, she says she regrets what she calls “the B-list years” – the mid-2000s for a goodish half-decade or so “when you look back and think, ‘God, was that the shallowest level of myself that I could ever be?’” Too much partying; not enough time devoted to the thing at the centre of her life: art.That was after she split up with her then partner, artist Mat Collishaw. Is she seeing anyone now, I wonder? “No, not really, no,” she says, slightly evasively. In her life she has dated men and women. “No, I’m not. I was having a relationship with someone for a while, but not a conventional relationship, and I had an affair for a long time with someone who I really was deeply in love with, and I still love. I’m still loving, I still love, and to love, really, is … is human. And I think to live without love is probably one of the saddest things for the self, for the heart, so I don’t want to live without love ever again. I’m quite happy now with unrequited love, as long as I can love – and I have my cats.”She’s absolutely certain, though, of one thing. “I don’t ever again in my life want someone saying, ‘What time you coming home? Where are we going on holiday? What we eating tonight? Did you eat the chocolate? No, it’s your turn.’ Never, ever – mind you, I never really had it, because it wasn’t like that with me … ” A certain self-containment, an ability to live her life as she wishes to live it, is what’s important now. “I like my sovereignty,” she says.Everything, now, is about the art. If the cancer, the touch of death, did one thing, it was to clarify utterly who she is and what she exists for. Painting is at the centre of her creative world these days. There are many canvases on the go in her studio, some she’s working on actively, some that might sit there for a few years until she turns to them again. She often paints over things she’s done – which are frequently, but not always, female figures a bit like herself, or couples or, at times, her mother – allowing one set of painted gestures to suggest the next, sometimes completely transforming the image along the way. Harry tells me that when they are in the studio together, “she talks about what she sees in the canvas, and then starts painting it in”.I ask her if she can describe what that feels like. “There’s the canvas, there’s me, and there’s this other space between us, and you have to go through it, that space, and you drag in everything behind you with you into it. It’s like going through a weird tunnel. And the painting is whatever you’ve dragged through the tunnel with you,” she says. “There are many ways to be a painter – art has many rooms. But for me it’s like an explosion of sorts. It’s like my heart being ripped open and then throwing it all on to the canvas.”She’s lit up when she says this. This is what she’s on this Earth for. It suddenly dawns on me: she’s happy – or at least happier than she has ever been. “Yes,” she says. “Even when I’m unhappy, I’m not as unhappy as I used to be. I do what I want to do. If I feel like painting, I’ll go and paint. If I don’t feel like painting, I’ll go and teach. If I don’t feel like teaching, I’ll go and take a walk on the beach. If I don’t want to walk on the beach, I cuddle my cats.” After the cancer, she says, “The big thing that I discovered was that I don’t want to die right now. You might think that’s obvious, but it’s not. I have spent a lot of my life being sad, being nihilistic and punishing myself mentally – and drinking and smoking. And then I realised: I could have my time back again.”Tracey Emin: A Second Life is at Tate Modern, 27 February-31 August. The Guardian is partnering with Tate to offer readers 2-for-1 tickets.

Or at least not in the snappy wording that has made it go viral.“The time of monsters” powerfully sums up the repulsion and disbelief many people feel about the news in 2026 – whether it’s emanating from the White House, the Epstein files or the battlefields of Ukraine. It evokes Goya’s famous etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as much as contemporary pop culture.“It has an apocalyptical feel, like when the Demogorgon appears at the end of Stranger Things,” said Peter Thomas, a historian of political thought and a Gramsci expert at Brunel University of London.View image in fullscreenJust some of the people who have used the monster line: composite of (clockwise left to right”: Bart de Wever, Zarah Sultana, Rutger Bregman and Slavoj Žižek.Composite: Getty and The GuardianBut in the notebooks that Gramsci filled with his thoughts on political theory, philosophy and linguistics after being imprisoned by the Italian fascist government in November 1926, there is no mention of monsters. In the original Italian, he wrote: “In questo interregno si verificano i fenomeni morbosi più svariati.”The most widely used translation of the Prison Notebooks, by the British academics Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith in 1971, renders this as: “In this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.” Not quite so pithy.An alternative 1996 edition by Joseph Buttigieg, the late father of the former US transport secretary Pete Buttigieg, talks of morbid “phenomena” instead of “symptoms”. Still, no mention of monsters.The first recorded English use of “time of monsters” in connection with Gramsci is in a 2010 article in the New Left Review by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek titled A Permanent Economic Emergency. In this context, the quote lends poetic gravitas to the challenge that the eurozone’s banking crisis posed to the left.However, when approached about why he had chosen to poetically refashion the original Italian, Žižek insisted the monsters were not his. “I DON’T REMEMBER anything about it, but I am sure that I took the word from somewhere else,” he told the Guardian in an email.In fact, a French version of the same phrase predates the moment it was popularised by Žižek in English. “Dans ce clair-obscur surgissent les monstres,”the French economist and urbanist Gustave Massiah wrote in a2003 essay– “in this twilight monsters arise”. The phrase “dans cet interrègne surgissent les monstres”was used in the pages of Le Mondeas early as 1996.View image in fullscreenThe quote evokes Goya’s famous etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as much as contemporary pop culture.Photograph: Fine Art/Corbis/Getty ImagesWhile the exact origin of Gramsci’s monsters remains elusive, there are wider reasons why the Italian intellectual’s ideas remain so potent today. Published in 1947, years after Gramsci’s death, the Prison Notebooks were written during concentrated periods in which the communist thinker was allowed pen and paper in his cell. “They distill a lot of things Gramsci had on his mind, so they are incredibly precise, at least for an Italian,”said Silvio Pons, the president of Rome’s Gramsci institute.The notebooks did not go truly global until after the cold war, with translations into more than 40 languages, but their central idea has proven electric for activists for much longer.“When Gramsci wrote the Prison Notebooks, he was trying to make sense of why there hadn’t been a socialist or communist revolution inItalybefore the fascist takeover,” said Marzia Maccaferri, a political historian at Queen Mary University in London. “And the key concept to emerge from that thought process is his theory of hegemony: that the ruling class can rule not only through coercion, but also through the intersection of popular and high culture, through intellectual and civil society.”In continentalEurope, this cultural turn inspired many of the student revolutionaries of 1968, while in Britain it provided a theoretical framework that Marxist sociologists such as Stuart Hall applied to Thatcherism in the 1980s.As early as the 1970s, however, Gramsci’s ideas were co-opted by the chief thinker of France’sNouvelleDroite,or “new right”, Alain de Benoist. The attempt to centre far-right politics on cultural rather than racial identities can be seen in the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s dictum that “all politics is downstream of culture”, and in many of the key figures of the contemporary European far right.The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s master’s thesis applied Gramci’s ideas to Poland’sSolidarność(Solidarity) movement; in Italy, Giorgia Meloni’s culture minister recently published a book calledGramsci è vivo(Gramsci is Alive).View image in fullscreenUS border patrol official Gregory Bovino walks with federal agents in January.Photograph: Madison Swart/ReutersThe “time of monsters” quote may have captured the minds of politicians and thinkers of today but many feel it strips Gramsci of the activist zeal that he embodied for previous generations.“Monsters are something exceptional, an inverted miracle that comes out of nowhere with no real explanation,” Thomas said. “It’s a metaphor that shuts off the possibility of trying to think through what is occurring. We get outraged or shocked at the monstrosity of these Trumpian figures, rather than trying to work out what produced it.”Before his imprisonment, Gramsci spent two formative years in revolutionary Russia, where he is said to have witnessed proof that a new world, in spite of its struggles, could eventually be reborn.“It was almost inconceivable for him that whatever temporary setbacks he would have to suffer, we wouldn’t eventually arrive at a victory,” Thomas said. “We probably find it a little bit harder to think like that.”Explore more on these topicsPhilosophyEuropeItalyCommunismThe far rightLanguagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am not going to stop looking until I find him’Stella Ralfini, 78-year-old beauty writer, London (pictured above)I’ve been single for 10 years, since my partner died. I started dating in my early 70s, and in the past year I’ve been on 10 dates. Initially, I thought it was sex I missed, or companionship, but it’s not that. I want someone to share romantic sunsets and picnics with again. And I want to die in love. I want to die remembering how that felt, because that’s when I felt most alive. I know the man for me exists, and I’m not going to stop looking until I find him.In my experience, few men are looking for a 78-year-old woman on dating sites and apps. I came off Match.com a few months ago because I look much younger than my age and was accused by two or three men of being AI-generated or using a fake picture.Men who are much younger than me – in their 50s – did show interest in me, but I’m not interested in them. It’s very important to me to date a man who is in his 70s or late 60s, who’s at the same point I am so we can live out our last years crazily in love.I’m now taking a new route, and going to face-to-face dating events and dinner dances. But the problem is, I don’t have a big family or grandchildren – just one daughter – and most of the men I meet in their 70s do, and want a similar kind of woman.The minds of many older men seem to have shrunk with age – they’re often not very interesting to talk toOne man I met – and felt was a brilliant match – told me after three dates that he would prefer a woman with grandchildren who would be more homey and less glamorous than me. I wear makeup and dress stylishly, in white, turquoise, red and pink, because I’ve realised I’m a person who loves to be admired. I know I sound shallow, but it’s got nothing to do with vanity. It’s got to do with me, recognising that these are my last years, and wanting to live authentically, every day.I’d like to meet a cheeky chappy with twinkling eyes, a sexy mouth and an open mind – a teddy boy with attitude, who probably smoked cannabis in the 1970s and was very involved in music. There’s this whole hippy-with-a-ponytail vibe that I like.But there are very few hot men in their 70s, and the minds of many older men seem to have shrunk with age – they’re often not very interesting to talk to. I have a very full life, with lots of hobbies, including swing dancing. But I want passion and I want romance. If I was offered £1m or the promise of falling in love, I’d choose love.‘Men in their 60s used Polaroidsfrom the 1970s as their profile pictures’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianPauline Tomlin, 61-year-old actor, LeedsIt’s a very barren landscape for me. A lot of men my age are not great at keeping themselves fit and healthy. I don’t know what happens – they seem to be all right in their 40s and 50s, and then they get to their 60s and you’re like: what the hell?When I do come across an attractive man my age, I often find they’re looking for a much younger woman. I see myself as a young 60, so I could probably date someone younger, but I’m not interested in being fetishised by a much younger man. I’m too mature for that energy.People keep saying: “Oh, you’re a very vibrant woman, you should go online and meet someone.” I did that briefly and discovered that many of the men in their 60s used old Polaroids of themselves from the 1970s as their profile pictures.When they contacted me, I constantly got the feeling they were keeping their options open. They didn’t take the time to read my profile and didn’t seem to want to engage in a meaningful conversation. It felt dodgy. I’m old-fashioned. I’d like to date someone I can have a laugh with, walk along the canal with and have coffee with. But these men appeared to be fishing and looking for sex.I also feel as though some men online saw me as a bit of a curiosity, being Afro-Caribbean. In the past, I occasionally tried dating websites for black people. Not all caucasian men understand the challenges and nuances of living as a black person in this world. You don’t always feel like sitting down at the dinner table and having to explain your experiences of structural racism and its covert impacts and microaggressions every night. It’s exhausting.I stopped online dating when a guy I was chatting with became abusiveIn my experience, the majority of the men who use black dating sites like to tell you how beautiful you are, with no real conversational depth. My response is: “Oh, get lost, this is not serious.”I stopped online dating when a guy I was chatting with became abusive. He said something weird, and I said, “That’s not very nice.” The next thing I knew, he was using expletives. It was quite unnerving.Face-to-face, men seem reluctant to even approach me. At a party recently, a man was looking at me all night but waited until I was getting into a taxi to ask for my number. He hadn’t said a word to me all evening. So I said no.I’ll be sad if my love life has to completely die in my 60s. It’s already been several years since I even had a hug. But unless someone of quality comes along, I’m not going to compromise. I won’t be with someone just so I can say, “I’ve got a man”, or because I feel a bit lonely or isolated sometimes. I’m getting on with my life, realising my ambitions and spending time with friends. Recently, I’ve written a play and joined a choir. I still want to rollerskate, learn tap dancing and become huge in my acting career so, if this is the rest of my life, I’m at peace with that.‘I had missed out on experiences other lesbians have in their youth’View image in fullscreenBonnie March (in blue sweater) with her partner Cheryl Ford (interviewed below).Photograph: Morgan Lieberman/The GuardianBonnie March, 84-year-old pensioner, Palm Springs, FloridaI got married in my 20s and had two children. Twenty years later, I entered into my first romantic relationship with another woman. It lasted eight years. Then I was single for maybe 30 years. Being alone didn’t bother me until Covid, when I was 79. In lockdown, I began to feel super lonely.So I joined Match.com and went on about 20 dates. I felt at sea, and kept asking myself: “What the heck is going on here?” The women I was matching with – who were all aged 75 to 85 – were so old in attitude. Their lives had been very narrowed by their own choices. They seemed to find all kinds of excuses to stay at home and stream Netflix.I met one date for lunch. When she gave me a big smile, I discovered she didn’t have any teethMany had pets they treated like their children. Some would refuse to do things because they had to go home and feed their animals. One woman had a parrot, which she introduced me to. She said she wanted me to hold it – I refused. Another had given up travelling because she vomited once after going on a trip. The worst date was with a woman who repeated herself ad nauseam about how connected and important she was in her early life. She was super cheap, too. On another date, I met a woman for lunch. When she gave me a big smile, I discovered she didn’t have any teeth.I decided to join the Conscious Girlfriend Academy, a queer and lesbian relationship coaching website for self-identifying women and non-binary people who love women. There are different levels of being out, and I had not come out in my local community. My coach helped me to think about how I could be brave enough to be who I am, how I could find the courage to say to anyone who had a problem with me: I don’t need you in my life.That freed something inside me. I realised I had missed out on some of the experiences other lesbians have in their youth. When one of the women I dated told me I didn’t act like I was in my 80s and suggested I lower the age range of the women I was looking for to 65 to 75, I decided to take her advice. The very first woman I met was Cheryl, who was 68.We met for lunch initially. There was a lot of laughter and a sense of ease. A few weeks later, we went to a blues festival together and stayed up until one or two o’clock in the morning just talking. We shared our life stories and realised we had a lot in common. She is a world traveller and an energetic, sports-oriented person, like I am. And we just clicked.‘It wasn’t my first choice to get together with an older woman, after losing my previous partner’Cheryl Ford, 71-year-old pensioner, Palm SpringsI knew within a couple of months that I wanted to marry Bonnie. It was so exciting. It felt like the first time I fell in love. All the same sort of butterflies, the same feeling of not being able to concentrate – we couldn’t stand to be apart. Unlike Bonnie, I came out of the closet when I was 19. I had a 25-year-marriage with an older woman, who died in 2017.I spent months dating women before I met Bonnie. Coincidentally, the craziest date was with a woman who talked constantly about her parrot.Sexdidn’t seem to be high on the list of things the women I met were interested in, and sex was important to me. A lot of them had come out later in life and were mothers. I had never been with a woman who had kids, and that was a challenge.One woman told me she couldn’t wait to have grandchildren and was planning to install a pool in her house for them. I was nonplussed. I wanted to meet someone who was relatively unencumbered and looking for an adventure. One of my key tests was: can we vacation together? Because I love to travel.It wasn’t my first choice to get together with an older woman like Bonnie, after losing my previous partner. But at the same time, it didn’t scare me to think Bonnie might die first. I knew I had been through such a loss already, and that I could get through it again.About a year after we met, we went to Paris. When we got to the top of the Eiffel Tower, I proposedAn advantage of dating when you are retired is you can take lots of vacations. Bonnie hadn’t travelled much until she met me, but there are now so many beautiful places all over the world that we have been to and shared together, and still more we are planning to visit. Sexually, our desire for each other aligned as well.About a year after we met, we went to Paris, because Bonnie told me she had always wanted to go there and walk around in a red beret, carrying a baguette, with her lover on her arm. When we got to the top of the Eiffel Tower, I proposed.We had a full-on wedding with 100 guests – we both dressed in white and walked down the aisle to Elvis Presley singing Can’t Help Falling in Love. Many of our guests had tears in their eyes. Lots of our friends had lived through the years when gay marriage wasn’t legal. When we walked into the reception room after the ceremony, everyone stood up and applauded for five minutes. We felt this overwhelming amount of support, and when Bonnie cried, I cried, too. They were tears of joy.‘I prefer younger men – older ones are more likely to hog the conversation’View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Evelyn Freja/The GuardianD’yan Forest, 91-year-old comedian, New YorkI’ve dated 40 or 50 men over the past 30 years – so many, I’ve lost count. I do online dating and I’m what people now call bisexual. What’s important to me is to meet someone who is bright, has a sense of humour and loves to travel. It doesn’t bother me what sex that person is. What matters is we have fun together.Dating has gotten harder as I’ve gotten older. When I was young, it was easy to meet people. I got married – and divorced – in my 20s. I went on to have two other serious relationships, including one that lasted 25 years, and started dating again in my 60s.I don’t like being in my apartment at night, alone. So I’ll find an interesting person online and invite them out for a coffee – and nine out of 10 times, I’ll never hear from them again. I think these people don’t want to meet anybody. They just like surfing around on the internet. They get a kick out of it.The few people I did meet were nebbishes – that’s Yiddish for losers and jerks. Some of them were my age and some were younger, one or two even as young as 28 or 30. I’d meet them in a bar, we’d have a good time, and then I’d never see them again.Other women my age tell me they don’t have sex any more, even with their husbands. I guess I’m differentI prefer younger men, because I find the older men are, the more likely they are to hog the whole conversation. Especially men who are 65 or older, they just talk about themselves. They don’t even realise they haven’t asked you one question, and that’s when my eyes glaze over. With women, there’s more back-and-forth talking.One match came through on Bumble recently, with a man who said he was 87. When I met him for a hamburger, he admitted he was 92. He talked about how he was rich and famous. Then he said he wasn’t like regular older guys. “I don’t just hold it for two minutes. I can hold it for two hours because I have balloons.” I realised he was talking about inflating his penis. He said his previous girlfriend had loved it – until she died. I wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could. Another guy kept planning dates with me and then saying he was busy. We were in touch for three months. Then he ghosted me.I have spoken about my dating experiences on stage at comedy clubs, and there are young guys who want to date me after seeing me perform. But they just want an hour of sex, they don’t want a relationship. I discovered this a couple of years ago, when I agreed to have sex with one. He was in his 40s. I thought it would lead to something. Then I realised: it’s not serious.Other women my age tell me they don’t have sex any more, even with their husbands. I guess I’m different. For me, sex is part of life, although I haven’t had it for a while now. I’m still looking for sex, but not with just anybody. I want to at least have some kind of relationship.I have no children and most of my family are dead. I travel a lot and I keep hoping I might meet someone in Paris or London or on an plane. I’m not looking to get married or even fall in love. I just want to find a companion who likes me and wants to have fun. It’s a lonely world. But you’ve got to have hope.Explore more on these topicsDatingRelationshipsOlder peopleSexWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His quiche is rich and creamy, with beautifully crumbly pastry, and my benchmark for these store-bought versions.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I tasted all of the quiches cooked according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Overall, the quality was lower than I’d hoped for, with many relying on ultra-processed ingredients, such as palm oil, emulsifiers and, often, caged-hen eggs. Free-range products didn’t always communicate this clearly on the packet, so it’s worth checking the ingredients list. Also, some described their pastry as “buttery” when they don’t contain any butter, and are instead made with vegetable shortening (palm and rapeseed oil). Encouragingly, however, a few gems emerged, with wonderfully simple ingredients, light and fluffy free-range custards, crisp all-butter pastry and generously filled.While the best are less processed, high welfare and rich in flavour, none of the quiches quite mastered the pastry in the same way as Meller. Although the outer layer crisped up in every case, the base was often undercooked and slightly stodgy in the middle.The best supermarket quichesBest overall:M&S portobello mushroom & mascarpone quicheView image in fullscreen£4.25 for 230g at Ocado (£1.85/100g)★★★★☆A small quiche, suitable for one or two, with a golden-brown top and a generous scattering of thick-cut sauteed mushrooms.

This year the number of people entering the UK could fall to such an extent that it drops below the number moving in the opposite direction, sending the figure for net migration below zerofor the first time since 1993.Migration chartWhile the trend may ease pressure on Keir Starmer from Reform UK, for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the trend presents a significant headache, hurting both the businesses that rely on immigrants and a loss of expected tax receipts for the Treasury.Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a thinktank, likened the effect to Brexit, saying that if net migration fell to zero, it wouldknock 3.7% off the UK’s annual national incomeby 2040. According to the Treasury’s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, Brexit has set the economy back by 4%.The political incentiveRob Ford, the professor of political science at Manchester University, says zero net migration would provide Starmer with the opportunity to steer the domestic political agenda away from the core topic of interest for Reform UK supporters. Reform leader Nigel Farage backed billionaire industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, who said immigrants were “colonising” the UK. Ratcliffe laterapologised, after public pressure from Starmer.While most Britons’ attitudes to migration vary little over time, Ford believes it will tumble down the list of voters’ biggest concerns next year, as the downward trend feeds through into data and, eventually, public attitudes.“It means that significant numbers of voters could peel away from the parties that make immigration a key element of their platform,” he says.Thedata released this weekshowed that the fall in skilled worker applications which began last July continued in January. The figures will soon be followed by more detailed data giving a breakdown of visa applications, and how many were granted, from October to December 2025.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Rachel Reeves will hope that net zero migration will steer domestic politics agenda away from Reform UK’s main agenda.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersThe expected downward trend will not reflect the government’s success or failure at stoppingsmall boats crossing the Channel. Instead, the fall will largely follow a collapse in the number of immigrants entering the UK relative to the increasing number who are being denied a visa extension and must leave, many of them students.The route to zero net migrationBy the end of this year, the annual number of non-EU migrants entering the UK on visas could drop below 550,000 after reaching more than 1.1m in 2023, according to a report by a Warwick University data analyst, James Bowes. It argues this is the effect of a clampdown under the previous Conservative administration, and tighter rules brought in by Labour last year.If the flow out of the country by non-EU nationals also accelerates, as expected, the emigration numbers could hit 430,000 by the end of the year, up from 88,000 in 2021.With about 900,000 fewer immigrants this year than in 2023, it is possible that net migration of 860,000 in 2023 and 431,000 in 2024 could fall to 184,000 in 2025 and -60,000 this year.The extent of the turnaround in migration since 2023 is a matter of contention, largely because poor government data allows analysts to fill the gaps in information with their own estimates, but the broader trend is not in dispute.Arrivals by type chartIn March 2024, care workers were banned from bringing spouses and children with them to the UK, while in April of the same year the salary threshold increased for work visas and family visas from £20,480 to £33,400, with an opt-out for some categories of worker set at £25,000.Most foreign postgraduate students were also told to leave their families behind. The minimum salary for a skilled worker visa increased from £26,200 to £38,700,Madeleine Sumption, the head of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, says: “It’s difficult to know exactly where we go next, mainly because we have a high number of people with temporary status and many of them might stay, or not.”View image in fullscreenIn March 2024, care workers were banned from bringing spouses and children with them to the UK.Photograph: MBI/AlamyBefore 2024, foreign students could finish their course and get a job with a salary that satisfied relatively low government thresholds to convert their student visa into a work visa.Many would pay the price of a one-year master’s degree – whichcan be more than £30,000– to get a student visa and within 18 months would be working in a care home.A doubling of the salary thresholds makes it difficult to continue this route into work, says Bowes.Refugees immigration chartLast July, the qualification threshold for getting a skilled worker visa or health and care visa also increased. Starmer went further by stopping overseas recruitment of social care workers, shortening the list of jobs eligible for the visas and increasing application fees.Sumption says the sponsors used by government to verify work visa applications have also faced a stricter regime.“There is an ongoing crackdown on dodgy sponsors who declare they have firms on their books with jobs for people when they don’t exist. This is another measure restricting the number of successful visa applications,” she says.The Observatory estimates that net migration will fall temporarily to a little over 250,000 this year before rising to 340,000 by the end of the decade.“The thing that gets lost in the debate is that the current situation is temporary and the fall that is undoubtedly taking place at the moment will be reversed later in the decade,” says Sumption.The economic impactJonathan Portes, an economics professor at King’s College London, says the impact could be limited by theweak state of the economy.“We had large labour shortages during the pandemic but that is clearly not the case now,” he says.Alan Manning, a professor at the London School ofEconomics, says the “fiscal impact” may be limited, especially in the longer term, if most of those leaving are in lower-paid jobs and their dependents.Nevertheless, Portes says the draconian restrictions on migration are “an act of self-harm”.Survey data and figures from HMRC documenting the pay that recent immigrants receive show they earn above average wages and generally have high skill levels in their field.Manning says: “If we further restricted work visas – which would have to be done to get to net zero longer term – then that would be reducing the number of high earners and there would be a hit to the public finances from that.”Jane Gratton, the deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, says recruiting from overseas was usually conducted as a last resort.“The recent fall in net migration has had a particular impact on sectors such as hospitality and healthcare,” she adds.View image in fullscreenThe hospitality sector has been hit by the fall in net migration.Photograph: JohnnyGreig/Getty Images/iStockphotoShe says BCC surveys show just 13% of member firms access the immigration system.“However, it’s vital that the immigration system works for those employers who need it to fill urgent vacancies. Currently, firms tell us it is too expensive, restrictive and difficult.”The OBR said last year it expected net migration of 262,000 in the year to mid-2026. That compares with the 47,000 Bowes believes is more realistic.The 200,000 difference will translate into a shortfall of between £6bn and £8bn in the public finances, says Portes.“The UK has benefited hugely from decades when it was an open economy that absorbed people arriving to do jobs and fill gaps in the labour market. What the Conservative and Labour party policies have done is reverse that, which is nothing short of self-harm,” Portes says.Germany embraces migrantsJean-Christophe Dumont, the head of the international migration division at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), says: “The UK Treasury has benefited from migrants, even when their use of all public goods and services are taken into account.”OECD analysis shows immigrants working in the private sector have “proved positive for wages” though there are wide variations from one industry to another.Dumont contrasts the UK with Germany.The UK is moving towards what Portes describes as a “guest-worker approach” where immigrant workers have little chance of becoming permanent residents. Starmer has opened talks aboutincreasing the number of EU citizens admitted to the UK under the youth mobility scheme, but this will only marginally affect the migration figures.View image in fullscreenGermany is aware that it needs young people to from outside the country to supplement its ageing population.Photograph: Christian Mang/ReutersDumont says Germany is moving firmly in the opposite direction, aware that it needs young people from outside the country to supplement its ageing population. AfD voters disagree, but the mainstream parties are fairly united in arguing that Germany’s survival depends on it, he says.For instance Germany, like Spain, Austria and Switzerland, have opened apprenticeships to foreign-born labour in addition to the steady stream of German school leavers. The UK has an effective ban.“People too often focus on the cost, but migrants contribute more on average than they cost,” he says.If forecasts for zero net migration come to pass, it will prove to be a boon for Starmer and a problem for Reeves, who will count the cost in hard cash.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEconomicsPublic financeTax and spendingEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)featuresShareReuse this content"

Samples from his body were secured before his burial and sent to the laboratories of two countries.The UK, describing the poisoning as barbaric, said it would be reporting Russia to theOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as a flagrant violation by Russia of the chemical weapons convention (CWC).The intelligence agencies claimed laboratory testing found that the deadly toxin in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs (epibatidine) was found in samples from Navalny’s body and probably resulted in his death.The statement adds: “Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.”“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia. There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body.”Although it had been widely assumed that Navalny had been poisoned by the Russian state, the evidence of the specific poison in his body is a new development. His wife, Yulia Navalny, posted in September that there was evidence of poison in his body at the time an autopsy was conducted.1:40'Putin must bear responsibility': Navalny's wife reacts to news of her husband's death – videoYulia wrote in a post on X that the named poison “causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death. I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with [a] chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth.Vladimir Putinis a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”The Kremlin has a long history of using poison as a weapon against its enemies. The death of Alexander Litvinenko in London fromradioactive polonium in 2006, the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, and a previous poisoning attempt on Navalny have cemented Russia’s reputation for resorting to toxins to silence critics and defectors.The Foreign Office, which oversees the intelligence agencies, said it has pursued the truth of Navalny’s death with partners from Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Germany. The UK added: “We know the Russian state now used this lethal toxin to target Navalny in fear of his opposition.”The release of the information during the Munich Security Conference was designed to remind everyone that Russia announced the news of Navalny’s death just as the conference convened two years ago.His wife, after some hesitation, made a short address to the conference in 2024 saying: “I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country. With my family and with my husband, they will be brought to justice. And this day will come soon.”The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia.“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice.“Russia saw Navalny as a threat. By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”The UK has led the way in trying to expose what it regards as nefarious Russian suppression of the regime’s opponents using poison, including the attempted killing of the UK agentSergei Skripalwith novichok on the streets of Salisbury in 2018. The UK has also led claims about Russian troops’ frequent use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.In it statement the UK said it was clear Russia did not destroy all its chemical weapons as claimed in 2017, and that it has not renounced biological weapons, as it is obliged to under the biological and toxin weapons convention.Explore more on these topicsAlexei NavalnyRussiaEuropePoisonVladimir PutinNovichok poisoningsAlexander LitvinenkonewsShareReuse this content"

When the Labour party sidelines its members, it weakens Labour’s roots in our communities, alienates voters and undermines Labour’s ability to win both people’s trust and elections.”The signatories pointed to the candidate selection for the upcoming Gorton and Denton byelection, which Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham was blocked from standing in.“Denying local members in Gorton and Denton the right to choose their candidate looks like part of a pattern, alongside the widespread barring of hard-working councillors and the withdrawal of the whip from MPs standing up for their constituents,” the letter said.Labour MP for Leeds East, Richard Burgon, who helped to coordinate the statement, said: “Under Keir Starmer and Morgan McSweeney, there has been a clampdown on the democratic rights of Labour members.“This has led to a small clique making out-of-touch decisions that have left the prime minister and the government deeply unpopular – from the mess over winter fuel payments to the appalling decision to make Peter Mandelson the US ambassador.“We need an urgent end to this nasty factionalism coming from the top of the party where the views of Labour members and trade unionists are treated with contempt.“Restoring democracy in the Labour party is essential if we are to reconnect with voters and prevent the election of a Trump-style Reform government.”The general secretaries of Unison, Unite, the CWU, the FBU and Aslef, all Labour-affiliated unions, had signed the letter, as had the groups Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, Momentum, the Labour Muslim Network, and Labour Assembly Against Austerity.Labour members and trade unionists will be able to add their names to the letter from 15 February.This date has been chosen as it is the 120th anniversary of the formal adoption of the name “The Labour Party” in 1906, according to the letter’s coordinators.A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party is proud to be powered by our brilliant party members as we work to bring about the vital change we were elected to deliver.“Our Labour government is delivering for families across the country, including tackling the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and restoring pride in local communities.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

But then again, its co-author George Cottrell claims to know what he’s talking about.Aclose aide to Nigel Farage, Cottrell served several months in a US prison after being convicted there in 2017 for wire fraud – a chapter in his life he referred to at his book launch party on Thursday night.Farage was among the guests at the luxury hotel Raffles on Whitehall, along with many senior members ofReform UK, but for once the party’s leader was content to let the spotlight fall on Cottrell and his co-author Lawrence Burke Files.One attender said: “George did clarify: ‘There’s nothing in this book that will assist money launderers or criminals. And he had a funny joke along the line that he did extensive research for the book, though unfortunately a lot of it is held by the FBI.”Published by Biteback, owned by Lord Ashcroft, the book is subtitled: A Guide for Law Enforcement, Prosecutors and Policymakers. Its promotional text reads: “The criminals already know how to launder money; this is, in part, their inside story.”Those attending the event included the Reform MP Richard Tice, the party’s treasurer, Nick Candy, and itsLondonmayoral candidate, Laila Cunningham.View image in fullscreenThe GB News presenter and former Brexit party MEP Martin Daubney arrives at Raffles hotel for the book launch. Nigel Farage was among the guests.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianThey were joined by a number of Reform staffers, the GB News presenter and former Brexit party MEP Martin Daubney and James Orr, the Cambridge University philosophy professor and senior adviser to Farage.“How to Launder Money offers a peek behind the wizard’s curtain to see the bent levers of finance and how they are pulled,” Cottrell and Burke Files write in an introduction, which describes anti-money laundering laws as “a convoluted failure” burdening legitimate businesses.It cites the experience of Burke Files who’s working in finance for more than 40 years, most of it as an investigator and expert in due diligence. He is a former director of corporate finance for the investment bank American National.As for Cottrell, the introduction says he was “exposed to the world of finance from a young age”, starting a career as a financier in London upon leaving school before he “caught the political bug” and in 2014 began a long engagement with British and international politics.“In 2016, George was arrested by IRS [the US Internal Revenue Service] officers at the Republican national convention, where he had flown with a group of leading British Brexiteers,” it adds. He was in the company of others, including Farage, then the leader of Ukip, when he was arrested while disembarking from a plane at Chicago’s O’Hare airport.“The arrest related to charges dating back to his years in finance and allegations of a money laundering conspiracy,” it reads, noting that he served eight months in prison before his release with all but a single charge dropped. The Guardianhas previously reportedthat prosecutors advised the judge in the case to offer Cottrell a light prison sentence because he had been willing to “provide federal agents additional information after his arrest” as part of a plea deal.The book’s introduction adds: “More recently, George has worked as an international political consultant, developed his art collection and applied himself to philanthropy, while running his political consultancy Geostrategy.com.”‘Handmaid’s Tale future’: Reform’s Matt Goodwin sparks outcry with fertility commentsRead more“Are we cheerleaders for crime? No. Quite the opposite,” it later states. The authors address law enforcement officers, who they “tip our hats to with our hands over our hearts”.Farage himself is mentioned on one page, which refers to him in the context of a discussion about the consequences for politically exposed persons (PEPs) from banks’ “de-risking”, which involves financial institutions ending or limiting ties with other banks and clients or regions considered high risk for money laundering.Describing Farage as “a central figure in the Brexit process”, it relates how he had his account closed by Coutts, adding that it was later revealed that his political views and status as a PEP influenced the decision.De-banking has gone from being a result of money-laundering risks to a result of social belief systems, write Cottrell and Burke Files.“Not even Orwell could have imagined this; the slope gets slipperier by the day,” they add.Burke Files told the Guardian that the book was about having a conversation about money laundering, and sharing what the criminals already know about laundering money with law enforcement and the public.“It’s also a call to review the failures and perverse impacts they have had on people, finance and international development. We hope it will be a catalyst to start the discussions to make a difference,” he said.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Some EU officials have put the date as early as 2027.Speaking to the annual Munich security summit, Ukraine’s president said he hoped “the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all of us but, honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things”.“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, notRussia,” he added.The issue of Europe’s frustration with a perceived US reluctance to spell out the security guarantees it is prepared to offer Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, and the need for the guarantees to be spelled out before an agreement is signed, likely remains the biggest wound in the badly fractured relationship between the US andEurope.In a speech that was welcomed by European leaders keen to see any sign of a thaw in the relationship, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, put forward an offer to work in partnership with Europe.However, this proposition, he stressed, was highly conditional and the US would go it alone if Washington’s highly Trumpian conditions were not met on climate, migration and tariffs.Using a diplomatic tone that the US vice-president, JD Vance, shunned in his speech at the conference a year ago, Rubio said “Europe and the US belong together”.He added that the US was ready to undertake the task of rebuilding the world order alone if necessary, but “we prefer it – and hope – to do it together with you, our friends in Europe”.He made almost no reference to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, besides claiming that the US had pressed India to stop importing Russian oil, a claim Russia disputes.At a press conference in Munich, Zelenskyy said the US had told him that if Ukraine withdrew from the Donbas, peace would come as quickly as possible, but he insisted this concession was not possible since Ukrainians live there.He disclosed that the US had so far offered a 15-year security guarantee, but Ukraine wanted a minimum 20-year, legally water-tight agreement, setting out the specific help the US would provide to a planned European reassurance force due to be put inside Ukraine in the event of a peace deal.How a Soviet-era heating system exposes Ukraine to Russian attack – a visual guideRead moreDetails of a so-called prosperity plan whereby the US would have access to Ukrainian mineral resources had not yet been exchanged, Zelenskyy said.He also queried why the head of the Russian negotiation delegation had been changed, saying he feared it meant the Russians were playing for time, rather than shifting strategy.Zelenskyy also complained about Europe having been practically absent from the table. “That’s a big mistake, in my opinion,” he said, a view that was shared by the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.On Friday, Donald Trump called on Zelenskyy to “get moving” to reach an agreement with Russia.Zelenskyy insisted that the elections that the US has pressed Ukraine to hold by 15 May can only take place two months after a ceasefire is declared, to ensure voters have adequate security.Trump has been trying to put pressure on Zelenskyy to agree a deal within months, but has not spelled out the consequences if Ukraine is not sufficiently flexible for the US.Zelenskyy also said the Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy plants would be raised in the talks in Geneva, adding that not a single energy plant inside Ukraine had now been left unscathed.European leaders appear gloomy that a diplomatic breakthrough will be secured, with the consensus being that Vladimir Putin is not yet economically or militarily exhausted.Zelenskyy said his ambition was to lift the number of Russians killed or seriously injured to 50,000 a month.One European leader predicted at least another two years of war, and insisted Europe had the resources to sustain Ukraine for that long.Zelenskyy also mounted a fierce attack on the Iranian regime for providing the Shahed drones that had caused so much damage inside Ukraine.With as many as 200,000 protesters attending a demonstration in Munich calling for the Iranian regime to be toppled, Zelenskyy said: “We have never had a conflict of interests with the Iranian regime.“But the Iranian Shahed drones they sold to Russia are killing our people and destroying our infrastructure.”He argued that if Iran is given time, it will cause more destruction. “Regimes like the one in Iran must not be given time. When they have time, they only kill more.“They must be stopped immediately, and this is exactly what should have happened with the Ayatollah after all the wars his regime unleashed and all the lives it took.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

For every one infected person, measles can spread to up to 18 unvaccinated people.Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health who is writing to every parent in the area, said the outbreak posed a serious threat to the wider capital and there was the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” because residents travel across the city.The return of measles: how a once-vanquished disease is spreading againRead moreShe told the Sunday Times London has “one of the lowest, if not the lowest, vaccination uptake rates” in the country.Sher-Arami said: “It is possible for it to grow. We know that measles has got some very nasty complications. It can cause deafness. It can cause brain damage and one in five children can need hospital treatment.”Temporary vaccination clinics are being held in schools and throughout Enfield, an area in which more than a fifth of children are not inoculated against measles, mumps or rubella by the age of five.A government campaign promoting childhood vaccination is expected to be launched next week with adverts on social media, YouTube and radio to counter vaccine scepticism. Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms followed by a rash a few days later, according to the NHS. Some people may also get small spots in their mouths.Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the UK isno longer considered to have eliminated measles, as transmission was re-established in 2024.It comes after a plateau in vaccination coverage and a surge in cases, with 3,681 cases recorded in the UK in 2024.From 2021 to 2023, the UK was considered to have “eliminated” the disease.WHO recommends at least 95% of children should receive vaccine doses for each illness to achieve herd immunity.According to UKHealthSecurity Agency figures 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine in 2024-25, unchanged from 2023-24 and the lowest level since 2010-11.The data also showed 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, the lowest level since 2009-10.Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthHealthChildrenLondonMMRVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

But when it comes to making money, people under 30 are proving they are something else entirely: successful.A record 1,000 taxpayers under 30 earned more than £1m last year, an 11% increase on the year before,HMRCrecords show.In total, these earners took home more than £3bn in the past year, making an average of £3m each.Lubbock Fine, the accountancy firm which obtained the figures from HMRC, suggested that the surge could partly be driven by influencers’ income from marketing spend on social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.The record increase may also be down to bigger pay deals for sports, music and media stars, as well as higher salaries in technology and financial services, the accountancy firm suggested.Under 30s now account for roughly 3% of all £1m+ earners and are thought to include Erling Haaland, the 25-year-old Manchester City striker who is estimated to earn £525,000 a week (about £27.3m a year) and 26-year-old Molly-Mae Hague, a former Love Island contestant and influencer who is reported to command up to £60,000 per post.View image in fullscreenErling Haaland, the 25-year-old Manchester City striker who is estimated to earn £525,000 a week, is thought to be one of the under 30s.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesOverall, there are now 31,000 taxpayers who earn £1m a year or more, which is only a 1% rise on the year before.This indicates the number of very high earners under 30 is increasing at a much faster pace than the number of high earners in older age groups.But earning so much when you are young does not necessarily mean you will be wealthy for life, warned Russell Rich, head of sports and entertainment for Lubbock Fine. “Footballers, boxers, and sports people generally tend to live beyond their means when they retire,” he told the Times. “People in the arts also do not tend to be good at saving and investing the money they make.”The number of people under 30 who earn over £1m has risen by 54% since the pandemic, when just 650 young taxpayers were recorded by HMRC in this income bracket.Over roughly the same period, the amount spent on influencer marketing in the UK tripled to £917m, according to Lubbock Fine, and is predicted to exceed £1bn this year.But it is not just young people who are cashing in – older generations are now waking up to their earning potential as influencers. Research from media analysts Ampere recently found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth inYouTubetraffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. TikTok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division,told the Guardianin December.High profile older influencers includeCaroline Idiens, a 53-year-old personal trainer from Berkshire who has 2.4m followers on Instagram, and Valerie Mackay, 62, who posts about her life as an older woman as@embracingfifty.However, their reach still pales in comparison to the likes ofAbby Roberts, a 24-year-old makeup influencer and music artist who has 15 million followers on TikTok and reportedly earns £14,000 per post.Explore more on these topicsMoneySocial mediaHMRCAccountancyDigital mediaThe super-richnewsShareReuse this content"

These demonstrations have grown in scope following thekillings of Renee Good and Alex Prettiat the hands of federal agents.But this week, Tom Homan, the US border czar, said that the Trump administration would bedrawing downits immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the killings after initial escalations by immigration agencies. Many have credited the decision to draw back as proof that the protests were successful in sending a message.“Right now, we’re being tested, and the good news is, what we saw in Minneapolis and St Paul, and what we’re seeing in places across the country, including here in Los Angeles, has been the American people saying no,” Obama said. “At least a good number of the American people saying, we’re going to live up to those values that we say we believe in.”“As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this,” he added.Obama, along with the former first lady,Michelle Obama, called the killing of Alex Pretti “aheartbreaking tragedy” and “a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault”.In astatementreleased last month, the Obamas said federal law enforcement and immigration agents were not operating in a lawful or accountable way in Minnesota. They said the tactics employed by ICE and other federal agents seemed “designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city”.Explore more on these topicsBarack ObamaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Protest (US)Minnesota ICE shootingsMinneapolisMinnesotaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Several plan to relaunch as independent social groups.The WI is one of the UK’s largest voluntary organisations, with thousands of local branches and about 180,000 members nationwide.Emma Hawley, chair of Social Lites WI in Urmston, Greater Manchester – a group with nearly 140 members that has run for 13 years – said her entire committee has decided to step down.“None of the other members want to take our places – many immediately said they weren’t even going to renew their membership,” she said.“We’re all heartbroken. I’ve put 13 years into running this amazing group but I can’t, ethically or morally, be a member of something that excludes transgender women,” she said.Seven Hills WI in Sheffield will also close after the current board decided to step down and no other members came forward.Clementine Dexter, vice-president of Seven Hills WI, said the group received about 220 abusive online comments after posting that they were closing. “Out of 250 comments, there were just 30 that were supportive,” she said. “The rest were really abusive and awful.“The NFWI’s decision has emboldened certain members to speak their minds and I think the federation has a serious issue as a result,” she said. “It’s going to struggle even more than it already does to attract younger members, and the more conservative members are going to be more emboldened to stick to what feels like a toxic culture.”Dexter said she had met Melissa Green, NFWI chief executive. “We asked how this would be policed and were told that gender at birth would be included in the list of questions determining eligibility for membership,” she said. “Members have to reapply every year and that just feels really nasty. I can’t be a member of an organisation that does that.”Even branches continuing under the new WI rules said they are facing practical fallout. Some have lost venues; others report speakers cancelling bookings.Sophie Hossack, president of Ladies of the Lock WI in Kentish Town, London, said the venue they have used for nearly a decade has refused future bookings because of the policy.“They said they did not feel comfortable renting their room to us because they are a trans-inclusive space,” she said.Nora Salmon’s Hackney Wicked Women group – Hackney Wick’s WI – will also close next month. She said the NFWI’s decision had created “a carnage of concern and upset” and that groups had received little support.“We were blindsided by their decision,” she said. “The lack of guidance and consultation has left us feeling betrayed. When we contacted them to say we’d lost members and were closing, the only response we got was, ‘We’re sorry to hear that’.”The NFWI’s decision followed a2025 UK supreme court judgmentwhich held that the legal definition of a woman under the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex.After reviewing the ruling, the NFWI announced it could no longer lawfully offer transgender women formal membership if it wished to continue operating as a women’s charity.In its statement, the organisation said it was acting with “utmost regret and sadness”, adding it would create alternative “sisterhood groups” open to all. Approached for this article, the NFWI declined further comment.Salmon said the move cut against the WI’s traditions. “The WI has alway been an incredibly grassroots organisation where every member has a say in how it’s run. But all that has been taken entirely out of our hands.”Hawley agreed the decision ran counter to the WI’s prior ethos: “We pay our fees to be part of a collective but although we’ve asked for a consultation, that doesn’t seem to be planned,” she said.For some branches, the implications of the ruling have actually worsened concerns rather than easing them.Jules Mortimore of Wells Angels, a 125-member WI group in Tunbridge Wells that also plans to close, pointed out the ruling means transgender men could join WI groups.“That is likely to be far more confronting and alarming for women than a trans woman,” she said.“The fact that we also haven’t been contacted about this and given any guidance about what to tell our members or how to handle it suggests the WI just haven’t thought any of this through properly at all,” she added.She said a WhatsApp network of about a dozen branches discussing closure is growing, with confusion and uncertainty driving increasing numbers of committees to consider leaving the NFWI.Despite the upheaval, however, many departing members say they remain attached to the community spirit that defined their groups, and intend to preserve it outside the official structure.“We’re going to reopen as an independent community group and we’re really positive about that,” said Mortimore.For Hawley, the aim is continuity rather than rupture. “We’ve been through so much together and given each other so much support,” she said. “We just want to carry on doing that.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's InstituteWomenTransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While rates are declining overall,cases among younger peopleare rising.“This is a curable cancer if diagnosed early,” says Dr Deirdre Cohen, director of the gastrointestinal oncology program for the Mount Sinai health system and an associate professor of medicine. “It’s important to bring any symptoms to the attention of your physician.”Here’s what you need to know about colorectal cancer.What is colorectal cancer?Colorectal cancer is an umbrella term for colon and rectal cancers, though these individual cancers are treated differently. The colon and rectum are parts of the large intestine, with the rectum positioned at the end of the colon.In some cases, cancer appears in both locations, says Dr Derek Ebner, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.Is colorectal cancer preventable?There’s no way to guarantee the prevention of colorectal cancer, and it can be a random event, says Cohen. But avoiding smoking and heavy alcohol use can reduce your risk.She also emphasizes the importance of a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, and avoiding processed meats like hot dogs and bacon.According to the American Cancer Society, high consumption of red meat is alsolinkedto a higher risk of colorectal cancer. A 2024studypublished in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention found that people with the highest level of red meat intake had a 30% increased risk for colorectal cancer. In the same study, individuals with the highest level of processed meat intake had a 40% increased risk.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'In addition to a variety of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, Ebner recommends lean meats and high fiber to his patients. This often leads people to stick with theMediterranean diet.Exercise is another critical factor in risk reduction, says Cohen. It may also lower the risk of recurrence. A 2025studypublished in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a three-year structured exercise program resulted in “significantly longer disease-free survival” and longer overall survival.Colorectal cancer can be hereditary, and some genetic syndromes, like Lynch syndrome, are linked to it.“If anyone has a first-degree relative, or a strong family history, they should see a genetic counselor for genetic testing and be considered for a colonoscopy at an earlier age,” says Cohen.What’s the link between inflammation and colorectal cancer?Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for variouscancers, including colorectal cancer. The drivers of chronic inflammation vary. For example,inflammatory bowel diseaseandCrohn’s diseaseare both risk factors for the development of cancer due to the long-term inflammation of the colon.Chronic inflammation related to alcohol use and ultra-processed foods can lead to an increased risk as well, explains Cohen.The relationship between colorectal cancer and inflammation is still being explored, says Ebner. But it’s possible that inflammation generatesfree radicals, which are unstable molecules that cause DNA damage.Is colorectal cancer becoming more common?Overall, colorectal cancer is ona decline, associated with increased screening efforts. In recent years, there has been a push to spread awareness about the disease, says Ebner. Celebrity cases of colorectal cancer, like Van Der Beek and actorChadwick Boseman, have also brought attention.However, “a striking thing we’re seeing is the astronomical rise of colorectal cancer under the age of 50 and under the age of 40”, says Cohen.What is a colonoscopy and should I get one?Read moreFor individuals under 50,rates of colorectal cancerhave increased by about 3% annually since 2010, per the American Cancer Society. Colorectal cancer death rates have also increased by 1% annually in people younger than 50 since 2005.It’s unclear why this rise is occurring, and potential drivers – like ultra-processed foods, sugary beverages and processed meats – are under investigation, says Cohen.Higher antibiotic prescribing in childhood is linked to a higher risk of colorectal cancer in somestudies; otherresearchhas found no evidence that antibiotic use in adulthood increases risk.“The fact that it’s increasing at such a high incidence in younger people suggests there’s been some environmental change,” says Cohen.What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?Colorectal cancer can beasymptomatic, so screening is important.Symptoms can include blood in your stool or a change in stool pattern, such as frequent or months-long constipation or diarrhea. Sudden weight loss or abdominal pain can also indicate that you should speak with your care provider, says Cohen.Patients may feel embarrassed to bring up these symptoms, says Ebner, but discussing these factors is normal.“It’s important that your healthcare providers are made aware of anything so we can navigate if next steps should happen,” he says.Who should be screened for colorectal cancer?In the US, theUS Preventive Services Task Forcerecommends screening beginning at age 45 for most individuals.“People might be surprised to learn that roughly a third of individuals who are eligible for screening have not yet undergone any,” says Ebner.Colorectal cancer can start as precancerous growths called polyps. These can form in the colon or rectum and turn into cancer over time. Finding and removing these polyps helps prevent cancer.There are several ways to bescreened, including a colonoscopy, stool-based screening tests and blood-based tests. Each test has different benefits and limitations, so it’s important to speak with your healthcare provider about which type is best for you.The frequency of each test also differs: For example, a colonoscopy is performedevery 10 yearsif results remain normal. A virtual colonoscopy, which is noninvasive and involves X-rays, may be conducted every five years.“I tell my patients who are at average risk that the best test is the one that gets done,” says Ebner. “When people have an opportunity to choose the test that will work best for them, it improves the actual adherence to doing that test.”Colonoscopy is the best strategy for those at high risk, he adds. It allows experts to identify and remove polyps simultaneously.If you suspect something is awry, it’s important to advocate for yourself and pursue screening even if you’re not in the typical age group, says Cohen.Is colorectal cancer treatable?People with stage 1 colorectal cancer have a cure rate of more than90%. The cure rate for stage 4 is closer to 15%.Treatments canincludesurgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, depending on an individual’s case and disease stage.Colorectal cancer is curable with early detection, explains Cohen. “Not every cancer has a screening tool that is effective, but in colorectal cancer, we do have that,” she says.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCancerHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1982, after competing in the World Pugilist championships in Hong Kong, I hitchhiked around Japan for a month or so, then headed for Korea via ferry in January of 1983. I’d heard air fares were cheap from Korea. No internet back then!While boarding, I was approached by a very attractive Japanese woman, with limited English, who told me that if I bought one box of bananas and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black label, I could pay for most of my trip in Korea. These items were very much in demand back then.Her name was Hitomi. We ended up talking on the ferry – I had absolutely no Japanese, and she was learning English as a hobby. She and her friend were travelling to Korea to buy clothes and accessories to sell in Japan. I didn’t know anything about Korea, so she suggested we travel together.View image in fullscreenHitomi and Kerry Cox in Tokyo circa 1990We stayed in Busan for a week, then in Seoul for another. Together, we’d visit local temples or Busan Tower. We’d just met – I didn’t think there were any romantic feelings.It turned out air fares were expensive in Korea, so Hitomi suggested I come back to Japan and spend some time in Miyazaki, Kyushu, where she lived with her mother. They lived in a valley, surrounded by rice paddies and koi ponds, with no other residences for a kilometre or so. Life was very simple. Hitomi’s mother was amused by me, and treated me well – at the time.Hitomi and I spent a lot of time traveling around Kyushu, visiting older people living on their own, others living with disabilities. She would often bring small gifts. I was becoming very attracted to her kindness, her always-cheerful personality, her lilting voice and laugh. She was beautiful on the inside and out. One local told me they thought she was an angel.One day we visited Takachiho, a famous mountain gorge. Because of the snow and ice, we decided to spend the night in a local tavern. That night she asked me when I would return home. I told her I was falling in love with her and wanted to stay longer. She said: “Me too!” I had no idea she felt the same way, and was ecstatic. We kissed. It was soft and delicate, just like her.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningEventually my visa ran out and I had to return to Australia. She came as far as Narita to see me off; we kissed forever and I almost missed the plane. We had plans for her to come to Australia as soon as she was able. I wasn’t thinking as far as marriage – this whole affair was completely unexpected for us both– but we were keen to see where it would lead.The moment I knew: on our second date I thought, ‘You’re kissing the man you’re going to marry’Read moreAs soon as I got back I realised Hitomi was the one. We had the odd phone call – expensive back then, so we primarily communicated through letters, in English. I have no idea how much she understood my writing although I tried to keep it as simple as I could, and I had an enjoyable but often difficult time understanding what she had written. All that mattered was the “love you” at the end.One day a mutual friend called: Hitomi is in Tokyo and wants to meet you … We hadn’t seen each other in years.She was trying hard to come to Australia but her mother was dead against it. So after a year I went back to Japan and hitchhiked down to a business hotel in Kyushu. Hitomi was working late, and I was just waiting in my room for her to arrive. There was a knock on my door. I opened it and she rushed into my arms, and a year’s worth of feelings spilled out. It was not a very romantic place, but I’d already decided I was going to ask her to marry me. And she said yes.Her mother did not approve. Looking back, I can understand: I was an unknown quantity, a foreigner who was possibly going to take her daughter away. If Hitomi and I were going to be together, I would have to come to Japan.View image in fullscreenKerry Cox and Hitomi on their wedding day, in Thames, New Zealand in 1990I went back to Australia to start applying for a visa. Unbeknownst to me, her mother was burning all my letters, and hung up whenever I tried to call.When I finally arrived back in Japan in 1988, I couldn’t contact Hitomi at all. She’d entered a singing competition, won a recording contract, and was travelling the country as a professional singer. Her manager and mother were blocking my attempts to contact her – their verdict was Hitomi had obligations and I would just complicate things.This was a gut punch. Knowing I wasn’t welcome in Miyazaki, I stayed in Tokyo, enrolled in Japanese language school, and worked in pubs, pachinko parlours and gyms.One day a mutual friend called: Hitomi is in Tokyo and wants to meet you. We met at Shinagawa station in a coffee shop. We hadn’t seen each other in years. She had matured, and was as beautiful as ever, with her same sweet voice and manner. By this time, my Japanese was better than her English and she was pleasantly surprised. After that, we rekindled our relationship very quickly. We were madly in love. We were now 30 years old and, according to her mother, no one else was going to marry a woman that old!In 1990, seven years after we first met on that ferry, we had a wedding ceremony in a beautiful old church in Thames,New Zealand. Hitomi wore a white wedding dress, then later changed into a kimono, which certainly turned heads in my small home town. Hitomi’s mother wore a kimono too – she’d come to accept that we could never be apart. My parents were totally enamoured of Hitomi, and said to me on the day: “If you stuff this up, don’t bother coming home!”‘For 40 years, I could never take my eyes off her’: Hitomi and Kerry Cox in Yugawara, Japan in early 2022.Photograph: SuppliedWe built a beautiful life together in Japan, with our two sons, and supported each other through thick and thin.Hitomi passed away three and a half years ago. I consider myself lucky that we were able to find each other again, after so many years apart. We always said it was fate that we boarded that ferry. If we had a choice, we would have married much earlier. For 40 years, I could never take my eyes off her. She was always the most beautiful woman in the room.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

They are all included in the V&A’sDesign 1990-Now galleries, which reopen to the public this week.The galleries, which run across two rooms on the upper floors of the museum, also house a collection of antique books. The displays cover six different themes including housing and living, crisis and conflict, and consumption and identity, rather than in a strict chronological order.View image in fullscreenThe ‘Please offer me a seat’ badge.Photograph: Olivia Singleton/V&A MuseumWith 250 exhibits, including 60 new additions, this can mean different takes on one theme across decades, as with the women at work section. It features a power suit from 1986 – but also a plastic-lined bra worn by women working on production lines in China to avoid being searched, and a pair of fast-fashion jeans like those made in the factories at theRana Plazabuilding in Bangladesh that collapsed due to a structural failure.‘Regrets? Number one: smoking. Number two: taking it up the wrong hole’: Tracey Emin on reputation, radical honesty – and ReformRead moreThe exhibits also demonstrate how history repeats itself, by using designs decades apart. This is clear with a poster calling for “No More Racist Murders” after the death of the teenager Rohit Duggal in 1992, which is displayed next to one commemoratingEric Garner, the Black man killed by a white police officer in 2014.There are 11 objects sourced fromRapid Response, a scheme that allows members of the public to suggest contemporary objects to be included in the museum’s collection. On display here are Snake Island stamps, which became a symbol of Ukraine’s resistance to Russia, a “life medal” given to those imprisoned for environmental action, and that Labubu.View image in fullscreenAn 80s boombox.Photograph: Jaron James/Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonCorinna Gardner, the V&A’s senior curator of design and digital, worked on the update. “The ambition of these galleries has always been to think that everybody who enters these spaces wakes up in the 21st century,” she said at a preview. “So how can we inform an understanding of today through the past? But also maybe think about a collective sense of what a future that we all might want can be, and the role design plays within that? It’s material things through which we navigate our place in the world.”Fresh insight into the objects we live with is everywhere – an Ikea lamp, for example, that is part of a manufacturing-at-scale section. “It’s designed as much to be compact for transport as it is to be beautiful in the home,” says Gardner.View image in fullscreenThe burkini was made after the designer saw her niece struggling to play netball while wearing a hijab and a long-sleeved top.Photograph: Robert Auton/V&A MuseumAn Apple home computer from 1977, and an accompanying advert suggesting the bliss of working from home, demonstrates the beginnings of something that is now a mainstay. “A computer in the home was a novelty at the time,” says Gardner. “There’s the idea that this husband [pictured in the advert], one might assume, is working away while his wife is kindly making dinner in the rear.”The backstory of familiar or newsworthy designs can be fascinating. The first ever baby monitor, designed by Isamu Noguchi in 1937, was inspired by theLindbergh baby kidnappingfive years earlier. The popularisation of plywood as a commercial material dates back to Charles and Ray Eames making a plywood splint to hold soldiers’ legs while in transit during the second world war.The burkini was made in 2004 after the designer Aheda Zanetti observed her niece struggling to play netball while wearing a hijab and a long-sleeved top. An unassuming-looking section of carbon-fibre rope, meanwhile, is the innovation that allows a building like Saudi Arabia’s 1km-high Jeddah Tower to power the lifts that serve all floors.The final section focuses on data and communication, and design over the last 25 years. This is where Edward Snowden’s laptop –borrowed from the Guardian’s archive– is displayed. “The archivist called it ‘an object we need to hold on to, because it’s so fundamental to our history’,” says Gardner. “The sense of the contestation of the public realm, the digital public realm, is manifest in that object.”View image in fullscreenNigeria’s 2018 World Cup kit.Photograph: Kieron Boyle/V&A MuseumThe Labubu is also here – surrounded by the antique books, and the librarians who look after them. It’s an example of how design can sometimes disrupt the usual environment of our every day. “One of my favourite moments as we’ve been reinstalling these galleries has been the giggles from the librarians because they were looking down at the Labubu,” says Gardner.Such reactions are what the V&A wants from the reworking of the gallery – whether from staff members, regular visitors or school groups of children and teenagers who might be surprised to see Labubus, football shirts or iPhones in a gallery. “Design museums, typically and historically, have been about celebrating excellence, and they do that very well,” she says. “These galleries are very much intended to be discursive …. The ambition is to be really expansive and open about that question of what design is.”Explore more on these topicsV&AExhibitionsDesignHeritageMuseumsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

That makes for some of the film’s funniest moments, like when Poinsettia ruins a Madama Butterfly opera performance by loudly singing along to the aria. Charles Burnett’s touching film is about how Fish and Poinsettia find refuge with each other that lets them emerge from the fantasies protecting them from the real world’s cruelty, and they find a kind of late-in-life puppy love over dinner dates, cozy sleepovers and card games at their Barbary Lane-like boarding house. When I saw the restoration last 14 February, the theater was filled with couples who, like my boyfriend and I, seemed cozied up just a little closer than usual.Owen MyersThe Annihilation of Fish is available on the Criterion Channel in the USThe More the MerrierI first saw The More the Merrier as a tween, and I fear it set completely unrealistic standards for all of my ensuing adult relationships. (Thanks for the education, Turner Classic Movies.) Joe (Joel McCrea) and Connie (Jean Arthur) are two strangers forced to live together in DC thanks to a second world war-era housing shortage. Connie is a straight-shooting working woman engaged to a real dud of a bureaucratic stooge. Joe is a raffish sergeant with a nagging crush on his new roommate. One night they walk home together, and Connie tries to distract herself from their obvious magnetism by babbling about her betrothed, who has the deeply unsexy name of Mr Pendergast. As Joe pulls Connie close, we watch her negotiate a desire for him against the practicality of Pendergast. You can guess who wins. The ensuing stoop makeup session gets a lot of attention (especially onYouTube, where it has been dubbed “one of the most erotic love scenes ever”). I agree, though I prefer a more subtly sexy moment: the meet-cute, where Joe walks in on Connie while she’s wearing a face full of moisturizer. She’s embarrassed; it’s played for laughs. But then we linger on Joe’s face, awash with that first jolt of falling for someone, clearly unbothered by how she’s un-done. If love doesn’t look like that, I don’t want it.Alaina DemopoulosThe More the Merrier is available to rent digitally in the USLibeled LadyDespite receiving an Oscar nomination for best picture in 1936, Libeled Lady doesn’t seem to be a go-to citation for classic screwball romance. Maybe it’s because stars Myrna Loy and William Powell are better known for their Thin Man series of detective comedies; or because their co-star Spencer Tracy’s best-known romcoms often feature Katharine Hepburn, absent here; or because it came out the same year as the seemingly more beloved My Man Godfrey (also with Powell). Or maybe it’s because Libeled Lady, even more than some of its fellow screwball classics, is heavily focused on its (very funny) farcical elements. Newspaperman Warren Haggerty (Tracy) enlists his irritated fiancee, Gladys (Jean Harlow), to help reporter Bill Chandler (Powell) trap heiress Connie Allenbury (Loy) in a seeming affair, thereby invalidating Allenbury’s libel suit against Haggerty’s paper. Got all that? As is often the case with screwball, all of the deception and scheming helps some fast-talking, fast-thinking people clarify what it is they actually value about one another. What sets Libeled Lady apart is all four players’ dexterity and flexibility when assessing their relationships – which makes it all the more heedlessly romantic when their various mix-ups settle on the “right” partners.Jesse HassengerLibeled Lady is available to rent digitally in the US, UK and AustraliaSanctuaryHard to pin down, Sanctuary pulls off the astonishing trick of turning an erotic thriller into a romcom, offering a virtually real-time, high-wire all-nighter that peers deeply into the psychology of love and seduction. It starsMargaret QualleyandChristopher Abbott(shortly before the pair was to feature in Yorgos Lanthimos’s 2023 absurdist coming-of-age flickPoor Things), here playing the roles of Rebecca and Hal, a hard-luck domme and the failson client who is about to dump her. The latter is about to inherit his father’s business empire and needs to clean up his act, but Rebecca has other plans, swiftly turning the tables by threatening to blackmail Hal with recordings of his deepest humiliations. What follows could be called an escalating battle of the sexes, but it could just as well be described as a torrid lovers’ quarrel, a roleplay gone much too far, or even do-it-yourself therapy. What makes Sanctuary stand out is the ever-surprising plot – where virtually anything can and does happen – and how Rebecca and Hal mercilessly peel back the layers of one another’s psyche. Throw in enough sexual tension to kill a horse and two simply astonishing performances, and you have a movie that cerebral, sexy, funny and extremely entertaining.Veronica EspositoSanctuary is available to watch on Hulu in the US, to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaLonesomeLoneliness strikes even in a crowd of nearly 7 million people – and in this urban romance from the last gasps of the jazz age, two heartsick New Yorkers pine for a lasting connection in a city growing bigger by the day. Mary and Jim (silent comedians Barbara Kent and Glenn Tryon), are hard-pressed moderns, living by the clock, working at the telephone exchange and on the factory line, who meet and fall in love on an Independence Day trip to the beach. Swapping the traffic of the city for the pleasure-rides and fireworks of Coney Island, they share a glimpse of a future – but lovers thrown together by fate are easily parted the same way. This is a wistful kind of romcom, in the great tradition of New York love stories. Lonesome is a lovelorn, restless “city symphony”, which only pauses during the tacked-on talking scenes that the producers erroneously thought would modernise this otherwise silent movie. Only question is: the same city that keeps Mary and Jim apart also conspire them a shot at happiness?Pamela HutchinsonLonesome is available to watch on YouTube and Tubi in the US and Australia and YouTube in the UKHav PlentyTwo decades before “it’s complicated” was an official relationship status, Hav Plenty was modeling the behavior with young Black romantics who radiated with 1990s’ grown and sexy vibes. Based on the true story of one man’s crush on Def Jam A&R turned #MeToo advocate Drew Dixon, Christopher Scott Cherot writes, directs and stars as Lee – a frustrated writer whose simmering affections for Hav (Chenoa Maxwell in her biggest role) fire up when he’s invited to a family New Year’s Eve party. Hav juggles Lee’s heart in one hand even as she’s engaged to an R&B star; with the other, she interferes with Lee’s ability to connect her flirty best friend and Hav’s sister divorcee. Indulgent, meandering and talky, Hav Plenty typifies R-rated indie screwballs of this era, and it took Cherot working as a cab driver and his mom taking out a third mortgage on her house to get this love letter made. The story ends on a messy, bittersweet note – just as real life tends to.Andrew LawrenceHav Plenty is available on Amazon Prime VideoAn Autumn’s TaleAn Autumn’s Tale is a delightful odd duck: a Cantonese romcom set in New York, made on a shoestring budget but starring two of Hong Kong’s biggest stars, that for a long time was difficult to see despite its cult fandom. In recent years some British and Australian distributors have done everyone a favor by putting it on Blu-ray and giving new audiences a chance to experience its charm. Our lonely heroine is Jennifer (Cherie Chung), a reserved, middle-class Hongkonger who comes to New York for college and soon suffers homesickness, money problems and romantic disappointment. A streetwise distant cousin, Figgy (Chow Yun-fat, more commonly an action star), agrees to help her around. Can the scrappy, uncultured Figgy help Jennifer find her way – and perhaps find something more? Of course. Yet this movie, for its cliches and predictable beats, is full of wit and emotional wisdom. Directed by Mabel Cheung, an underappreciated female film-maker, it also boasts great location shots of the seedy splendor of 1980s New York.J Oliver ConroyAn Autumn’s Tale is available to watch on the Criterion Channel in the US and to rent digitally in the UKTkarontoThe first question we hear in Tkaronto (the Mohawk name for Toronto), is: “Who are you and I?” It lingers throughout Métis film-maker Shane Belcourt’s modest and melancholic romance about two people feeling alienated from their own Indigenousness and finding a fleeting sense of place with each other. Made for a scrappy $25,000, at a time when Indigenous creators were tokenized by an industry that barely supported their storytelling, Belcourt’sBefore Sunrise-inspired debut feature resonates far beyond its means. Duane Murray’s white-passing Métis creative Ray (a surrogate for Belcourt) and Melanie McLaren’s Anishinaabe painter Jolene cross paths, just as they’re both interrogating what it means to be urban-dwelling Indigenous people at a distance – not just from the reserves, but also the culture and history that had been taken from them. Tkaronto patiently and beautifully expresses that longing for connection through their fleeting, thorny and bittersweet romantic interlude, in which two awkwardly charming individuals find a mirror in each other and fall in love with the person they see reflected back at them.Radheyan SimonpillaiTkaronto is available to watch onVimeo on DemandMy Old AssMy Old Ass, writer-director Megan Park’s criminally underseen albeit woefully titled sophomore feature, is an unlikely romance film. The film’s central relationship is between 18-year-old Elliott (Maisy Stella), a recent high school graduate in her last summer at home, and her 39-year-old self (Aubrey Plaza), whom she conjures during a magic mushrooms trip. Though older Elliott’s vague advice is to avoid anyone named Chad – and she soon meets a very nice Chad (Percy Hynes White) – her primary concern is the looming drumbeat of time. The film’s standout scene is a hallucinatory tribute to Baby-era Justin Bieber. There’s a late-stage, tear-jerking twist. None of this should work – Stella and Plaza look nothing alike, for one – and yet few films have sneaked past my defenses and suffused me with romantic notions quite like this one. That’s both in the broad view – swelling tides of love for family, for youth, for home – and in the narrower sense: sometimes, despite your best intentions or expectations (or beliefs of your own sexuality), you fall in love with someone anyway, even someone named Chad – and even knowing what you know now, you’d do it all again.Adrian HortonMy Old Ass is available on Amazon Prime VideoAddicted to LoveBack in 1997, Meg Ryan, who had spent almost a decade as reigningromcom sweetheart, decided to pull a Cable Guy. Like Jim Carrey, who had found success with big, for-the-family humour beforedipping into darkness, she decided to subvert her star image and go rogue in the sour, ex-stalking comedy Addicted to Love. But Ryan found, like Carrey before her, that audiences and critics were not willing to follow and the film was dismissed as a“disturbing”misstep. Yet in my teens, it was always an undersung VHS favourite because like the very best movie romances, it understands that it’s our shared perversities that truly bond us. In this case it’s Ryan andMatthew Broderick’s bitter dumpees joining forces to spy on and eventually destroy their exes who have shacked up together (it means we’re watching a romcom of people watching and eventually rewriting a romcom). He is led by heartache and she by rage but the deeper they get into their increasingly deranged – and dangerous – scheme, the more they realise that doing terrible things with each other is maybe the most fun they’ve ever had. The most alienating romcoms fail to understand or really admit that true romance can turn us into petty and pathetic lunatics. Addicted to Love knows us far better than that.Benjamin LeeAddicted to Love is available to rent digitally in the US, UK and AustraliaP’tang, Yang, KipperbangIn the annals of obscure teen romcoms, they don’t get much more obscure than this - a film with a gibberish title that showed on Channel 4 on its second night of existence in 1982 and then - largely - promptly forgotten about. Well, I can say I was watching that night and I have to say I was profoundly moved – and was equally moved when I had another look a couple of nights ago. Technically, it’s part of the wave of teen movies that surged in the 1980s, but it would be hard to find something more diametrically opposite to the sassy Hughes/Coppola/Heckerling style. This British film - directed by Michael Apted, not long off Coal Miners Daughter, from a script by Jack Rosenthal that acted as a throwback to his own grammar school education in the 1950s. That pre-permissive society setting is one link to the US high school movie - think American Graffitti, Porky’s, The Outsiders - but there any similarity end, and it’s not just because of theRay Lindwallreferences. P’tang, Yang, Kipperbang is basically about shyness – it’s title referencing a meaningless catchphrase the lead character uses with a couple of his scrotty mates – and this kid, garlanded with the nickname “Quack Quack”, is hopelessly, yearningly in love with one of his fragrant classmates (played by Abigail Cruttenden) – who is known, naturally, as “Smelly”. Quack Quack’s main weapon is an internal monologue voiced by cricket immortal John Arlott (once of the Guardian’s parish) which of course goes into overdrive when Quack Quack is cast in the school play and – gulp – is called upon to kiss Smelly. What actually transpires is one of the more heartrending endings in romcom history – but it can’t be nearly as heartrending as the earlier scene where the girls vote on the “dishiest” boy in the class. For Quack Quack, it’s most nightmarish of all possible outcomes: he doesn’t just get zero votes, they forget to include him in the first place – a near-perfect illustration of something the Guardian’s art critic Adrian Searleonce wrote: “To be ignored is the worst fate of all.”Andrew PulverP’tang, Yang, Kipperbang is available on Amazon PrimeExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsValentine's DayJames Earl JonesMargaret QualleyAubrey PlazaMatthew BroderickComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then, as the realisation that he had won gold forBrazilin the men’s giant slalom, he collapsed to the floor and allowed the tears to flow.“I just hope that Brazilians look at this and truly understand that your difference is your superpower,” he said, still sobbing away. “It may show up in your skin or in the way you dress. But I hope this inspires every kid out there who feels a bit different to trust who you are.”From vertigo to Van Gogh: 10 things you may have missed at the Winter OlympicsRead moreOn the back of his helmet, Pinheiro Braathen has in big letters “Vamos Dancar” – “Let’s Dance.” And he certainly did that on his first run, establishing a stunning 0.95sec lead over the Swiss legend Marco Odermatt.Braathen’s performance was so good that only seven skiers were within two seconds of his pace, and while he leaked away some of his advantage with some ragged turns in his second run, he held his nerve to win gold by 0.58sec. “It really was one hell of a first run and I was able to keep composed and balanced in the second run,” explained the 25-year-old who collapsed to the snow at the finish before rising up and holding his skis aloft.

And it’s been a rather unconventional one. But it’s been my one. It’s a road that has been paved with daring to be who I am.”That is certainly true. Pinheiro Braathen was born to a Brazilian mother and Norwegian father in Oslo and reluctantly took up skiing at the age of eight after being introduced to the sport by his father. He was raised speaking both Norwegian and Portuguese.He competed for Norway at the Beijing Games, where he failed to finish in either giant slalom or slalom, before stunning the sport when he split with the Norwegian federation and retired after winning the World Cup slalom title in 2023, saying he was not able to express himself or have the freedom to work with his own sponsors.View image in fullscreenFans with Brazilian flags urge Lucas Pinheiro Braathen to Olympic glory.Photograph: Fredrik Sandberg/TT/ShutterstockIn 2024, Pinheiro Braathen returned to the slopes in the colours of Brazil, the birthplace of his mother Alessandra and where he spent several years of his childhood.

As I said before these Games started, Brazil is not here to participate. We are going to bring a difference. That was my goal. I’ve dreamed about this for so long, that if I followed my heart I could finish off on top. And that’s why I am an Olympic champion today.”Odermatt, the reigning Olympic champion, took silver.

However, the sport’s governing body did warn Canada about their abusive langugage and introduced emergency spot checks on Saturday afternoon to make sure teams were not cheating when releasing the stone.A bad-tempered game erupted when Sweden’s Oskar Eriksson told Canada’s Marc Kennedy he was double-touching the stone on the penultimate end, which led to Kennedy responding with an expletive.‘I told him where to stick it’: Cheating claims fly in Canada v Sweden Winter Olympics curling clashRead moreSpeaking after Canada had lost 9-5 to Switzerland on Saturday afternoon, Kennedy insisted he was innocent of any wrongdoing. “I can’t think of once in my entire career where I’ve done something to gain a competitive advantage by cheating,” he said. “And I take that very seriously. And it’s been a really long career. So when you get called out, my instinct was to be a little bit of a bulldog. I don’t regret defending myself or my teammates in that moment. I just probably regret the language I used.”The Curling Canada chief, Nolan Thiessen, said it was a poor choice of words from Kennedy. “I think heat of the moment, I would allow for as well,” Thiessen said. “Something was said in his ear which got him going. Head games get played in a lot of sports and things get said in competitive sport and I think this was one of those situations. Do I wish Mark didn’t drop an F-bomb? Yeah.”World Curling has introduced electronic handles on the stones at these Games, which flash red if players are still making contact with the stone beyond the hog line, the point where curlers must let go of the stone during delivery. However, the Swedes believed Kennedy was touching the stone and not the handle containing the sensor, meaning the red lights did not flash. Replays seemed to back Eriksson up, although officials did not intervene during the contest.“We told the officials,” said Eriksson. “They came out and they misread the rules, sadly. Because they thought double-touching any part of the rock is OK. And then they found out that was wrong. You can only touch the electronic part of the handle.”In a statement, World Curling confirmed it did not currently use video replay to re-umpire game decisions and would not change the result. “Decisions made during a game are final,” it added.However, on Saturday, Kennedy vented his anger at the Swedish team for calling him out. “I know we’re not the only team that they’ve done that to,” he said. “They have come up with a plan here at the Olympics, as far as I know, to catch teams in the act at the hog line. It was planned right from the word go yesterday, from the words that were being said by their coaches and the way they were running to the officials.”Eriksson hit back by saying he was confident that Kennedy had not followed the rules – having watched the video. “I don’t think he has slept too well, while I slept like a baby,” he added.World Curling did, however, say it would be introducing spot checks to ensure the rules were followed.It also sent an email to every team in the Winter Olympics, reminding them that not using the handle was illegal. Canada was also warned that any repeat of the bad language would result in sanctions.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026CurlingWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Glory to Ukraine.”Heraskevych was excluded from the Games on Thursdayafter he was told he had contravened the International Olympic Committee (IOC) athlete expression guidelines by wanting to wearing the helmet, which showed the images of 24 Ukrainian athletes and children killed by Russia during its military invasion.An urgent appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which he hoped would allow him back into a competition that waswon by Great Britain’s Matt Weston, was refused on Friday. Cas’s sole arbitator said she had no choice to reject the appeal because she was bound by rules in the IOC athlete expression guidelines, which prohibit athletes from expressing their views on the field of play.“The sole arbitrator considers these guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes’ interests to express their views, and athletes’ interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play,” Cas said in a statement.Andrii Sybiha, the Ukraine minister of foreign affairs, said Heraskevych’s disqualification would be remembered by future generations as “a moment of shame”. “He who has the truth on his side should prevail,” Heraskevych posted on social media on Saturday morning.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Volodymyr ZelenskyyWinter OlympicsUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

They will both make one run down the track, and their combined time will be what counts. The key difference is that, unlike the regular event, the mixed team skeleton uses a reaction start. Sledders can only go when the start lights change, and there’s a half-second penalty for anyone who makes a false start.“I think we’re going to be one of the strongest sets of teams out there,” Weston says. “We can definitely take it to the rest of the nations, and hopefully come back with a few more bits of bling.”View image in fullscreenMatt Weston is aiming to emulate double Olympic gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesTheir strongest competition comes from China, Austria, and Germany, whose men won the silver and bronze in the men’s event behind Weston, and women filled the same positions after the first two heats of their event.Germany has won the event on four of the five times it has been held at the world championships, but Weston finished second on each of the last three occasions, twice in partnership with Stoecker. “We’ve had quite a few of them now, although this year I only actually took part in one because I have been restricting how much I’ve been doing because of the pretty bad injury at the start of the season. But I haven’t forgotten how to do it so, yeah, I’m excited to see what we can do and I think the team’s in a great position.”Weston has broken the track record in Cortina four times already this week, but is convinced he can be even quicker. “I’m very much a perfectionist so even in that last run there’s some bits that I wasn’t quite happy with,” he says.“I look at it as a continuation, like a five-heat race. The only difference is that reaction start, and that’s quite exciting, it adds a bit of jeopardy and adds a bit of adrenaline so hopefully I’ll push a bit faster as well. It’s just laying it all out there.”Weston’s roommate at these Games, Marcus Wyatt, will also compete in the mixed team event, along with the second-fastest of the British women.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Saturday afternoon in Milan’s western suburbs, Jordan Stolz mastered the sport’s fastest and most unpredictable race and pushedhis Olympic campaigntoward historic territory.The 21-year-old American won the 500m in an Olympic-record 33.77 seconds, securing his second gold medal of the Milano Cortina Olympics and adding pace behind what is rapidly becoming one of thedefining individual campaignsof these Winter Games.It also means Stolz has opened these Games with two races, two gold medals and two Olympic records.Quick GuideJordan Stolz's expected Olympic programShowScheduleAll times Eastern.Wed 11 FebMen's 1000m, 12.30pmSat 14 FebMen's 500m, 11amThu 19 FebMen's 1500m, 10.30amSat 21 FebMen's Mass Start semi-finals, 3pmSat 21 FebMen's Mass Start final, 4.40pmWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In a final that rewrote the record book, the entire podium finished below the previous Olympic record of 34.32sec. Stolz led the way in 33.77sec, followed by the Netherlands’ Jenning de Boo in 33.88sec and Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil in 34.26sec. The performance was historic on multiple levels. Stolz’s time stands as the fastest 500m ever skated at sea level, while his 0.11-second winning margin marked the largest gap in a single-race Olympic 500m since 1988.Winter Olympics 2026: skeleton, ski jumping, Norway win 10th gold, and more – liveRead moreStolz did not win through a single dominant phase. Instead, he combined an elite start, near-perfect first-corner mechanics and exceptional speed preservation down the back straight – the three components that typically separate Olympic champions from podium contenders at this distance. In modern sprint skating, where aerodynamic drag and ice friction punish even slight inefficiencies, that phase-to-phase balance is rare.The result mattered not just because it added another medal, but because of the distance itself. The 500m was generally viewed as the toughest of Stolz’s three primary individual races: an all-out sprint from the opening push, where races are often decided by hundredths and where even generational skaters can lose control before the first corner exit.Skating in the third-to-last of 15 heats, Stolz was paired with De Boo – whoended Stolz’s two-year world title reignat the distance last March in Hamar, Norway – in one of the afternoon’s marquee matchups. If the 1000m on Wednesdayshowcased Stolz’s devastating closing speed, the 500m demanded something else: immediate perfection. Stolz delivered it.“It was super close. I already knew it was going to be close before the race,” Stolz said. “I thought if I skated a perfect one, and I get a really good last outer turn, I can probably pull it off.”View image in fullscreenAll three medalists finished below the previous Olympic 500m record.Photograph: Robert Ghement/EPAHe exploded cleanly from the start, protected the first turn with his trademark low, efficient body position and carried speed through the back straight with the kind of technical stability that has defined his rise.“Coming down the last hundred meters, I thought I should be able to beat him and that’s exactly what I did,” he said. “I had a really good outer turn and I could feel him coming up. When I first entered the turn I was waiting to hear his skates, and I wasn’t hearing them yet. Then, finally, he started coming up next to me and I thought: ‘I can beat him now.’”The victory builds directly on the platform he established earlier this week, when he won gold in the 1000m by the largest Olympic margin at the distance since 1984 – a result that immediately positioned him as the central long-track storyline of these Games.Jordan Stolz: the American speed skater who could define the OlympicsRead moreStolz said the emotional shift from winning earlier in the week helped him approach Saturday differently. “Way less pressure,” he said. “I really wanted to win the 1000m and after that I knew the environment, what to expect.“Today I felt way less pressure until maybe 30 minutes before the race. Then I started to really focus. I was just thinking about the pushes, went through the whole race in my mind and how I wanted to do it. I’m happy I pulled it off.”Two races into the program, the greater historical framing is harder to ignore. The men’s record for most speed skating gold medals at a single Olympics is the five won by Eric Heiden at Lake Placid in 1980, one of the most untouchable achievements in Olympic sport. Stolz entered Milan viewed as a multi-event gold threat. With two wins already secured, the ceiling remains intact. He also joins Heiden, who was in attendance Saturday, as only the second man to complete the Olympic 500m-1000m double.His trajectory since Beijing 2022 has been meteoric. At 17 as an Olympic debutant, he finished 13th in the 500m and 14th in the 1000m. Four years later, he is dictating the competitive tone of the Olympic long-track program.Raised in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, and developed at the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee, Stolz has approached speed skating less as an art than a systems problem, obsessing over blade setup, ice density and aerodynamic efficiency in pursuit of what he calls “free speed”. The Milan track – a temporary Olympic venue that has already produced some of the fastest times in Olympic history – has played into that mindset.The Olympic schedule now turns toward Thursday’s 1500m, where Stolz could become only the second American to win three gold medals at a singleWinter Olympics. The mass start still follows later in the program. The last man to win three speed skating gold medals at a single Winter Games was Norway’s Johann Olav Koss in 1994, another historical marker now sitting within touching distance.But if the 500m represented the event most likely to destabilize his campaign, Stolz just removed that threat. And with two gold medals already secured – and records falling around him – the possibility of a historic Olympic medal haul is unfolding in real time.Explore more on these topicsJordan StolzSpeed skatingUS sportsUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Reclaiming the Calcutta Cup is always sweet but convincingly ending England’s 12-Test unbeaten record was a glorious bonus. For Gregor Townsend and his side, under pressure after theiropening round defeat in Rome, this was some riposte to their criticsUltimately, it was not even close. Two tries by Huw Jones, a hard-nosed collective effort from the Scottish pack and a typically artful display from Finn Russell were simply too much for an England team who had dared to believe this week that their previous tartan traumas were behind them. Instead, they were outplayed and tactically out-thought by Townsend and his coaching staff. England have now won just two of the past nine meetings between the nations.‘Something to smile about’: Townsend salutes Scotland after shocking EnglandRead moreScotland were rampant at times in the first half, with sharp tries by Jones, Jamie Ritchie and Ben White giving them a 24-10 interval cushion. From England’s perspective, there was little improvement thereafter, with Jones’s second try, originating from a charged-down George Ford drop-goal attempt, in effect sealing the visitors’ fate.Well as Scotland played, they were assisted by a strangely below-par English effort. Little errors killed any momentum they did generate and their defensive system, with Tommy Freeman not looking entirely at ease in the midfield, was repeatedly outflanked. Steve Borthwick’s side, possibly lulled into a false sense of security by theirstraightforward win over Wales in round one, were off the pace and lacking in control and authority.View image in fullscreenHuw Jones scores Scotland’s fourth try after George Ford’s kick was charged down.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesThey also had Henry Arundell shown red in the 37th minute when the wing received his second yellow card of the game for taking out Kyle Steyn in the air. These days that means England were reduced to 14 men for only the ensuing 20 minutes but the disruption to Borthwick’s plans and the encouragement it gave Scotland were both significant.Such twists and turns are all part of the intricateSix Nationstapestry. And days such as this encapsulate the championship’s enduring appeal. The city of Edinburgh looked achingly beautiful beneath clear blue skies and, as ever, there was a tantalising sense of local expectancy on the streets and the stadium-bound trams. To dust down a classic old Scottish newspaper intro: Can they do it? Aye, I think they can.It was also a perfect evening for rugby: cold, still and atmospheric. The acoustic version of Flower of Scotland never sounds better than when England are in town, while the hosts’ defeat in Rome added a now-or-never element. For Scotlandthisfixture was a clear fork in the road in terms of their championship prospects.Quick GuideMatch detailsShowScotlandJordan, Steyn, Jones, Tuipulotu (capt), Dobie, Russell, White; McBeth, Turner, Z Fagerson, Brown, Cummings, Ritchie, Darge,Dempsey.ReplacementsCherry, Schoeman, Millar-Mills, Williamson, M Fagerson, Horne, Hastings, Graham.TriesJones 2, Ritchie, White.ConsRussell 4PenRussell.EnglandSteward; Roebuck, Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Heyes, Chessum, Itoje, Pepper, Underhill, Earl.ReplacementsGeorge, Rodd, Davison, Coles, Pollock, T Curry, Spencer, F Smith.Yellow cardArundell 8.Red cardArundell 37.TriesArundell, Earl.ConsFord 2.PensFord 2.Referee:Nika Amashukeli (Georgia).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Gregor Townsend had demanded a good start “to show who we are” and the opening 14 minutes suggested his players were still very much listening to him. Even before Arundell received a slightly harsh first yellow for desperately trying to slow down a home attack, Scotland were already ahead through a Russell penalty and looking sharp. A 14-man England were struggling to get a grip and a lovely midfield tip-on by Russell then gave Jones the chance to run around Maro Itoje, temporarily out of his natural habitat on the right wing.Worse was to follow for the visitors as Scotland poured forward again, committing white-shirted defenders and leaving England’s flanks exposed. This time it was Sione Tuipulotu’s long pass to the unmarked Ritchie that did the damage, with Russell’s second successful conversion further widening the gap.View image in fullscreenHenry Arundell (left) endured a tough afternoon after two yellow cards in the first half of the Calcutta Cup clash.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesEngland needed to respond urgently and did so when Arundell, back on the field, appeared on Ford’s shoulder to score his fourth try of this championship. So much for a cautious, cagey opening half-hour. A Ford penalty made it 17-10 after just 25 minutes with no sign of the contest slowing down.Russell was certainly enjoying himself and Scotland’s ringmaster was soon orchestrating more mischief. Having already danced around and through a thicket of defenders, the fly-half put in a rolling chip that held up nicely just short of the England line. Ellis Genge went to gather it but the ball squirted loose and Ben White seized gleefully on the unexpected gift.Almost nothing that England had talked about – silencing the crowd, suffocating Russell, asserting forward dominance – came to pass. They looked uncertain and their narrow defence was again shown up when Scotland chose to run from their own line, making good progress up the right-hand side rather than hoofing the ball straight back into English hands.With Arundell having now disappeared for the second time, England’s rigid gameplan badly needed updating. Ten Scottish linebreaks to three reflected the tenor of the contest’s first 40 minutes as accurately as any other stat and Borthwick’s side were already heading for their heaviest Six Nations defeat since they lost 29-13 to Ireland in 2023.Scotland 31-20 England: Six Nations player ratings from MurrayfieldRead moreEven the arrival of Tom Curry in place of Sam Underhill at half-time could not steady the sinking ship. An early scrum penalty did trim the score to 24-13 but another English calamity was just around the corner. Ford’s drop-goal attempt was charged down by the energetic Matt Fagerson and Jones was on his shoulder to sprint 60 metres for the bonus-point score.The rest was simply a matter of Scotland ensuring there would be no repeat of past collapses from winning positions, despite a late consolation try for Ben Earl. This result has also dramatically resuscitated their title hopes, with embattled Wales in Cardiff next up. Although, on the evidence of this spectacular turnaround, it would be wisest to assume nothing.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Scotland rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Fast forward two months and the Egyptian great is starting, scoring and shaping games for Arne Slot again. Appeasement between the pair is for the greater good.Salah produced a sublime assist, his fourth since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, and scored from the penalty spot asLiverpoolmoved into round five with a commanding victory over Fabian Hürzeler’s struggling team. There was no evidence of Brighton not performing for their under-pressure manager but their lack of cutting edge was glaring, as was the case when visiting here in the Premier League.Liverpool 3-0 Brighton: FA Cup fourth round – liveRead moreCurtis Jones and a stunning strike from Dominik Szoboszlai – “one of the best players in the world right now”, according to Salah – condemned Brighton before the Egypt international applied the final blow. It could have been worse for Hürzeler’s side had the substitute Rio Ngumoha not had a late goal wrongly disallowed for offside.“It is very nice to have Mo on the scoresheet again,” said Slot, who rested Hugo Ekitiké and Ryan Gravenberch on the bench but otherwise went strong with his lineup. “But what I like the most is he also helps the team a lot defensively and that is something very positive. It is what the team needs. Also, more players are capable of playing at this intensity level every three days and so more and more we see the quality we have.”This was a slow-burning cup tie. Liverpool needed half an hour to find any urgency while Brighton had the better of the opening exchanges without seriously troubling Alisson. Hürzeler could take some encouragement from his players’ confidence in possession and pressing game but a third successive game without a goal underlined where their weakness lies.Jones, the latest Liverpool player to be handed the cursed right-back shift, signalled the start of the improvement when sending an angled drive just wide of Jason Steele’s top corner. Cody Gakpo headed in from Szoboszlai’s free-kick minutes later but from an offside position.Liverpool were finally playing with the intensity and intent that the occasion demanded. Salah broke clear of Ferdi Kadioglu and had the ball taken off his toes by the Brighton left-back just as he shaped to shoot. Milos Kerkez then stung Steele’s fingertips having been found in space behind the visitors’ defence by Alexis Mac Allister’s quickly taken free-kick.View image in fullscreenCurtis Jones gives Liverpool the lead from Milos Kerkez’s cross.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesBrighton could not escape the Liverpool pressure and were finally breached shortly before the interval. A tackle by striker Charalampos Kostoulas on Mac Allister inadvertently played the ball to Kerkez. The Hungarian left-back swept a dangerous low cross into the six-yard box where Jones, arriving unmarked between Jan Paul van Hecke and Kadioglu, side-footed home via the underside of the crossbar. The midfielder’s first goal of the season rewarded a dominant spell by Liverpool yet sparked an immediate response from Brighton.Jack Hinshelwood could have levelled swiftly when beating Gakpo to Harry Howell’s corner but headed wastefully over at close range. A slip by Jones in first-half stoppage time presented Diego Gómez with a one-v-one against Alisson. The Liverpool keeper came out on top, saving the forward’s low shot with his legs.Fortune favoured Alisson early in the second half when his clearance struck the in-coming Gómez and rebounded wide of the Liverpool goal. The keeper then made a vital intervention to prevent Lewis Dunk’s header reaching the unmarked Van Hecke. A key moment, as Liverpool in effect settled the tie from their next attack.The home side’s second was outstanding in its creation and execution. When Gakpo’s crossfield pass found its way to Salah the striker, in one movement, leapt into the air and cushioned the ball into the run of Szoboszlai on the volley. The Hungary captain did not break stride and lashed an emphatic first-time drive past Steele.Salah won and converted the penalty that brought Liverpool their third. There was a glimpse of the Salah of old as he turned Kadioglu and powered past the left-back into the box, where he was dragged back by Pascal Gross. Stuart Attwell immediately pointed to the spot and the Egypt international gave Steele no chance with a blistering penalty kick.“Moments decided the game, unfortunately in the wrong direction,” said Hürzeler. “Liverpool had the quality to use their chances. We were not able to be that effective.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupLiverpoolBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

With theFA Cupnot allowing the video protocol until the fifth round, this was an occasion to make the abolitionists think twice. Is elite football already too far gone to officiate without a bank of screens in a faraway business park? Or were Chris Kavanagh, a referee promoted to the Uefa elite list in December, and his assistants just having a nightmare day at the office?Sandro Tonali’s two goals and Nick Woltemade’s clincher booked Newcastle’s fifth-round place, completing a comeback in the face of officiating mistakes weighing against Eddie Howe’s team. It wasAston Villawho lost their discipline. They should have been down to 10 men earlier than they eventually were.“We had the benefit of replays and we felt very aggrieved,” said Eddie Howe before playing a diplomatic card. “I think the referees and officials are making honest decisions. They’ve got them wrong on more than one occasion but I thought the players did really well to control their emotions, to stay calm.”View image in fullscreenMarco Bizot brings down Jacob Murphy to earn a red card.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesIn Unai Emery’s view, the game’s events had served as further proof in his belief that “VAR is necessary to help referees, to have as a reference”.Tammy Abraham’s opener for Aston Villa, his first goal for the club since 2019, found Newcastle’s defence slumbering when Douglas Luiz scooped a free-kick through. The striker was clearly offside. Perhaps both defenders and officials have become too reliant on the tech. No semi-automation here; the goal stood.VAR makes hypocrites of us all. Emery and Howe have been critical of the technology in recent weeks. In the Premier League, there would have been second looks on first-half penalty-area challenges on Lewis Hall and Harvey Barnes but Kavanagh let the game flow. Lucas Digne’s first-half yellow card for clattering Jacob Murphy had a distinct tinge of red, the latter’s leg having the stud marks to show it. Again, the decision stood. Good process?Seconds before the break, there was no mistake about Marco Bizot’s dismissal, a rush of blood of volcanic proportions. Fully 45 yards from goal, the Villa goalkeeper’s last-man foul on Murphy was incomprehensible. Bizot himself required a second look on the touchline video screen to make any sense of it. Emi Martínez came on as sub keeper.Burnley turfed out of FA Cup on perfect day for Louis Reed and MansfieldRead moreBoth starting XIs had betrayed greater interest in other competitions. Barring a Champions League miracle, the FA Cup represents Newcastle’s sole chance of silverware to follow last year’s Carabao Cup. Last March at Wembley was the realisation of a dream but Howe now deals in more prosaic realities. “You see all this stuff on social media which he doesn’t deserve,” said Kieran Trippier, Newcastle’s captain. “We are fully behind him.”This season has been a sincere test of true faith for the Toon Army. Bruno Guimarães’s absence, with the prognosis he could miss 12 games, must be overcome. “He’s devastated,” said Howe. Newcastle have not won a league match without the Brazilian since March 2022. Could the FA Cup offer guidance?Villa, a man down, sitting back on their advantage, asked Newcastle to play through them. Initially, that did not come easy. More outrage followed when Digne handled in the box. It was plumb, and yet Kavanagh and his assistant Nick Greenhalgh ruled the offence outside. At least there was summary justice as Tonali clattered in the rebound of the resultant, errant free-kick to equalise. “I’m fairly sure it was a penalty,” said Trippier, showing similar restraint to his manager. “But this is football, you have to react to disappointments and we did that.”Newcastle seized merrily on their hard-won momentum. Anthony Gordon threw back his mane in disgust at a chance missed. Dan Burn was grappled to the floor by Pau Torres in the Villa box. Play on, said Kavanagh, ears now burning at the ridicule aimed his way.Tonali’s second goal mirrored his first but was a yet sweeter hit, laid up by Burn. The withdrawal of Morgan Rogers and Douglas Luiz suggested surrender from Emery, as did the comedic defending from which Woltemade profited to score from close range.

A stunning Louis Reed free-kick completed a hard-fought turnaround for the League One side against their labouring Premier League opponents.There is little doubt thatBurnleyare getting relegated, leaving the Cup as their only hope of salvaging a desperate season, but they lacked quality from start to finish on another dispiriting day for Scott Parker.

After the promise of a first win in 17 Premier League games against Crystal Palace in midweek, the goodwill that earned was lost at a frustrated Turf Moor. With relegation almost a certainty, taking the Cup seriously could have salvaged something amid the misery but it created more.“Certainly when you come off the back of a result that we had in midweek, you probably dampen the noise around the place a little bit.” Parker said. “You come into this game wanting to get a result and keep that momentum and we’ve just applied that noise even more now, tenfold and rightly so.”There were nine changes from Selhurst Park and Burnley never found a rhythm. It puts Parker’s role under scrutiny because the football is not worth watching and if they cannot get past a mid-table third tier side at home, then he might not be the long-term solution. The chair, Alan Pace, called for the fans’ “anger and frustration” to be turned into support, an indication not all is well at Turf Moor, with this result only increasing the upset.View image in fullscreenLouis Reed curls home Mansfield’s winner from 25 yards.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersBefore the break, Burnley could have been out of sight. Ashley Barnes missed from close range and Loum Tchaouna lost all composure to fire over from inside the box but at least Josh Laurent gave the hosts the lead. It was a rare moment of quality on an afternoon of scrappy football. Lyle Foster and Tchaouna exchanged passes on the edge of the box, before Laurent put the goalkeeper on the floor and rolled the ball into an empty net.Mansfield failed to threaten in the first half, offering endeavour but without possessing the necessary skill to cause the Burnley backline problems. They got the ball out to the wings with great regularity but the crosses invariably did not reach their targets. “We said: ‘You need to be better,’” Garner said, “‘because you haven’t done your jobs.’ That’s what we told them: ‘Just be a little bit better, put some more crosses in the box, test them, and we’ll see what happens.’ Sometimes the players do listen to you and actually do what you tell them to do.”Things changed after the break as Burnley’s stumbling performance became an outright collapse. Hjalmar Ekdal fell over 30 yards from his own goal, allowing Oates to have a one-on-one with the goalkeeper, but he scooped the ball over the bar. It was not the finish Mansfield wanted but it was the first sign of hope.Oates did not make the same mistake again. Kyle Knoyle found space on the right and sent a pinpoint cross to the back post, where the forward was waiting. He rose above Laurent, wanting to win the header more, leaving Max Weiss at a standstill, as the silence of a half-full Turf Moor was interrupted.Mansfield were happy to turn the match into a battle, with Oates earning a war wound when Florentino Luís kicked him above the eye, to give away a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Reed stepped up and whipped the ball into the top corner for a first victory over a top-flight club since 1969. “As soon as it left my boot I felt it going in,” the captain said. “I have been working on them throughout the week. The lads said: ‘This is your moment, go and take it.’ Thankfully, I did.”Cue delirium in the away end, a noise that was repeated at full-time, even drowning out the boos of the few home supporters that stayed.Explore more on these topicsFA CupBurnleyMansfieldmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Bees are moving from mid-table stalwarts to European hopefuls.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesInside footballBrentfordKeith Andrews’s gravity-defying miracle has Brentford dreaming of EuropeJonathan WilsonTheir best players and managers may move on, but this thoroughly modern club keep punching above their weightSat 14 Feb 2026 15.00 ESTShareWhen the news cycle spins so fast, it’s worth remembering whereBrentfordwere in the summer. They had lost their popular manager of seven years, Thomas Frank. They had lost their two best forwards, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. They had lost their goalkeeper Mark Flekken. And they had lost two stalwarts in Christian Nørgaard and Ben Mee (even if the latter’s involvement the previous season had been limited as he turned 35). Departure and replacement is an unavoidable part of life for a club such as Brentford, but this seemed a like a lot to deal with.Their summer signings were hard to judge. As a rule of thumb, if Brentford are signing someone about whom you already have considered opinions, it’s likely something has gone awry. That said, Caoimhín Kelleher’s gifts are clear, and a fee of just under £13m seemed good value for a goalkeeper with Premier League experience, while Dango Ouattara had demonstrated at Bournemouth how effective he could be either through the middle or out wide. But Antoni Milambo, Michael Kayode and Kaye Furo were unknown quantities.But the biggest unknown was the manager – or, at least, it was unknown how effective Keith Andrews would be as a manager. Part of the issue with his credibility was that he was so familiar from his (excellent) television work. There’s always a degree of scepticism when a member of the backroom staff steps up, but it’s magnified when everyone recognises him as the Championship punditry bloke off Sky Sports.‘He would fill you with confidence’: how Liam Rosenior made his mark at HullRead moreA manager is supposed to have an aura, a mystique, to come from an elevated land with great wisdom to impart. He’s not meant to be readily pictured leaning forward on the Friday-night sofa to speak with eloquence and earnestness about West Brom’s pressing triggers or the deficiencies of Middlesbrough’s offside trap.It was entirely reasonable in August to fear for Brentford. They have the lowest wage bill in the Premier League. Their repeated mid-table finishes are a miracle of defying gravity. With so many key elements in their recent successes departed and a new manager with no frontline experience, doubt was logical. Yet, afterThursday’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal, they sit seventh in the table, 16 points clear of the relegation zone, surely safe, and dreaming of European qualification.Brentford have beaten Liverpool, Manchester United and Aston Villa and taken points off Chelsea and Arsenal at home. And if they win at Macclesfield in the FA Cup on Monday, they will be in the fifth round for only the third time since theyreached the last eightin 1989. It’s unlikely they will match their fifth-place finish in 1936, but a best postwar season of eighth or higher is attainable.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Igor Thiago shoots past Sunderland’s Robin Roefs. His 17 goals so far have filled the gap left by  the absence of Mbeumo and Wissa.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSo what’s gone right? Most obviously, there is Igor Thiago and his 17 goals this season. Injury restricted the Brazilian to one league start in 2024-25, but his potency this campaign has meant the absence of Mbeumo and Wissa has barely been noticed. Brentford’s capacity to identify talent remains extraordinary. It’s true that he scored 18 goals for Club Brugge in the season before he moved, but plenty of forwards have been rampant in a second-tier European league without being able to replicate that in the Premier League.There’s Kayode, perhaps the best exponent of the long throw in a league obsessed by them, as was underlined again against Arsenal. There’s Kevin Schade, whose pace makes him a tremendous threat on the break. There’s the relentlessness of Keane Lewis-Potter. There’s Nathan Collins, a fine old-fashioned centre-back.There’s Mikkel Damsgaard, slight and cerebral, more wispy academic than modern-day midfielder, but an adept unlocker of massed rearguards – when he gets the chance; Andrews often prefers a more physical option. There’s Vitaly Janelt, one of those more physical midfield options, gobbling up possession and distributing calmly.But there is also Andrews. It’s clear the structures at Brentford are exceptional, a point only emphasised by Frank’s struggles after stepping outside that environment, but that doesn’t mean success is automatic.Talking about his “word of the week” in pre-season may have seemed uncomfortably like Andrews had spent too much time on LinkedIn or was looking for a gig hosting one of those podcasts in which plausible people explain that you too could be as successful as them, if only you spent 20% less time sleeping and 12% more rubbing ice cubes over your sinuses while sipping a smoothie made of horse placenta, but it seems to have worked. Given Liam Rosenior’s evident popularity with the Chelsea squad, maybe it’s time to accept that the era of the brusque football man with his simple tastes (steak and chips, Spain, Billy Joel) is over and the epoch of players as wannabe CEOs is upon us.However he’s done it, Andrews has created a side that are quick and direct, as dangerous on the counterattack as any in the Premier League. Igor Thiago is part of that, one of the most effective of the new wave of No 9s, a striker who causes central defenders physical problems.Brentford are capable of sitting deep and absorbing pressure in a low block but, as is the modern way, also able to press hard and high when required. They are a threat from set plays, not only Kayode’s throws but also corners. And they are physical and motivated enough to win more than their fair share of duels.There is something very modern about Brentford. But that’s not just about style of play, it’s about what they are. What is the next stage? Perhaps they can dream of a Cup run or European qualification, butCrystal Palace offer a warningof how quickly that sort of success can turn sour. The modern stratification of football means no matter how sensibly a club are run there are ceilings through which they cannot pass.Brentford cannot deny gravity for ever. Their best players will move on and so too will their managers. But they are denying it now and they should enjoy it while they can. The doubts at the start of the season were understandable enough, but that only highlights how remarkable Brentford are.Explore more on these topicsBrentfordInside footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Or was she?Now back in Texas, albeit with a different coach to the one she left last summer, Asher-Smith has spent the winter, during which she turned 30, running with notably renewed vigour. A few swift early-season performances paved the way for this first appearance at the UK Indoor Championships in a decade, and a return to her throne looked a certainty from the moment she stepped on the Birmingham track on Saturday.A time of 7.17sec in the heats preceded 7.11 in the semi-finals and then an utterly dominant 7.05 – a championship record – to triumph in the final, well clear of Hunt, who clocked 7.15 for silver. The winning time was the third-quickest of Asher-Smith’s career. Who thought it wise to suggest the best might be behind her?“I’ve learned so much about myself over the past few years,” she said. “I’m somebody who runs fast when I’m happy. I’m really enjoying training in this environment, but most importantly I’ve got to be happy in myself. I think you’re seeing that.“Last year was very tough. But I’ve changed as a person, and I think I gained a lot of confidence from that because to be disappointed that I didn’t medal [at the world championships] when you have training disruptions like that … I was just proud that psychologically I could handle it.”She will now head to next month’s World Indoor Championships in Poland, alongside Hunt, whose strongest suit remains over longer sprint distances. “Obviously, it’s not nice to lose to one of your biggest rivals, so I’m slightly frustrated,” Hunt said. “But on the plus side, we are getting a lot more consistent. For me to be frustrated with a 7.15 shows how far I have come in the last 12 months.“No one still expects anything from me in the 60s, so I get to go out there and just have fun. If I can keep this momentum rolling, I will be super happy.”Asher-Smith’s winning margin was significantly greater than in the men’s equivalent, in which reigning world and European 60m champion Jeremiah Azu had to fight to the line to see off Romell Glave, clocking 6.56 to the silver medallist’s 6.62.View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson in Birmingham but she is now setting her sights on the 800m world record.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe day’s leading performance emerged from what effectively became a first-round time trial. With the British selection policy for the World Indoor Championships merely requiring athletes to turn up and compete here in Birmingham, Keely Hodgkinson had announced earlier in the week that she would contest only the 800m heats and not Sunday’s final.With only one opportunity to impress, the Olympic champion produced a phenomenal solo performance to break her own British indoor record with a winning time of 1min 56.33sec, the third-fastest indoor time in history.Instead of lining up for the final, she will take on a high-class field next week at a meeting in France, where she has her sights set on breaking the world record of 1:55.82 that was set on the day she was born – 3 March 2002.“I have high hopes for next week,” she said. “I’ve been trying to get it for years. I think I’m very capable of doing it. I’ve had my healthiest winter in years, I haven’t missed a single thing, and I think that shows it. I feel like it’s destined to be mine – I feel like it would be great if I can break it.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDina Asher-SmithnewsShareReuse this content"

England won by five wickets and, though it was ultimately emphatic, it was not exactly a rediscovery of peak form, even if Tom Banton located his with the 41-ball 63 that powered his team to victory.“We haven’t made it as easy as we would have liked so far but hopefully we can have a slightly easier run starting with Italy on Monday,” the captain Harry Brook said. “We haven’t played our best cricket yet but we’re in a strong position. World Cups aren’t always smooth sailing. We’d rather not start amazing and finish amazing than start amazing and finish bad.”England left with no margin for error after defeat by West Indies at T20 World CupRead moreScotland built half an excellent innings at the beginning of the match, but it careered downhill at Winter Olympic pace in its third quarter and, for all that they continued to show flashes of quality, they were unable to recover. “The dressing room is hurting a little bit,” said their captain, Richie Berrington, who top-scored for his side with 49 off 32.“We had a lot of belief going into that game. If we played our best cricket, executed our skills, we were right in there with a chance. We showed that for a large part of the game. It has reinforced the message that when we execute our skills for long enough we can put any team under pressure and mix with the best.”Scotland faced two helpings of spin, each four overs long, and each brought carnage of a different kind: a barrage of runs in the first, a riot of wickets in the second. From there they were unable to produce a total to truly stretch England on a good batting wicket, even if Brook’s team did occasionally threaten to self-destruct.England’s opening partnership is in theory a strength but against both Nepal and Scotland Phil Salt and Jos Buttler have faltered. “There’s a long way to go in this tournament,” Brook said, “and if they get firing at the right time then we’ll be in a really good place.”They put the team in an awkward one here, Salt driving straight to point having scored only two, and Buttler going only one better – even if he became just the fourth player to score 4,000 runs in T20 internationals in the process – before he sent a leading edge looping into the hands of mid-off.View image in fullscreenScotland’s Bradley Wheal (left) walks past Will Jacks and Tom Banton after England’s victory.Photograph: Bikas Das/APBanton and Jacob Bethell eventually added 66 from 45 for the third wicket but they were initially determined to bring little more than calm, and this became the first time in 16 years that England failed to score a boundary in their first four overs of a T20 innings. But Scotland’s score was sufficiently small that one big over would send the required run rate plummeting and it came in the ninth, Mark Watt’s first, in which Banton deposited each of the first three legal deliveries into the stands, and from there it quickly became less a chase than a stroll.Scotland’s innings had been derailed when Jofra Archer took two wickets in its third over, but Berrington rebuilt alongside Michael Jones (33 off 20), before a partnership of 71 off 42 with Tom Bruce saw the team stride towards a genuinely competitive score. But having romped to 48 runs in the first four overs of spin they faced, everything changed when Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson returned.The transformation was not quite immediate, and Berrington hit the second ball of Dawson’s comeback high over the head of long-off for six. But then, from nowhere, there was chaos. In the space of 22 balls of unbroken spin, and, despite the fact that few deliveries actually did much spinning, Scotland lost five wickets for just 15 runs. And that, there, was the match.England now know that victory over Italy on Monday will secure a place in the Super Eights; Scotland are not out yet, but may be by the time they face Nepal in their final group fixture on Tuesday. “We’ll just have to wait and see what happens,” said Berrington. “We can’t look too far ahead but our focus is going to be on how we move on from this game. There’s a lot of positives to take from the cricket we’ve played in the last three games.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026England cricket teamScotland Cricket TeamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Cold, yes, and a grey day by kick-off, but bright enough to throw light on an Ireland side scrambling for their footing, and a bullish Italy one looking to break new ground.Neither quite worked out. Never having won aSix Nationsgame in Dublin might be the sort of statistic to weigh you down but theAzzurricarried it here like a backpack with only a couple of bits and bobs. What they achieved was to give the Championship a highly competitive performance that was heartening, but not worthy of a note in history.Ireland 20-13 Italy: Six Nations rugby union – liveRead moreAs for Ireland, Andy Farrell shaped the narrative all week with his declaration that intent was a non-negotiable. He got that in spades in the endgame when his team were throwing themselves under blue buses trying to batter a route to the Irish line. In a very physical, narky Test match that was always watchable, the shortage of some extra guile – exhaustion had to be a factor – was Italy’s undoing as they tried to square the game. But when Farrell was backing his players into a corner he expected them to fight their way out of it, and finish with a knockout.Did he factor in a winning bonus point? The context there was that with the clock already in the red Ireland were defending very well to hang on to their seven-point lead. Suddenly that shifted into a different race: a sprint towards a bonus point. It ended with them settling for what they had and putting the ball out of play.By then the positives were topped by Robert Baloucoune picking up the man-of-the-match award; Edwin Edogbo making his debut with a suitably stubborn shift; and Ireland’s nightmare in the air, where France had shot them down from start to finish in round one, was turned into a reasonable dream.Farrell was quick to point out the quality of Baloucoune’s try, which put Ireland seven points clear with the last quarter to come. Yes, it was ambitious and creative and a cracking finish from the wing.“Jack was at the forefront of that as well,” Farrell said of Crowley. “I thought he played outstandingly well when he came on.”View image in fullscreenGiacomo Nicotera’s try gave Italy a half-time lead.Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesThe coach can’t have missed the reception the Bandon man got from the crowd when he replaced Sam Prendergast in the second half. In Ireland’s continuing and heat-generating debate over who should have the keys to No 10, this will be seen by some as a successful rescue mission. As ever, Prendergast shuffled with ease through his very impressive passing game, only to do himself in with two missed conversions that should be bread and butter to goal-kickers in Test rugby. The momentum Ireland got from Crowley was unmissable, however.So was their struggle at the scrum, putting together a sequence of three penalties conceded in a row between the end of the first half – which Italy finished 10-5 ahead courtesy of Giacomo Nicotera’s try and a Paolo Garbisi conversion and penalty – and the start of the second. The away team would have been happier still to wrap the first period further ahead for Craig Casey was in the bin and they were camped in Ireland’s 22.Quick GuideIreland 20-13 Italy teams and scorersShowIrelandOsborne; Baloucoune, Ringrose, McCloskey, Lowe; Prendergast (J Crowley 56), Casey (J Gibson-Park 52); Loughman (T O’Toole 67), Sheehan (R Kelleher 52), Clarkson (T Furlong ht), McCarthy (T Beirne 52), Ryan (E Edogbo 70), Izuchukwu (N Timoney 58), Doris (capt), Conan.Yellow cardCasey 32.TriesOsborne, Conan, Balacoune.PenCrowley.ConCrowley.ItalyPani; Lynagh, Menoncello, Marin, Ioane; Garbisi, Fusco (A Garbisi 63); Fischetti (M Spagnolo 58), Nicotera (D di Bartolomeo 58), Ferrari (M Hasa 58), N Cannone (R Favretto 67), Zambonin (F Ruzza 61), Lamaro (capt), Zuliani, L Cannone.Yellow cardLynagh 11.TryNicotera.PenP Garbisi.Con: P Garbisi.Referee:H Davidson (Sco).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Equally Ireland started the second half so well, with a try from Jack Conan to square the game, they might have thought the hard part was over. What followed next was acutely difficult for them as Italy forced them to exit three times in a row before Louis Lynagh got over in the corner. It was ruled out, correctly, for a forward pass.The relief turned into elation five minutes later when Baloucoune did his thing and Crowley succeeded where Prendergast had failed in adding the extras. Again we thought Italy might fold, but again they came back for more, always threatening at the scrum, always willing to carry, always willing to try and win rather than settle for just hanging on.A losing bonus point for them was certainly better than an empty space on the points ledger, but for their hosts it was less than they needed before next week’s trip to Twickenham.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Ireland rugby union teamItaly rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Opinion on who is likely to finish 12th changes daily.There is a hefty caveat to the threat for those sweating at the bottom, withnext season’s league expansionmeaning no team face an automatic drop. Instead, 12th will face a playoff against the third-placed team in WSL2 for a chance to remain in the top division.Upsets in women’s football are rare. With professionalism in its infancy, a WSL team are less likely to lose to a second-tier club than a fifth-tier men’s side are to beat Premier League opponents. The chances of a WSL2 team beating the WSL’s worst side have historically been slim. However, with investment in WSL2 on the rise, three promotion places having proved an enticing carrot, a playoff fixture that previously would have been a foregone conclusion could be quite competitive.As it stands, that WSL2 team would be Bristol City, with their fresh investment from Mercury 13, but they have Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Southampton on their heels, Newcastle with a game in hand. Charlton, the leaders, and Birmingham fill the top two places. None of those teams would be easy to beat, particularly after a bruising season and its impact on the morale of the lowest WSL side.Quick GuideManchester City power on in Women's Super LeagueShowWSL: Manchester City 6-0 Leicester CityVivianne Miedema scored a first-half double as leaders Manchester City eased to a 6-0 Women's Super League victory over the bottom side Leicester.A ruthless first-half display saw City score four goals in 16 minutes when Khadija Shaw nodded home and Miedema scored twice in quick succession before Yui Hasegawa's strike gave the league leaders a 4-0 advantage at half-time.Kerolin and Aoba Fujino both struck after the break to leave Leicester at the foot of the table with a fourth-straight loss and City climb 11 points clear of second-placed Manchester United, who play London City Lionesses on Sunday.PA MediaPhotograph: Charlotte Tattersall/WSL FootballWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This weekend has already begun badly for Leicester after their 6-0 Friday-night mauling at City. Liverpool, just one place above the Foxes, take a daunting trip to Chelsea.Gareth Taylor’s side drew with the champions in the reverse fixture but the 9-1 revenge of the Blues in their League Cup quarter-final speaks to the eradication of any complacency.Concerns for Liverpool have lessened a little after a strong January on and off the pitch, with Taylor named WSL manager of the month and four permanent signings and three loanees coming through the door, including Denise O’Sullivan from North Carolina Courage and the goalkeeper Jennifer Falk on loan from Häcken. Taylor has a bigger and better squad, in theory enough to keep them in the league. After this weekend they have their best opportunity to pick up the points needed to secure WSL survival, with Leicester, Brighton, Everton and West Ham their opponents before tough matches against Manchester City and Arsenal conclude their season.For Leicester things are less rosy. The team are winless in 2026 and have scored only one goal, in a 2-1 loss to West Ham. The showdown against Liverpool on 15 March could have a huge say in where both teams finish. Rick Passmore’s side looked good in their 2-0 loss to Manchester United and caused the Champions League side real problems but, despite five signings in January, climbing off the bottom looks a big ask.View image in fullscreenMidfielder Denise O’Sullivan is one of a number of arrivals to bolster Liverpool’s squad.Photograph: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesEverton host West Ham on Sunday with a chance to pull away. Both teams are in good form, the Hammers having come from two goals down against Brighton to secure a thrilling 3-2 win in the final eight minutes of last Sunday’s game. Before that came a narrow loss to Tottenham and a win over Leicester.Their manager, Rita Guarino, appointed at the start of the winter break, has six points from a possible 12, more than half of their tally of 11. Three of Shekiera Martinez’s six goals have come in the past three games and there is energy to their play. There is no doubtthe exit of Rehanne Skinnerand fresh eyes of Guarino have made a difference. Despite Skinner operating for much of her tenure with both hands tied behind her back through a lack of meaningful support from the club, eventually the toll of that causes fractures. New players also help shift a spiralling mood, and the January recruitment of Ria Bose from Sporting Tuva Hansen from Bayern Munich, Ylinn Tennebø from Vålerenga and loan deals for Juventus’s Estelle Cascarino and Katie Zelem from London City Lionesses have contributed to the quality on the pitch and the dynamics and morale off it.Everton’s turnaround has been less easy to pinpoint. The managerBrian Sørensen’s departurethe day after their first home win was unusual timing, with the transfer window also in the rear-view mirror. Scott Phelan has come across from Everton’s Under-18s to take interim charge and earned a surprise win over London City in his first game, putting the club in a strong position. However, with only three loan additions in January (Hannah Blundell from Manchester United, Laila Harbert from Arsenal and Zara Kramzar from Roma) and others around them having recruited well, whether they will be able to maintain this new wind is the big question.It is impossible to say who is likely to finish bottom and that is what makes this a race to watch.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Theironyis hard to escape: as the prime minister is embroiled in the scandal of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and now hisformer aide’s linksto a sex offender, MPs are defending him on a platform that has in thepast monthallowed users tocreate sexualised imagesof women and girls.This says something about the unprecedented way in which X has been tied to modern politics since it was still known as Twitter, as well as how widespread the culture of indifference is to the violation of female bodies, both online and off. But it also points to a growing dilemma facing not just politicians, but all of us: is it possible to post ethically on social media any more? And when is it time to log off?It seems as though every major social-media platform has been contaminated to some degree. Since Elon Musk bought X, on top of deepfakes ofsexually explicit images, the site’s algorithm has ramped up itsboosting ofrightwingcontent, with Musk himself posting about how the white race was “rapidly dying” and other extreme views on race almostevery day of January. Facebook, longaccusedof mass data collection and involvement inRussia-backedelection interference,dumped fact-checkersweeks before Donald Trump’s second term. Instagram, also owned by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, was found toknowinglybe making teenage girls’ body images worse. And TikTok has been criticised for“exploiting” children, with under-13s exposed to self-harm content alongside dance crazes.The Guardian’srevelationthis week that Substack – the publishing forum some progressives fled to after other sites shifted rightwards – is making money from hosting Nazi newsletters sums up the no-win situation social-media users find themselves in. Substack, which has up to 50 million users worldwide, was found to be platforming writers espousing white supremacy, Holocaust denial and antisemitism, including an activist who described Adolf Hitler as “one of the greatest men of all time”. It’s all very 2026, isn’t it? Or 1936.Still, none of this would be as disturbing if the disgust wasn’t accompanied by a pull to keep posting. There are very real reasonsso many of us have failed to delete the apps, and not just because our dopamine-hungry brains have been trained to reach for our phones every five seconds. Over the past 15 years, for good or ill, social media has become a key way of connecting with others that – if we’re honest – many of us would struggle to fully break. That’s even more the case for marginalised groups, such asdisabled people, who are more likely to rely on online networks for socialising and practical help. Just as it’s simpler to take the moral stand to cancel Prime if you can get to the shops with ease, it’s much easier to “get off socials” if you can walk up the stairs to your friend’s flat, feel safe in an LGBT+ bar or afford a round at the pub.Social media can also be a literal lifeline for oppressed people, from Palestinians using Bluesky to crowdfund for food and medicine, to the lawyer of aprotester in Irannotifying the world of their imprisonment. That is the absurdity of social media now: the same platforms that let some users scroll mindlessly to see what colour Stacey Solomon is painting her kitchen enable others to track andescape Israeli bombing. Often, we are in the surreal state of witnessing both through our screens at once.Australia’s social media ban gives kids an opportunity to experience what millennials long for | Jodi WilsonRead moreThere is a deep irony in the fact the platforms we seek escapism in are increasingly the most glaring demonstrations of the very darkness we wish to avoid. On the rare occasions I check my X account, I am usually greeted within seconds by (in no particular order): racism, pro-Trump posts, anti-benefit/eugenist rhetoric, Islamophobia, AI images and/or naked women. Perhaps as damaging as the content itself is the (quite false) feeling that this small corner of the internet is somehow representative of the country or humanity at large. There are few more successful ways for bad actors to keep resistance low than exhausting good people into thinking the battle is already lost.There will be those in politics and public bodies who genuinely believe platforms such as X and Facebook help them reach the electorate, not least in an era when many older and disenfranchised people get their news – and plenty of fake news – from social media. There is certainly some truth in that. And yet theMandelsonand Downing Street aide scandals, much like the government using X to defend them, are a reminder of how the very worst behaviour quickly becomes normalised when it is, at minimum, being tacitly condoned by those in power. If Starmer wishes to show his government’s disdain for sexual abuse or the far right, logging off X would be a good start. Public opinion of politicians – and the current Labour party – is in the gutter. It seems unlikely that it will improve by them tweeting from it.Personally, I’d just like to post a photo of my dog without coming into contact with a Nazi. I’m not sure that’s the snowflake demandMusk and co want us to think it is.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a redefinition of itLisa PortolanLove has long been framed as a pursuit of the young, but this narrative lags behind realitySat 14 Feb 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 21.38 ESTShareAs Valentine’s Day approached we were once again flooded with the usual suspects: roses, chocolates, sophisticated dinners and glossy ads featuring young heterosexual couples staring earnestly into each other’s eyes. The problem isn’t just that this version of romance is exclusionary – though it is. It’s that it’s profoundly out of step with how love is actuallybeinglived, negotiated and reimagined in contemporary Australia.Culturally, love has long been framed as a pursuit of the young. From Romeo and Juliet to Normal People, from Bridget Jones to When Harry Met Sally, romantic fulfilment is depicted as something you secure early; ideally before your knees give out or your mortgage locks in. The message is consistent: find love in your 20s or 30s, settle down, and then coast (emotionally paired and narratively complete) until death do you part.That story no longer holds (if it ever truly did).In Australia, people over 50 areone of the fastest-growing cohorts actively seeking love– or, at the very least, rethinking what intimacy, partnership and companionship might look like in the second half of life. This shift isn’t marginal, it’s structural.Boyfriends are cringe. But is the #boysober trend a feminist reclamation or a neoconservative tilt? | Lisa PortolanRead moreResearch shows that close to a third of Australian divorces now occur after the age of 50; a phenomenon known as“grey divorce”. While overall divorce rateshave declinedsince their 1990s peak, separations among over-50s have bucked that trend. Empty nest syndrome, financial pressures and retirement adjustments are all major drivers but beneath these factors lies something deeper: a recalibration of expectations about happiness, fulfilment and selfhood later in life. For many, the end of a long marriage isn’t a failure. It’s a reset.This is where our cultural narratives lag behind reality.In my research on dating, gender and intimacy, I found that ideas about love remain stubbornlytemporal. There is still a perceived “right” time to marry, a sense that one should sow wild oats before settling down in one’s late 20s or early 30s. Miss that window and the language turns anxious: you’ve “missed the boat”, done things “out of order” or fallen behind the life schedule.For people dating in their 50s and beyond, that temporal anxiety is amplified. They are acutely aware that they are out of sync with the story they were promised and yet, paradoxically, often far more intentional about what they want.What became clear in my research is that older Australians come to love differently. Many women in their 50s, in particular, are seeking connection and companionship without cohabitation. They are reluctant to merge households, unwilling to take on unpaid caring roles for a new partner, and wary of financial entanglements that could jeopardise hard-won stability. This isn’t emotional coldness, it’s structural realism.After decades of gendered labour – caregiving, part-time work or interrupted careers – many women enter later life with less superannuation, fewer assets and greater financial vulnerability. Add to this rising rates of homelessness among older women and the romantic ideal of “starting over” through shared property or pooled finances begins to look less like love and more like a risk.Men and women do not arrive at later-life dating on equal footing, and pretending otherwise only reinforces outdated ideals of romance that no longer serve anyone.Then there’s the dating landscape itself. For many over-50s, dating apps arrived suddenly and without warning; a brutal technological intervention into a world where courtship once involved friends, workplaces and chance encounters. For some, apps offered an unexpected abundance: a buffet of possibility, a way back into desire. For others, the swipe-and-discard logic felt alienating, even dehumanising, a sharp departure from slower and relational forms of connection.Still, people adapt.What’s striking is that despite the upheaval, many older Australians report being content on their own. More than half say they are satisfied with single life, particularly women, who cite independence, peace and personal space as key benefits. This doesn’t signal a retreat from love. It signals a redefinition of it.We’re already seeing cultural green shoots. Programs like The Golden Bachelor have drawn large Australian audiences, suggesting a hunger for romantic stories that don’t centre youth. More broadly, as generation X moves into its 50s and 60s – the same generation that rebranded parenting, ageing and even grandparenthood (goodbye “Grandma”, hello “Gigi”), it’s unlikely they’ll accept inherited scripts about love without revision.Love is about to be shaken up again.The challenge now is to let our cultural narratives catch up with our social realities. Love doesn’t expire at 40. Romance isn’t invalidated by divorce. Intimacy doesn’t have to mean cohabitation, financial merger or lifelong sacrifice. For a growing proportion of Australians, love in later life is about alignment rather than aspiration, companionship rather than completion.Love doesn’t belong to the young, and the sooner we rebrand it the better off we’ll all be.Lisa Portolan is an academic.

Nobody needs ‘autumn oven gloves’Sat 14 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 10.27 ESTShareIt’s Valentine’s Day, which means you should have spent the last few weeks swapping all of the lamps in your house. If not, you still have a few hours: box up your beige lampshades (or better yet, throw them in the bin) and replace them with ones of red and pink hues. Then – if you want to feel mentally well – you must also change your lightbulbs, because “warm white lighting” is the best way to ensure your crimson decor doesn’t look “too harsh”.This is according to online lighting company Pooky, which is selling 43 “lust-worthy lamps” (and shades) for Valentine’s Day. A press release sent on behalf of the brand in late January proudly declared that Google searches for “seasonal decor” have increased 70% year-on-year globally, while queries about “Valentine’s decor” have soared 2,584% since the start of 2026. “The beauty of seasonal lighting,” said Pooky’s chief creative officer, “is that it’s easy to rotate. Store one or two Valentine lampshades, a set of rose-tinted bulbs and a handful of candles in a labelled box, and you can transform your home every February in minutes.”View image in fullscreenIndoor Halloween decorations in a family home.Photograph: thelittlegreyartist/AlamyThat’s all very well and good, but what if my “lusty lighting” box won’t fit next to the plastic tubs holding my “autumn oven gloves”, “Halloween curtain rods” and “Easter rugs”? Wouldn’t it be faster – better, even – to join the62% of Britonswho simply throw perfectly good homeware in the bin? After all, how else will I find the time on 16 March to swap from my Mother’s Day to St Patrick’s Day decor?Can I just ask: what are we doing?More than a quarterof Britons feel homeware trends are “changing at an increasingly fast pace”, and 70m items of home decorare thrown awayevery year. I’ll concede there are some things worth destroying the planet for (flying! We literally get to fly across the sky!), but surely not this? Surely we can all agree that the climate apocalypse isn’t a fair exchange for a “brown resin Valentines dog ornament” wearing heart-shaped glasses and a little pink bow? (It’s uglier than you think, please do not click.)It’s not that seasonal decor can never make sense. It’s the balm we’ve sought during the cost of living crisis, when many people find it too expensive to go out, and home is where the heart-shaped frying pan is. Socialising is costlier than ever, but novelty ceramics have seemingly never been cheaper. And it’s understandable that we want our living spaces to be cosy and calm when the world outside is anything but.But leaving aside the harm to the planet – and how often we do! – “fast homeware” is full of false promises. In the 41,000 TikTok videostagged“seasonal decor” (plus countless others hashtagged #autumnaesthetic or #springvibes), influencers promise that swapping out your homeware can boost your mood, spark joy and even “heal your soul”. For years, marketers and content creators have savvily used the names of happiness hormones to conflate shopping and personal wellbeing. TK Maxx has a page on its website called Dopamine Home Decor (under the umbrella of Home Seasonal Events).I hate to be the one to tell you this, but a spring-themed bath mat is not going to markedly improve your mental health. In reality, overconsumption has been repeatedly linked to lower wellbeing and evenpsychological distress. Personally, I know that the buzz of buying something is often quickly replaced with an empty sensation and a desire for more – the satisfaction somehow never seems to last.View image in fullscreen‘The year-round demand for novelty is not going anywhere any time soon.’Photograph: Pixel-shot/AlamyPlus, there are faster and cheaper ways to get a dose of dopamine (music, meditation and especially volunteering, for a start). And if you’re an aesthete, never fear! I actually know a fantastic little designer who redecorates seasonally, free of charge. Her name is mother nature, and she also swaps out the bulbs.Of course, I’m fighting a losing battle: online content creators must create content and supermarkets must generate ever-increasing profits, so the year-round demand for novelty is not going anywhere any time soon. If I can’t beat them, maybe I should join them – and charge for my ideas (a jester’s-hat butter dish for April Fools’ Day; an Ash Wednesday kettle). Or maybe I have one last trick up my sleeve to make you reconsider: think of your grandma’s home.She never swapped out the lamps – the things on her coffee table were the things onhercoffee table, collected over the course of a lifetime, consistent while you grew and changed. That stained, stainless steel teapot spoke to you from a different era; it showed you the world existed before you existed, it promised that things could endure after you were gone. Isn’t there meaning and happiness to be found in consistent homeware, in a home that reflects your personality, and in a personality that’s unwavering in the face of marketing trends? Wait, no.

The redundancies that were announced to staff on a video call, the axing of half its foreign bureau (including the war reporter in Ukraine) – not sinceP&O Ferrieshave layoffs been handled so badly. Former Post stalwartPaul Farhidescribed a decisionthat affected nearly half of the 790-strong workforce as “the biggest one-day wipeout of journalists in a generation”.Whyit happened is still baffling, at least for anyone not inside the head of one of the world’s richest men. Marty Baron, the Post’s former editor,highlightedthe owner’s “sickening” efforts to curry favour with Donald Trump in a “case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction”.Slate magazine, owned by the Graham family (previous owners of the Post),accused Bezosof “accelerating the [Post’s] decline on purpose” because of “external economic interests” such as Amazon and Blue Origin, his space business. Perhaps he agreed to savage cuts because it showed he really was the boss, or just because he could. In any case, his ownership of the Washington Post is yet more proof, if needed, that owning a newspaper is not about money; it’s about power and influence. In other words, it’s about politics.Washington Post editor acknowledges ‘genuine trauma’ over mass layoffsRead moreBezos, with his $266bn fortune,doesn’t need the moneythat a newspaper might bring in; his interest payouts make the Washington Post’s $100mannual losseslook like a rounding error. When he bought the paper in 2013, the age of Obama, Bezos splashed the cash on bonuses for reporters, used one of his private jets tocollectreporter Jason Rezaian from an Iranian jail and travelled to Istanbul tomake a speechabout murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Then, in the first age of Trump, who made no secret of his dislike for a paper known for bringing down corrupt presidents, Amazonlosta $10bn government computing contract. The resulting lawsuitblamed“improper pressure from President Donald J Trump … to harm his perceived political enemy – Jeffrey P Bezos”. (The US Department of Defense defended its selection process, saying there were no external influences.)The ability of Trump to use other means to flood the zone – social media run by himself or his big-tech pals – has made him even more dangerous in his second coming.Last week’s news was the culmination of a new mood at the Post that started in 2024. Bezos hadappointedan outsider for the first time, the British journalist and media executive Will Lewis, to be publisher just as opinion polls started to suggest that Trump would become the 47th US president. In the runup to the election, Bezospulledthe Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, on the grounds that endorsements create distrust; and insisted on a more free market-friendly orientation in its opinion pages. The decisionled, within days, to almost 250,000 subscribers deserting the paper.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Washington Post attend a rally held by guild members outside its office building on 5 February 2026.Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/ShutterstockAnyway, all this seems to go to show that uber-wealthy owners in the news industry can’t be trusted to put private interests over the public good. Or, as the award-winning editor Tina Brownsays of the Post debacle: “The purpose of having fuck-you money is to say fuck you, but it seems the purpose of fuck-you money is to have more fuck-you money.” And if the pesky newspaper that burnishes your reputation hurts your ability to make fuck-you money? Kill it – or at least let it fade into managed irrelevance.So what are the alternatives? There has been no shortage of ideas among those who care about the future of journalism. One of my favourites is the suggestion that Bezos’s ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, could pair up with other first wives of big-tech billionaires, such as Melinda French Gates, and use their divorce payouts to support the Post instead of their other philanthropic causes.A better, though possibly just as unlikely, idea is for Bezos to erect some legal frameworks to protect editorial safeguards. The best guarantees are embedded into a trust-based ownership such as that enjoyed by the Guardian. He could just stick a tiny fraction of his planet-sized fortune into a trust and have nothing to do with it.The most likely scenario is the most depressing for anyone who cares about freedom of the press. The Post will simply do less and less of the great journalism that has seen it lauded with Pulitzer prizes, until eventually no one thinks of it as thepaper of Watergateany more.The crisis at theWashington Postmarks a turning point in this new age of disillusionment, an era in which the excitement of the early web has made way for shame and bewilderment at how much we lose by allowing the rich and powerful to kill the parts of society that make it function better.Jane Martinson is an academic and Guardian columnist.

The group includes police experts on sexual offending and is chaired by a gold commander, Louisa Rolfe, who was previously aMetropolitan policeassistant commissioner.One senior policing source said a “tsunami” of allegations was expected as a result of the release of millions of papers relating toJeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who trafficked women and had a network of powerful friends.The forces involved include Thames Valley police, which are assessing two separate claims against Mountbatten-Windsor and whether they merit a full criminal investigation, and Surrey police, which are assessing another allegation against the former prince.Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all wrongdoing.The Met, which is also part of the group, is criminally investigating Peter Mandelson for allegedly passing information to Epstein while a Labour government minister.Bedfordshire police were unable to say whether they were assessing claims that Luton airport, which is in the force’s area, was used by planes linked to Epstein to traffic women.Similarly, Essex police could not say whether they were assessing claims that Stansted airport had been used for such flights,with the former British prime minister Gordon Brownsaying police should take action.A spokesperson for the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council said: “A national coordination group has been set up to support a small number of forces assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the US DoJ [Department of Justice] Epstein files.“We continue to work collaboratively to assess the details being made public to allow us to understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been published.”The national coordination group is a measure similar tothat set upto deal with the explosion in sexual abuse allegations triggered by the Jimmy Savile scandal more than a decade ago. It is intended to avoid duplication in the handling of allegations involving the same individuals.Part of the group’s role is to make formal approaches to obtain the original unredacted documents from the US, rather than each police force having to make separate requests.As yet, it is not a national investigation and each force retains operation control. A source with knowledge of discussions said: “It is not a national operation, but it is heading in that direction. The feeling in policing is this is going to grow arms and legs.”The latest release of documents from the Epstein files a fortnight ago led to new revelations.The Thames Valley assessment covers claims that Mountbatten-Windsor used his position as a British trade envoy to potentially give sensitive information to Epstein. Claims that the former prince used his position as a British trade envoy to pass potentially sensitive information to Epstein are being examined by the force.They are also examining a claim that Epstein sent a second woman to the UK for sex with the former prince in Windsor in 2010.Another police source warned that the avalanche of allegations and revelations in the news media might not be enough to prompt full criminal investigations, let alone bring prosecutions: “Andrew may be a barefaced liar, but that does not mean he committed a criminal offence.”The Met has twice looked at sexual abuse allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor and decided they did not merit a full investigation.A spokesperson for Surrey police said: “A number of police forces are currently assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the FBI Epstein files.“As a result, nationally, policing is seeking access to unredacted versions of the material to enable a full and independent assessment of the information released. This will allow all forces to understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been made publicly available.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceJeffrey EpsteinAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorMetropolitan policeMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

So even though it didn’t happen immediately, I have faith that it’s going to happen quite soon. The ban has been proven unlawful from its inception so the fact that we haven’t been de-proscribed immediately – we can wait a little bit longer.”Saying that the government would appeal on Friday, Mahmood added: “The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament.”More than 500 of the 2,500-plus placard-holders have been charged under section 13 of the Terrorism Act but their cases have been delayed while the outcome of the judicial review was awaited. They took part in a civil disobedience campaign of mass protests defying the ban and earned a glowing tribute from Ammori.3:17‘Palestine Action is back’: Terror ban ruled unlawful | The View From - videoShe said: “It’s just been incredible, it’s been so inspiring and moving to see how many people have been inspired to resist this ban, to defy it.“When I first heard about the proscription going through, it’s just like a ton of bricks, and then when you see the amount of solidarity and support – it’s incredibly uplifting. And I won’t say ‘I think’ – I know this victory is in huge part thanks to them.”The judges described Palestine Action as “an organisation that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”, a definition seized on by Mahmood. But they found that, as such, most of its activities could be dealt with by criminal law, and did not amount to terrorism – meaning that proscribing the group could not be justified given the interference with protected rights.Ammori said winning on the free speech and right to protest ground – one of two on which she was successful – was important. If she had succeeded only on a procedural ground, such as the failure to consult Palestine Action before the ban,which was rejected by the judges, it would have been open to Mahmood to consult and still reach the same decision to proscribe.Owen Jones on Palestine Action high court win – The LatestRead moreBut the result was an emphatic one after months that Ammori said had taken a personal toll on her. “It’s not easy to be labelled or smeared as a terrorist, to see that something that was made and founded in order to disrupt the Israeli weapons industry, to stop the greatest crimes happening against the Palestinian people, can be labelled as a terrorist organisation,” she said.“I think with my background being Palestinian and Iraqi, it’s not the first time I would have had the kind of slur but I remember the first month or two, every time I heard the words terrorist organisation on a news programme, you can’t connect with that. It just makes you feel sick to your stomach to hear that’s how they describe Palestine Action.”Ultimately, she believes it was an own goal for a Labour government bent on destroying the organisation.“This has made Palestine Action a household name,” she said. “It has sparked outrage among thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands of people across the country and across the world and it has increased the support for direct action massively. It’s now proven that they did all this unlawfully, did all those arrests unlawfully. That’s a huge attack on people’s rights and I think that has massively backfired on them.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionUK criminal justiceHome OfficeProtestFreedom of speechShabana MahmoodIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Bruises and marks of severe physical assault remain on her body,” he added.Mohammadi was arrested before protests erupted nationwide later in December. The movement peaked in January, with authorities launching a crackdown that activists say has left thousands dead.Earlier this month she was handed a further six years in prison on charges of harming national security and a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda against Iran’s Islamic system. She also went on hunger strike for almost a week to protest the conditions of her detention.Over the past quarter of a century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her campaigning against Iran’s use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.She was born in Zanjan but is resident in Tehran. Her foundation said she had on two occasions during previous jail stints been transferred to Zanjan prison where she suffered ill treatment.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaNobel peace prizeProtestFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

No communication is recorded. No ransom has been paid. But the FBI has doubled the reward for information leading to an arrest to $100,000, offered a description of a man 5ft 9in or 5ft 10in tall with an average build, and given a description of a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker backpack he was wearing.“We hope this updated description will help concentrate the public tips we are receiving,” the FBI stated in the X post. The agency said it had collected more than 13,000 tips since Guthrie was taken from her home on 1 February.Donald Trump was asked Friday whether the drug cartels or potentially another “nation state” could be involved in Guthrie’s disappearance.“You can’t say that yet”, he responded outside the White House. “It’s a little bit early. But it’s somebody [who] either knew what they were doing very well, or they were rank amateurs. Either way, it’s not a good situation”.The Pima county sheriff’s department said it had fielded more than 18,000 calls and asked residents living near Guthrie’s home for video surveillance footage going back weeks. Then surveillance video circulated online of a man attempting to scale a wall five miles away, wearing similar clothes and backpack to a man seen in video recovered from the doorbell camera at Guthrie’s home on the night of the crime. Officialstold NBC Newsthat law enforcement officers had cleared the man.That video, recovered from Google archives, showed the presumed abductor, or an accomplice, in a ski mask and neoprene gloves carrying what appeared to be a pistol in an oddly placed holster, attempting to block the lens with vegetation from Guthrie’s garden.The black-and-white image of a masked man bearing flowers, described as a small “bouquet of weeds” by some observers, vividly gave form to the contours of deception and ill-intent playing out across the inhospitable terrain of the desert south-west.Soon after, delivery driver Carlos Palazuelos was detained during a traffic stop south of Tucson near the US-Mexico border. His home in Rio Rico was searched on a judge’s approval. Palazuelos, who was later released, told Telemundo that he didn’t recall delivering anything to Guthrie’s house, didn’t know who she is and wasn’t involved.View image in fullscreenMembers of the media remain outside Nancy Guthrie’s home in Tucson on Friday.Photograph: Ty ONeil/APThen there was a black glove found on a road, and one in Guthrie’s home. Rumors of a rift between local investigators and the FBI emerged after one was sent to a private crime lab in Florida and not to FBI headquarters in Virginia for analysis. The Pima county sheriff, Chris Nanos, denied he was withholding evidence from the FBI and that an agent had told him, “We do not want the media to divide us.”Investigators have also made repeated trips to the home of Annie Guthrie, sister of Savannah and a poet, and her husband Tommaso Cioni, a science and biology teacher, and the last to see Nancy when he dropped her at home hours before her abduction.The sheriff’s department hasn’t provided an official news briefing in over a week, allowing the citizen sleuths to fill the vacuum with a range of theories Almost any man who fits the rough description of a 5ft 10in man connected to the family has been brought under online suspicion.The case, likened variously to theLindbergh baby casein the 1930s, to an episode of Columbo and to the Keystone Cops, has at root a missing elderly woman whose fate is unknown. A series of purported ransom emails containing a demand for $6m in bitcoin and two deadlines sent to celebrity news outlet TMZ and two local TV stations are now rarely mentioned.Guthrie’s family have said they believe she is still alive but have no way to directly contact the ransom seekers and have not received the so-called “proof of life” they asked for.Joe Petito, father of Gabby Petito who went missing on a 2021 cross-country road trip and was later found to have been murdered by her fiance, Brian Laundrie, told Fox & Friends that false leads and misinformation made the search more difficult.“A lot of outside influence will try to give an opinion,” Petito said. Investigators, he added, “have all of the information or as much as possible. So I just hope they’re listening to what they feel is best.” The statement, and its implicit appeal to intuition, brought to mind Columbo.View image in fullscreenA screen grab from a video shows an armed individual at Nancy Guthrie’s front door the morning of her disappearance.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBut armchair detectives are not out in the field, as FBI agents are, knocking on doors and picking through inhospitable desert terrain of cactuses, bushes and boulders, in 80F heat in search of clues to crack a case of a missing woman authorities believe was taken against her will and whose blood was found on her front porch.“In hindsight we can say that ransom note was a fake and sent after the case went national,” says Bryanna Fox, a former FBI profiler at the University of South Florida.“That said, imagine being in the Guthries’ shoes and thinking ‘what if it is real and we don’t treat it as real?’ But who conducts a kidnapping-for-ransom and goes to the crime scene without a ransom note prepared? It’s so contrary to kidnapping.”Fox says the recent harvest of clues, despite lacking any definite resolution in the case, are substantial. “We’re waiting for the dividends,” she says. “One of those 4,000 tips sent to the FBI has to play out.”The task now will be to winnow them out and to get a potential suspect or suspects “committed to a story and track down the details of their story. If there are a lot of holes in it, you’ve got something more.” Fox says it’s possible Palazuelos knows more. “I’m not saying this man is involved, but is that a possibility? Yes.”Key to cracking the case may be the black-and-white images. Fox points to the resolution of recent cases – the murder of the United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, to name one – in which a suspect was arrested with help from surveillance films. “Maybe we just have to let a little more time go by for those leads to turn into an identification,” Fox says. “I’m optimistic.”Explore more on these topicsUS crimeArizonafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The agency argued that the estimates contain too much uncertainty.Previously, the EPA placed a dollar figure on the benefits of cleaner air, factoring in outcomes such as fewer premature deaths and reduced illness, includingasthmaattacks.The 2009 endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare and should therefore be controlled by the EPA. Byrevoking iton Thursday, officials eliminated the legal foundation enabling the government to control planet-heating pollution.‘A different set of rules’: thermal drone footage shows Musk’s AI power plant flouting clean air regulationsRead moreThe senators criticized the updated policy as “particularly troubling” and said the repeal “destroys that framework and results in a failure to faithfully execute EPA’s statutory mandate to protect human health”, according to a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday.The effort is being led by the ranking member of the Senate committee on the environment and public works, Sheldon Whitehouse. The lawmakers have asked the EPA to provide documents and details explaining how it reached its decision by 26 February.Senate Democrats are seeking to know the reasoning behind the EPA’s move; what factors the agency will consider when carrying out Clean Air Act rule-making; whether it has considered no longer quantifying health effects for other pollutants; and whether it consulted any outside parties, including the secretary of health and human services, the US surgeon general, or public health specialists.“It is literally zero surprise that they knew their hand-picked climate deniers weren’t putting out real science,” Whitehousewrote on Xin response to an article suggesting the Trump administration ignored the recommendations of scientists. “Their nonsense has never been real, but part of a fraudulent propaganda campaign, designed by fossil fuel to protect its ‘free-to-pollute’ business model.”The repeal is part of Trump’s sweeping attacks on US climate policy. On Thursday, he said the endangerment finding formed “the basis for the green new scam”. Since returning to office last January, theTrump administrationhas taken aggressive steps to roll back pollution regulations and promote fossil fuel production. Critics argue that this anti-environmental agenda benefits the president’s fossil fuel-industry donors.Trump’s decision drew broad condemnation from climate scientists and advocates focused on environmental protection, public health and economic justice. Asked on Thursday to address environmental concerns about the new rule, Trump said: “Don’t worry about it.”“This has nothing to do with public health,” he said of the endangerment finding. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”Explore more on these topicsUS Environmental Protection AgencyUS SenateAir pollutionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS CongressClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Even if you do manage to work for a day, it’s punctuated by periods of an hour and a half of rain where you’re sitting in your truck doing nothing. Before, I used to think, a day off, that’s great. But now you think, oh, jeez, not another day off!”View image in fullscreenMark’s Harrington’s team working in the rain on 15 January 2026.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThe delays have financial consequences for Harrington. “I am haemorrhaging money at the moment just trying to cope with the delays,” he says. “Jobs are taking longer, customers are unwilling to pay for extra scaffolding to over-roof their property, and the lads who work with me – who I have spent time and money on over the years training – are grumbling that they need to find work indoors. I’m earning a minimal wage myself.”Harrington used to be able to pay his employees half a day’s wages when their work was rained off, but not any more. “I’d run out of money.”The weather’s impact on his materials, such as wheat, adds further pressure. “If wheat seeds lay on wet ground for an extended period of time, they don’t germinate and this will affect availability. We had a disastrous crop two years ago and are still suffering from the after-effects of the shortage.” Shortages mean the crop becomes more expensive, leading to higher costs for customers.View image in fullscreenMark Harrington, a master thatcher: ‘Even if you do manage to work for a day, it’s punctuated by periods of an hour and a half of rain.’Photograph: Guardian Community“If a skilled tradesman such as myself is unable to maintain a team or even work as much as is required, then I fear for the future,” he says.‘I’m concerned that what we’ve seen so far is only the beginning of a long drawn out disaster’On a hill near Helston inCornwall, John, 83, says it is the relentlessness of the rain that is doing the damage. This year alone he and his wife, Vicki, 73, have lost 15 trees – many of them pines they planted nearly 40 years ago to provide shelter for their plant nursery as well as for “sheer beauty”.“What I see is a combination of results from the increased numbers of storms and continuous rainfall,” he says. “The ground gets very soggy, and the trees hold less well in it,” he says. “It’s such a shame to see a tree you planted lying on its side.”Living on a hill offers some protection from flooding, but the surrounding lanes have been submerged, at times with water three-quarters of the way up car wheels. Heavy rain has also worsened potholes, turning what was once a straightforward seven-mile drive into Helston into an obstacle course. “The time I take to do that same drive is pretty well doubled, because I’m dodging potholes and having to keep my speed right down,” he says.View image in fullscreenOne of the 15 trees that have fallen over on John and Vicki’s land this year.Photograph: Vicki and JohnThe worsening weather has caused other problems. Vicki, who runs the plant nursery, says the increasingly unstable weather has made small-scale growing far more difficult.Even on a south-facing slope high on a hill, the ground is “totally soggy and waterlogged”, with standing water lingering after heavy rain. “Flood water is really irritating – slopping around in mud everywhere and trying to keep drains clear,” she says. But it is the combination of saturated ground and increasingly violent winds that has proved most damaging.Vicki, who specialises in old-fashioned fragrant and historic roses, along with culinary and aromatic herbs, has decided to scale back operations. The latest bad weather brought three storms in quick succession.“Storm Goretti,” she says, “blew my last remaining polytunnel cover off.” Looking across the site, she adds: “It’s very hard to come back from that. It takes a lot of work to build up stock.”“Thirty or 40 years ago, it was fine. There’s no way I would contemplate polytunnels on top of a hill now. The climate has changed so much.”John predicts the worst is yet to come. “As global heating progresses there is a likelihood that we will have structural damage to buildings as well as trees. I’m concerned that what we’ve seen so far is only the beginning of a long drawn out disaster,” he says. “Some mornings we wake up and because it’s so misty and dank, it feels like the start of a third-rate historian novel.”The relentless rain hasn’t just affected those working in rural areas.‘I worked in gardens where half the plants were dying last summer, and now they’re all soaked’View image in fullscreenConnor Law, a gardener in London: ‘I worked in gardens where half the plants were dying last summer, and now they’re all soaked.’Photograph: Guardian Community“It’s been hard to work with this much rain,” says Connor Law, a gardener inLondon. “I don’t mind working through a shower or two but when it’s so consistently wet, you can end up accidentally disturbing plants. So jobs get pushed further and further back. I’m self-employed, so it’s going to start making money a bit tight if it carries on for too long.”Law, 33, has worked outdoors for the past 10 years and has noticed changes in the weather becoming increasingly extreme. “I worked in gardens where half the plants were dying last summer, and now they’re all soaked. Especially here in London, seasons have become confused. I saw spring bulbs flowering in December,” he says.“Working as a gardener, you see it first-hand every day. [Parts of the UK] onlyrecently came out of an official droughtdue to how dry last year was. It wasn’t really that noticeable unless you’re working in the gardens. [But] droughts followed by flooding are becoming increasingly common.”Law says people will have to change their approach to their gardens. “We can’t do what we’ve traditionally done for the last couple of hundred years. They’re going to have to look a bit different. I’ve always told people to grow wetland plants; if you’ve got an area garden that keeps flooding, try and embrace it and encourage frogs and insects to move in.”Conditions in London may be milder than other parts of the country at the moment, but the climate is still a concern, Law says. “The rain isn’t causing danger to people’s lives like in other parts of the country – I have family in Wales and the south-west where it’s more hairy.“But in terms of the health of the natural environment, people’s gardens are really important for biodiversity, insects and carbon capture. And if things in your garden are constantly dying because the conditions have changed, we’re going to lose that resource.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherExtreme weatherFloodingDevonCornwallLondonClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are widely used in consumer products and some have been linked to a range of serious health problems.What are PFAS, how toxic are they and how do you become exposed?Read moreAt one site, groundwater contained Pfos at 3,840ng/l, alongside elevated levels of other bannedPfascompounds. Twenty-five sites recorded Pfos concentrations well above drinking water guideline limits of 100ng/l for the combined total of 48 Pfas compounds.The contamination spans an area of outstanding natural beauty with multiple protections for wildlife and habitats.A resident whose business’s private well is polluted said they found out in November 2021 after being “unofficially” informed by an individual at the Environment Agency, and stopped drinking the water immediately. According to the resident, the agency had been testing the well for about 35 years because of concerns about “chemical drift” in the groundwater.“When I contacted the agency, they offered no help,” the resident said, adding that they were directed to Westmorland and Furness council, which “said they wished I had not been told, as they could not even test for Pfas … there was no help, no advice, no support of any kind”.“I tried to get the council to look for the source of the pollution but no one seemed interested,” the resident said. “They said it looked like we were an outlier … nearly five years later I am still no wiser.”Westmorland and Furness council said it was informed by the Environment Agency about the contaminated supply in late 2021 and that the business switched over to the mains water supply.“The council has continued to support the business to ensure compliance in line with statutory requirements and the provision of a safe water supply. These arrangements remain in place and are being managed to ensure there is no risk to public safety,” said a spokesperson.The Environment Agency said it identified elevated levels of Pfas in the area in 2022 through its national surveillance monitoring programme, but stressed that responsibility for protecting users of private water supplies lies with local authorities.The agency said it alerted the private borehole owner after detecting Pfas above drinking water guidelines and advised them to contact the local council. It added that councils, the UK Health Security Agency, the Food Standards Agency and the DrinkingWaterInspectorate (DWI) were informed in 2025.Possible sources of Pfos contamination identified in the Environment Agency’s March 2025 report include a paper mill in Beetham, where Pfas are known to have been used. Sites where Pfas-contaminated paper pulp may have been spread on land are also flagged as potential hotspots where Pfas could contaminate soils and enter the food chain.The mill’s operator went into administration and its assets were sold to a new operator in June 2025. Responsibility for earlier operations now sits with the former company’s administrators.“The mill is now operated by a new legal entity,” said Robyn Khan, director of the new operator Pelta Medical Papers. “Since this acquisition, there has been no use of Pfas-based chemicals on site, and the mill does not manufacture paper containing Pfas.“Any manufacture of Pfas-containing paper products occurred under the previous legal entity and ownership, in line with regulatory guidance and permit conditions in force at the time. We take our environmental responsibilities seriously and will continue to engage appropriately with the relevant regulatory authorities.”The mill’s administrators, Kroll Advisory, did not respond to requests for comment.The Environment Agency report also identified five historical landfills and one operational landfill as possible sources of Pfas, alongside sewage treatment works, fire stations and discharges from caravan parks.The government’s new Pfas action plan,published on Tuesday, sets out proposals to tighten controls on the chemicals, including new guidance on contaminated land, a consultation on statutory limits on Pfas levels in drinking water, and potentially tougher rules for industrial sites.But Water UK wants Pfas banned altogether. It said: “We risk falling further behind other European nations, which are increasingly banning these substances and demanding manufacturers pay for clean up.”Chloe Alexander, the chemicals policy lead at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the government’s plan was “a roadmap to nowhere”, warning it contained no binding phaseouts, no clear timetable, and no commitment to match the EU’s proposed Pfas ban.There are about 33,000 private water supplies in England and “it is becoming ever clearer how vulnerable some private water supplies are as the climate changes”, a DWI report said, with more running dry during droughts and others increasingly hit by environmental pollution.Hannah Evans from the environmental charity Fidra said: “This is yet another case demonstrating just how prevalent Pfas pollution is and the real-world consequences. Persistent chemicals should not be in our drinking water, our food, or our bodies. We urgently need to turn off the tap and transition the UK towards Pfas-free alternatives, many of which are already widely available.”Explore more on these topicsPfasWaterRiversPollutionCumbriaEnvironment AgencyLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

By revoking it on Thursday, officials eliminated the legal foundation enabling the government to control planet-heating pollution.Trump said the rollback constituted “the single largest deregulatory action in American history”, while EPA secretary Lee Zeldin said it would end “the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach”.“The endangerment finding, and the regulations that were based on it, didn’t just regulate emissions,” said Zeldin. “It regulated and targeted the American dream.”The move prompted widespread condemnation from climate experts and advocates for environmental, public health, and economic justice. Asked to respond to environmental concerns about the new rule on Thursday, Trump said: “Don’t worry about it.”“This has nothing to do with public health,” he said of the endangerment finding. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”The repeal is part of Trump’s sweeping assault on climate policy. On Thursday, he said the endangerment finding formed “the basis for the green new scam”. Since returning to office last January, Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to dismantle pollution rules and boost fossil fuels. That anti-environmental agenda, critics say, serves his fossil-fuel donors.“These modern-day robber barons would gladly add to their already obscene piles of wealth by making us less safe from climate change,” said Manuel Salgado, federal research manager at the nonprofit We Act for Environmental Justice.An EPA spokesperson told the Guardian: “The Trump EPA is following the law, ending the bogus overreach of previous administrations done by agenda-driven climate zealots.”1.Where did the endangerment finding come from?In 2007, the supreme court ruled in the lawsuit Massachusetts v EPA that the Clean Air Act gives the government authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles – somethingadvocatesand scientists had demanded for years.Two years later, under Barack Obama, the EPA issued the endangerment finding, which determined that six greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.The finding empowered the agency to act and barred it from ignoring the climate crisis, becoming the bedrock of federal climate regulation.2.What will this repeal do?Trump’s EPA contendsthat a section of the Clean Air Act which regulates emissions from cars and trucks applies only to “pollution that harms health or the environment through local and regional exposure”. The move effectively voids all federal greenhouse gas regulations on motor vehicles.It will also prompt a broader unspooling of climate regulations, experts say. Stationary pollution sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities are regulated under a different section of the Clean Air Act, but the legal theory laid out by EPA on Thursday attacks the endangerment finding in its entirety, said Andres Restrepo, a senior attorney at the green group the Sierra Club.“What they’re basically doing is announcing a position that the Clean Air Act does not allow EPA to find that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare,” he said. “That will require them to end emissions standards for power plants, too, because they cannot continue regulating power plants if that’s their legal position.”Joseph Goffman, who served as EPA air chief under Joe Biden, expects the agency will apply its vehicles-focused arguments to stationary polluters in the coming months, noting it has already laid the groundwork for that move. Over the summer, officialsproposed to find that emissionsfrom power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution” and therefore should not be regulated.“Instead of the entire house of cards of all EPA climate regulation collapsing all at once today, it’s going to be like a row of dominoes falling,” said Goffman, who helped write and implement the Clean Air Act and worked directly on the endangerment finding.The Guardian has contacted EPA to confirm its plans for power plant regulations.Adam Zuckerman, senior clean vehicles campaigner on the climate program at consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said this week’s move could also have “perilous” consequences for US carmakers and the workers they employ.“As China and Europe race toward building [electric vehicles], the American auto industry will need to make some challenging choices about how it decides to invest in innovation,” he said “The move puts American automakers in a bind, pushing them to make dirty, obsolete vehicles for the US that they can’t sell to most of the world.”3.Didn’t the Trump administration say this will save the US money?The administration says their new rule will save the US $1.3tn.But that claim, experts say, ignores the far greater costs Americans will incur due to extreme weather and other impacts of climate change.One estimate from environmental nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund found the repeal of the endangerment finding could impose up to $4.7tn in additional expenses tied to climate-warming and toxic pollution over the next two decades.“Today’s action by President Trump, if unchecked by the courts or Congress, will put more money in the pockets of the CEOs who pollute our air and cut big checks for Republican politicians,” said Jason Walsh, executive director of BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups.“But it will put more regular folks in the hospital or force them to flee climate disasters while the billionaire class is safely protected on their mountaintops and private islands.”The EPA spokesperson said: “Under President Trump, EPA is returning to common‑sense policies and adhering to the law. That is how we keep dollars in the pockets of American families and protect human health and the environment, refusing to let any ‘climate religion’ trump the laws passed by Congress.”4.Will this rollback hold up in court?Green groups, health-focused organizations, and the states of California and Connecticut have pledged to sue the administration over the rollback, noting that federal courts have repeatedly upheld and affirmed the endangerment finding.“This cynical and devastating action by the Trump EPA will not go forward without a fight,” said Manish Bapna, president of the conservation organization the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We will see them in court – and we will win.”Groups will begin filing litigation to the DC circuit court “very soon”, said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert at Columbia University. The challenges could wend their way through the courts for years. But they could also be settled quickly, said Gerrard.“We have quite a history of the supreme court jumping into these kinds of things quickly,” he said, noting that they high court tookunprecedentedly quick actionto issue a stay on Obama-era power plant regulations in 2016. “This could all take less than a year, potentially.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisDemocracy, climate and justiceTrump administrationUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Moth said Nichols is now moving “to slightly more restful pastures”.Moth was born in Zambia but moved to Kent in his early years. His previous role was as bishop of Arundel and Brighton; before that he was bishop of the Forces.The new leader has spoken publicly about issues surrounding migration andcondemned the recent commentsmade by billionaire and co-owner of Manchester United, Sir Jim Ratcliffe.In an interview with the Press Association, he said: “Speaking into a debate is fine, but the language is unfortunate, and I think that approach that he expressed is a deeply unfortunate one. I would disagree with it wholeheartedly.”View image in fullscreenThe archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, among the clerics gathered for the installation of Richard Moth as the 12th archbishop of Westminster.Photograph: Lucy North/PAHe also criticised government policies to house asylum seekers in hotels. “I think the debate I would like to see is how can we best approach this issue? Having people living in hotels for long periods of time is not ideal,” he said in the same interview.At the ceremony in Westminster, the new archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, said Moth has a “deep concern for the dignity of every person”.“In a world marked by division and uncertainty, the call to unity flows from the heart of the gospel itself – our traditions are not weakened by friendship, they are deepened when we walk together in charity, honesty and truth,” she said.Moth has also spoken about the “opportunity” for the church to capture the interest of new believers.In aninterviewwith the Catholic Herald this month, he said: “Most dioceses report increased adult baptisms and a gradual rise in people coming to church. Numbers are picking up again after Covid, though not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. There is also growing interest from young adults exploring or entering the church. So there is a great opportunity here.”Explore more on these topicsCatholicismChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The campaign group is sending the venue vegan ham as an alternative.Jennifer White, an associate director at Peta, welcomed the decision, saying she hoped it would remind people “that all pigs areindividuals with personalitiesand not body parts to be chopped up”.Peppa Pig’s Big Family Show is touring the UK and Ireland until September. White saidPetacontacted Grimsby after reviewing theatre menus and noticing a startling amount of pork. The venue agreed to the request, and Peta said it hoped others would follow suit.In the letter to the theatre, Peta wrote: “As the fictional Pig family comes to life on stage, real pigs lose their lives for the bacon and sausage in your cafe. It’s a jarring contradiction: encouraging children to cheer for Peppa and her family one moment, then inviting them to eat the flesh of pigs the next.View image in fullscreenAn indoor commercial pig farm.Photograph: Farlap/Alamy“Like Peppa and [baby sister] Evie, real pigs are playful, curious, and social. But on theUK’s industrial pig farms, most spend their entire short lives confined to filthy sheds without sunlight.”The letter acknowledged that the show would not depict Peppa and Evie “convulsing in a gas chamber” but said “the products of this real-life suffering can be found in your cafe”.The auditorium told Peta it would remove pork products from the Stage Door cafe menu as a “considerate gesture” during the show’s run on 3-4 March.White said she hoped the Grimsby decision – and any similar moves elsewhere – would prompt meaningful conversations between parents and children about the ethics of eating animals. She encouraged families to order Peta’sfree vegan starter kit, which features recipes and practical advice.First broadcast in the UK in 2004, Peppa Pig is now shown in more than 180 territories and 40 languages.When Evie Pig was born last year, Grazia published aninterview with Mummy Pigin which she revealed the baby’s gender and speculated on what they might call her. “We’ve got SO many ideas for names,” she said. “Too many, frankly! Oink!”Alongside more than 400 TV episodes and the touring stage show, the franchise includesPeppa Pig Worldin the New Forest, praisedby Boris Johnson in 2021in a rambling speech to the Confederation of British Industry.2:09Boris Johnson praises Peppa Pig in bizarre CBI speech – videoUrging business leaders to visit, he said: “I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass transit systems. Even if they’re a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.”White said she hoped all theatres and arts organisations would reflect on their menus.In November, Peta said it had persuaded Chichester Festival theatre to drop pork products from its menus during a run ofThe Three Little Pigs.Explore more on these topicsChildren's theatrePeppa PigTheatreFarm animalsPetaVegan food and drinkVeganismnewsShareReuse this content"

One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running – one American and two Russians – prompting Nasa to pause spacewalks and trim research.Moving in for eight to nine months are Nasa’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot, and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have visited the ISS before. During her first space station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to visit space. Hathaway is a captain in the US navy.“Bonjour!” Adenot called out once the capsule had docked to the space station 277 miles (446km) up.French president Emmanuel Macron offered support to Adenot in asocial media post: “In space as on Earth, it is by uniting our strengths that we accomplish the extraordinary.”A couple of hours later, the hatches swung open and the seven space travelers hugged and exchanged exuberant high-fives. “Let’s get rolling,” Meir said.Nasa has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on 7 January or explain what happened, citing medical privacy.

They set shops on fire and forced the whole village to flee,” Ibrahim said.He added that many villagers fear returning as the gunmen remain nearby.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There are thought to have been at least 70 perpetrators but police have not been able to identify them all.Questions also remain over whether the couple’s daughter,Caroline Darian, was also abused by Dominique, something that caused a rift when Darian accused her mother of not believing her when police discovered two photos of her unconscious and wearing underwear she did not recognise.Pelicot said the revelations had not brought the family together, instead describing them as “an explosion that blows everything away”, but she is rebuilding her relationship with her daughter whom she now speaks to every day on the phone.She told the New York Times that the uncertainty for Darian was “inescapable hell”. “There are those two photos of her asleep that open up a lot of questions. But I don’t have any answers, and Monsieur Pelicot didn’t give her any answers either.”Gisèle Pelicot calls on victims to ‘never have shame’ in her first TV interviewRead morePelicot said of her ex-husband: “I hope that when we’re face to face, he’ll be able to tell me the truth, both about his daughter and about everything else he’s now accused of. Maybe he’ll have some remorse. I’m still holding on to that hope. Maybe I’m naive, maybe I won’t get an answer.”Pelicot described the day in November 2020 when she had been brought into the station to discuss, she thought, an incident where her then husband was caught filming up women’s skirts.She saw a police officer’s “face start to change” as he pointed to a stack of files. She was asked if she recognised herself in a photo of a woman being raped by a man she did not know.“And of course I didn’t recognise myself, because I was with a man I didn’t know, who was raping me. I said: ‘I don’t know this man’ … He shows me a second photo, which is pretty much the same, and he says: ‘That’s you there.’ I say no, and he says: ‘This is your room, Madame Pelicot, these are your bedside lamps. We searched your home, these are your belongings.’”The police officer told her Dominique was in custody and that 53 people had been arrested. “He tells me that I have been raped about 200 times. I say: ‘But that’s not possible.’ And then I ask for a glass of water because I can’t talk any more.”She described later watching the videos. “I’m a rag doll. It’s as if I’ve come out of surgery, because I’m completely anaesthetised. These men, when you see what they’re doing to me – how is it possible that my body couldn’t feel anything? … Fortunately for me, I have no memories, because I think I would have killed myself afterward.”She described feeling shame and spending “hours in the shower trying to wash away this filth, this dirt that makes you feel dehumanised”.Pelicot also talked about specific incidents, including a crown on one of her teeth coming loose, which she later realised was caused by oral rape.“When I discovered the videos showing the violence these men inflicted on me, in my limp mouth – they have to hold my head because my face is falling, I have no muscle tone – and Monsieur Pelicot doesn’t even react. There is no empathy, no pity for this woman who is there, completely dead in her bed. It was incredibly violent to tell myself that even that, they didn’t spare me.”During the trial, Pelicot waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse. “The shame is theirs,” she famously stated of her abusers – and became a global feminist icon, leaving court each day to applause from gathered crowds.Support poured in from high-profile people, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who thanked her for her “dignity and courage”, and Queen Camilla of the UK.In a letter, Camilla wrote to express her “heartfelt admiration for the courage, grace and dignity with which you have faced the horrific crimes committed against you”.Speaking to BBC Newsnight at the weekend, Pelicot said: “I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.”Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialRape and sexual assaultWomenFranceViolence against women and girlsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Palantir refused to comment on the claims.The US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. TheUS militaryhas used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.Critics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.AI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.This more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.The Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk.

In addition, many are seeking some certainty in turbulent times.An annuityis a product that converts an individual’s pension pot into a regular, guaranteed income for the rest of their life (or for a fixed term). They pay a life insurance company a lump sum, and, in exchange, it guarantees a regular payout.Demand plummeted after the“pension freedoms”introduced in 2015 meant people no longer had to take one out. Butchanges to inheritance tax (IHT) on pensionsannounced by Rachel Reeves in her October 2024 budget helped give them a new lease of life.She said money left in a defined contribution (AKA money purchase) pension after someone’s death will be pulled into the IHT net from April 2027. All private pensions, and most workplace schemes, are defined contribution.The changes mean “unused” pension savings could be taxed as part of someone’s estate if they exceed the IHT threshold. Unused funds are money in a pension pot that has not been used to claim an income – such as buying an annuity.Commenting on the data issued by the Association of British Insurers, Clare Moffat at the insurer Royal London said: “With changes next year to inheritance tax and pensions, there has been an increased interest in using annuities for IHT planning.”Annuities now also offer better value than they used to. Marianna Hunt at the investment firm Fidelity International said its recent data showed that a 66-year-old in good health with a £300,000 pension pot could buy a single-life annuity paying £22,440 a year – a rate of about 7.5%.“Five years ago, rates were closer to 4%to 5%, delivering roughly £13,500 from the same pot. That’s a substantial uplift in guaranteed income,” she added.Explore more on these topicsPensionsAnnuitiesInheritance taxRetirement planningFinancial sectornewsShareReuse this content"

He wanted it to look like a “hybrid” of the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg bridges. Soon after, Macken, who grew up in Middle Village, Queens, moved his family to a small town upstate, more than 160 miles from the city. Macken loaded his bridge on the moving truck. It did not make the trip.“It got destroyed, and I was kind of bummed,” said Macken, who is now 63. “So I figured, let me build something better.”Twenty-three years later, that “something better” survived another truck drive – this time to the Museum of the City ofNew York, which now houses the project that spiraled into Macken’s life’s work.After the accidental bridge demolition, Macken focused on another New York landmark. He carved a mini replica of 30 Rock, the art deco skyscraper and centerpiece of Rockefeller Center. That went well, so he started adding on, using wood to render the surrounding Midtown neighborhood. His mini Midtown became mini Manhattan. Then, he decided to model all of New York’s five boroughs, block by block.View image in fullscreenJoe Macken’s miniature model of lower Manhattan.Photograph: David Lurvey/Museum of the City of New YorkThe result is a 50-by-27ft piece made of wood and cardboard, held together by glue and the sheer determination Macken needed to get it done. “This is all about consistency,” Macken said. “I just started cutting one little house at a time.” It took him 10 years to cover Manhattan, and then another decade to get through the rest of New York.In the late 60s and early 70s, Macken watched the twin towers rise from his childhood bedroom window. He remembers seeing cranes hoist girders into the sky. “It was my favorite building,” Macken said. So he put it in the model, which has replicas of both One World Trade Center, which opened in 2014, and the original towers. “No matter what, the [former] World Trade Center was going to be in there,” he said. “That was just a personal thing I wanted to do.”Before it arrived at the museum, Macken kept the model in a storage unit near his home. Macken, a former truck driver, stacks the boards into piles when transporting the piece. He tries to avoid another model bridge massacre by “driving slow”. “You have a couple casualties here and there, but nothing that can’t be fixed,” he said.The museum exhibits the model in a large, ground-floor gallery, arranged from due north to south. Manhattan, the borough used to getting all the attention, is dwarfed by the outer boroughs, reminding viewers that much of the city’s magic occurs far away from tourist hubs. “I’ve been thinking a lot about how knowable and unknowable New York City is to all of us, whether we’re from here or just have a mental picture of this place,” said Elisabeth Sherman, MCNY’s deputy director and chief curator. “It is both immediately resonant, and yet so hard to grasp. Joe did that in his own way, and now we all get to participate and appreciate it for ourselves.”View image in fullscreenA tiny boat floats near a miniature version of the Coney Island beachfront.Photograph: David Lurvey/Museum of the City of New YorkThere are binoculars placed on the outside edges of the model, so viewers can take a closer look at specific sections. People who live near landmarks can easily find their blocks – one museum employee pointed out their home on the edge of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. This reporter had a tougher time trying to find her street, located in a gridlocked Brooklyn neighborhood.Sherman said that when museum staff first saw the model, “we were all standing around squealing, ‘Look, there’s our museum!’ ‘There’s the Met, there’s the Guggenheim.’ It’s this great act of recognition, and then it’s also witnessing [Macken’s] creativity, how he made this complex architecture out of very humble materials.”Sherman first heard of Macken the way many others did: last summer, the project went viral on TikTok, when 8 million people – coincidentally, that’s about the population of New York – turned into his delightfully lo-fi first video. In the clip, Macken stares directly at the camera, holding up downtown Manhattan, making sure to point out his beloved twin towers. It was not his deal – Macken said his daughter egged him on. “I’m totally clueless when it comes to that stuff,” he said. “It took me longer to download the app than it did to build this whole thing.”Explore more on these topicsArtNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our writers recall the offbeat songs that capture their heartsJohn Doran,Safi Bugel,Jason Okundaye,Luke Turner,Jeffrey Ingold,Elle Hunt,Tim Jonze,Dave SimpsonandKate SolomonSat 14 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 08.02 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWolf Eyes – Stabbed in the FaceBy Easter 2004, I’d been in a relationship with my partner, Maria, for four months and I was just realising how deeply in love I was. We had become inseparable. A magazine sent me to the ATP festival at Pontins in Camber Sands to interview “the Beastie Boys of noise”, Wolf Eyes. The interview fell to pieces when the band, in a state of great psychic refreshment, all wearing Manowar T-shirts, refused to stop watching a Manowar DVD and signalled they would only answer questions if they related to Manowar.The rest of the day was exemplary – one of the best ever – walking on the beach, visiting record shops, watching the most incredible music curated by Sonic Youth. When Maria and I got back to our B&B room that evening, I fired up the CD player, which contained a pre-release copy of the new Wolf Eyes album, Burned Mind, containing the single Stabbed in the Face. But now its howling feedback and tinnitus machine noise sounded like a celebratory, ecstatic, love-filled symphony. People might think we’re being juvenile by saying Stabbed in the Face is our song, but it is the soundtrack of an incredibly joyous, optimistic time. We don’t listen to it that often now, though; our 14-year-old son says it upsets the dog.John DoranSharpe and Numan – Change Your MindFor years, I associated this track with big nights out. Its swooning synths and sing-along chorus made it the perfect contender for the lights-on moment on many occasions: epic, yet soft enough to sway around to with frazzled friends. But it took on new meaning when I heard it in the background of an Instagram video featuring someone I had just started seeing. In those early days of shy phone calls and infrequent in-person hangouts, I watched that short, blurry clip over and over again, yearning like a teenager, as the melody etched itself into my brain. The song quickly became something that reminded me of said person rather than just parties and, later, something we would dance to together as well.View image in fullscreen‘I associated this track with big nights out’ … Gary Numan at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1984.Photograph: Pete Still/RedfernsThat’s in spite of the fact that Change Your Mind is more of a breakup song, with a dejectedGary Numanpining over some unrequited lover, urging them to change their mind – sometimes aggressively so. But the woozy and sparkly production, paired with all the memories attached to it, makes all those bitter sentiments feel irrelevant. The fact that the 12in version stretches over a luxurious eight and a half minutes makes it the ideal soundtrack for overindulging the soppiest of feelings, whether it’s missing late nights with friends or fancying someone.Safi BugelAmy Winehouse – Stronger Than MeIf your man caught you listening to Stronger Than Me, he would surely think that you hate him: “Don’t you know you supposed to be the man? / Not pale in comparison to who you think I am.” The song is a modern-day equivalent of the scene in Euripides’ tragedy The Bacchae where frenzied women tear Pentheus limb from limb, an act called thesparagmos. It not only concerns a partner who disappoints during sex, but his physical and emotional weakness as compared to Winehouse. It is emasculating, mocking and of its time: “Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy.”Yet I have always found its frankness more romantic than spurning. I don’t get the sense that Winehouse isn’t in love with the man in question, only that she is willing to show him what his weaknesses are and appeal to his bodily instincts. She knows that endless talk can kill romance and affection, especially when you’re being fed bullshit, and that sometimes wordlessly stepping up to take on a caring or leadership role can help meet your partner’s needs. It is all somewhat illogical, reductive about gender roles and dismissive, but, at times, I’ve listened to this song to channel my bluntest assessments of how to get back on track. Sometimes, that is just to be held and “gripped” without words, rather than be fed with the same old “tired script”.Jason OkundayeEinstürzende Neubauten – Youme & MeyouCompared with the flying sparks and screaming of Einstürzende Neubauten’s early work, Youme & Meyou – with Blixa Bargeld crooning over melodic pulses made by rhythms tapped out on plastic pipes – is far from abrasive, yet it still had the power to teach me something about love. I first fell for Neubauten in part because they wrote romantic songs to places, rather than just people, but in this I missed some of their depth.I heard the lines “out there’s always a construction site / A Starbucks and yet another Guggenheim” and took this as being a song about the blandness of the globalisation of the urban environment in the early 21st century. It was only when my partner told me it made her think of us that I spotted what the title actually is, a dialogue between a me and a you in a relationship,and I realised thatI had been an idiot. In odd ways, it started to cement us together. You might not have Bargeld pegged as an agony uncle, but this is a song filled with wonderful lines about feeding love to make it endure, mutual understanding and realism – as he sings it, “if the future isn’t bright at least it’s colourful”.Luke TurnerLeona Lewis – My HandsWhen you’ve been single for 34 years, most traditional love songs have lost their lustre. Songs about heartbreak are now where I find hope for the romantic love that my life has lacked. When I first heard Leona Lewis’s desperately sad My Hands in 2010, I was just so moved by it. The song is about trying to rebuild your life after a breakup, but your body physically rejects every step forward. When Lewis’s voice almost breaks as she sings “ready for a new day without you”, it evokes the acute desperation of a person pushed to the brink of disintegration.View image in fullscreen‘I hope to one day know what that devastation feels like’ … Leona Lewis at the Hackney Empire in 2009.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe despair that washes over this song can only come from a place of a fully realised, intimate and deep romance. It made me stop and imagine how it would feel to love – and be loved – so deeply that you “don’t wanna start again” because your body aches just to feel the touch of your ex’s hand. I hope to one day know what that devastation feels like because it can only mean that I have truly been in love. If it’s weird to find that romantic, well then, my heart just won’t let me be normal.Jeffrey IngoldStephen Malkmus and the Jicks – Middle AmericaI couldn’t really tell you what Middle America is about. Malkmus’s lyrics to this gentle guitar ditty are typically opaque; all he’s said is that it’snot a commentary on the flyover states. To me, it sounds like love – more specifically, the sort of love I’d like to find.Having spent the past decade meaningfully single, I find it hard to relate to explicitly romantic songs: they’re too generic to be moving, too singular to be relatable, or too histrionic to be aspirational. Elliptical as it is, Middle America always evokes how I would like to feel in a relationship. There is something about Malkmus’s delivery that suggests he’s picking up a conversation that had no obvious start and never really ends – it just roams, as talk does with a partner.Malkmus’s narrator wonders aloud about time passing and “how to simplify”, the kind of problems you’d bring to a romantic relationship. In my reverie he engages with mine, offering gentle encouragement (“do your major duty”) or calling me on my bullshit: “When you get down to it, you wanted to.” He asks, “do you think you’ve got the nerve?” and sympathises without being a performative ally: “Men are scum, I won’t deny.” And he’s steadfast in his commitment and care without promising for ever or reaching for once-in-a-lifetime love: “I will not disappear.”Often, when I press play on Middle America, my shoulders drop and I take a proper breath for the first time in hours, day-to-day stresses suddenly surmountable. Between the lines of Middle America, I can glimpse some “unnamed star” and dare to hope it’s not so far away.Elle HuntPublic Image Ltd – This Is Not a Love Song (album version)Of course it’s not romantic. Just read the title!John Lydonwasn’t lying when he told us – repeatedly, over towering, brass-powered chords – that this was not a love song. Instead, it was a sneering, sarcastic attack on 80s capitalism, music industry greed and all of those who had accused the former Sex Pistol of selling out.It was also – two decades after its 1983 release – one of the staples of my DJ bag, a dead-cert whenever I played it at indie club nights across the country in the early 2000s. PiL’s biggest hit was cool enough to gain approval from the hipsters, yet also guaranteed to fill the dancefloor. I was delighted when the girl in the blue dress came up to the DJ booth during my set at Pigs in Leeds and requested it. She had caught my eye the previous week; now it turned out she had great taste, too. Of course I’d play it for her. I turned back to the decks and realised – to my horror – that I’d taken it out of my bag to listen to that same morning … and forgotten to put it back. Nightmare!Luckily, I had a chance to make amends. At the end of the night, promoter Ash handed me a bottle of champagne (OK, probably cheap sparkling wine) and told me to award it to the best dancer. Well, shewasa great dancer, but really I just wanted an excuse to talk to her.I stumbled across the dancefloor, desperately looking for her, but to no avail. Realising I maybe looked slightly obsessive, I admitted defeat and gave it to someone else. She must have gone home, I thought. Then she reappeared in the queue for the cloakroom. Her eyes matched her dress and she had a cute Manchester accent. I was smitten. Despite not having the record she wanted, and despite having just given some other girl a free bottle of fizz, she seemed happy to see me. Twenty-two years and two kids later, we both still love that record and the way it became part of our lore. It might not be a love song, but it was definitely the start of a love story.Tim JonzeOrchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – Enola GayI met my first ever girlfriend when we both worked at Asda. I was part-time on Saturdays and sometimes after school, and she was full-time and already far more worldly. She introduced me to all sorts, including Iggy Pop albums, but because I was too young for pubs, most of our dates consisted of aimless walks arm in arm around Leeds suburbs.View image in fullscreen‘It spoke to my fears that ours would be a fleeting romance’ … Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImageOne place that did let us in was Primo’s, a Saturday electronic night in Leeds city centre. One night, we somehow ended up snogging while draped across the long velvety seats that ran alongside the dancefloor, until a chuckling bouncer gently lifted me up. Our prematurely halted encounter played out to the sound of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s Enola Gay, a synth-pop classic. Despite seemingly loved-up lines such as “this kiss you give, it’s never ever going to fade away”, it’s about the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, killing up tens of thousands of people. I’m not sure I knew that then, but the song’s haunting, melancholy synth riff also spoke to my fears that ours would be a fleeting romance. She dumped me a few months later, but if I ever hear Enola Gay playing anywhere, it instantly takes me back.Dave Simpson‘Utterly devastating’: Guardian writers on their favourite breakup songsRead moreHe Is Legend – The SeductionI’m sure there are many people out there who find certain heavy rock songs romantic, but I personally am more of the harps and harmonies persuasion. It’s not that I don’t like heavy music as a rule, I just don’t find it very conducive to candlelit dinners and the laying of capes over puddles, you know? Call me crazy but I don’t want to cuddle while guitars chug and a man roars incoherently at me, despite what my last relationship might suggest.While at university, I had the sweetest, loveliest boyfriend you could possibly imagine, a kind and generous man who had a powerful affection for the kind of technical metal I would rather put my head in a meat grinder than listen to. One day, he played me this song – which is not that heavy, and not that technical, and unlikely to be classified as truly metal by the heads. But with its banging hooks, relentless punk beat and drawling insouciance, it provided this shared musical ground to dance on together. Sure, it’s a skewed retelling of Romeo and Juliet but, aside from that, it’s essentially a man yelling at me while guitars chug. But whenever my boyfriend would put it on, I knew he was saying: “Hey, here’s that song we both like and I’ve put it on so we can enjoy it together.” And what could be more romantic than that?Kate SolomonExplore more on these topicsMusicValentine's DayPop and rockExperimental musicElectronic musicJohn LydonGary NumanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a years-long party that eventually came crashing downAs told toOlivia LadanyiSat 14 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAt 13, what felt like almost overnight, I turned from a happy, musical-theatre-loving child into a sad, lonely teenager. Things I had cared about only yesterday were suddenly irrelevant, as I realised that nothing and no one mattered, least of all me. It’s an angst that adults often find difficult to remember or understand; as the famous line from The Virgin Suicides goes: “Obviously, Doctor, you’ve never been a 13-year-old girl.”Going to an all-girls Catholic school, I didn’t even really know that sex, drugs and alcohol existed, or that they had currency, until I watched Thirteen for the first time at 14, after seeing a still on Pinterest. The reckless rebellion the two best friends portrayed was seductive to me, and within weeks of watching the film, I’d met some girls from the co-ed school opposite who were having sex, going to parties and taking drugs. Soon, I was doing it all too.In the provocative 2003 teen drama, which launched the career of Evan Rachel Wood, 13-year-old Tracy gets her tongue pierced, then her belly button. So I got my tongue pierced, then my belly button. I swapped baggy Hunger Games T-shirts for crop tops, low-waisted jeans and push-up bras. I bleached my hair blond and I snuck out on school nights after my parents went to bed. They had no idea what I was up to. I went to parties in mansions, where we’d get really drunk and tattoo each other. I had sex for the first time. I took acid.Before this, I had felt severely uncool, as if I was standing in front of soundproof glass watching everyone laughing at a joke I hadn’t heard. Suddenly life was in colour again, and not just colour, but fluorescence. Now cool girls wanted to be my friend, and people at school were talking about me; I was interesting, I was somebody. At parties with these cool girls and hot boys, I felt important. Thirteen had taught me that if you did those things then you were cool, and if you were cool, you mattered.View image in fullscreen‘Their reckless rebellion was seductive’ … Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed in Thirteen.Photograph: Working Title/AllstarYou hear about people who party when they’re young and get tired of it before becoming adults, but that wasn’t what happened to me. I continued the hunt into my late teens, seeking adrenaline, validation, acknowledgment that I was special. Even though I knew it wasn’t healthy, it took me years to understand I didn’t always have to get so blackout drunk that I had to be carried home. I thought that was the whole point, and I was still trying to fill the void that had appeared when I was 13 by being the last one at the party.That ended in 2024with a psychotic episode.I was 20, living in university accommodation but not a student, working a nine-to-five job and getting wasted on a Tuesday for no reason. The only thing I had to look forward to was a holiday that I’d been saving for. But when we got there, I pushed things way too far. After days of not sleeping and taking whatever was offered to me, I entered a psychosis that lasted for two-and-a-half days. When I came back to myself and saw the fear in my friends’ eyes, I was forced to confront how I’d been acting since I was a teen, and the damage I’d normalised.My cultural awakening: A Queen song helped me break free from communist CubaRead moreThirteen offered me a script for how to survive the wilderness of adolescence through excess, and for a lonely teenage girl, that felt like a remedy rather than thewarningthe film intended it to be. I would have done those things eventually, but the immediacy wasn’t a coincidence. It was like being given an answer I’d been desperately seeking, then turning the corner and finding it waiting for me. But I’ve realised that what I was really running from was myself, and the emptiness I felt within. I thought I could hide inside fun nights and quick highs, but eventually, I had to face myself.I still want to matter, to feel interesting and alive, but now I find that in friendship, my work and creativity. Thirteen, which ends hauntingly with Tracy alone spinning on a roundabout, didn’t just teach me how to escape myself – it showed me the cost of doing so.AnonymousShare your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It’s a place where terrified newbies realise they can survive only by abandoning their innocence and decency, and submitting to the gang authority of a psycho top G, naturally involving a horrible loyalty test.This is a place where drugs arrive by drone, where facially tattooed men meet each other’s gaze with a cool opaque challenge in the canteen, and where the cues and balls on the recreation area’s pool table have only one purpose: to give someone a three-month stay in the hospital wing while underpaid guards in lanyards and ill-fitting v-neck jumpers look the other way.Tut Nyuot plays Troy, just arrived on remand for conspiracy to commit murder. Having been emotionally messed up by his neglectful, vulnerable mum Joy (Sharon Duncan-Brewster), he instantly forms a bond with Krystian (Vladyslav Baliuk), a shy Polish kid remanded for a chaotic attempt to burgle a library, in order to sniff the glue used to repair bindings. They are menaced by the chilling Dion (Sekou Diaby), whose rule they must obey; they are wary also of the sinister Mason (Ryan Dean).Stephen Grahamplays Claypole, the unit’s caring youth worker.This is a film that, for me, doesn’t quite have the storytelling ingenuity or plausibility of the comparable Bafta-nominated prison film Wasteman. Graham’s role is a bit earnest, and I frankly didn’t believe in how the cathartic final scene plays out, where he assembles the inmates to talk to them about shame. But that scene, and the film in general, have a bold idealistic belief in redeemability (which Wasteman doesn’t, really) and it challenges the genre’s hetero machismo.Animol shows us the prison world’s three types of currency: phones, drugs and respect. The first two can be airlifted in by drone (those of my generation will smile to remember the quaint economy of “snout”, AKA cigarettes, in the 70s BBC comedy Porridge); the third is more intangible. Dion accumulates and maintains it through an unending, exhausting theatrical display of menace, which involves appointing consiglieres to hang out in his cell, who must be played off against each other as if in a Renaissance court. Mason has no talent for leadership; he is a loner who can only radiate violent spite.But there is a fourth commodity: secrets. Knowing these, and threatening to reveal them, is a dangerous business; the irony is that blackmail will be a learning process – almost a coming-of-age process – for the inmates. This is a flawed film, certainly, but with empathy, and strong performances.Animol screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPrisons and probationAshley WaltersStephen GrahamUK criminal justiceBerlin film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus the classics reimagined for a modern readerElla RisbridgerSat 14 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 08.18 ESTShareOpposites attract. He falls first. Coffee shop. Forced proximity. Sports romance. University sports romance. Ivy League university sports romance! Best friend’s brother. Brother’s best friend. Slow burn. Age gap. Amnesia. Wounded hero. Single father. Single mother. Language barrier. The bodyguard. Fake dating. Marriage of convenience.If this list means nothing to you, you’re not a romance reader. Tropes, as these bullet-point ideas have come to be known, have taken over romance. Those who write, market and read romantic fiction use them to pinpoint exactly what to expect before the first page is turned. On Instagram, Amazon and bookshop posters you’ll find covers annotated with arrows and faux-handwritten labels reading “slow-burn” or “home-town boy/new girl in town”. Turn over any romance title and they’ll be there listed in the blurb.“They are the easiest way to signpost what a book is,” says Lucy Stewart, commissioning editor for romance at Hodder. “As soon as I say ‘enemies-to-lovers’ in an acquisition meeting, I’ve already communicated so much to a room full of people in just three words: I’ve told them it’s a romcom, what the hook is and where it sits in the market.”Tropes have always existed in romance, but only in recent years have specific categories developed as a way to categorise, market and even consume romantic fiction, and of course these have accumulated and evolved. A “hot billionaire”, for example, is always popular, though in recent years his style has shifted from Prince Charming to a bit of a beast, kind and generous giving way to reluctant and dangerous. “There’s only one bed” has given rise to “Oh no, now there are two beds”; or if you prefer historical romance, “There’s only one horse”.Publishers market their authors in this way, and often romance writers will write with particular tropes in mind, but it can be hard to know exactly where to draw the line. “Is love itself a trope? Is motherhood? Is marriage the same as ‘only one bed’?” posted the author Rainbow Rowellon Instagram, in the run-up to her new novel, Cherry Baby.Or take the new TV show Heated Rivalry, adapted from the novel by Rachel Reid about ice-hockey players on opposing teams who fall in love. It’s fairly obvious that the “enemies-to-lovers” trope is at play here – and “sports romance”, too. But there has been much discussion about the book’s representation of “MLM” (men loving men). Is that really a trope, or simply queerness represented?You can reduce anything down to tropes – grumpy v sunshine, pride v prejudice – but should we? What does it mean for the way we read – and for the ways we think about art? For tropes are, of course, not unique to romantic fiction. Mystery novels have them; as does science fiction. “The butler did it” is a classic trope.View image in fullscreen‘There’s only one bed’ …Illustration: Inès Pagniez/The GuardianChristopher Booker’s The Seven Basic Plots, now 22 years old, popularised the idea that there are no new stories; and his book drew on a theory of archetypes that Carl Jung developed a century ago. The psychoanalyst believed that some stories were so fundamental to the human experience they were essentially ingrained into the psyche from birth. Tropes exist in all fiction; indeed in all storytelling.“Anything you read is made of tropes. Shakespeare loved tropes. So did Dickens, Austen – anyone you can think of. It’s all tropes, all the time,” says romance writer Laura Wood. Before Romeo and Juliet’s “star-cross’d lovers” there was Pyramus and Thisbe. Fairytales offered a long line of hot, mean, rich men long before Mr Darcy became shorthand for an arrogant millionaire with a secret heart of gold.Not everyone is a fan of the way these archetypes have been appropriated for marketing purposes, however. “I completely despair at the way books are reduced to their tropes,” writer and reader of romance Eleanor Vendrell tells me, “as if a menu of characteristics is in any way representative of a story.” But aren’t they simply a way for readers to navigate a busy library or crowded online store? More books are being published than ever before, and they have never been easier to access. We are drowning in content: things to watch, things to hear, things to read. We have to have some way of categorising all these words, and all these ideas. “Tropes might make me pick up a book,” another romance reader tells me, “but I’ll stay or go for the writing.”“As soon as you start thinking about them, you realise you’re being fed them all the time,” a book publicist says. “If you click on a film on a streaming service, for example, it’ll tell you the tropes in the description so you know what to expect before watching.” There are, apparently, more than 36,000 different codes on Netflix – Small Town Scares, Twisted Christmas, One-Weekend Watches– to ensure the viewer is always presented with just the right content at just the right time.In literary terms, though, it’s mostly romantic fiction that has come to define itself by tropes – and to be derided for them, too. Of course, romantic fiction has always been at the frontline of a kind of culture war. “Reading romances”, or even just “novel-reading”, has been cause for concern among the cognoscenti for the best part of 300 years: Mr Collins, in Pride and Prejudice, is horrified that the Bennet sisters would rather read something from a travelling library than hear a sturdy sermon.Are today’s criticisms really so different? These books are derided as un-literary, formulaic. And what has happened to the thrill of stumbling on an indefinably brilliant novel by chance? “I don’t think that anyone needs to apologise right now (or ever) for seeking comfort in the familiar,” counters Wood. The world is full of chaos. There has to be room for reading as pure pleasure, for reading as escape. The genre of romantic fiction acts as a kind of playground for the reader. If the same basic plot point can unfold in a thousand different worlds in a thousand different ways, the reader can try a thousand different lives.“I rarely seek out tropes,” says Stewart. “[But what] I really love to find is a voice that embraces, celebrates and plays with the structures of a romance plot we already know really well.”“The – wrong – assumption,” she continues, “is that these tropes make romance books repetitive or boring or predictable. Brilliant writing – which exists in abundance in romance writing – knows how to surprise and trick the reader, even while doing something we think we already know. So, rather than feeling dulled when I see a trope in a romance book, I get a thrill out of seeing them coming. Oh, they’re on a road trip in a storm, are they? We are definitely driving head first into an only-one-bed scenario and I genuinely cannot wait to see how we land there … and what happens to the couple once we do.”If critics fear that trope-based storytelling is a threat to the delight of discovery and surprise, they might think of it as that stormy roadtrip: familiar landmarks, new detours, foreign snacks and lightning strikes. We fear it in the romantic novel most, perhaps, because only the romantic novel leans in. As in the best love affairs, these books and their readers wear their heart on their sleeve.Asking someone for their favourite trope is a deeply personal question – I, myself, could not have it waterboarded out of me – but there are dozens of forums and message boards where people share their most specific desires. Mostly, those books already exist. Mostly, there aremanypeople who share those dreams, or at least, can help a reader find what they’re looking for.A trope is to narrative as form or brushstroke is to a painting. It is possible, even usual, to like one more than others. I will always stop to look at a floral still life with big, deep colours and tiny little bugs. I like them old and Dutch. Dragging my mother round the Fitzwilliam Museum, one rainy day last autumn, we stood in mutual incomprehension before an exceptionally beautiful Rachel Ruysch. In vain I pointed out the beetle; the orange; the reflection of the 17th-century sky in the polished surface of the jug. “I think it’s lovely that you love it,” my mother said, generously. “I’m glad it’s here for you.”Which is, obviously, the only way to approach all art: it’s all for somebody. It’s all here for all of us, in infinite and glittering variety. The trope is a shortcut to delight. Here it is, the thing you wanted. Here is the thing you like best, the perfect book for you: something, somehow, as familiar as a friend, and as shiny as a jewel.Ella Risbridger is the author of In Love With Love: The Persistence and Joy of RomanticFiction(Sceptre).True romanceClassics reframed for a modern reader, by Sarah Moss and Sinéad MooneyBillionaire romanceLittle Women by Louisa May AlcottFour sisters growing up in 19th-century New England long for artistic fulfilment, exciting love lives, new clothes and good food. We meet them at Christmas, fantasising about brilliant futures while knitting socks for soldiers in the American civil war and preparing to give their Christmas dinner to starving refugees. Unfortunately, dreams of fulfilment and glamour contradict their parents’ Puritanism, so the girls will have to catch husbands without appearing to try. Meanwhile, over the garden fence, teenage Laurie is the heir to his grandfather’s immense fortune, and luxuriates daily in exotic fruit and ice-cream, playing his grand piano and fencing. Meg is too old for Laurie. Beth dies young. Jo can’t repress her queerness enough for anyone but a middle-aged German professor who needs help with his boys’ school, but once pretty blond Amy gives up her dreams of an artistic career, Laurie’s wall-to-wall carpets and opera tickets are all hers.Fake datingThe Wings of the Dove by Henry JamesKate Croy needs money. Her secret fiance Merton Densher needs money. They need a plan to enable them to marry. Solution: fake date a dying American heiress. Enter Milly Theale, who is rich, radiant and not long for this world. Kate encourages Merton to marry Milly so that they can eventually live happily ever after on his inheritance. Unfortunately, Merton catches real feelings, and Milly catches on to the scam. Fake dating becomes moral panic in a Venetian palazzo. Awkward, but everyone remains terribly polite, in extremely long sentences.Friendzone to loversFar from the Madding Crowd by Thomas HardyBathsheba Everdene inherits a farm. Her most reliable employee, Gabriel Oak, saves dying sheep, gives good agricultural advice, and quietly becomes her emotional support. After she rejects his proposal, he does the mature thing and sticks around, saving her hayricks from lightning and being respectful and competent in the background. Bathsheba, meanwhile, disastrously samples the local dating pool. Sergeant Troy is good at swordplay, bad at farming and in love with someone else: a walking red flag in a uniform. Obviously, Bathsheba marries him anyway, with predictably chaotic results. Troy fake-dies after gambling the farm into near ruin, then really dies when one of Bathsheba’s other ill-advised exes goes mad and shoots him. Throughout, friendzoned Gabriel remains loyal, practical and emotionally literate. Eventually Bathsheba realises that a man who fixes stuff and never causes problems is … really attractive.Sunny v grumpyTo the Lighthouse by Virginia WoolfMrs Ramsay’s daughters dream of “a wilder life”, perhaps in Paris, “not always taking care of some man or other”, but she herself is literally and figuratively married to the English bourgeoisie, and determined to enjoy it no matter how moody her husband and his tedious friends. She has her best epiphanies while knitting and weeding. Unlike many straight women in literature and perhaps life, she has found a way to love men without eroticising power. Mr Ramsay doesn’t notice the flowers she grows or the meals she cooks. She knows that he often thinks he would have written better books if he hadn’t married her, but even so he has “an eye like an eagle’s”, and somehow admiration for his great thoughts fuels her enduring sunshine.Holiday romanceA Room With a View by EM ForsterLucy Honeychurch arrives in Florence with her cousin Charlotte. They are meant to enjoy Italy in a respectable way, which means avoiding excitement, physicality, and anything Italian. Fortunately, the unsuitable George Emerson appears – brooding, impulsive and oblivious to social rules. Italy does what it always does in English novels: it causes inconvenient emotion. Lucy faints at a murder, George catches her mid-swoon, and they later share a kiss in a field of violets – an event so shocking that it nearly destroys the British empire at one fell swoop. Lucy, oscillating between desire and decorum, immediately suppresses the memory and flees back to England, where she becomes engaged to Cecil, a man with all the charm and spontaneity of an income tax form. George inconveniently reappears, reminding Lucy that passion, sunlight and honesty exist, even in the home counties.Sarah Moss’s latest novel is Ripeness (Picador). Dr Sinéad Mooney researches modernism and women’s writing."

It may be toys or monsters or fish, but it’s a human story that you can relate to,” he said.Ward says he has seen visitors recreating scenes from Pixar films: “They’re like, ‘Andy’s coming.’ They lie flat, like they’re a dead toy.”The exhibition opens before two new Pixar releases: next month’s original film Hoppers, about a girl who uses technology to turn herself into animals, and Toy Story 5 in June.View image in fullscreenThe house at the centre of Up, a 2009 film described by the Guardian as a‘masterclass in narrative exposition’.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianWard said he hoped Hoppers – which he described as “wild, very funny and very unorthodox” – might eventually find a place within the exhibition.He acknowledgeda degree of sequel fatigueamong some viewers in the run-up to Toy Story 5, but said Pixar’s plan was to continue striking “a balance”.He added: “The sequels are beloved [intellectual property] that people know. Have you a little bit less of a risk in making a sequel? In some regards – but it also helps fuel the desire for new originals.”Ward noted that as films approached their 20th anniversaries, interest often spiked as a new generation of parents wanted to share childhood favourites with their own children.Cars, released in 2006, is “coming back into the popular consciousness again”, which could pave the way for another instalment.View image in fullscreenLightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) on a set seen in the 2006 film Cars.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianPixar is learning how to adapt to shifting audience habits: more viewing at home, fewer cinema trips, shorter attention spans and a move towards quicker cuts in film-making. Even so, the studio aimed to retain its focus on producing “high-quality full-length films”, he said.“I do think that attention spans tend to be shorter. People are distracted. People are looking at a mobile device while they’re watching a movie now, which is incredible. You’re hearing stories of people saying: ‘Oh, you have to reiterate the plot three or four times to get it’,” Ward added.“I hope we’re not at that point. [But] if so, do we find a smarter way to do that? So it doesn’t feel like you’re beating people over the head with something.”Explore more on these topicsExhibitionsPixarLondonAnimation in filmWalt Disney CompanyUpToy StoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So when we asked Guide readers to share their memories of seeing now-massive bands and artists before they were famous, it was inevitable we’d get some great tales. So much so, in fact, that we’ve decided to devote the main chunk of this week’s Guide to your pre-fame gig recollections. We’ve also asked Guardian music writers – seasoned veterans of seeking out the next big thing – to share a few of their memories. Read on for tales of Kurt Cobain in Yorkshire, Playboi Carti’s set in an east London snooker club and an ill-advised David Bowie mime performance …PulpIn 1991, I was a young music writer starting out when I came across a pre-fame Pulp (pictured above) at a short-lived event called Piece Hall Live in Halifax. They shared the bill with the long-forgotten Bob, Levellers 5, and wondrous Todmorden oddballs Langfield Crane. The courtyard was sparsely populated when Pulp finally went on under the moonlight to perform a set containing the hardly chart-bound likes of Death II. However, they were absolutely captivating, and the setlist also included cult-classic single My Legendary Girlfriend, and Babies, which became the first of the run of killer singles which took them to bigger things two or three years later. Despite his messy hair and a fluffy jumper that looked like he’d found it in a skip, singer Jarvis Cocker was clearly a superstar in the making. “Top of the Pops by Christmas”, I wrote in Melody Maker. I never said which Christmas.Dave Simpson, Guardian music criticHaimView image in fullscreenCharisma … Haim photographed for the Guardian in 2012.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianBack in 2012, a close friend convinced me to cross London and join him at the Shacklewell Arms to see a trio of Californian sisters who, he promised, were a bit Fleetwood Mac-meets-Destiny’s Child. Even then, before they’d put out an EP, Haim’s stadium tour-grade potential shone, alongside their natural charisma and instrumental versatility. I left knowing I’d seen something special. (Also, in her now classic style, Este Haim told a truly unpublishable sexting anecdote that will remain secret except for the two dozen or so of us there that heard it that night.)Charlie Lindlar,acting deputy editor, newslettersDavid BowieIn 1969, I saw Tyrannosaurus Rex in concert. The third support act after a sitar player and John Peel reading his letters was David Bowie doing a strangeMarcel Marceau-type mime actto recorded sound effects. It was pretty rubbish and I knew he’d never make it.Millard Parkinson, LiverpoolGiggsI came of age in the MySpace era, and still frequently find myself pining for that web 2.0 feeling of finding a track no one else had heard of, ripping it on to a CD for your mates at school, and hoping you hadn’t just infected the family PC with deadly malware in the process. The MySpace era also meant the dawn of Underage festival in Victoria Park, which was THE place to be seen – ideally in some kind of Camden Market-sourced outfit, heavy black eyeliner, and giant plastic jewellery from the brand Lady Luck Rules OK (think Indie Sleaze: junior edition).It was at the festival, in 2010, that I saw the Peckham-born rapper Giggs perform, and was instantly taken with his pithy bars and slightly menacing air. He wasn’t a total unknown at that point, butTalkin Da Hardestwas yet to take on the mythic quality it has gained in the intervening years – dubbed the UK’s national anthem on Twitter and performed in locations as diverse as Worthy Farm and, er, an NFL game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. In the years since, Giggs has gone on to work with the likes of Drake and been name-checked by Jay-Z, a far cry from when the police used to try to shut down his shows. Maybe playing to a crowd of 16-year-olds wasn’t his dream show, but it was clearly a stepping stone on a hard-won path to the mainstream.Hannah J Davies,culture writer and editorColdplayView image in fullscreenNo roadies … Coldplay onstage in 2000.Photograph: Amanda Edwards/RedfernsI saw them at Bedford Esquires, just before Yellow broke. I’d actually gone to see the support band, Mercedes, but stayed to watch Coldplay alongside 15 to 20 other punters, which included the band members of Mercedes. I remember Chris Martin getting the hurry-up from the security bods to clear away their equipment (they had minimal, if any, roadies). Not long after, I saw the same bands at the Scala in London, just as Yellow was breaking into people’s consciousness –. There was a much different atmosphere, what with rumours of Kylie on the guest list (– which doesn’t sound quite so preposterous now!).”Dave Morgan, Beddington, SurreyThe Police“The Police. I saw them at theUniversity of Essex students’ union bar in Colchester, in 1978. My friend, who was at uni there, said, “Come down and see this band, at least they look pretty.” So we went, and they did. And they weren’t bad musicians either.Sharon Eckman, HitchinNirvanaOn 25 October 1989, a young American trio played their second British show– a second-act spot on a three-band bill at the Duchess of York in Leeds. The band was called Nirvana – not yet superstars, but with enough of a reputation that they and headliners Tad filled the back room of the pub. I’d like to say it was obvious they were destined for greatness, but that wasn’t clear then. And so, writing up the show for the University of Leeds’ student newspaper – one of my first reviews – I noted that Tad were destined for greatness, while Nirvana were a sludgy mess, and we’d be hearing no more from them. It didn’t seem to do them any harm (andlistening back to the show on YouTube, I still don’t think I was wrong, to be honest).Michael Hann, former music editor of the GuardianOasisI was DJing at an indie night at the much-missed Le Bateau in Liverpool. The advertised band were called Smaller but they asked me if their mates could do a set using their gear. Their mates were Oasis and they playeda short killer setto a tiny crowd months before they were signed. My finest night as a DJ!Kevin MacManus, LiverpoolPlayboi CartiView image in fullscreenMesmerising … Playboi Carti performing in New York in 2016.Photograph: JP Yim/Getty ImagesI’ve been lucky to witness a few US rap legends amid the wafting ocakbasi smoke of east London’s Kingsland Road. There was a thousand-yard-staring Future at the Nest in 2014, and in 2010, abusing my door-code privileges while working at The Nest, I snuck in to see Tyler, the Creator with his Odd Future brethren at the Three Crowns pub: their first UK gig. But perhaps the most incongruous performance from today’s vantage point was seeing Playboi Carti at a fifth birthday party for Dalston radio station NTS, in 2016. Today Carti is a gothically-tinged malcontent with a wizened lean-cured croak, playing arenas and creating mosh pits made up of thousands of 15-year-old boys. His next UK gig is in Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium, supporting the Weeknd. But back then, he was on a tiny stage in the corner of a snooker hall, the sound system gamely attempting to prop up his Atlantan bass, a spray of brightly coloured birthday balloons behind him rather dulling his edge – still, I couldn’t take my eyes off him even then.Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor of the GuardianTwenty One Pilots“What immediately popped into my mind was seeing Twenty One Pilots inI saw them in this dodgy club in a basement in Mesa, Arizona in March of 2013. If I said there were 50 people in attendance, that would be a generous estimate. As soon as the show was over, my mate and I turned to each other and both said at the same time, “DUDE! THIS BAND IS GOING BE HEADLINING ARENAS!”“Dude! This band is going to be headlining arenas!” Inevermake proclamations like that … especially at sparsely attended shows in a basements. The thing that was remarkable about the show was that, even though it was far from a sellout, Tyler and Josh treated it like it was an arena show. It was obvious thatthey Tyler and Josh aspired to eventually play arenas, and they knew that if they were going to get to that level they were going to need to treat every show as an arena show, regardless of the size of the venue and crowd.”Mark Chotiner, CaliforniaJames BluntOn my first international job as a green-gilled music writer in the spring of 2005, I watched a posh singer-songwriter and his band play a venue that would’ve warmly received the arrival of tumbleweed. Twenty-two people stood forlornly in front of the stage in that dive bar in Munich, but the man behind the microphone, the perma-grinning James Blunt, wasn’t bothered.He started the gig by bringing out a large crate of beer, the remains of his rider. “These are for you,” he announced. “If you know English, the last one of you to be sick is a ninny.” He yelled, “Hello, Deutschland!” soon after, a proper pop Alan Partridge, and covered – unnervingly – Pixies’ Where is My Mind?. He ended with the song that would become a global, inescapable hit by the end of the summer. I’d happily never hear You’re Beautiful again, but that gig was madly brilliant.Jude Rogers, Guardian folk music criticThe KillersIn the early 2000s, a flashy new indie band set for stardom seemed to surface on an almost weekly basis. As an NME writer I was lucky enough to see loads of them – Franz Ferdinand, the Cribs, Bloc Party, Kaiser Chiefs – before they became big. I wrote the NME’s first live review of the Killers, when they were still unsigned, and unknown enough to fit inside Camden’s Dublin Castle. “Few groups arrive on our shores as perfectly- formed as Tthe Killers,” I enthused, adding rather over-excitedly that they had “an arsenal of tunes so head-mashingly brilliant they’ll be beating your sweat-drenched ass around every corner of the dancefloor come this time next year”. Back then, frontman Brandon Flowers was actually an extremely shy 22-year-old, obsessed with British bands such as New Order and the Cure, but onstage that night he transformed into the sleek-suited showman we recognise today. I picked out Mr Brightside as their key banger, although I don’t think I could have predicted it would still be regularly in the UK charts 23 years later.The review had a somewhat comical afterlife. In 2017, I hosted a Guardian webchat with Flowers and drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr and someone asked them about their big break. – I was surprised when they started talking about “the guy who wrote our first NME live review”, clearly having no idea that said guy was in the room with them. Flowers seemed to believe it was the entire reason that they got signed, and saidsaying something to the effect of, “If only we could return the favour one day.” I bashfully revealed my identity. What was I expecting? A cut of future royalties? A simple one-off cash payment of $10,000 would have done me. Even a Snickers from the canteen vending machine would have been nice. Instead there was a strangely awkward silence, the pair seeming a bit unsure what to do, and we moved on to the next question.Tim Jonze, associate editor of Guardian CultureTo read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterPulpHaimDavid BowieGiggsColdplayNirvananewslettersShareReuse this content"

Others say having individual interests is imperative. I’ve read that couples whosleep in separate bedsare the happiest and I’ve also read that sleeping in separate beds is the death knell of romance. When I got engaged, I asked my parents – who have been married for 40 years – what advice they had for me, and my mother offered: “Contribute as much as you can to your retirement accounts.” OK!Ultimately, every couple (orthrouple!) is different – what works for some might not work for others. Still, we can always learn from each other. For Valentine’s Day, we asked Guardian readers to share their best relationship advice.Make life easier for each otherMany years ago, I came across George Eliot’s famous quote: “What do we live for if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?” Since then, I have never treated my relationships the same.I struggle with depression, which can make maintaining balance in a relationship extremely difficult. But if I can say to myself at the end of the day that I have done one thing – just one little thing – to make his life better, then I feel as if I haven’t failed the day entirely.– Brandi, North CarolinaCan being codependent in a relationship actually be a good thing?Read moreLower your expectationsHigh expectations for a partner can create conflict and disappointment. Learn to appreciate what you have, even if it’s not exactly what you want. This is an opportunity to expand your mind and your capacity for love. (Obviously, there are limits. You don’t need to accept abuse of any kind.)– Tim, retired, New YorkLaugh together oftenI met my wife in high school and fell in love with her instantly because she made me laugh. Over the past 20 years, we have grown and changed, but we are always laughing. During the hardest times of my life, making time to laugh together eased the pain. When my relationship with my father fell apart, my wife and I had just closed on our first home. She suggested we get naked and rub our butts on the walls since the house was ours now. We giggled and ran all over the house, even though I’d been crying not 10 minutes before. Laughter has saved our lives and made our marriage one of joy.–Ollie, 35, ColoradoRemember you’re different – not better or worseI’ve found that my long term relationships (friends and romances) work best when we recognize that we were all raised differently and our families did things differently and adjust accordingly.– Anonymous, IllinoisLearn how to have uncomfortable conversationsFor years, I thought my husband and I were soulmates because of how great we got along. We never fought, never argued, agreed on the important things and had a friendly and cordial relationship. What I didn’t realize was that neither of us had learned how to express our needs, especially if that need had the potential to be upsetting.One day last year, he told me he didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. It caught me completely off guard. He could not tell me why.

Don’t embark on a relationship where lying is the norm.– Anonymous,the UKLike the person you’re in love with …If you were stuck on an island, would this be the person you would want to be with?

We couldn’t, as flower farmers, legally use these toxic chemicals here in the UK.”Valentine’s Day is the flower industry’s busiest time of the year. According toanalysts, about 200m roses are produced to meet the demand for lovers’ gifts on 14 February in Europe alone.More than half on sale in the UK have been sourced from the Netherlands. But for most stems, that is just the last leg of a much longer journey from farms in countries such as Colombia,Kenyaand Ethiopia, where the climate allows for year-round production and laxer regulatory regimes allow for more powerful pesticides.To determine the levels of pesticide residues on flowers likely to be on sale this Valentine’s Day, Pesticide Action Network Netherlands (Pan-NL) randomly tested 17 bouquets – five bunches of roses, eight mixed bouquets, and four bunches of tulips.The highest concentration of pesticide residues was found on a bouquet of red roses bought from a Dutch garden centre, with 65.8 mg/kg. Of 26 pesticides detected on the sample, 13 were banned for use in the EU.None of the bouquets tested were pesticide-free, but the roses and mixed bouquets contained the most residues. Among those, the analysis found 87 different pesticides, including eight metabolites, roughly equally split between insecticides and fungicides.Of the 79 active substances found, almost a third were banned for use as “plant protection products” in the EU and the Netherlands, while 78% “pose[d] a significant risk to human health and/or the environment”, said Pan-NL. Among the pesticides Pan-NL found on the flowers were known neuro- and reproductive toxins, as well as carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.The findings come amid growingconcerns in the floristry sectoraround the chemicals to which workers are exposed and their health effects. But in producer countries,such as Kenya, the problems are even more acute.David Bek, a professor at the University of Coventry who researches the flower industry, described how the farms around Lake Naivasha, Kenya’s major flower-producing region, doused crops repeatedly in chemicals to keep pests at bay.“They are basically flower factories,”he said, with flowers grown in vast quantities in sealed polytunnels, then sorted, trimmed, bunched and packed by hundreds of workers in processing areas.Bek said spraying happened at almost every stage of the production process, but particularly as they prepared to ship. “That’s what they have to do to make sure they don’t end up with problems that mean the consignment will get rejected when it gets to the border.”So where does that leave those of us looking for a Valentine’s gift? Pan-NL recommended “organically grown seasonal flowers or organically grown ornamental plants”.And for those of us who do receive a “poison bouquet”? The advice is clear: “Don’t throw the remains on the compost heap or in the organic waste bin, but with residual waste. This prevents the toxins from being recycled in nature.”Explore more on these topicsValentine's DayPesticidesHealthNetherlandsEuropeKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

She and her children escaped seconds before the building exploded. Her husband Malcolm Baker died in the blaze.That night, Onody lost her husband, her home, her pets and her possessions.She also lost all her money. Shortly before he died, Baker had emptied their joint bank accounts and cancelled her mortgage protection and buildings insurance.Three years later, she faced losing the little she had left. The mortgage lender, Halifax, announced that it planned to repossess the property to pay off the £35,000 of mortgage arrears and other charges that had accrued since Baker’s death. That included the land around the ruins of her home, where she and her children have been living in a caravan ever since the fire.“It feels like my world has once again imploded,” she said when she first contacted Guardian Money in June last year. “I saw my home razed to the ground. I’ve scraped together to put a very basic roof over mine and my kids’ heads, and now the Halifax want to literally pull the ground out from under our feet.”This month, three-and-a-half years after the explosion, Onody, 53, was able to pay off the mortgage and take possession of the land. Halifax halted proceedings after Guardian Money intervened. It also cancelled the interest and fees that had accrued on the mortgage during Onody’s long legal battles to secure probate.View image in fullscreenHalifax suspended the repossession order after  Guardian Money intervened.Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianHer ordeal exposes the legal and financial obstacles faced by domestic abuse victims long after a relationship has ended.In the years since Baker’s death, she has had to challenge his will, which left her with nothing, battle banks and insurers, and fund a barrister to represent her at his inquest.Meanwhile, red tape at the Probate Office and the Land Registry left her in legal limbo for months.Worst of all, at one point she faced potential blame for Baker’s death when the Home Office commissioned a domestic homicide review to establish whether he was the abuse victim. The Home Office later apologised to her. It acknowledged in a letter that Baker was the perpetrator and that the investigation had “continued the dynamics of abuse” that Onody had suffered during the 18-year marriage.My husband’s campaign of financial and domestic abuse was strategically planned to continue after his deathFrancesca Onody“My husband’s campaign of financial and domestic abuse was strategically planned to continue after his death, and the subsequent lack of recognition and support from organisations has inflicted further years of fear on me,” she says.Onody’s nightmare began years before the explosion. Baker, a Metropolitan police superintendent, had become mentally unstable after retiring from the Met in 2011, his inquest was told. He was also a heavy drinker. Onody says matters escalated when she demanded a divorce.“He became more vindictive, threatening to ruin mine and my kids’ lives,” she says. “On one occasion he left a dead rabbit in my bed. We lived in a constant state of anxiety, wondering whether in a drunken stupor or one of his rages he might destroy our house around us while we slept.”Baker began stockpiling canisters of petrol in the family home, Onody says, and she made frequent calls to the police as his behaviour became more threatening.View image in fullscreenThe remains of the family home after it was set alight.Photograph: Francesca OnodyOn his final night, she had dialled 999 after a confrontation. Baker barricaded himself in an upstairs bedroom when officers arrived. Onody and her children were downstairs when petrol began streaming through the sitting room ceiling. Police evacuated the house, which caught fire seconds later and exploded. Baker, still barricaded upstairs, could not be saved.Onody and her children moved into a caravan alongside the ruin without heating or piped water. Since the deeds to the property and the mortgage were in Baker’s sole name, she was unable to sell the land or apply to rebuild the cottage.It took her 28 months to successfully contest his will under theInheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Actand to be appointed as personal representative of the estate.During that time, she was not authorised to discuss the mortgage with the Halifax since she was not named in probate.She took over the administration of the estate in February 2025 and discovered that in the interim, £34,700 of mortgage arrears and legal fees had built up, and a repossession order had been issued by the Halifax.I am being punished for my husband’s actions, with the Halifax now acting in his place as financial controller and abuserFrancesca Onody’s impact statementHalifax, she claims, initially agreed to allow her to remortgage the estate in her own name so she could sell the land, but last June it withdrew the offer and warned her that the property would be repossessed unless she paid off the debt within two months.It is at that point that Onody first contacted the Guardian for help.“I am being punished for my husband’s actions, with the Halifax now acting in his place as financial controller and abuser,” she said in an impact statement. “If I had a mortgage in my name and lodged with Land Registry, I would be able to move forward with my plan to sell the land, pay off all debts and build us a home and a secure, fear-free future.”Halifax suspended the repossession order after Guardian Money questioned its handling of the case. It agreed to transfer the mortgage into her name once the deeds to the property had been amended to show her as the owner. It also admitted that a staff member had erroneously worked on a mortgage application for her last February and paid her £500 as an apology.View image in fullscreenIn the years since Baker’s death, Onody has had to challenge his will, which left her with nothing.Photograph: YAY Media AS/AlamyA spokesperson for Halifax said: “We recognise the very difficult and complex situation Ms Onody faced. While trying to support her as she awaited the court’s decision on the disputed will, we could have explained more clearly what we were able to do and what steps she needed to take to transfer the deeds.“We’re sorry we didn’t provide the level of support she needed at first. To put this right, we paused recovery action against the estate indefinitely to give her time to complete the deed transfer, paid her £500 compensation, and reduced the mortgage balance by over £21,000 to the date of her husband’s death.“We’ve always been willing to discuss mortgage options once the deeds were in her name, but we understand her decision to sell the land and move on.”The Land Registry agreed to expedite the application for the transfer of deeds when we got in touch.Onody became legal owner of the land in November, and this month she paid off the mortgage.Perpetrators will use any tool at their disposal to maintain control and cause earth-shattering harm to victim-survivorsSam Smethers, Surviving Economic AbuseShe now hopes to sell the land and buy a property elsewhere to rebuild a life with her children.“It’s been a really tough time for years,” she says, “but I’m ever-optimistic that there can be some degree of happy ending.”The Financial Conduct Authority introduced new rules in 2023 to force financial firms to improve support for vulnerable customers.The Consumer Dutyrequires companies to act flexibly to protect customers in vulnerable situations but, according to the charitySurviving Economic Abuse, victims like Onody are still being failed.“This story is a heartbreaking but sadly all-too-common reflection of the devastating harm caused by economic abusers,” says its chief executive Sam Smethers.“Perpetrators will use any tool at their disposal – from insurance products to joint mortgages – to maintain control and cause earth-shattering harm to victim-survivors. Financial services [companies] have made significant progress in the support they offer victim-survivors of economic abuse, but there’s still a long way to go.”In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

I would do it all day if I thought people couldn’t see me.I’m currently staring out of our front window, arms folded, at the large puddle running along the road’s edge outside our house.It normally appears after a sustained period of rain, and disappears after a day or two. But as a dedicated observer of things happening outside this window, I can testify that the puddle has now been there for three uninterrupted months. It’s a foot deep in the middle and too wide to jump across – more moat than puddle. I’ve come to suspect that rain has nothing to do with it: the puddle is being fed by an underground source.Today’s events seem to confirm my opinion: as I watch, a man in a hi-vis vest is placing cones around the edge of the puddle.“This is a big day for you, isn’t it?” my wife says. I don’t know how long she’s been standing right behind me.“It’s a big day for all of us,” I say, without turning round.“Something is actually happening outside your window,” she says.I have a terrible feeling that when my wife says we need to do something about these curtains, she might mean today“I knew if I was patient, this moment would come,” I say.“We need to do something about these curtains,” she says.I have an idea what she’s talking about: the curtains are heavy, and over time large horizontal tears have appeared on the lining side. This looks terrible, but only if you’re outside looking in, and only when the curtains are drawn. I do not consider this any kind of priority.But I have a terrible feeling that when my wife says we need to do something about these curtains, she might mean today. I’m in the process of formulating a non-committal reply when I turn round and see she’s holding a ladder.“Oh no!” I say.“It’s not like you’re doing anything else,” she says. “You’re literally staring out the window.”“It has cognitive benefits!”Knowing my tendency to panic when an unscheduled chore appears in my day, my wife speaks in a soothing voice.“I think if you can just take them down, I might be able to unpick the lining,” she says.“Fine,” I say, hoping that the unpicking part will take more than a day, pushing the reinstallation into next week.Once I climb the ladder I recall that these curtains and I have a lot of history. I remember the era when the right curtain would roll completely off the end of the track and collapse to the floor every time you tried to open it, until I invented some bodged a remedy that still seems to be working.It takes 15 minutes to unhook both curtains, by which time the men in the street are gone. Whatever happened out there is over, and I missed it.“So yeah, you get unpicking,” I say. “And I’ll be out in the kitchen just looking at …”“I don’t think it’s going to work,” my wife says. “Look, the lining is all sewn up into the pleats.”“Oh dear,” I say.“Maybe I could just cut it across the top,” she says. “But will that look even worse?”“You have a think,” I say. “Take your time.”I make a coffee and take it to my office, with a vague plan to sit in there for the rest of the day. After half an hour, my wife comes to find me.“I’ve had an idea,” she says.“Uh-oh,” I say, following her back to the living room.She points to the curtains hanging over the side door, which looks out onto a brick wall.“Let’s put these,” she says, “over there.”“Really?” I say. “Are they the same size?”“Let’s measure,” she says.The curtains are not the same size: to swap them will also require the transfer of six curtain sliders – three per side.“Even so,” I say, “one set of curtains will never fully close. And the other will never fully open.”“It’s still better,” my wife says.The switch takes over an hour. The only reason it doesn’t take longer is because my wife decides she prefers the side door curtainless.“Really?” I say. “Won’t it be cold?”“We can try it for a couple of weeks, and see,” she says.“I like the sound of that,” I say, folding up the ladder.The afternoon stretches before me, except there’s no milk, so I put on my coat and head to the shops. On my return I notice a sign has gone up in front of the house, announcing remedial work on the puddle, by the water company, beginning a week hence. A date, I think, for the diary.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means that with a single strike on a heating plant, Moscow can wipe out heating for whole neighbourhoods.Graphic showing how water is heated in a central plant and pumped into residential buildings using networks of pipesUkraine says that all such power stations have now been hit during the course of the full-scale war. These thermal power plants often also produce electricity, leaving people cold and in the dark.Kyiv has been the main target of such attacks this year, with heavy bombardment of thermal power plants and sub-stations that pump the hot water.People in the capital live in 20th-century Soviet Union apartment blocks that were mass-produced out of concrete panels and are calledpanelki. Cities across the former USSR aredotted with these multi-storey residential buildings, which were built during a postwar housing shortage in the 1950s and 1960s.The heating system was considered efficient, and can serve tens of thousands of people across entire neighbourhoods.But a centralised infrastructure is inherently vulnerable to attack. Russian bombardment this year has left about 3,500 apartment buildings in Kyiv without heating, according to mayor Vital Klitschko.Map of disconnected housesThere are frequent capital-wide blackouts restricting electricity to three or four hours a day. Authorities in Kyiv have set up tents where local residents can go for warmth.The intense bombardment has coincided with bitterly cold conditions. The lowest temperature recorded this year at a weather station in Kyiv was -20.7C on 2 February. Average daily temperatures have not risen above freezing this year.Several people have frozen to death, and some residents have started to dig cesspits as the water system fails.Graph showing average daily temperature in Kyiv.Other cities have also been badly hit. Nearly 300,000 people were left without power and water supply in the southern city of Odesa after a Russian attack, the deputy prime minister, Oleksiy Kuleba, said this week. More than 10,000 consumers were also left without heating in the south-eastern city of Dnipro.View image in fullscreenA woman walks past a government-run humanitarian aid point on 12 January 2026.Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersThe European Commission last month said it would deploy 447 emergency generators.“The EU will not let Russia freeze Ukraine into submission and will continue helping Ukrainians get through this winter,” the commission has said.Graph showing daily number of strikes.Russian attacks have also disrupted electricity infrastructure, meaning backup generators or battery packs can fail, leaving people with very few options to keep warm.The Facebook account of the Kyiv city state administrationposted an imageof candles held underneath bricks, which it said was used as a rudimentary but dangerous source of heat.

Green baize is laid on the muddy garden path between posts painted with equal bands of green, white and red, the colours of the Islamic republic’s flag.They come to remember the supreme leader who, in a chapter of history little known outsideFrance, spent four months in the town in the late 1970s before his triumphant return to Tehran as the leader of the Islamic revolution.View image in fullscreenThe town of Neauphle-le-Château is a 90-minute drive west of Paris.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianThe fact this is commemorated every year in a small town in Île-de-France evokes a deep grievance among local people, and particularly this year. That their home has become synonymous with a regime in Tehran accused of killing thousands, some say tens of thousands, in a continuing crackdown, feels, they say, like a betrayal. Rather than remembering, they would rather forget.“People prefer not to speak of it. It’s a moment in history that has nothing to do with us,” says Pascal Pagand, who owns the Café des Sports in the town square, the hub of local life.“I know it still annoys people. They don’t understand why he was given sanctuary here … The town wasn’t asked or consulted. It was imposed; people had no choice. I wasn’t here back then, but those who were here remember it as a difficult time.”View image in fullscreenPascal Pagand, the owner of Café des Sports, says ‘people don’t understand why he was given sanctuary’.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianVisitors have been making the annual pilgrimage to Neauphle-le-Château for 47 years. In October 1978, the then French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, agreed to allow Khomeini to settle in France after his expulsion from Iraq.D’Estaing was persuaded that the Shia cleric would be a democratic alternative to the autocratic Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the erratic shah whose regime was in its dying days. The Frenchman also believed Khomenei would reward Paris’s hospitality with lucrative contracts establishing France as a counterweight to US influence in the region.Photographs and newsreel from the time show Khomeini meditating under an apple tree in the garden of 23 Route de Chevreuse. Inside, his acolytes prepared hundreds of cassette recordings of Khomeini urging Iranians to rise up, tapes that were flown to Tehran to be spread secretly across Iran.Nowadays there is nothing left of the two-storey house that was destroyed many years ago. Locals believe it was “plastiqué” (blown to bits), either by French secret services or by angry Pahlavi supporters after Khomeini left. The force of the explosion cracked the windows of neighbouring homes, they say.View image in fullscreenKhomeini and his acolytes in the garden of 23 Route de Chevreuse.Photograph: Gilbert Uzan/Gamma-Rapho/GettyIn France, leftwing intellectuals hailed Khomeini as the new Gandhi, among them Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault, who would later regret setting up a Khomeini support committee, ignoring Simone de Beauvoir’s warnings that the radical version of Islam he espoused threatened women’s rights.On 1 February 1979, 15 days after Pahlavi fled into exile, Khomeini flew – first-class on Air France courtesy of the French government – to Tehran. He was greeted by ecstatic crowds and within days had established the theocratic dictatorship that has ruled Iran ever since.View image in fullscreenA portrait of the writer Marguerite Duras, who lived in Neauphle-le-Château, hangs in Café des Sports.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianIn Neauphle-le-Château, what irks locals is the sense that the town is on the map for the wrong reason. Why can itnot be remembered for the novelist andplaywright Marguerite Duraswho lived and wrote there? Why not for Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, the Cognac and bitter-orange liqueur, created and produced there until, like Khomeini, it moved elsewhere?Sitting under a photograph of Duras at a corner table in the Café des Sports, Jean-Claude Cintas, an artist and film-maker, summed up the collective dismay. “Most people here would rather Neauphle-le-Château was known for Marguerite Duras and Grand Marnier,” he said.View image in fullscreenFilm-maker Jean-Claude Cintas would rather the town be remembered for Marguerite Duras.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianCintas remembers seeing Khomenei on his way to pray and recalls the widespread support for him in France. “At the time, the left was very much for Khomeini and didn’t have a word to say against him,” he said.“It was only 10 years after May 1968,” he added, referring to the leftwing student-led revolt that almost brought down the French government. “It was an extraordinary era. The shah was basically in the bin and if you were leftwing you were for Khomeini.“But he was not at all welcome locally. It wasn’t aimed at him personally, because people didn’t know who he was at first; it was because the town was suddenly overrun with journalists and police and it caused chaos.”Cintas added: “Suddenly every time the town was mentioned, it was in connection with Khomeini. It’s been like it for 47 years now and we feel that’s not what we are about.”In Tehran, long after Khomenei’s death aged 86 in 1989, Neauphle-le-Château has become part of the city’s geography. The street on which the French embassy sits was changed to rue Neauphle-le-Château.While most French people over the age of 50 will immediately associate Neauphle-le-Château with Khomeini,thetown has been making efforts to bury the memories. Three years ago, during the protests resulting from thedeath in police custodyofMahsa Amini, who had been arrested three days earlier for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code for women, a commemorative board at the property on Route de Chevreusebearing Khomeini’s portrait was vandalised. The town hall ordered its removal and decreed there should be no permanent sign marking his stay.Iran sentences Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi to seven more years in prisonRead moreElisabeth Sandjivy, the mayor of Neauphle, told French media at the time: “I would like the town of Neauphle to no longer be associated with this part of history that has been imposed on it, because it was the government that gave permission for the ayatollah to stay here.”French media reported that an official request from Tehran to create a museum on the site had been met with a definitive “non”. Attempts by the Guardian to speak to Sandjivy were unsuccessful.“Locals will tell you they don’t care about the town’s association with the Ayatollah Khomeini and they don’t want to talk about it, but deep down it still rankles,” said Cintas. “It’s not what we want our town to be remembered for.View image in fullscreenNeauphle-le-Château was overrun with journalists wanting to speak to Khomeini in 1979.Photograph: Daniel Simon/Gamma-Rapho/Getty“Khomeini spent only four months living on the very outskirts of the town, but his stay has thrown a shadow over the entire place especially with what has happened since.“There is a sense of betrayal: we gave him sanctuary and instead of democracy this is what he did.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They set shops on fire and forced the whole village to flee,” Ibrahim said.He added that many villagers fear returning as the gunmen remain nearby.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He was an engineering student in Venezuela and fled in 2024 after being beaten by police while protesting against the dictatorship there, first to Colombia and then north. He had an appointment in the US to request asylum under the Biden administration but instead was arrested and accused of being a member of the dangerous Venezuelan criminalgang Tren de Araguabecause he had some tattoos, despite no evidence being presented of actual gang connections.View image in fullscreenA handout photo made available by the Presidency of El Salvador shows guards at the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) prison transferring Venezuelans on 16 March 2025.Photograph: Presidency of El Salvador/EPAThe judge acknowledged that if any of the men return to the US to argue in court, it was his understanding that “they will be detained upon their arrival”.Muñoz Pinto said: “Do you have any idea what my family went through after finding out I was sent to that prison in El Salvador? I went from chasing a dream to work and support my family to being humiliated by guards beating me in the face and my entire body.”On the night of Saturday 15 March last year, the Trump administrationabruptly deportedmore than250 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, defying a court block and orders that any such flightsshould turn around.Images then emerged of the men shackled held bent over by baton-wielding Salvadoran police, before their heads were shaved and they were imprisoned atthe notorious Cecot mega-prison. Formerdetainees saidthey were told they would die there, and had no outside communications with lawyers or family. Then last July they were returned to Venezuela in a US-brokeredprisoner swap.Venezuelans sent by Trump to El Salvador endured systematic torture, report findsRead moreBoasberg on Thursday told the Trump administration to prioritize the deportees currently living in third countries but also explain “the feasibility of returning plaintiffs still in Venezuela”, while US-Venezuela relations remain vexed.A White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, blasted Boasberg’s ruling, saying in a statement it was “an absurd, unlawful ruling from a far-left judicial activist trying to undermine the president’s lawful authority to carry out deportations”.She added: “Americans elected President Trump based on his promise to deport criminal illegal aliens and Make America Safe Again. Boasberg has no right to stop the will of the American people, and this will not be the final say on the matter.”Lee Gelernt, the lead ACLU attorney in the case, said he was aware of only a small group of the deportees living outside Venezuela.Boasberg’s order in principle applies to the 137 men deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act invoked by Donald Trump, when the US president made an unprecedented claim that the US was being “invaded” by gang members allegedly with ties to the Venezuelan state. The others sent to Cecot last year were deported under regularUS immigrationlaw and are not covered by the current case.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Cecot, where Luis Muñoz Pinto was imprisoned along with other Venezuelans deported from the US.Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images“It is worth emphasizing that this situation would never have arisen had the government simply afforded plaintiffs their constitutional rights before initially deporting them,” Boasberg said on Thursday.However, he added that the number of men who may seek to return to the US “would be likely very small if not zero”.Muñoz Pinto is torn.“I know Trump deported me to Cecot and I’m not over that nightmare yet, but the US is still the land of opportunities,” he said.He was deported under the Alien Enemies Act, he said, a fact which the Guardian verified via sources familiar with the case, who were not authorized to speak openly on the matter.Before Boasberg’s latest order, the ACLU had argued in court that the men should have the right to either return to the US or have a remote hearing to challenge their deportation.In January, lawyers for the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,argued in a courtfiling that bringing the 137 men back into the US “would risk material damage to the US foreign policy interests in Venezuela”.Even remote hearings, lawyers for Rubio added, “also present a serious risk of intentional interference by anti-American elements in Venezuela that would undermine the interests of justice”.Human rightsinvestigators foundthat Cecot guards dished out beatings,torture,denial of foodandalleged sexual assault. Lawyers for some of the Venezuelans saidthey endured“state-sanctioned torture”.El Salvador’s government does not make efforts to publicly rebut allegations of violence and deprivation amounting to torture. The president,Nayib Bukele, respondedsarcasticallyto allegations of cruelty at Cecot made by Hillary Clinton last year. Some online influencers areinvited into make videos of the harsh conditions.View image in fullscreenGuards overlook a module holding thousands of accused gang members imprisoned at Cecot in Tecoluca, El Salvador.Photograph: John Moore/Getty ImagesBefore Boasberg’s latest ruling, Muñoz Pinto had also spoken to the Guardian in person, in Bogotá, in his first non-TV interview. He was briefly featured on CBS’s 60 Minutes show, aired in the USlast month.Muñoz Pinto recounted that on arrival at Cecot: “Three guards threw me to the ground and kicked me in the face so badly that it caused me a nosebleed and all my gums bled too.”He added: “I started to cry because I didn’t know what to do, I had tried to be a good man since I was little, I had gone to college, I had tried to help my parents, who are still sick in Venezuela, and I was then in the worst prison on the entire planet and I had not committed a crime.”Old friends inColombiahelped him find work delivering food across Bogotá, arguing it was a better opportunity to support his family financially than he could get in Venezuela.Muñoz Pinto said: “This court decision is devastating because I want to go back [to the US], yes, but why do they want me detained again? How many months this time? I am not sure if I can do it again.”Additional reporting by the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationVenezuelaAmericasColombianewsShareReuse this content"

Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance.Anthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed.Anthropic raises $30bn in latest round, valuing Claude bot maker at $380bnRead moreA spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims.The WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership withPalantirTechnologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims.The US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. TheUS militaryhas used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.Critics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.AI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.This more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.The Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)VenezuelaAmericasChatbotsPalantirUS militaryTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Then, as the realisation that he had won gold forBrazilin the men’s giant slalom, he collapsed to the floor and allowed the tears to flow.“I just hope that Brazilians look at this and truly understand that your difference is your superpower,” he said, still sobbing away. “It may show up in your skin or in the way you dress. But I hope this inspires every kid out there who feels a bit different to trust who you are.”From vertigo to Van Gogh: 10 things you may have missed at the Winter OlympicsRead moreOn the back of his helmet, Pinheiro Braathen has in big letters “Vamos Dancar” – “Let’s Dance.” And he certainly did that on his first run, establishing a stunning 0.95sec lead over the Swiss legend Marco Odermatt.Braathen’s performance was so good that only seven skiers were within two seconds of his pace, and while he leaked away some of his advantage with some ragged turns in his second run, he held his nerve to win gold by 0.58sec. “It really was one hell of a first run and I was able to keep composed and balanced in the second run,” explained the 25-year-old who collapsed to the snow at the finish before rising up and holding his skis aloft.

Pinheiro Braathen was born to a Brazilian mother and Norwegian father in Oslo and reluctantly took up skiing at the age of eight after being introduced to the sport by his father. He was raised speaking both Norwegian and Portuguese.He competed for Norway at the Beijing Games, where he failed to finish in either giant slalom or slalom, before stunning the sport when he split with the Norwegian federation and retired after winning the World Cup slalom title in 2023, saying he was not able to express himself or have the freedom to work with his own sponsors.View image in fullscreenFans with Brazilian flags urge Lucas Pinheiro Braathen to Olympic glory.Photograph: Fredrik Sandberg/TT/ShutterstockIn 2024, Pinheiro Braathen returned to the slopes in the colours of Brazil, the birthplace of his mother Alessandra and where he spent several years of his childhood.

As I said before these Games started, Brazil is not here to participate. We are going to bring a difference. That was my goal. I’ve dreamed about this for so long, that if I followed my heart I could finish off on top. And that’s why I am an Olympic champion today.”Odermatt, the reigning Olympic champion, took silver.

Both Carney and Poilievre fought back tears as they spoke with victims’ families for the first time.The two, who have clashed politically in recent weeks, have set aside partisan differences in order to show a unified front – a move welcomed by residents of the town.“Today, there are no Conservatives.

Operations froze over the course of the year due to safety concerns, shrinking access and unpopularity.The major operator Neuron and its subsidiary Beam reduced their combined fleets by nearly a 10th over the year, to about 12,500 e-scooters across 24 locations.Catalyst for change or community menace? What’s next for Australia’s e-bike revolutionRead morePerth pulled about 1,000 rental e-scooters from its streets after aman died in an e-scooter crash. A subsequent Western Australian inquiry found e-mobility could be brought back in under tight regulation.In Bendigo, Beam’s 250 scooters were pulled from streets after users took less than 55,000 trips,missing expectations, while the City of Adelaide said ridership of its 2,000-strong fleet fell from 543,000 trips in 2024 to 514,000 in 2025.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailNeuron and Lime pulled scooters from Melbourne’s Yarra area after the council hiked fees, having already beingforced out of the central business district in 2024.Stephen Coulter, an industry consultant with Zipidi, blamed the e-scooter slowdown on a “moral panic” about safety and injuries.“You’ve had moral panic, which has caused some [local governments] to overreact, like the City ofMelbourne, who just withdrew them overnight back in September 2024,” he said.Coulter said state governments could help e-scooters return in 2026, with the Victorian and New South Wales governments approving share scheme operators, while WA and Queensland to respond to state inquiries.In the meantime, residents in Melbourne had swapped to Lime’s ebikes, Coulter said.“Bikes are picking up in the absence of scooters and the operators are becoming better at aligning them with customer need,” he said.Ebikes cluttering Sydney footpaths to be swept aside by new bill – but riders may bear brunt of levyRead moreCities that previously only adopted e-scooters have moved towards bikes. Hobart adopted Beam bikes in May, Canberra invited applications for ebike and e-scooter operations and Adelaide will issue a similar invitation this year.Lime’s Asia-Pacific head, Will Peters, said the company had been disheartened when Melbourne forced out its e-scooters but was hopeful of growing its ebike offering.It is capped at operating 1,200 ebikes across inner Melbourne but has debuted bikes and scooters in the Darebin municipality and is watching for a chance to expand into nearby Merri-bek.Peters said Lime had experienced the greatest uptake in Sydney, where e-scooter use is illegal, including for shared schemes.View image in fullscreenTwo Neuron e-scooters.Photograph: Sally Robertson/AlamyIt more than doubled its Sydney fleet to at least 7,000 ebikes in 2025, according to Guardian Australia analysis of public data, though industry sources have suggested the true figure could be higher than 10,000. The company declined to share fleet data.Lime is bidding to boost its ridership further in Sydney, offering redesigned bikes and subscriber discounts as it negotiates to expand as far west as Parramatta.“How do we make Sydney the best market?” Peters said. “I think we can be bigger than London, we can be bigger than Paris.”Ebikes boomed in Paris after the first European city to invite shared e-scooters also became the first to ban them in 2023.Sydney’s lack of scooters has supported rapid growth in rental ebike use, with 600,000 NSW residents now using a shared ebike monthly – 100,000 more than in October, government data suggests.The City of Sydney reported shared ebike trips in the central business district nearly doubled in 2025, to 3.7m. Demand has attracted competition, with HelloRide operating 3,000 ebikes and Ario bringing a fleet of 2,700 since it entered in late 2024.Shared bikes are legal for road use, restricted to speeds of 25km/h and power of 250 watts, unlike illegal and modified ebikes which haveattracted government crackdownsamid a nationwidesurge in injuries.E-scooters and other personal mobility devices were involved in 10 deaths and 440 crashes in Queensland in 2025, preliminary police data shows. Legal ebikes, both privately owned and rented, were involved in four deaths and 235 crashes.Rapid adoption of e-scooters had brought some “novelty-driven behaviour” and challenges that cities weren’t expecting, while ebikes build on existing cycling culture, according to Adam Rossetto, general manager of Ario, which also operates scooters in far north Queensland.“[Shared] ebikes are coming back into the fore,” Rossetto said. “They provide a more traditional approach to mobility … that delivers less stupidity, I think, from a section of users.”Explore more on these topicsTransportCyclingConsumer affairsCommutingElectric vehiclesRoad safetySydneynewsShareReuse this content"

What does that tell us about Australians’ attitudes towards debt – and how does it affect interest rates?For much of 2024 and early 2025, goods inflation was weak amid a cost-of-living crisis before suddenly accelerating.AMP’s head of investment strategy and chief economist, Shane Oliver, says the spending patterns show that Australians just needed a bit of financial relief to feel confident again.How did Australia's housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing's fault? – video“People seem to be withstanding higher levels of debt than previously thought,” Oliver says.Breville reported double-digit revenue growth in Australia over the past six months, backed by surging coffee machine sales. While some customers bought simple drip devices and, at the other end of the price scale, touchscreen brew-to-order machines, most bought middle-class models priced at about $700.The premium furniture retailer Nick Scali reported a 13% lift in sales revenue from its Australian and New Zealand business unit while also expanding profit margins.Meanwhile, revenue at online retailer Temple & Webster increased 20% – although many customers waited for discounts, crimping the company’s profitability.‘Squat’ cans and rented clothes: cash-strapped younger Australians drive demand for ‘little luxuries’Read moreSuch discretionary purchases were made despite very high household debt in Australia, both historically and compared with the rest of the world.While mortgage and rental stress is traditionally defined as spending more than 30% of pre-tax income on loan repayments and rent, many Australians are now either comfortable with (or resigned to) the fact that they will breach this metric due to high housing costs.It appears that as long as someone has a job, and Australia has robust employment levels, they are willing to spend.‘Upgrading the car’Ashwin Clarke, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank, says Australians have been willing to spend on discretionary items such as household goods as easing inflation and rate cuts brought respite after some “pretty tough” years.“We had three interest rate cuts last year which also helped to boost household incomes,” Clarke says. “We have seen mortgagees increase their spending more than other housing cohorts over the last several months.”CBA’s analysis of de-identified payments data from 7 million customers found household spending rose 0.5% in January,marking 16 consecutive months of growth.Its data shows that consumers splashed out on tickets, travel and fitness, with major events including the Australian Open tennis and summer festivals drawing strong crowds.It also noted strong purchases of clothing and hardware.There is also evidence that mortgage-free young adults are seeking ways to navigate affordability pressures without completely giving up on indulgences,even if that means plunging deeper into debt.This contrasts with the historical, cautious response of forgoing discretionary items altogether when facing financial pressure.Prof Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, says those aged over 55 remain the cohort most likely to buy durable goods.“They’re updating tv sets, they’re travelling … they’re upgrading the car,” he says. “They’re the big spenders at the moment.”When the RBA lifted the cash rate this month, ending its shortest rate cut cycle in 30 years, it cited housing and consumer durables as key drivers of a resurgence in underlying inflation.The RBA also noted there wereconstraints on the economy’s ability to deliver the things people and businesses demanded, leading to higher prices.Although consumer durables are still a modest contributor to the rise in the consumer price index, central bankers see them as a “canary in the coalmine” for the broader economy, given that they could usher in more permanent inflationary pressures that are hard to reverse.While the central bank anticipated demand for both housing and consumer durables to slow, bringing down inflation in these sectors, it warned this outlook was “highly uncertain”.The question now turns to whether rising inflation will sour sentiment, or if Australians will keep buying more couches and coffee machines.While this earnings season has delivered mixed answers to that question, shares in Nick Scali plunged by more than 15% after it released its earnings on Friday.Investors were reacting to weaker-than-expected January sales figures, which could indicate some of last year’s buying enthusiasm is already waning as cost-of-living pressures reignite.Explore more on these topicsConsumer spendingAustralian economyConsumer affairsInterest ratesInflationReserve Bank of AustraliaRetail industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

The case against him was dropped in 2023 in the wake of his death, with no other person charged.Prosecutors said an investigation had shown Brunel was “a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein” who had offered modelling jobs to young girls from poor backgrounds.He had engaged in sexual acts with underage girls in the United States, the US Virgin Islands, Paris and the south ofFrance, they said.Ten women had made accusations against Brunel, several describing how they had been led to drink alcohol and had been subjected to forced sexual penetration, according to the prosecutor’s office.Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.The prosecutor’s office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities.“An investigation is under way to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report,” the prosecutor’s office stated.Police set up national group to deal with UK-related Epstein allegationsRead moreThe prosecutor’s office has also received a complaint filed by a Swedish woman against Daniel Siad, a model recruiter with close ties to Epstein. She accused him of “sexual acts that she describes as rape and that may have been committed in France in 1990”.The office has also received a complaint filed against French conductor Frédéric Chaslin, alleging acts of sexual harassment allegedly committed in 2016, it said.The latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position as head of a top cultural body, the Arab World Institute.Lang has, however, denied any wrongdoing, saying he was “shocked” that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company Epstein founded in 2016.The office of the national financial prosecutor said it had opened a preliminary investigation for “aggravated tax fraud and money laundering” against Lang and his daughter Caroline Lang.Following this announcement, Lang resigned from the presidency of the Arab World Institute.Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children, in what the US authorities ruled was a suicide.Explore more on these topicsFranceJeffrey EpsteinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Some EU officials have put the date as early as 2027.Speaking to the annual Munich security summit, Ukraine’s president said he hoped “the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all of us but, honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things”.“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, notRussia,” he added.The issue of Europe’s frustration with a perceived US reluctance to spell out the security guarantees it is prepared to offer Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, and the need for the guarantees to be spelled out before an agreement is signed, likely remains the biggest wound in the badly fractured relationship between the US andEurope.In a speech that was welcomed by European leaders keen to see any sign of a thaw in the relationship, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, put forward an offer to work in partnership with Europe.However, this proposition, he stressed, was highly conditional and the US would go it alone if Washington’s highly Trumpian conditions were not met on climate, migration and tariffs.Using a diplomatic tone that the US vice-president, JD Vance, shunned in his speech at the conference a year ago, Rubio said “Europe and the US belong together”.He added that the US was ready to undertake the task of rebuilding the world order alone if necessary, but “we prefer it – and hope – to do it together with you, our friends in Europe”.He made almost no reference to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, besides claiming that the US had pressed India to stop importing Russian oil, a claim Russia disputes.At a press conference in Munich, Zelenskyy said the US had told him that if Ukraine withdrew from the Donbas, peace would come as quickly as possible, but he insisted this concession was not possible since Ukrainians live there.He disclosed that the US had so far offered a 15-year security guarantee, but Ukraine wanted a minimum 20-year, legally water-tight agreement, setting out the specific help the US would provide to a planned European reassurance force due to be put inside Ukraine in the event of a peace deal.How a Soviet-era heating system exposes Ukraine to Russian attack – a visual guideRead moreDetails of a so-called prosperity plan whereby the US would have access to Ukrainian mineral resources had not yet been exchanged, Zelenskyy said.He also queried why the head of the Russian negotiation delegation had been changed, saying he feared it meant the Russians were playing for time, rather than shifting strategy.Zelenskyy also complained about Europe having been practically absent from the table. “That’s a big mistake, in my opinion,” he said, a view that was shared by the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.On Friday, Donald Trump called on Zelenskyy to “get moving” to reach an agreement with Russia.Zelenskyy insisted that the elections that the US has pressed Ukraine to hold by 15 May can only take place two months after a ceasefire is declared, to ensure voters have adequate security.Trump has been trying to put pressure on Zelenskyy to agree a deal within months, but has not spelled out the consequences if Ukraine is not sufficiently flexible for the US.Zelenskyy also said the Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy plants would be raised in the talks in Geneva, adding that not a single energy plant inside Ukraine had now been left unscathed.European leaders appear gloomy that a diplomatic breakthrough will be secured, with the consensus being that Vladimir Putin is not yet economically or militarily exhausted.Zelenskyy said his ambition was to lift the number of Russians killed or seriously injured to 50,000 a month.One European leader predicted at least another two years of war, and insisted Europe had the resources to sustain Ukraine for that long.Zelenskyy also mounted a fierce attack on the Iranian regime for providing the Shahed drones that had caused so much damage inside Ukraine.With as many as 200,000 protesters attending a demonstration in Munich calling for the Iranian regime to be toppled, Zelenskyy said: “We have never had a conflict of interests with the Iranian regime.“But the Iranian Shahed drones they sold to Russia are killing our people and destroying our infrastructure.”He argued that if Iran is given time, it will cause more destruction. “Regimes like the one in Iran must not be given time. When they have time, they only kill more.“They must be stopped immediately, and this is exactly what should have happened with the Ayatollah after all the wars his regime unleashed and all the lives it took.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We couldn’t, as flower farmers, legally use these toxic chemicals here in the UK.”Valentine’s Day is the flower industry’s busiest time of the year. According toanalysts, about 200m roses are produced to meet the demand for lovers’ gifts on 14 February in Europe alone.More than half on sale in the UK have been sourced from the Netherlands. But for most stems, that is just the last leg of a much longer journey from farms in countries such as Colombia,Kenyaand Ethiopia, where the climate allows for year-round production and laxer regulatory regimes allow for more powerful pesticides.To determine the levels of pesticide residues on flowers likely to be on sale this Valentine’s Day, Pesticide Action Network Netherlands (Pan-NL) randomly tested 17 bouquets – five bunches of roses, eight mixed bouquets, and four bunches of tulips.The highest concentration of pesticide residues was found on a bouquet of red roses bought from a Dutch garden centre, with 65.8 mg/kg. Of 26 pesticides detected on the sample, 13 were banned for use in the EU.None of the bouquets tested were pesticide-free, but the roses and mixed bouquets contained the most residues. Among those, the analysis found 87 different pesticides, including eight metabolites, roughly equally split between insecticides and fungicides.Of the 79 active substances found, almost a third were banned for use as “plant protection products” in the EU and the Netherlands, while 78% “pose[d] a significant risk to human health and/or the environment”, said Pan-NL. Among the pesticides Pan-NL found on the flowers were known neuro- and reproductive toxins, as well as carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.The findings come amid growingconcerns in the floristry sectoraround the chemicals to which workers are exposed and their health effects. But in producer countries,such as Kenya, the problems are even more acute.David Bek, a professor at the University of Coventry who researches the flower industry, described how the farms around Lake Naivasha, Kenya’s major flower-producing region, doused crops repeatedly in chemicals to keep pests at bay.“They are basically flower factories,”he said, with flowers grown in vast quantities in sealed polytunnels, then sorted, trimmed, bunched and packed by hundreds of workers in processing areas.Bek said spraying happened at almost every stage of the production process, but particularly as they prepared to ship. “That’s what they have to do to make sure they don’t end up with problems that mean the consignment will get rejected when it gets to the border.”So where does that leave those of us looking for a Valentine’s gift? Pan-NL recommended “organically grown seasonal flowers or organically grown ornamental plants”.And for those of us who do receive a “poison bouquet”? The advice is clear: “Don’t throw the remains on the compost heap or in the organic waste bin, but with residual waste. This prevents the toxins from being recycled in nature.”Explore more on these topicsValentine's DayPesticidesHealthNetherlandsEuropeKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

Samples from his body were secured before his burial and sent to the laboratories of two countries.The UK, describing the poisoning as barbaric, said it would be reporting Russia to theOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as a flagrant violation by Russia of the chemical weapons convention (CWC).The intelligence agencies claimed laboratory testing found that the deadly toxin in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs (epibatidine) was found in samples from Navalny’s body and probably resulted in his death.The statement adds: “Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.”“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia. There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body.”Although it had been widely assumed that Navalny had been poisoned by the Russian state, the evidence of the specific poison in his body is a new development. His wife, Yulia Navalny, posted in September that there was evidence of poison in his body at the time an autopsy was conducted.1:40'Putin must bear responsibility': Navalny's wife reacts to news of her husband's death – videoYulia wrote in a post on X that the named poison “causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death. I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with [a] chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth.Vladimir Putinis a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”The Kremlin has a long history of using poison as a weapon against its enemies. The death of Alexander Litvinenko in London fromradioactive polonium in 2006, the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, and a previous poisoning attempt on Navalny have cemented Russia’s reputation for resorting to toxins to silence critics and defectors.The Foreign Office, which oversees the intelligence agencies, said it has pursued the truth of Navalny’s death with partners from Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Germany. The UK added: “We know the Russian state now used this lethal toxin to target Navalny in fear of his opposition.”The release of the information during the Munich Security Conference was designed to remind everyone that Russia announced the news of Navalny’s death just as the conference convened two years ago.His wife, after some hesitation, made a short address to the conference in 2024 saying: “I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country. With my family and with my husband, they will be brought to justice. And this day will come soon.”The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia.“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice.“Russia saw Navalny as a threat. By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”The UK has led the way in trying to expose what it regards as nefarious Russian suppression of the regime’s opponents using poison, including the attempted killing of the UK agentSergei Skripalwith novichok on the streets of Salisbury in 2018. The UK has also led claims about Russian troops’ frequent use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.In it statement the UK said it was clear Russia did not destroy all its chemical weapons as claimed in 2017, and that it has not renounced biological weapons, as it is obliged to under the biological and toxin weapons convention.Explore more on these topicsAlexei NavalnyRussiaEuropePoisonVladimir PutinNovichok poisoningsAlexander LitvinenkonewsShareReuse this content"

Bruises and marks of severe physical assault remain on her body,” he added.Mohammadi was arrested before protests erupted nationwide later in December. The movement peaked in January, with authorities launching a crackdown that activists say has left thousands dead.Earlier this month she was handed a further six years in prison on charges of harming national security and a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda against Iran’s Islamic system. She also went on hunger strike for almost a week to protest the conditions of her detention.Over the past quarter of a century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her campaigning against Iran’s use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.She was born in Zanjan but is resident in Tehran. Her foundation said she had on two occasions during previous jail stints been transferred to Zanjan prison where she suffered ill treatment.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaNobel peace prizeProtestFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

The campaign began after a member of Syria’s general security forces affiliated with IS ambushed US and Syrian forces in the city of Palmyra, killing two US soldiers and an interpreter, and wounding three members of the Syrian government forces.The US has led the international coalition to defeat IS in Syria and Iraq since 2014, partnering with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to defeat the radical group. In November, Syria officially joined the coalition and Washington has since turned towards Damascus as its principal anti-IS ally.Analysts warn that the group has been trying to reconstitute itself sincethe fall of Assad in December 2024, exploiting the security vacuum and weapons that flooded the country when Assad’s soldiers abandoned their posts.On Saturday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, praised Damascus for its participation in the anti-IS coalition, welcoming the Syrian government’s commitment to fully cooperate with the US and the global coalition.NGOs sound alarm as foreign families flee camp holding suspected IS membersRead moreThe US has steadily been evacuating male detainees accused of being IS fighters out of north-east Syria over the past month, announcing on Friday it had successfully transported 5,700 detainees to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial.

When the Labour party sidelines its members, it weakens Labour’s roots in our communities, alienates voters and undermines Labour’s ability to win both people’s trust and elections.”The signatories pointed to the candidate selection for the upcoming Gorton and Denton byelection, which Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham was blocked from standing in.“Denying local members in Gorton and Denton the right to choose their candidate looks like part of a pattern, alongside the widespread barring of hard-working councillors and the withdrawal of the whip from MPs standing up for their constituents,” the letter said.Labour MP for Leeds East, Richard Burgon, who helped to coordinate the statement, said: “Under Keir Starmer and Morgan McSweeney, there has been a clampdown on the democratic rights of Labour members.“This has led to a small clique making out-of-touch decisions that have left the prime minister and the government deeply unpopular – from the mess over winter fuel payments to the appalling decision to make Peter Mandelson the US ambassador.“We need an urgent end to this nasty factionalism coming from the top of the party where the views of Labour members and trade unionists are treated with contempt.“Restoring democracy in the Labour party is essential if we are to reconnect with voters and prevent the election of a Trump-style Reform government.”The general secretaries of Unison, Unite, the CWU, the FBU and Aslef, all Labour-affiliated unions, had signed the letter, as had the groups Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, Momentum, the Labour Muslim Network, and Labour Assembly Against Austerity.Labour members and trade unionists will be able to add their names to the letter from 15 February.This date has been chosen as it is the 120th anniversary of the formal adoption of the name “The Labour Party” in 1906, according to the letter’s coordinators.A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party is proud to be powered by our brilliant party members as we work to bring about the vital change we were elected to deliver.“Our Labour government is delivering for families across the country, including tackling the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and restoring pride in local communities.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

For every one infected person, measles can spread to up to 18 unvaccinated people.Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health who is writing to every parent in the area, said the outbreak posed a serious threat to the wider capital and there was the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” because residents travel across the city.The return of measles: how a once-vanquished disease is spreading againRead moreShe told the Sunday Times London has “one of the lowest, if not the lowest, vaccination uptake rates” in the country.Sher-Arami said: “It is possible for it to grow. We know that measles has got some very nasty complications. It can cause deafness. It can cause brain damage and one in five children can need hospital treatment.”Temporary vaccination clinics are being held in schools and throughout Enfield, an area in which more than a fifth of children are not inoculated against measles, mumps or rubella by the age of five.A government campaign promoting childhood vaccination is expected to be launched next week with adverts on social media, YouTube and radio to counter vaccine scepticism. Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms followed by a rash a few days later, according to the NHS. Some people may also get small spots in their mouths.Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the UK isno longer considered to have eliminated measles, as transmission was re-established in 2024.It comes after a plateau in vaccination coverage and a surge in cases, with 3,681 cases recorded in the UK in 2024.From 2021 to 2023, the UK was considered to have “eliminated” the disease.WHO recommends at least 95% of children should receive vaccine doses for each illness to achieve herd immunity.According to UKHealthSecurity Agency figures 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine in 2024-25, unchanged from 2023-24 and the lowest level since 2010-11.The data also showed 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, the lowest level since 2009-10.Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthHealthChildrenLondonMMRVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

Moth said Nichols is now moving “to slightly more restful pastures”.Moth was born in Zambia but moved to Kent in his early years. His previous role was as bishop of Arundel and Brighton; before that he was bishop of the Forces.The new leader has spoken publicly about issues surrounding migration andcondemned the recent commentsmade by billionaire and co-owner of Manchester United, Sir Jim Ratcliffe.In an interview with the Press Association, he said: “Speaking into a debate is fine, but the language is unfortunate, and I think that approach that he expressed is a deeply unfortunate one. I would disagree with it wholeheartedly.”View image in fullscreenThe archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, among the clerics gathered for the installation of Richard Moth as the 12th archbishop of Westminster.Photograph: Lucy North/PAHe also criticised government policies to house asylum seekers in hotels. “I think the debate I would like to see is how can we best approach this issue? Having people living in hotels for long periods of time is not ideal,” he said in the same interview.At the ceremony in Westminster, the new archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, said Moth has a “deep concern for the dignity of every person”.“In a world marked by division and uncertainty, the call to unity flows from the heart of the gospel itself – our traditions are not weakened by friendship, they are deepened when we walk together in charity, honesty and truth,” she said.Moth has also spoken about the “opportunity” for the church to capture the interest of new believers.In aninterviewwith the Catholic Herald this month, he said: “Most dioceses report increased adult baptisms and a gradual rise in people coming to church. Numbers are picking up again after Covid, though not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. There is also growing interest from young adults exploring or entering the church. So there is a great opportunity here.”Explore more on these topicsCatholicismChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running – one American and two Russians – prompting Nasa to pause spacewalks and trim research.Moving in for eight to nine months are Nasa’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot, and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have visited the ISS before. During her first space station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to visit space.

The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at a hospital before returning to Houston.The space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.Explore more on these topicsInternational Space StationNasaSpaceXSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

These demonstrations have grown in scope following thekillings of Renee Good and Alex Prettiat the hands of federal agents.But this week, Tom Homan, the US border czar, said that the Trump administration would bedrawing downits immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the killings after initial escalations by immigration agencies. Many have credited the decision to draw back as proof that the protests were successful in sending a message.“Right now, we’re being tested, and the good news is, what we saw in Minneapolis and St Paul, and what we’re seeing in places across the country, including here in Los Angeles, has been the American people saying no,” Obama said. “At least a good number of the American people saying, we’re going to live up to those values that we say we believe in.”“As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this,” he added.Obama, along with the former first lady,Michelle Obama, called the killing of Alex Pretti “aheartbreaking tragedy” and “a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault”.In astatementreleased last month, the Obamas said federal law enforcement and immigration agents were not operating in a lawful or accountable way in Minnesota.

The agency argued that the estimates contain too much uncertainty.Previously, the EPA placed a dollar figure on the benefits of cleaner air, factoring in outcomes such as fewer premature deaths and reduced illness, includingasthmaattacks.The 2009 endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare and should therefore be controlled by the EPA. Byrevoking iton Thursday, officials eliminated the legal foundation enabling the government to control planet-heating pollution.‘A different set of rules’: thermal drone footage shows Musk’s AI power plant flouting clean air regulationsRead moreThe senators criticized the updated policy as “particularly troubling” and said the repeal “destroys that framework and results in a failure to faithfully execute EPA’s statutory mandate to protect human health”, according to a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday.The effort is being led by the ranking member of the Senate committee on the environment and public works, Sheldon Whitehouse. The lawmakers have asked the EPA to provide documents and details explaining how it reached its decision by 26 February.Senate Democrats are seeking to know the reasoning behind the EPA’s move; what factors the agency will consider when carrying out Clean Air Act rule-making; whether it has considered no longer quantifying health effects for other pollutants; and whether it consulted any outside parties, including the secretary of health and human services, the US surgeon general, or public health specialists.“It is literally zero surprise that they knew their hand-picked climate deniers weren’t putting out real science,” Whitehousewrote on Xin response to an article suggesting the Trump administration ignored the recommendations of scientists. “Their nonsense has never been real, but part of a fraudulent propaganda campaign, designed by fossil fuel to protect its ‘free-to-pollute’ business model.”The repeal is part of Trump’s sweeping attacks on US climate policy. On Thursday, he said the endangerment finding formed “the basis for the green new scam”. Since returning to office last January, theTrump administrationhas taken aggressive steps to roll back pollution regulations and promote fossil fuel production. Critics argue that this anti-environmental agenda benefits the president’s fossil fuel-industry donors.Trump’s decision drew broad condemnation from climate scientists and advocates focused on environmental protection, public health and economic justice. Asked on Thursday to address environmental concerns about the new rule, Trump said: “Don’t worry about it.”“This has nothing to do with public health,” he said of the endangerment finding. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”Explore more on these topicsUS Environmental Protection AgencyUS SenateAir pollutionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS CongressClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about”.Wasserman was facing a client rebellion after suggestive communications with Maxwell in 2003 were released. In one, he told her: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?”In a response to the then married man, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. “All that rubbing – are you sure you can take it? The thought frankly is leaving me a little breathless.”In another, Maxwell asked if it will be foggy enough during an upcoming visit “so that you can float naked down the beach”.In recent days, a number of Wasserman’s clients, including Grammy winner Chappell Roan and US women’s soccer star Abby Wambach, cut ties to the agency. In a statement, Roan said: “No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.”Artists, she added, “deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity” and her decision “reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust”.After the emails were disclosed, Wasserman issued an apology, saying he regretted his correspondence with Maxwell, “which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light”. He stated: “I never had a personal or business relationship withJeffrey Epstein.”Other Wasserman clients who have departed the agency or spoke out include the Dropkick Murphys, John Summit, Orville Peck, Weyes Blood, Best Coast front woman Bethany Cosentino and the indie group Wednesday.Wasserman joins a lengthy parade of business figures who have resigned or stepped down over their contacts with Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, or Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for related offenses.Figures who have stepped aside include Kathryn Ruemmler, the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and former White House counsel to Barack Obama. Emails showed that Ruemmler described Epstein as an “older brother” and downplayed his sex crimes.Attorney Brad Karp stepped down as chair of the high-powered law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison after emails showed him thanking Epstein “for including me in an evening I’ll never forget”.This article was amended on 14 February 2026.

But travelers in the US could see screening delays at airports. Disaster relief and immigration enforcement could also be affected if the funding stoppage becomes prolonged.Transportation Security Administrationofficers are expected to work without pay, but trade groups for the US travel industry and major airlines warned that the longer DHS appropriations lapse, the longer security lines at the nation’s commercial airports could get.During past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended tobuild over time, not overnight. However, air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations.One immediate effect of the shutdown was the cancellation of the official House delegation to the Munich security conference. Democratic members of the body, including Bronx DemocratAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezand former House speakerNancy Pelosi, made the trip but in a personal capacity.“Some of us are going over anyway on our own dime to reassure and thank our allies,” Connecticut Democrat Jim Himesposted on X.Colorado Democrat Jason Crowtold NBC Newsthat Republican House speaker Mike Johnson had ordered the hotel reservations, military flights and credentials to the conference to be cancelled.Ocasio-Cortez said she was attending because Democrats “want to tell a larger story, that what is happening is indeed very grave, and we are in a new era, domestically and globally”.At the center of the dispute are demands by Democrats for new restrictions on immigration agents following the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month by federal immigration agents. The restrictions include mandating that agents perform operations without face masks and first obtain judicial warrants to make home arrests – demands Republicans largely reject.However, the shutdown does not halt Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection operations because they were amply funded as part last year’s budget bill.Ahead of the shutdown, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, criticized his counterpart, House speaker Mike Johnson, for adjourning Congress rather than keeping lawmakers in Washington to continue negotiations.“We’ve drawn a hard line in the sand on behalf of the American people, and we’re not going to allow the Congress to cross it,” Jeffries told reporters on Friday. “ICE needs to be dramatically reformed. Period. Full stop.”After Democrats rejected a White House offer on Thursday, the Senate minority leader called it “not serious, plain and simple.”Schumer laterposted a video on Xthat showed federal immigration agents pushing people to the ground and pepper-spraying them. “This is why Democrats voted NO on more funding for ICE. And we will continue to do so until ICE is reined in and the violence ends.”But the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said: “What it appears to me, at least at this point, is happening is the Democrats, like they did last fall, they really don’t want the solution. They don’t want the answer. They want the political issue”.Donald Trump told reporters Friday: “We’re talking, but we have to protect law enforcement. I know what they want, I know what they can live with. The Democrats have gone crazy.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdownsHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And in 2024, Trump reheated his old promise that “jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country”.There is an undeniable appeal to the hard hat and the grease-stained overalls; to the sweat on the brow of hard men in vintage posters; to the virtue of a hard day’s labor on the production line. But the American political class would do well to overcome its nostalgia for the past and forget about promises to make manufacturing great again.As US influence wanes, the Chinese trade surplus strangles manufacturing across the globeRead moreThe promises make little sense.They haven’t really worked politically. One study concluded that job losses in big manufacturing countiesdid not push voterstoward Trump in 2016, on average. (While they led to increased support for the Republican in predominantly white areas, they were associated with diminished support in diverse counties.) And despite Biden’s strenuous efforts, in 2024 even rust belt counties that benefited richly from his incentives to support manufacturing voted for Trump.If the politics don’t work, the efforts to “restore” manufacturing – which accounts for less than 8% of the jobs in the country – make even less sense in economic terms. It’s about as sensible as a commitment to restore agriculture – which employsless than 2%of Americans – to the place it occupied at the center of the US economy in the 19th century.A line chart showing that manufacturing makes up less than 8% of US jobsPlacing tariffs on imports, Trump’s preferred policy tool, is a particularly inept approach. Over half of American imports are in fact, capital equipment and intermediate goods that American manufacturers put into finished products, often for export. About 91% of respondents toa surveyby the National Association of Manufacturers said they use imported components. By raising the price of such inputs, tariffs make domestic firms less competitive. Steel, for instance, is more expensive in the United Statesthan practically anywhere else, which makes life difficult for every manufacturer that uses the stuff.While the Biden administration’s strategy was not quite as stupid, it was nonetheless ineffectual. Indeed, despite all the help from the White House, manufacturing output has not recovered its level from before the Covid pandemic. It remains at roughly where it was 20 years ago. And manufacturing jobs show no sign of a revival.A line chart showing that manufacturing output has not recovered to its pre-Covid levelOne problem is that Biden’s multibillion spending on industrial policy – through the Inflation Reduction Act, the Chips and Science Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act – made manufacturing more expensive, by bidding up the costs of capital goods and other inputs, like materials and wages of factory workers, as well as pushing up interest rates and the dollar. Moreover, Biden stiffened some trade barriers inherited from the first Trump administration, for instance tightening “Buy America” government procurement rules.While factory construction did boom, investment in industrial equipment did not. Moreover, real spending on other bits of infrastructure – like bridges and highways – contracted despite a massive infusion of federal dollars, according toan analysis by Jason Furmanfrom Harvard’s Kennedy School. And the building of manufacturing plants has fizzled under Trump.The decline in manufacturing, however, is less a story about policy blunders than one about the long progress of theUS economy, which has to a large extent graduated out of producing stuff like phones and cars and into the delivery of services, like finance and healthcare – a process similar to that followed by other countries that moved up the ladder of success.One study foundthat the number of manufacturing firms in the US declined by 21% in the two decades from 2002 to 2022, even as the overall number of companies in the country grew by 10%. The only industrial sector that saw substantial growth in the number of firms and jobs was that of beverages and tobacco products – largely a consequence of the fad for trendy drinks like canned kombucha and fancy sparkling water.A chart showing that manufacturing productivity has stalledFor many years, the story US manufacturing was one of fast productivity growth, which propelled production increases despite stable or falling employment. But the growth of manufacturing productivity stalled about 15 years or so ago, even as productivity across the economy continued to improve.There is a valid case for a nation like the United States to nurture some manufacturing industries – especially those that will prove important for national security, like advanced semiconductors, or advanced energy technologies needed to reduce carbon emissions.But the many campaigns Washington has embarked on over the years to restore manufacturing to some image of past glory are largely driven by misplaced nostalgia. It is true that manufacturing workers earn more, on average, than those employed in the service economy. But that is an argument for policies to raise wages for low-wage service sector workers. The dream of greasy overalls and hard hats does not justify protectionist policies that harm American consumers or other wasteful incentives that are failing both to generate jobs or to produce anything of value.Explore more on these topicsUS economyManufacturing sectorEconomicsUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Saturday afternoon in Milan’s western suburbs, Jordan Stolz mastered the sport’s fastest and most unpredictable race and pushedhis Olympic campaigntoward historic territory.The 21-year-old American won the 500m in an Olympic-record 33.77 seconds, securing his second gold medal of the Milano Cortina Olympics and adding pace behind what is rapidly becoming one of thedefining individual campaignsof these Winter Games.It also means Stolz has opened these Games with two races, two gold medals and two Olympic records.Quick GuideJordan Stolz's expected Olympic programShowScheduleAll times Eastern.Wed 11 FebMen's 1000m, 12.30pmSat 14 FebMen's 500m, 11amThu 19 FebMen's 1500m, 10.30amSat 21 FebMen's Mass Start semi-finals, 3pmSat 21 FebMen's Mass Start final, 4.40pmWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In a final that rewrote the record book, the entire podium finished below the previous Olympic record of 34.32sec. Stolz led the way in 33.77sec, followed by the Netherlands’ Jenning de Boo in 33.88sec and Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil in 34.26sec. The performance was historic on multiple levels. Stolz’s time stands as the fastest 500m ever skated at sea level, while his 0.11-second winning margin marked the largest gap in a single-race Olympic 500m since 1988.Winter Olympics 2026: skeleton, ski jumping, Norway win 10th gold, and more – liveRead moreStolz did not win through a single dominant phase. Instead, he combined an elite start, near-perfect first-corner mechanics and exceptional speed preservation down the back straight – the three components that typically separate Olympic champions from podium contenders at this distance. In modern sprint skating, where aerodynamic drag and ice friction punish even slight inefficiencies, that phase-to-phase balance is rare.The result mattered not just because it added another medal, but because of the distance itself. The 500m was generally viewed as the toughest of Stolz’s three primary individual races: an all-out sprint from the opening push, where races are often decided by hundredths and where even generational skaters can lose control before the first corner exit.Skating in the third-to-last of 15 heats, Stolz was paired with De Boo – whoended Stolz’s two-year world title reignat the distance last March in Hamar, Norway – in one of the afternoon’s marquee matchups. If the 1000m on Wednesdayshowcased Stolz’s devastating closing speed, the 500m demanded something else: immediate perfection. Stolz delivered it.“It was super close. I already knew it was going to be close before the race,” Stolz said. “I thought if I skated a perfect one, and I get a really good last outer turn, I can probably pull it off.”View image in fullscreenAll three medalists finished below the previous Olympic 500m record.Photograph: Robert Ghement/EPAHe exploded cleanly from the start, protected the first turn with his trademark low, efficient body position and carried speed through the back straight with the kind of technical stability that has defined his rise.“Coming down the last hundred meters, I thought I should be able to beat him and that’s exactly what I did,” he said. “I had a really good outer turn and I could feel him coming up. When I first entered the turn I was waiting to hear his skates, and I wasn’t hearing them yet. Then, finally, he started coming up next to me and I thought: ‘I can beat him now.’”The victory builds directly on the platform he established earlier this week, when he won gold in the 1000m by the largest Olympic margin at the distance since 1984 – a result that immediately positioned him as the central long-track storyline of these Games.Jordan Stolz: the American speed skater who could define the OlympicsRead moreStolz said the emotional shift from winning earlier in the week helped him approach Saturday differently. “Way less pressure,” he said. “I really wanted to win the 1000m and after that I knew the environment, what to expect.“Today I felt way less pressure until maybe 30 minutes before the race. Then I started to really focus. I was just thinking about the pushes, went through the whole race in my mind and how I wanted to do it. I’m happy I pulled it off.”Two races into the program, the greater historical framing is harder to ignore. The men’s record for most speed skating gold medals at a single Olympics is the five won by Eric Heiden at Lake Placid in 1980, one of the most untouchable achievements in Olympic sport. Stolz entered Milan viewed as a multi-event gold threat. With two wins already secured, the ceiling remains intact. He also joins Heiden, who was in attendance Saturday, as only the second man to complete the Olympic 500m-1000m double.His trajectory since Beijing 2022 has been meteoric. At 17 as an Olympic debutant, he finished 13th in the 500m and 14th in the 1000m. Four years later, he is dictating the competitive tone of the Olympic long-track program.Raised in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, and developed at the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee, Stolz has approached speed skating less as an art than a systems problem, obsessing over blade setup, ice density and aerodynamic efficiency in pursuit of what he calls “free speed”. The Milan track – a temporary Olympic venue that has already produced some of the fastest times in Olympic history – has played into that mindset.The Olympic schedule now turns toward Thursday’s 1500m, where Stolz could become only the second American to win three gold medals at a singleWinter Olympics. The mass start still follows later in the program. The last man to win three speed skating gold medals at a single Winter Games was Norway’s Johann Olav Koss in 1994, another historical marker now sitting within touching distance.But if the 500m represented the event most likely to destabilize his campaign, Stolz just removed that threat. And with two gold medals already secured – and records falling around him – the possibility of a historic Olympic medal haul is unfolding in real time.Explore more on these topicsJordan StolzSpeed skatingUS sportsUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Fast forward two months and the Egyptian great is starting, scoring and shaping games for Arne Slot again. Appeasement between the pair is for the greater good.Salah produced a sublime assist, his fourth since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, and scored from the penalty spot asLiverpoolmoved into round five with a commanding victory over Fabian Hürzeler’s struggling team. There was no evidence of Brighton not performing for their under-pressure manager but their lack of cutting edge was glaring, as was the case when visiting here in the Premier League.Liverpool 3-0 Brighton: FA Cup fourth round – liveRead moreCurtis Jones and a stunning strike from Dominik Szoboszlai – “one of the best players in the world right now”, according to Salah – condemned Brighton before the Egypt international applied the final blow. It could have been worse for Hürzeler’s side had the substitute Rio Ngumoha not had a late goal wrongly disallowed for offside.“It is very nice to have Mo on the scoresheet again,” said Slot, who rested Hugo Ekitiké and Ryan Gravenberch on the bench but otherwise went strong with his lineup. “But what I like the most is he also helps the team a lot defensively and that is something very positive. It is what the team needs. Also, more players are capable of playing at this intensity level every three days and so more and more we see the quality we have.”This was a slow-burning cup tie. Liverpool needed half an hour to find any urgency while Brighton had the better of the opening exchanges without seriously troubling Alisson. Hürzeler could take some encouragement from his players’ confidence in possession and pressing game but a third successive game without a goal underlined where their weakness lies.Jones, the latest Liverpool player to be handed the cursed right-back shift, signalled the start of the improvement when sending an angled drive just wide of Jason Steele’s top corner. Cody Gakpo headed in from Szoboszlai’s free-kick minutes later but from an offside position.Liverpool were finally playing with the intensity and intent that the occasion demanded. Salah broke clear of Ferdi Kadioglu and had the ball taken off his toes by the Brighton left-back just as he shaped to shoot. Milos Kerkez then stung Steele’s fingertips having been found in space behind the visitors’ defence by Alexis Mac Allister’s quickly taken free-kick.View image in fullscreenCurtis Jones gives Liverpool the lead from Milos Kerkez’s cross.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesBrighton could not escape the Liverpool pressure and were finally breached shortly before the interval. A tackle by striker Charalampos Kostoulas on Mac Allister inadvertently played the ball to Kerkez. The Hungarian left-back swept a dangerous low cross into the six-yard box where Jones, arriving unmarked between Jan Paul van Hecke and Kadioglu, side-footed home via the underside of the crossbar. The midfielder’s first goal of the season rewarded a dominant spell by Liverpool yet sparked an immediate response from Brighton.Jack Hinshelwood could have levelled swiftly when beating Gakpo to Harry Howell’s corner but headed wastefully over at close range. A slip by Jones in first-half stoppage time presented Diego Gómez with a one-v-one against Alisson. The Liverpool keeper came out on top, saving the forward’s low shot with his legs.Fortune favoured Alisson early in the second half when his clearance struck the in-coming Gómez and rebounded wide of the Liverpool goal. The keeper then made a vital intervention to prevent Lewis Dunk’s header reaching the unmarked Van Hecke. A key moment, as Liverpool in effect settled the tie from their next attack.The home side’s second was outstanding in its creation and execution. When Gakpo’s crossfield pass found its way to Salah the striker, in one movement, leapt into the air and cushioned the ball into the run of Szoboszlai on the volley. The Hungary captain did not break stride and lashed an emphatic first-time drive past Steele.Salah won and converted the penalty that brought Liverpool their third. There was a glimpse of the Salah of old as he turned Kadioglu and powered past the left-back into the box, where he was dragged back by Pascal Gross. Stuart Attwell immediately pointed to the spot and the Egypt international gave Steele no chance with a blistering penalty kick.“Moments decided the game, unfortunately in the wrong direction,” said Hürzeler. “Liverpool had the quality to use their chances. We were not able to be that effective.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupLiverpoolBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The International Olympic Committee only recognizes independent sovereign states, and Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.Through the first week of the Milano Cortina Olympics, fans have brought the flag to different corners of the Games. It was waved in the grandstands in Anterselva, wherethe only two Greenlandic athletesat the Games competed in biathlon.View image in fullscreenThe US was victorious in their preliminary round game against Denmark on Saturday.Photograph: Getty ImagesThat the US and Denmarkhappened to face off in the men’s hockey tournamentwas no extra motivation to the players. Though “U-S-A! U-S-A!” chants from the very red, white and blue crowd filled the arena throughout the game, none of the geopolitics reached the ice, and multiple Denmark players last week downplayed any connection between the Greenland situation and the game against the US.But it was a chance for Denmark to ride a wave of patriotism as significant underdogs. Danish forward Nick Olesen was credited with the opening goal after Zach Werenski accidentally knocked the puck into his own net. Matt Boldy tied it for the Americans two minutes later.Eleven minutes in, Danish forward Nicholas B Jensen beat US goaltender Jeremy Swayman from 95ft away, just inside the center red line, to go up 2-1.Swayman didn’t have to kick himself too badly for the blunder. The US took the lead midway through the second period after goals by Brady Tkachuk and Jack Eichel – two-thirds of the top line, along with Brady’s brother Matthew.Pride and unease: US Winter Olympians navigate politics, patriotism and Trump attacksRead moreDefenseman Noah Hanifin added another when his shot got through Mads Sogaard and trickled over the goalline a bit later, providing some breathing room that proved necessary.Jake Guentzel fired a one-timer past Sogaard with a little more than 12 minutes left in the third period, and Jack Hughes scored off a feed from Brock Nelson after Sogaard exited with injury and was relieved by Frederik Dichow.Captain Auston Matthews made the pass to Guentzel, and Werenski had the secondary assist to get some retribution.After rolling over Latvia 5-1 in their opener on Thursday night behind two goals from Nelson, the Americans have six points in the standings, the same as Canada, going into the final day of the preliminary round.The US wraps up round-robin play against Germany. Canada faces 0-2-0 France. If they each win in regulation, the No 1 spot in the single-elimination knockout round would come down to goal differential.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Ice hockeyUSA Olympic teamWinter OlympicsUS sportsGreenlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Early mistakes triggered a meltdown that laid bare the brutal math of modern figure skatingSat 14 Feb 2026 11.16 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 11.58 ESTShareWhat madeIlia Malinin’s Olympic defeatso shocking was not simply his years-long dominance entering Friday night. It was how completely the competition had tilted in his favor before he even stepped on the ice.For nearly three years, Malinin had been men’s skating’s guiding light: unbeaten since late 2023, winner of back-to-back world titles, the skater whorecalibrated the sport’s technical ceilingand then made winning look procedural. He arrived at the Milano Ice Skating Arena leading by more than five points after the short program and carrying the most difficult planned program in the field. Under almost any normal competitive logic, that combination should have been decisive.Fall of the Quad God: Ilia Malinin finds he is all too human under the Olympic spotlightRead moreWhat made the result feel even closer to inevitable was what happened around him.One by one, the contenders who could realistically threaten him faltered. Italy’s Daniel Grassl fell out of podium contention. France’s Adam Siao Him Fa lost ground. Several skaters struggled to generate clean technical content on ice. (Some athletes have privately questioned its quality.) By the time Malinin took the stage at 10.48pm local time, the event had effectively opened for him.That makes what followed over the next seven minutes so difficult to process.The official result – eighth place overall after entering the free skate with a five-point lead – only tells part of the story. The deeper explanation sits inside the scoring sheet: the collapse of base value, the loss of combination opportunities and the cascading technical penalties that follow when one missed element forces a skater to improvise a program designed to be executed, not adjusted.What unfolded in Milan was not just an Olympic upset. It was a case study in how modern figure skating scoring works at its most unforgiving – and why even the most dominant technical skater of his generation was not immune to it. Here’s how it happened.This wasn’t just mistakes. It was a chain reactionOnce the axel disappeared, Malinin had to chase points rather than control the program.After briefly recovering with a quad lutz for another massive score, a planned quad loop became a double, cutting roughly 10 points from its expected scoring range.Then came the first fall on the opening leg of a planned quad lutz-single euler-triple flip in combination, normally one of his highest-scoring elements. Instead of scoring in the mid-teens, the quad lutz barely cleared three points after deductions.Later, a planned quad salchow-triple axel sequence – one of the highest-value passes in the program – turned into a double salchow and a fall, effectively wiping out another double-digit scoring opportunity.Even with the errors, Malinin still landed one elite combination – the quad toe loop-euler-triple flip – but by that point the structural damage to the program’s base value had already been done.By the final third of the skate, Malinin was no longer performing the layout he built to win Olympic gold. He was trying to mitigate damage. And in modern figure skating, where scoring is ruthlessly precise, you cannot salvage your way to an Olympic title.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin fell twice during Friday’s free skatePhotograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty ImagesThe score sheet explains how big the gap really wasMalinin had a technical score of 76.61 points. Shaidorov, the surprise winner, finished with 114.68.At the Olympic level, that is not simply a large margin. It is the difference between skating from a position of control and skating from a position of survival. In elite men’s skating, technical element scores in the 100-plus range typically define medal contention. Dropping into the mid-70s effectively removes a skater from the competitive ceiling of the event.Multiple skaters in the field cleared 100 technical points. Malinin didn’t come close.For a skater who built dominance on overwhelming technical margins – often separating from the field before program components were even factored in – the reversal was staggering. The same technical ceiling helped deliverthe United States the team goldearlier in the week, when even programs below his peak standard still outscored most of the field.The very system that allowed him to dominate when he landed most of his elements offered almost no protection once multiple bedrock jumps disappeared.Download original documentShaidorov did not try to match Malinin’s difficulty ceilingInstead, the 21-year-old Kazakh executed the formula that has quietly won Olympic titles for years: several extremely difficult jumps including five quads with two in combination. Clean landings. Positive execution scores. No falls. No major deductions.Crucially, Shaidorov preserved his jump layout structure even on imperfect elements, maintaining combination opportunities and second-half bonus scoring. In modern judging, that matters as much as raw difficulty. A slightly flawed quad that stays upright and preserves program structure can still generate major points. A fall or doubled jump erases them entirely.To casual viewers, that approach can look less spectacular. Under Olympic pressure, it is brutally effective. As the top contenders’ programs began to unravel one after another, the competition stopped being about who could do the most difficult things and became about who could protect the value of the elements they had already planned.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin reacts in the kiss-and-cry area after Friday’s free skate.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesThe Olympic pressure factor – why this stage is differentMalinin had hinted all week that the Olympic atmosphere felt different. Hiscomments in the aftermathrevealed as much: he’d become awash in thoughts and memories from his starting pose rather than clarity, he’d lost awareness of where he was in the program, it all went by so fast and he didn’t have time to process.In normal competitions, Malinin’s extreme difficulty creates room for small mistakes. That margin can disappear quickly under extreme psychological duress. One mistake becomes two. Two becomes three. Add pressure of an Olympic debut to the mix and suddenly the entire structure is gone.Malinin, controversially left off the 2022 US Olympic team despite a second-place finish at nationals, seemed to realize the unique pressure of competing at the Games for the first time. While in the kiss-and-cry area after his disastrous free skate, an NBC hot mic caught him saying: “[If they had] sent me to Beijing, I wouldn’t have skated like that.”There is precedent for this kind of Olympic rupture. Nathan Chen debuted at the 2018 Games as a co-favorite andcollapsed in the short program, missing the podiumdespite winning the free skate. One month later, hewon the world title. Four years later, hewon Olympic gold.Malinin understands that arc exists, but it will be a long four years untilFrench Alps 2030. But Olympic defeats carry a different weight when they halt dominance rather than simply postpone it.Why this upset will matter beyond one resultMalinin remains the sport’s technical revolutionary. That did not change Friday. At 21, he is stillthe two-time reigning world championand the skater most likely to define the next Olympic cycle. But Milan may reshape how he – and perhaps the sport – thinks about winning championships.For three seasons, Malinin forced rivals to chase maximum difficulty simply to stay competitive. He shifted the technical baseline of men’s skating. Programs that once won major titles suddenly looked conservative. Base value became the starting point, not the separator. Friday was a reminder that another path still exists.Clean programs still win. Four or five quads can still beat seven. Execution still beats theoretical difficulty when pressure is highest. The Olympics, more than any other event, still reward the skater who preserves structure rather than the one who pushes possibility to its edge.Malinin may still set the sport’s limits. But the Olympics are decided by who can stay inside them.Explore more on these topicsIlia MalininUS sportsFigure skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2030analysisShareReuse this content"

But several entered the fray as it drifted toward the Red Storm’s visitors’ bench.The game was delayed by nearly 20 minutes while the referees sorted out the punishments: four St John’s players were booted and two from Providence, and by the time the Friars got the ball back they had watched a one-point lead turn into a four-point deficit.“You’re not supposed to come off the bench, but you can’t let your players get beat up,” Pitino said after the 79-69 victory gave the Red Storm its 11th straight win. “You can’t fight. Back when I was the Kentucky coach we fought almost every SEC game, and it was not a big deal. But you can’t fight any more, so toughness has to come between the lines.”“I feel like we responded in the best way possible,” said St. John’s forward Zuby Ejiofor, who anticipated a frigid reaction for Hopkins in his first game back since he transferred from Providence. “Coming into this game we knew exactly how rowdy this environment was going to be — not only for him, but for all of us. We knew it was going be tough. You have to have a great mindset to come in here and win, and I think that’s what we did.”St John’s led by as many 13 points in the first half, but Providence rallied in the second to take a series of one-point leads and had a 40-39 edge with 14:25 left when Hopkins went up for a fast-break layup and was raked across the head and face by Powell’s arm, taking him to the ground.Providence coach Kim English didn’t like the foul, either.“There’s a time to foul hard. There’s a time to foul a poor free throw shooter hard. That’s fouling to not let them get the ball above their head. Fouling their arms. It’s a good, clean basketball play. A good hard foul. You don’t want to give up ‘and ones,’” English said. “He had plenty of opportunity to get in front of him, just playing straight up.”Hopkins got up and moved toward Powell but was held back and guided away by his former teammate, Friars forward Oswin Erhunmwunse. Others in the game got involved and the players from the nearby St John’s bench couldn’t be held back any longer.The pushing and shoving continued while coaches, referees and security tried to break it up. Police were sent on to the court to prevent further escalation, and the TNT broadcast reported that a fan was kicked out of the Amica Mutual Pavilion arena for getting involved in the melee.During the delay, players for both teams warmed up at their baskets. As the referees updated the coaches on their decision, the fans broke into a chant of “Duncan Powell!”Providence guard Jaylin Sellers was led down the tunnel to cheers from the crowd; he was soon joined by Powell. St John’s Dillon Mitchell, Ruben Prey, Sadiku Ibine Ayo and Kelvin Odih also were ejected.View image in fullscreenSt John’s forward Dillon Mitchell and a game official fall after a fight broke out in Saturday’s game.Photograph: Mark Stockwell/APThe pool report said the conference will review the game to see if additional penalties are warranted.Pitino began his postgame media availability by saying with a smile, “We’re getting out of here before the fans beat the coaches up.” And he ended it by joking, “Get me [Big East Commissioner] Val Ackerman on the phone.”In between, he chastised a reporter for asking Ejiofor about the fight, saying, “We’re not going to address that; let the league address it. If you want to talk basketball, talk basketball. You write what you saw. Don’t ask my players that.”Hopkins made two free throws, then St John’s Oziyah Sellers made one of two and followed it with a layup for a five-point play that gave the Red Storm a 44-40 lead. After a Friars miss, St John’s Dylan Darling hit a 3-pointer for a seven-point lead.Tensions flared again with five minutes left after a hard foul by Erhunmwunse on Ejiofor. That was ruled a common foul, but Providence fans under the basket got the Red Storm players riled up enough for the referees to step in.Later in the game, Providence’s Jamier Jones was ejected for pushing Ejiofor on a fast break.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballUS sportsCollege sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But all that control melted away when the speed skater glided on to Fox’s Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test reality TV series in fall 2023 for a taste of the grueling training that elite US troops endure.She was part of a motley cast that included former Dallas Cowboys star Dez Bryant, NBA clutch shooter Robert Horry and skier Bode Miller, a fellow Winter Olympic champion. But Jackson was less concerned with outshining her athletic peers than with confronting her own fears. To test her anxiety around swimming, Jackson was strapped into a mock helicopter, submerged in icy water and told to hold her breath for at least 15 seconds before freeing herself, grabbing a lifejacket, and paddling to safety.Ten athletes from Team USA to watch at the Milano Cortina Winter OlympicsRead moreEven though she panicked underwater and bailed on the drill after just five seconds, Jackson went on to complete the overall course, finishing as one of three contestants – and the only world-class athlete – to earn a passing grade. “I’m a lot tougher than I thought,” the 33-year-old said at Team USA’s media summit late last year. “I have a lot of fears, and the show did a really good job of exploiting all of them. It was a good character-building experience for me.”Mind you, this is a woman who was already standing on a strong foundation – the wheeled skating prodigy from Ocala, Florida, who transitioned to ice inadulthoodandcaptured the 500m at the 2022 Beijing Games, making history as the first Black woman to win a Winter Olympic gold in an individual sport. As one of this year’s US flag bearers, Jackson entered the Milano Cortina Games with high expectations. Astumble in the 1000m sprintkept her off the podium earlier this week, but a Sunday return to the Milano Speed Skating Stadium for her 500m title defense offers a fresh shot at redemption. That she’s even in this position is an even stronger testament to her courage than the trials she endured alongside JoJo Siwa and multiple runners-up from The Bachelorette.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

That morphed into being what we call a ‘rink rat’, just someone who hangs out at the local skating rink, skating around to the music, eating pizza with friends. That was my whole childhood. That’s still what gets me going.”Jackson’s inline skating hobby quickly morphed into a vocation, taking her away from the University of Florida to 47 national titles and a starring role as a “jammer” on the US roller derby team. In 2016, at the relatively overripe age of 24, she made the leap to speed skating with no prior experience. After a four-month training push, she qualified for the 500m at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. Three years after that 24th-place finish, she set two track records on her way to becoming the first Black woman to win on the World Cup circuit.That momentum carried her toward the Beijing Games – a touch too fast, perhaps. In the 500m trials Jackson bobbled out of the corner, clipped the ice on the back straight, and went down, losing precious seconds in a race measured in hundredths. Somehow, she chipped across the finish line furiously enough to take third – an impressive recovery, though still short of a guaranteed Olympic team spot.Jackson had come to terms with looking ahead to the 2026 Olympics instead. But then a curious thing happened: Brittany Bowe, who had also qualified for the Games in the 1000m, relinquished her spot in the 500m roster for Jackson, a childhood friend. “After that unfortunate slip I knew in my mind before that night was even over that if it had to come down to a decision of mine, she could have my place,” Bowe said at the time. “No one is more deserving than her to get an opportunity to bring Team USA home a medal.”View image in fullscreenErin Jackson was chosen as one of two US flag bearers for this year’s opening ceremony.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/APIn the spirit of good vibes, Bowe’s grand gesture brought another twist: Team USA received an additional quota place in the women’s 500m, making it possible forbothher and Jackson to skate in the event. In the end Jackson didn’t just land on the Beijing podium; she pipped the 500m field by eight-hundredths of a second to become the first American woman to win the event since Bonnie Blair in 1994, all the while drawing comparisons toShani Davis– the Lewis Hamilton of speed skating. Ever since, Jackson’s life has spun along a blur of speaking gigs, endorsements – not least a recent ad for Hershey’s chocolate – and, of course, the TV time with Jack Osbourne and the villain of Vanderpump Rules.“I had like that one morning and afternoon after the event, and then I was on a flight home the next evening for six nine-hour days of constant media,” said Jackson, recalling the aftermath of her gold in Beijing. “It’s really about capitalizing on the time we have to get the word out about our sport and the Olympic movement.”Jordan Stolz crushes Olympic 1000m record to begin four-gold pursuit after reskateRead moreBut even amid the whirlwind, nothing steels Jackson’s focus like seeing so many boys and girls who look like her, looking up to her. “I really take on that responsibility with pride of being a face others can look to and maybe get out and try the sport,” Jackson said of her pioneering status. “It’s really rewarding to get tagged in these posts from parents showing me videos of their kids out there skating. When I retire from skating and have a bit more time on my plate, I want to start an organization to help fund people’s [start in] speed skating because it is a really expensive sport to get into.”For now, her focus is on defending her title on Sunday. Perpetually on the move, Jackson carries her gold medal in a travel pouch to keep pace with the constant demands of media, fans and rubberneckers. “I joke that the only thing it’s good for is getting me stopped at airport security,” she said. But that’s not to suggest her bauble is a burden. Every medal she can grab, she will, without fear. She got this far after battling through back and hamstring injuries and surgery in March 2023 to address chronic fibroid issues.As for the rest, she’ll leave that to fate, the ice and whatever else she can’t control.Explore more on these topicsSpeed skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the sport’s governing body did warn Canada about their abusive langugage and introduced emergency spot checks on Saturday afternoon to make sure teams were not cheating when releasing the stone.A bad-tempered game erupted when Sweden’s Oskar Eriksson told Canada’s Marc Kennedy he was double-touching the stone on the penultimate end, which led to Kennedy responding with an expletive.‘I told him where to stick it’: Cheating claims fly in Canada v Sweden Winter Olympics curling clashRead moreSpeaking after Canada had lost 9-5 to Switzerland on Saturday afternoon, Kennedy insisted he was innocent of any wrongdoing. “I can’t think of once in my entire career where I’ve done something to gain a competitive advantage by cheating,” he said. “And I take that very seriously. And it’s been a really long career. So when you get called out, my instinct was to be a little bit of a bulldog. I don’t regret defending myself or my teammates in that moment. I just probably regret the language I used.”The Curling Canada chief, Nolan Thiessen, said it was a poor choice of words from Kennedy. “I think heat of the moment, I would allow for as well,” Thiessen said. “Something was said in his ear which got him going. Head games get played in a lot of sports and things get said in competitive sport and I think this was one of those situations. Do I wish Mark didn’t drop an F-bomb? Yeah.”World Curling has introduced electronic handles on the stones at these Games, which flash red if players are still making contact with the stone beyond the hog line, the point where curlers must let go of the stone during delivery. However, the Swedes believed Kennedy was touching the stone and not the handle containing the sensor, meaning the red lights did not flash. Replays seemed to back Eriksson up, although officials did not intervene during the contest.“We told the officials,” said Eriksson. “They came out and they misread the rules, sadly. Because they thought double-touching any part of the rock is OK. And then they found out that was wrong. You can only touch the electronic part of the handle.”In a statement, World Curling confirmed it did not currently use video replay to re-umpire game decisions and would not change the result. “Decisions made during a game are final,” it added.However, on Saturday, Kennedy vented his anger at the Swedish team for calling him out. “I know we’re not the only team that they’ve done that to,” he said. “They have come up with a plan here at the Olympics, as far as I know, to catch teams in the act at the hog line. It was planned right from the word go yesterday, from the words that were being said by their coaches and the way they were running to the officials.”Eriksson hit back by saying he was confident that Kennedy had not followed the rules – having watched the video. “I don’t think he has slept too well, while I slept like a baby,” he added.World Curling did, however, say it would be introducing spot checks to ensure the rules were followed.It also sent an email to every team in the Winter Olympics, reminding them that not using the handle was illegal. Canada was also warned that any repeat of the bad language would result in sanctions.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026CurlingWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Cas’s sole arbitator said she had no choice to reject the appeal because she was bound by rules in the IOC athlete expression guidelines, which prohibit athletes from expressing their views on the field of play.“The sole arbitrator considers these guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes’ interests to express their views, and athletes’ interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play,” Cas said in a statement.Andrii Sybiha, the Ukraine minister of foreign affairs, said Heraskevych’s disqualification would be remembered by future generations as “a moment of shame”. “He who has the truth on his side should prevail,” Heraskevych posted on social media on Saturday morning.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Volodymyr ZelenskyyWinter OlympicsUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Then, as the realisation that he had won gold forBrazilin the men’s giant slalom, he collapsed to the floor and allowed the tears to flow.“I just hope that Brazilians look at this and truly understand that your difference is your superpower,” he said, still sobbing away. “It may show up in your skin or in the way you dress. But I hope this inspires every kid out there who feels a bit different to trust who you are.”From vertigo to Van Gogh: 10 things you may have missed at the Winter OlympicsRead moreOn the back of his helmet, Pinheiro Braathen has in big letters “Vamos Dancar” – “Let’s Dance.” And he certainly did that on his first run, establishing a stunning 0.95sec lead over the Swiss legend Marco Odermatt.Braathen’s performance was so good that only seven skiers were within two seconds of his pace, and while he leaked away some of his advantage with some ragged turns in his second run, he held his nerve to win gold by 0.58sec. “It really was one hell of a first run and I was able to keep composed and balanced in the second run,” explained the 25-year-old who collapsed to the snow at the finish before rising up and holding his skis aloft. He then sought out his father, Bjorn, for a long embrace.View image in fullscreenBrazil’s Lucas Pinheiro Braathen gives a thumbs up after winning the gold medal.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP“You guys keep trying to ask me if I can put words into these emotions but I really can’t,” he admitted. “This road has really been long. And it’s been a rather unconventional one. But it’s been my one. It’s a road that has been paved with daring to be who I am.”That is certainly true. Pinheiro Braathen was born to a Brazilian mother and Norwegian father in Oslo and reluctantly took up skiing at the age of eight after being introduced to the sport by his father. He was raised speaking both Norwegian and Portuguese.He competed for Norway at the Beijing Games, where he failed to finish in either giant slalom or slalom, before stunning the sport when he split with the Norwegian federation and retired after winning the World Cup slalom title in 2023, saying he was not able to express himself or have the freedom to work with his own sponsors.View image in fullscreenFans with Brazilian flags urge Lucas Pinheiro Braathen to Olympic glory.Photograph: Fredrik Sandberg/TT/ShutterstockIn 2024, Pinheiro Braathen returned to the slopes in the colours of Brazil, the birthplace of his mother Alessandra and where he spent several years of his childhood. With 443,000 followers on Instagram, he is a regular at fashion weeks in Paris and Milan, and has also launched his own skincare product range.And two years later, he realised his dream. “It was the biggest stage I could put my foot on,” he added. “But I am built for this stage. As I said before these Games started, Brazil is not here to participate. We are going to bring a difference. That was my goal. I’ve dreamed about this for so long, that if I followed my heart I could finish off on top. And that’s why I am an Olympic champion today.”Odermatt, the reigning Olympic champion, took silver.

Nonetheless, across the three days in Bahrain it was Mercedes who finished on top with Kimi Antonelli and George Russell setting the quickest times, from the two Ferraris of Hamilton and Charles Leclerc, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in fifth and sixth for McLaren and Verstappen in seventh for Red Bull.Hamilton warns F1 over ‘ridiculously complex’ new rules after spin in testingRead moreThe Red Bull does look formidably quick but what was of real concern for F1 was the four-time champion’s open disdain for driving it. The Dutchman dismissed the energy management that now plays a critical role as being “not fun to drive” and “Formula E on steroids”. Indeed, it was the antithesis of racing, he believed, as he once more insinuated that he could leave F1 if he ceased to enjoy the racing.“The proportion of the car looks good, that’s not the problem. It’s just everything else that is a bit anti-racing,” he said. “Probably people will not be happy with me saying this. But I am outspoken and why am I not allowed to say what I think of my race car?”His words carried all the more impact forechoing those of Hamiltona day earlier. “None of the fans are going to understand it, I don’t think. It’s so complex. It’s ridiculously complex,” he said. “I sat in a meeting the other day and they’re taking us through it and it’s like you need a degree to fully understand it all.”With F1 riding a wave of popularity there will be concern their doubts manifest into a less than edifying spectacle come the first round in Melbourne on 8 March. The regulation changes this season amount to the biggest rule in F1 history with new engines – featuring an almost 50-50 split between combustion and electrical power leading to the complex energy management demands on drivers – new chassis, new tyres and the use of fully sustainable fuel.However, there were not only dissenting voices in Bahrain. The current world champion, McLaren’s Lando Norris, declared it “a lot of fun” and hadshort shrift for Verstappen.“If he wants to retire, he can retire,” he said. “I don’t expect Max is going to go out and not give a shit, he’s going to try and win. Comparing to the older cars, it doesn’t feel as pretty and beautiful to drive, but it’s still pretty good and it’s still early days.”View image in fullscreenMechanics work on Max Verstappen’s Red Bull in Bahrain.Photograph: Ali Haider/EPAMcLaren believe they still have work to do to best learn how to exploit the new demands of the Mercedes power unit with their car but appear to be there or thereabouts with the other expected frontrunners Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari. Ferrari too can consider the three days in Bahrain very positive, with Leclerc’s race simulation run showing enormous pace, as did Hamilton’s on the final day, noted by Norris and Russell. With aero advances set for the final test, Ferrari are looking very promising indeed.Mercedes had appeared to be early favourites after thefirst test in Barcelonabut in Bahrain it was Red Bull, who are building their own engine for the first time, who caught the eye as they managed to recover energy so efficiently they could deploy it to serious and extended effect on the straights, where Verstappen was repeatedly demonstrating a fearsome straight-line speed.The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said it had set “the benchmark” at perhaps a second per lap of extra pace and Russell called it a “pretty scary” advantage. Which inevitably led to Red Bull’s technical director, Pierre Waché, playing the testing game with gusto as he insisted his team to be at best fourth fastest behind Mercedes Ferrari and McLaren. Verstappen joined the chorus in suggesting Mercedes were clearly sandbagging. “I can tell you one thing: just wait until Melbourne and see how much power they suddenly find. I already know that,” he said.All of which is part and parcel of the gamesmanship in testing but behind it also lies some serious politicking as therow involving Mercedeshaving exploited a loophole to gain an advantage in the compression ratio of their engine rumbled on in the background. There will be an important F1 commission meeting next week in Bahrain, at which the governing body, the FIA, is known to understood to want to close the issue before Melbourne.Away from the sharp end, the much-anticipated surge from Aston Martin with their first car designed by Adrian Newey has been lacklustre at best. Lance Stroll berated the engine (a failing already acknowledged by the manufacturers, Honda), balance and grip as he noted pointedly they were four seconds off the pace of the leaders. They have at least managed to put in some decent running now but the car’s current weaknesses appear to leave a mountain to climb, even given the exponential rate of development expected this season.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Max VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Bremen kept the league leaders at bay in the opening stages but Kane gave Bayern the lead after 22 minutes, converting a penalty after the video assistant referee pointed out Lennart Karl had been felled in the box.Bayern doubled their lead three minutes later when Kane snuck a low shot in off the right post from the edge of the box. The Bayern captain, Manuel Neuer, was substituted at half-time because of a recurrence of a calf injury. Bremen’s Marco Gruell hit the post shortly after the break but Bayern put the game to bed when Goretzka swept home with 20 minutes remaining.Hoffenheimcontinued their turnaround this season, beatingFreiburg3-0 at home with goals from Fisnik Asllani, Ozan Kabak and Valentin Gendrey as they tightened their grip on third spot.Bayer LeverkusenbeatSt Pauli4-0 at home, their fifth win in their past six games, taking the 2023-24 title winners to fourth spot.

But as they looked to be on their way to victory, Locatelli equalised.Zielinski, however, had other ideas and Inter advanced to 61 points, comfortably ahead of second-placed Milan, who have played one match fewer, on 53, while Juventus remained fourth on 46.Ederson and Nicola Zalewski scored asAtalantabeatLazio2-0 in Serie A to strengthen their claim for a place in European football next season.

A third consecutive league victory, coupled with Paris Saint-Germain slipping up 3-1 at Rennes on Friday, sent Pierre Sage’s side one point clear of the champions.

It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about”.Wasserman was facing a client rebellion after suggestive communications with Maxwell in 2003 were released. In one, he told her: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?”In a response to the then married man, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. “All that rubbing – are you sure you can take it? The thought frankly is leaving me a little breathless.”In another, Maxwell asked if it will be foggy enough during an upcoming visit “so that you can float naked down the beach”.In recent days, a number of Wasserman’s clients, including Grammy winner Chappell Roan and US women’s soccer star Abby Wambach, cut ties to the agency. In a statement, Roan said: “No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.”Artists, she added, “deserve representation that aligns with their values and supports their safety and dignity” and her decision “reflects my belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust”.After the emails were disclosed, Wasserman issued an apology, saying he regretted his correspondence with Maxwell, “which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light”. He stated: “I never had a personal or business relationship withJeffrey Epstein.”Other Wasserman clients who have departed the agency or spoke out include the Dropkick Murphys, John Summit, Orville Peck, Weyes Blood, Best Coast front woman Bethany Cosentino and the indie group Wednesday.Wasserman joins a lengthy parade of business figures who have resigned or stepped down over their contacts with Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, or Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for related offenses.Figures who have stepped aside include Kathryn Ruemmler, the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and former White House counsel to Barack Obama. Emails showed that Ruemmler described Epstein as an “older brother” and downplayed his sex crimes.Attorney Brad Karp stepped down as chair of the high-powered law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison after emails showed him thanking Epstein “for including me in an evening I’ll never forget”.This article was amended on 14 February 2026.

They’ve got them wrong on more than one occasion but I thought the players did really well to control their emotions, to stay calm.”View image in fullscreenMarco Bizot brings down Jacob Murphy to earn a red card.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesIn Unai Emery’s view, the game’s events had served as further proof in his belief that “VAR is necessary to help referees, to have as a reference”.Tammy Abraham’s opener for Aston Villa, his first goal for the club since 2019, found Newcastle’s defence slumbering when Douglas Luiz scooped a free-kick through. The striker was clearly offside. Perhaps both defenders and officials have become too reliant on the tech. No semi-automation here; the goal stood.VAR makes hypocrites of us all. Emery and Howe have been critical of the technology in recent weeks. In the Premier League, there would have been second looks on first-half penalty-area challenges on Lewis Hall and Harvey Barnes but Kavanagh let the game flow. Lucas Digne’s first-half yellow card for clattering Jacob Murphy had a distinct tinge of red, the latter’s leg having the stud marks to show it. Again, the decision stood. Good process?Seconds before the break, there was no mistake about Marco Bizot’s dismissal, a rush of blood of volcanic proportions. Fully 45 yards from goal, the Villa goalkeeper’s last-man foul on Murphy was incomprehensible. Bizot himself required a second look on the touchline video screen to make any sense of it. Emi Martínez came on as sub keeper.Burnley turfed out of FA Cup on perfect day for Louis Reed and MansfieldRead moreBoth starting XIs had betrayed greater interest in other competitions. Barring a Champions League miracle, the FA Cup represents Newcastle’s sole chance of silverware to follow last year’s Carabao Cup. Last March at Wembley was the realisation of a dream but Howe now deals in more prosaic realities. “You see all this stuff on social media which he doesn’t deserve,” said Kieran Trippier, Newcastle’s captain. “We are fully behind him.”This season has been a sincere test of true faith for the Toon Army. Bruno Guimarães’s absence, with the prognosis he could miss 12 games, must be overcome. “He’s devastated,” said Howe. Newcastle have not won a league match without the Brazilian since March 2022. Could the FA Cup offer guidance?Villa, a man down, sitting back on their advantage, asked Newcastle to play through them. Initially, that did not come easy. More outrage followed when Digne handled in the box. It was plumb, and yet Kavanagh and his assistant Nick Greenhalgh ruled the offence outside. At least there was summary justice as Tonali clattered in the rebound of the resultant, errant free-kick to equalise. “I’m fairly sure it was a penalty,” said Trippier, showing similar restraint to his manager. “But this is football, you have to react to disappointments and we did that.”Newcastle seized merrily on their hard-won momentum. Anthony Gordon threw back his mane in disgust at a chance missed. Dan Burn was grappled to the floor by Pau Torres in the Villa box. Play on, said Kavanagh, ears now burning at the ridicule aimed his way.Tonali’s second goal mirrored his first but was a yet sweeter hit, laid up by Burn. The withdrawal of Morgan Rogers and Douglas Luiz suggested surrender from Emery, as did the comedic defending from which Woltemade profited to score from close range.

A stunning Louis Reed free-kick completed a hard-fought turnaround for the League One side against their labouring Premier League opponents.There is little doubt thatBurnleyare getting relegated, leaving the Cup as their only hope of salvaging a desperate season, but they lacked quality from start to finish on another dispiriting day for Scott Parker. Mansfield were not necessarily the better side but Nigel Clough’s men worked harder, leaving the fans and players celebrating long after the game was over.Mansfield stun Burnley, Southampton v Leicester goes to extra time: FA Cup – liveRead more“The FA Cup’s always been a fantastic competition – for Mansfield Town to get into this position, it’s an incredible achievement,” said their first-team coach, Andy Garner. “This is very high in what we’ve achieved.”Quick GuideFA Cup roundup: Saints strike late; Norwich beat BaggiesShowJames Bree scored an extra-time winner to fireSouthamptonto a 2-1 FA Cup victory at home to their Championship rivalsLeicester.

After the promise of a first win in 17 Premier League games against Crystal Palace in midweek, the goodwill that earned was lost at a frustrated Turf Moor. With relegation almost a certainty, taking the Cup seriously could have salvaged something amid the misery but it created more.“Certainly when you come off the back of a result that we had in midweek, you probably dampen the noise around the place a little bit.” Parker said. “You come into this game wanting to get a result and keep that momentum and we’ve just applied that noise even more now, tenfold and rightly so.”There were nine changes from Selhurst Park and Burnley never found a rhythm. It puts Parker’s role under scrutiny because the football is not worth watching and if they cannot get past a mid-table third tier side at home, then he might not be the long-term solution. The chair, Alan Pace, called for the fans’ “anger and frustration” to be turned into support, an indication not all is well at Turf Moor, with this result only increasing the upset.View image in fullscreenLouis Reed curls home Mansfield’s winner from 25 yards.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersBefore the break, Burnley could have been out of sight. Ashley Barnes missed from close range and Loum Tchaouna lost all composure to fire over from inside the box but at least Josh Laurent gave the hosts the lead. It was a rare moment of quality on an afternoon of scrappy football. Lyle Foster and Tchaouna exchanged passes on the edge of the box, before Laurent put the goalkeeper on the floor and rolled the ball into an empty net.Mansfield failed to threaten in the first half, offering endeavour but without possessing the necessary skill to cause the Burnley backline problems. They got the ball out to the wings with great regularity but the crosses invariably did not reach their targets. “We said: ‘You need to be better,’” Garner said, “‘because you haven’t done your jobs.’ That’s what we told them: ‘Just be a little bit better, put some more crosses in the box, test them, and we’ll see what happens.’ Sometimes the players do listen to you and actually do what you tell them to do.”Things changed after the break as Burnley’s stumbling performance became an outright collapse. Hjalmar Ekdal fell over 30 yards from his own goal, allowing Oates to have a one-on-one with the goalkeeper, but he scooped the ball over the bar. It was not the finish Mansfield wanted but it was the first sign of hope.Oates did not make the same mistake again. Kyle Knoyle found space on the right and sent a pinpoint cross to the back post, where the forward was waiting. He rose above Laurent, wanting to win the header more, leaving Max Weiss at a standstill, as the silence of a half-full Turf Moor was interrupted.Mansfield were happy to turn the match into a battle, with Oates earning a war wound when Florentino Luís kicked him above the eye, to give away a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Reed stepped up and whipped the ball into the top corner for a first victory over a top-flight club since 1969. “As soon as it left my boot I felt it going in,” the captain said. “I have been working on them throughout the week. The lads said: ‘This is your moment, go and take it.’ Thankfully, I did.”Cue delirium in the away end, a noise that was repeated at full-time, even drowning out the boos of the few home supporters that stayed.Explore more on these topicsFA CupBurnleyMansfieldmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was the defender’s first goal for the club he joined last month.Burnley turfed out of FA Cup on perfect day for Louis Reed and MansfieldRead moreAlfie Dorrington’s own goal had suggested a City avalanche that might emulatelast season’s 8-0 Cup winhere but it did not happen. Instead, Salford’s packed back and middle lines stifled their aristocratic hosts.Guardiola was unhappy at the display but delighted that City were through; this born winner adores being in contention for any trophy. The manager said: “One of our players had to put the ball on the opposite side [to gain space] and it happened only after 2-0. That is why it was boring. We didn’t read the spaces where we were. We spent too much time making the process.“The only good news that we go through. That’s all. I know the players want it, it is just we didn’t read what we should do. Maybe I didn’t convey what we should do to be more fluid.”Six minutes were enough for Rayan Aït-Nouri to force Dorrington to turn into his net. Tijjani Reijnders fed the left-back along his flank and a whipped-in cross was slipped past Matthew Young by the on-loan Tottenham centre-back.The XI Guardiola fielded was completely different from 13 months ago. It featured Omar Marmoush at centre-forward, as Erling Haaland was absent after being injuredin the win over Fulham, with John Stones the captain, in his first appearance since early December after a thigh problem.Salford are sixth in League Two, despite losing two of their last three league games, and in Karl Robinson have a manager bolstered by signing a new deal on Friday. His 3-5-2 featured Ryan Graydon partnered in attack by Kelly N’Mai, the midfielder pushed forward as Robinson hoped the 21-year-old’s pace would trouble City.View image in fullscreenAlfie Dorrington (centre) diverts the ball past his goalkeeper for Manchester City’s first goal.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesGraydon did precisely this when roving left in front of the home D and passing to Josh Austerfield: the midfielder had sight of James Trafford’s posts but, when unloading, miskicked and, in going to challenge Max Alleyne, was hurt and forced off.This brought Ryan McAidoo on to play along the right, Rico Lewis occupying Alleyne’s right-back berth, and Austerfield’s next act was to pull Stones down at a corner, but the referee, Matthew Donohue, was not interested in City’s penalty claims.Robinson was pleased at how becalmed City were – the closest they came to a second by half-time was Marmoush’s 23rd-minute finish chalked off for offside. Towards the end of the opening period Salford nearly broke their drought against top–flight opponents when Ben Woodburn shot, Trafford tipping over.Then at close range, from a corner, Brandon Cooper spurned a platinum-plated chance to head the equaliser, missing badly at the far post. “He had to score,” said Robinson.The Liverpudlian sent his men out for the second half with encouragement that a shock could be forced. City came out invigorated – initially. The quiet Rayan Cherki galloped forward and fed McAidoo, the youngster’s shot tingled Young’s fingers, and two corners followed. Yet no goals did and a Robinson volley aimed at Rosaire Longelo for not threading the ball towards City’s goal indicated he fancied Salford’s chances.Quick GuideFA Cup roundup: Saints strike late; Norwich beat BaggiesShowJames Bree scored an extra-time winner to fireSouthamptonto a 2-1 FA Cup victory at home to their Championship rivalsLeicester.

Guardiola’s substitutions proved the better when Guéhi bundled in. The goal calmed nerves but this was far from vintage Guardiola-era City.Robinson said: “I feel an immense amount of pride.

They had lost their popular manager of seven years, Thomas Frank. They had lost their two best forwards, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. They had lost their goalkeeper Mark Flekken. And they had lost two stalwarts in Christian Nørgaard and Ben Mee (even if the latter’s involvement the previous season had been limited as he turned 35). Departure and replacement is an unavoidable part of life for a club such as Brentford, but this seemed a like a lot to deal with.Their summer signings were hard to judge. As a rule of thumb, if Brentford are signing someone about whom you already have considered opinions, it’s likely something has gone awry. That said, Caoimhín Kelleher’s gifts are clear, and a fee of just under £13m seemed good value for a goalkeeper with Premier League experience, while Dango Ouattara had demonstrated at Bournemouth how effective he could be either through the middle or out wide. But Antoni Milambo, Michael Kayode and Kaye Furo were unknown quantities.But the biggest unknown was the manager – or, at least, it was unknown how effective Keith Andrews would be as a manager. Part of the issue with his credibility was that he was so familiar from his (excellent) television work. There’s always a degree of scepticism when a member of the backroom staff steps up, but it’s magnified when everyone recognises him as the Championship punditry bloke off Sky Sports.‘He would fill you with confidence’: how Liam Rosenior made his mark at HullRead moreA manager is supposed to have an aura, a mystique, to come from an elevated land with great wisdom to impart. He’s not meant to be readily pictured leaning forward on the Friday-night sofa to speak with eloquence and earnestness about West Brom’s pressing triggers or the deficiencies of Middlesbrough’s offside trap.It was entirely reasonable in August to fear for Brentford. They have the lowest wage bill in the Premier League. Their repeated mid-table finishes are a miracle of defying gravity. With so many key elements in their recent successes departed and a new manager with no frontline experience, doubt was logical. Yet, afterThursday’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal, they sit seventh in the table, 16 points clear of the relegation zone, surely safe, and dreaming of European qualification.Brentford have beaten Liverpool, Manchester United and Aston Villa and taken points off Chelsea and Arsenal at home. And if they win at Macclesfield in the FA Cup on Monday, they will be in the fifth round for only the third time since theyreached the last eightin 1989. It’s unlikely they will match their fifth-place finish in 1936, but a best postwar season of eighth or higher is attainable.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Igor Thiago shoots past Sunderland’s Robin Roefs. His 17 goals so far have filled the gap left by  the absence of Mbeumo and Wissa.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersSo what’s gone right? Most obviously, there is Igor Thiago and his 17 goals this season. Injury restricted the Brazilian to one league start in 2024-25, but his potency this campaign has meant the absence of Mbeumo and Wissa has barely been noticed. Brentford’s capacity to identify talent remains extraordinary. It’s true that he scored 18 goals for Club Brugge in the season before he moved, but plenty of forwards have been rampant in a second-tier European league without being able to replicate that in the Premier League.There’s Kayode, perhaps the best exponent of the long throw in a league obsessed by them, as was underlined again against Arsenal. There’s Kevin Schade, whose pace makes him a tremendous threat on the break. There’s the relentlessness of Keane Lewis-Potter. There’s Nathan Collins, a fine old-fashioned centre-back.There’s Mikkel Damsgaard, slight and cerebral, more wispy academic than modern-day midfielder, but an adept unlocker of massed rearguards – when he gets the chance; Andrews often prefers a more physical option. There’s Vitaly Janelt, one of those more physical midfield options, gobbling up possession and distributing calmly.But there is also Andrews. It’s clear the structures at Brentford are exceptional, a point only emphasised by Frank’s struggles after stepping outside that environment, but that doesn’t mean success is automatic.Talking about his “word of the week” in pre-season may have seemed uncomfortably like Andrews had spent too much time on LinkedIn or was looking for a gig hosting one of those podcasts in which plausible people explain that you too could be as successful as them, if only you spent 20% less time sleeping and 12% more rubbing ice cubes over your sinuses while sipping a smoothie made of horse placenta, but it seems to have worked. Given Liam Rosenior’s evident popularity with the Chelsea squad, maybe it’s time to accept that the era of the brusque football man with his simple tastes (steak and chips, Spain, Billy Joel) is over and the epoch of players as wannabe CEOs is upon us.However he’s done it, Andrews has created a side that are quick and direct, as dangerous on the counterattack as any in the Premier League. Igor Thiago is part of that, one of the most effective of the new wave of No 9s, a striker who causes central defenders physical problems.Brentford are capable of sitting deep and absorbing pressure in a low block but, as is the modern way, also able to press hard and high when required. They are a threat from set plays, not only Kayode’s throws but also corners. And they are physical and motivated enough to win more than their fair share of duels.There is something very modern about Brentford. But that’s not just about style of play, it’s about what they are. What is the next stage? Perhaps they can dream of a Cup run or European qualification, butCrystal Palace offer a warningof how quickly that sort of success can turn sour. The modern stratification of football means no matter how sensibly a club are run there are ceilings through which they cannot pass.Brentford cannot deny gravity for ever. Their best players will move on and so too will their managers. But they are denying it now and they should enjoy it while they can. The doubts at the start of the season were understandable enough, but that only highlights how remarkable Brentford are.Explore more on these topicsBrentfordInside footballcommentShareReuse this content"

A couple of nearly-moments may linger; in the final seconds, at which point these teams had been slogging it out for 133 minutes, the substitute Kain Adom saw an effort repelled by Alphonse Areola and Kegs Chauke, another sub, skittled the rebound into the side-netting to gasps.Quick GuideFA Cup roundup: Saints strike late; Norwich beat BaggiesShowJames Bree scored an extra-time winner to fireSouthamptonto a 2-1 FA Cup victory at home to their Championship rivalsLeicester.

Burton made it to the Carabao Cup semi-finals under Nigel Clough seven years ago, when the goalkeeper Brad Collins, on loan then from Chelsea and now from Coventry, endured a draining night picking the ball out of his net as Manchester City killed the tie with a 9-0 first-leg victory. John Brayford, part of Bowyer’s coaching staff, was in defence that day.There was a different energy to this game, however, and these opponents were devoid of quality until Nuno introduced Summerville and Valentin Castellanos on 82 minutes. Kick-off was delayed as a hole in Areola’s net was patched up in front of the visiting West Ham fans, who sang against the club’s chair, David Sullivan and vice-chair, Karren Brady. The message also rained down from a few thousand feet, a plane flying over the Pirelli Stadium trailing a banner against the hierarchy.View image in fullscreenTempers flare between Burton and West Ham after Freddie Potts’s red card.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAWest Ham treated the first half like an inconvenience, Mohamadou Kanté’s skied shot that easily cleared the West Stand terrace symptomatic of a dire display.Mavropanos was the only survivor from the side that would have beaten Manchester United on Tuesday but for Benjamin Sesko’s 96th-minute equaliser and the debutant Keiber Lamadrid was among those who struggled. It was Adama Traoré, on his first start, who exhibited West Ham’s first flash of Premier League quality nine minutes into the second half, pressing pause and then speeding past Toby Sibbick before sending a dangerous ball into the six-yard box. The ball eluded Callum Wilson and just as Ollie Scarles attacked the cross, Kyran Lofthouse intervened to take it off his toes.West Ham improved – albeit it was a low bar – against a side who will, like West Ham, reimmerse themselves in a relegation battle next week. Mavropanos soared high to direct a header at Collins and a few minutes later the Greece defender skewed wide. Wilson sent a first-time shot at goal from a tight angle but there was little evidence to suggest this game would finish in regular time.Both teams struggled to create clear chances, prompting the in-form Summerville to take matters into his own hands four minutes into extra time. The winger darted inside from the left flank and drifted unopposed towards the edge of the box, dispatching a curled shot at goal that looped past Collins via a deflection.Given the paucity of openings, that, surely, was that? Potts’s red card plunged West Ham into trouble, Jack Armer placing a shot wide before Burton threw bodies forward. Nuno called for Axel Disasi and Malick Diouf to see out the game. It was ugly but West Ham got the job done. “We achieved what we came here to do,” Nuno said.Explore more on these topicsFA CupBurton AlbionWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Jørgensen put them ahead on 21 minutes and restored the lead after Koki Saito’s equaliser before Ryoya Morishita’s goal early in the second half sealed the victory.O’Neill later refused to take credit, saying Damien Johnson, who has been in caretaker charge, deserved the plaudits. “I only arrived in the building yesterday at 11am, so the work was done by Damien all week. He prepared the team and did a fantastic job.”Jørgensen’s attacking partnership with Andri Gudjohnsen was a key factor in Rovers’ victory. O’Neill, who urged his new team on from the technical area, having initially considered watching from the stands, said the decision to deploy the duo together up front was Johnson’s.“The front two have a lot in them. They played really well with each other,” O’Neill said. “That was Damien. He felt the two up top would benefit us. Having them give us what they gave us, in and out of possession, was a real bonus. Damien said he felt it would really benefit the team if I was in the dugout, so I took guidance from him.

To bring greater consistency to our performances and compete with conviction in every match.ProfileIgor TudorShowPlaying daysAn imposing centre-back, Tudor broke through at hometown club Hajduk Split before joining Juventus in 1998. He spent nine years in Turin, winning two Serie A titles before returning to Hajduk. Tudor also won 55 Croatia caps, playing at the 1998 and 2006 World Cups and scoring against England at Euro 2004.Early managerial careerTudor's first managerial job came at Hajduk, winning the Croatian Cup in 2013. He lasted just nine months at Greek side Paok before being sacked due to \"unsuccessful results and criticism of the team\". After a year at Karabukspor, Tudor moved to Galatasaray but was sacked after 10 months, having struggled in Europe and fallen out with star player Wesley Sneijder.Return to ItalyTudor was named head coach of Udinese in April 2018 and saved the club from relegation. He left in the summer, but returned to Friuli in March 2019.  Tudor rejoined Hadjuk in January 2020 but after just eight months he was back in Italy, joining Juventus as Andrea Pirlo's assistant. The pair won the 2021 Coppa Italia but failed to regain the title and were dismissed. \"I think it was unfair,\" Tudor said. \"I've decided I will no longer work as an assistant for anybody else.\"Season in Verona and Marseille moveTudor was hired by Verona in September 2021 after they started the season with three league defeats. He improved things quickly, guiding them to a ninth-placed finish – but again leaving at the end of the season. Tudor's next job came at Marseille, where he replaced Jorge Sampaoli. The team finished third in Ligue 1 but flopped in the Champions League, losing twice to Tottenham. He announced his exit in June after \"a great year\", saying he was \"tired\" of managing Marseille.Lazio stint and return to JuventusTudor waited nine months for his next job, which came at Lazio after Maurizio Sarri resigned. After winning six of his 11 games in charge and sealing a Europa League spot, Tudor walked away after reported disputes with the club hierarchy over transfer targets. Having previously been linked with a return to Juventus, Tudor replaced Thiago Motta in March 2025, guiding the club to fourth place. He signed a contract extension until 2028, but was sacked in October after an eight-game winless run.Guardian sportWin percentages by clubHadjuk Split(first stint) 44.9%Paok37.78%Karabukspor38.1%Galatasaray55.9%Udinese(combined) 42.3%Hadjuk Split(second stint) 50.0%Verona38.9%Marseille56.3%Lazio54.6%Juventus41.7%Photograph: Jamie, Mcdonald/02 ALLSPORT UKWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“There is strong quality in this playing squad, and my job is to organise it, energise it and improve our results quickly.”Once Spurs chief executive Vinai Venkatesham – along with other influential figures – decided Frank’s tenure had to end, they switched focus to how best to salvage the season.With a wider pool of managerial candidates to pick from in the summer, including former manager Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham elected to go down the interim route for the final three months of this season.An experienced interim was favoured and Spurs have chosen Tudor, who has in recent years gone into Lazio and Juventus midway through league campaigns and delivered an instant upturn in results.Tudor’s lack of Premier League experience has raised eyebrows amongst an already disgruntled and concerned Tottenham fanbase, especially given relegation to the second tier of English football for the first time since 1977 is a real possibility.However, the former Juventus defender faced Spurs on two occasions during his time at Marseille in 2022 and won five of his nine matches at Lazio after his March arrival in the 2023-24 campaign.Tudor produced an equally impressive revival in Turin last year when he guided Juventus into the Serie A top four with five victories during the final two months of the campaign, before he was dismissed in October.Tottenham’s hierarchy will be desperate for Tudor to enjoy a similar upturn, but his first match in charge is a north London derby with Premier League leaders Arsenal on February 22 and the 47-year-old will be missing up to 12 players.Captain Cristian Romero is suspended in a blow to Tudor, who has favoured a three-man defence and wing-backs system in his recent roles. Tudor will be familiar with some members of the Spurs squad after he worked with forward Randal Kolo Muani at Juve last season and has coached Radu Dragusin, Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski in the past, but the latter two are currently out injured.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

The hosts ran out comfortable winners and Townsend said Scotland produced “some of the best rugby we’ve ever played” in the opening quarter.Given their woundingdefeat to Italy on the opening weekendit will certainly rank among Scotland’s most memorable wins under Townsend, who has now been the architect of five Six Nations wins over England in six years. The head coach was full of praise for his players afterwards and says he was extremely proud of the reaction to the defeat by Italy.Borthwick has a big week ahead after England’s grand plans shredded in Scotland | Gerard MeagherRead more“I’m quite emotional,” Townsend told ITV Sport. “After 20 minutes I thought that was some of the best rugby we’ve ever played. So much ambition. That’s all you want as a coach. Then the effort in the second half … we became a real team that will fight for each other and our supporters. It’s great we can give them something to smile about for the next 12 months.“We were just true to ourselves. We moved the ball away from contact, were aggressive in contact and played at speed. That was one of Finn Russell’s best performances for Scotland. The work rate from our forwards was superb.“There are so many games where you play well but the opposition play well too and get narrow wins. We know we’re up there with the teams we come up against. For coaches, there is more a feeling of relief but for the players it’s joy. But we’re back on it next week. We’ll go to Cardiff and build on what we’ve done today.”The Scotland captain, Sione Tuipulotu, acknowledged the Italian disappointment had fuelled his side’s desire to take down England. “I did really feel desperate this week …I can’t remember hurting like that after a game,” said Tuipulotu, who felt his side had “bossed” an England team previously unbeaten in 12 Tests. “For us to pick ourselves up again … I’m so proud of the coaching staff and the group. It’s not easy to be in that changing room and not get the results.“It’s hard at times to sit in the chair I’m sitting in. Now I really want us to back up this performance next week in a stadium we’ve previously had problems in. I feel this is a performance that can change a lot.”Scotland do have some injury problems to manage, with Jack Dempsey (biceps) and Jamie Ritchie (knee) out of next week’s game against Wales and Jamie Dobie nursing a shoulder injury.England’s head coach,Steve Borthwick, acknowledged his side were blown away in the first quarter and were left with too much ground to make up after Henry Arundell’s red card.“I am bitterly disappointed,” said Borthwick. “Scotland got an advantage from the aerial contest and from those loose balls they attacked really well. Clearly playing such a large part of the game without a winger against a team moving the ball to the edge that much hurt us. Ultimately it gave us too much to do in the second half.“To have conceded the points we conceded in the first 20 minutes was disappointing. We played against New Zealand and were 12-0 downand we reeled them in. Unfortunately we gave Scotland too much of a head start and playing 30 minutes of that first 50 with 14 men hurt us. He [Arundell] is disappointed as all the players are but he will bounce back.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Scotland rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Working as a pundit on the BBC, Wayne Rooney has described the decision to award Newcastle a free-kick instead of a penalty for a Lucas Digne handball that clearly occurred a couple of yards inside the box as “one of the worst decisions” he has ever seen in football.It was one of several contenders for the accolade in this match alone, but luckily justice was served when Newcastle scored on the back of the free-kick in question. “That decision is one of the worst decisions I have ever seen in football because at no stage was Digne out of the penalty box,” said Rooney.“He is three or four yards inside. The linesman is just in front of it and you can clearly see how much he is in the penalty box. The referee looked like he blew and looked like he was listening to someone in his ear, so I’m assuming the linesman gave the decision and it’s an absolute shocker.”Tonight may well have proved that some match officials have become over-reliant on VAR and are now too scared to make big decisions themselves. In this match alone, Villa’s opener was offside but allowed to stand, Lucas Digne was only booked for what seemed a clear red card offence, Newcastle were denied a stonewall penalty and could conceivably have been awarded another spot-kick for a Pau Torres foul on Dan Burn at a corner.

So, it was to some raised eyebrows that the country’s sprint queen was usurped by Amy Hunt last summer – the young upstart claiming world championships 200m silver, while Asher-Smith faded to fifth.Australian sprint star Gout Gout will not race at 2026 Commonwealth GamesRead moreThe former world 200m champion could – but notably chose not to – point to the mitigating circumstances of a turbulent mid-season return to England after a training move to America gone wrong. But the changing of the guard felt significant: one athlete on the up and the other on the decline. Or was she?Now back in Texas, albeit with a different coach to the one she left last summer, Asher-Smith has spent the winter, during which she turned 30, running with notably renewed vigour. A few swift early-season performances paved the way for this first appearance at the UK Indoor Championships in a decade, and a return to her throne looked a certainty from the moment she stepped on the Birmingham track on Saturday.A time of 7.17sec in the heats preceded 7.11 in the semi-finals and then an utterly dominant 7.05 – a championship record – to triumph in the final, well clear of Hunt, who clocked 7.15 for silver. The winning time was the third-quickest of Asher-Smith’s career. Who thought it wise to suggest the best might be behind her?“I’ve learned so much about myself over the past few years,” she said. “I’m somebody who runs fast when I’m happy. I’m really enjoying training in this environment, but most importantly I’ve got to be happy in myself. I think you’re seeing that.“Last year was very tough. But I’ve changed as a person, and I think I gained a lot of confidence from that because to be disappointed that I didn’t medal [at the world championships] when you have training disruptions like that … I was just proud that psychologically I could handle it.”She will now head to next month’s World Indoor Championships in Poland, alongside Hunt, whose strongest suit remains over longer sprint distances. “Obviously, it’s not nice to lose to one of your biggest rivals, so I’m slightly frustrated,” Hunt said. “But on the plus side, we are getting a lot more consistent. For me to be frustrated with a 7.15 shows how far I have come in the last 12 months.“No one still expects anything from me in the 60s, so I get to go out there and just have fun. If I can keep this momentum rolling, I will be super happy.”Asher-Smith’s winning margin was significantly greater than in the men’s equivalent, in which reigning world and European 60m champion Jeremiah Azu had to fight to the line to see off Romell Glave, clocking 6.56 to the silver medallist’s 6.62.View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson in Birmingham but she is now setting her sights on the 800m world record.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe day’s leading performance emerged from what effectively became a first-round time trial. With the British selection policy for the World Indoor Championships merely requiring athletes to turn up and compete here in Birmingham, Keely Hodgkinson had announced earlier in the week that she would contest only the 800m heats and not Sunday’s final.With only one opportunity to impress, the Olympic champion produced a phenomenal solo performance to break her own British indoor record with a winning time of 1min 56.33sec, the third-fastest indoor time in history.Instead of lining up for the final, she will take on a high-class field next week at a meeting in France, where she has her sights set on breaking the world record of 1:55.82 that was set on the day she was born – 3 March 2002.“I have high hopes for next week,” she said. “I’ve been trying to get it for years. I think I’m very capable of doing it. I’ve had my healthiest winter in years, I haven’t missed a single thing, and I think that shows it. I feel like it’s destined to be mine – I feel like it would be great if I can break it.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDina Asher-SmithnewsShareReuse this content"

Reclaiming the Calcutta Cup is always sweet but convincingly ending England’s 12-Test unbeaten record was a glorious bonus. For Gregor Townsend and his side, under pressure after theiropening round defeat in Rome, this was some riposte to their criticsUltimately, it was not even close. Two tries by Huw Jones, a hard-nosed collective effort from the Scottish pack and a typically artful display from Finn Russell were simply too much for an England team who had dared to believe this week that their previous tartan traumas were behind them. Instead, they were outplayed and tactically out-thought by Townsend and his coaching staff. England have now won just two of the past nine meetings between the nations.‘Something to smile about’: Townsend salutes Scotland after shocking EnglandRead moreScotland were rampant at times in the first half, with sharp tries by Jones, Jamie Ritchie and Ben White giving them a 24-10 interval cushion. From England’s perspective, there was little improvement thereafter, with Jones’s second try, originating from a charged-down George Ford drop-goal attempt, in effect sealing the visitors’ fate.Well as Scotland played, they were assisted by a strangely below-par English effort. Little errors killed any momentum they did generate and their defensive system, with Tommy Freeman not looking entirely at ease in the midfield, was repeatedly outflanked. Steve Borthwick’s side, possibly lulled into a false sense of security by theirstraightforward win over Wales in round one, were off the pace and lacking in control and authority.View image in fullscreenHuw Jones scores Scotland’s fourth try after George Ford’s kick was charged down.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesThey also had Henry Arundell shown red in the 37th minute when the wing received his second yellow card of the game for taking out Kyle Steyn in the air. These days that means England were reduced to 14 men for only the ensuing 20 minutes but the disruption to Borthwick’s plans and the encouragement it gave Scotland were both significant.Such twists and turns are all part of the intricateSix Nationstapestry. And days such as this encapsulate the championship’s enduring appeal. The city of Edinburgh looked achingly beautiful beneath clear blue skies and, as ever, there was a tantalising sense of local expectancy on the streets and the stadium-bound trams. To dust down a classic old Scottish newspaper intro: Can they do it? Aye, I think they can.It was also a perfect evening for rugby: cold, still and atmospheric. The acoustic version of Flower of Scotland never sounds better than when England are in town, while the hosts’ defeat in Rome added a now-or-never element. For Scotlandthisfixture was a clear fork in the road in terms of their championship prospects.Quick GuideMatch detailsShowScotlandJordan, Steyn, Jones, Tuipulotu (capt), Dobie, Russell, White; McBeth, Turner, Z Fagerson, Brown, Cummings, Ritchie, Darge,Dempsey.ReplacementsCherry, Schoeman, Millar-Mills, Williamson, M Fagerson, Horne, Hastings, Graham.TriesJones 2, Ritchie, White.ConsRussell 4PenRussell.EnglandSteward; Roebuck, Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Heyes, Chessum, Itoje, Pepper, Underhill, Earl.ReplacementsGeorge, Rodd, Davison, Coles, Pollock, T Curry, Spencer, F Smith.Yellow cardArundell 8.Red cardArundell 37.TriesArundell, Earl.ConsFord 2.PensFord 2.Referee:Nika Amashukeli (Georgia).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Gregor Townsend had demanded a good start “to show who we are” and the opening 14 minutes suggested his players were still very much listening to him. Even before Arundell received a slightly harsh first yellow for desperately trying to slow down a home attack, Scotland were already ahead through a Russell penalty and looking sharp. A 14-man England were struggling to get a grip and a lovely midfield tip-on by Russell then gave Jones the chance to run around Maro Itoje, temporarily out of his natural habitat on the right wing.Worse was to follow for the visitors as Scotland poured forward again, committing white-shirted defenders and leaving England’s flanks exposed. This time it was Sione Tuipulotu’s long pass to the unmarked Ritchie that did the damage, with Russell’s second successful conversion further widening the gap.View image in fullscreenHenry Arundell (left) endured a tough afternoon after two yellow cards in the first half of the Calcutta Cup clash.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesEngland needed to respond urgently and did so when Arundell, back on the field, appeared on Ford’s shoulder to score his fourth try of this championship. So much for a cautious, cagey opening half-hour. A Ford penalty made it 17-10 after just 25 minutes with no sign of the contest slowing down.Russell was certainly enjoying himself and Scotland’s ringmaster was soon orchestrating more mischief. Having already danced around and through a thicket of defenders, the fly-half put in a rolling chip that held up nicely just short of the England line. Ellis Genge went to gather it but the ball squirted loose and Ben White seized gleefully on the unexpected gift.Almost nothing that England had talked about – silencing the crowd, suffocating Russell, asserting forward dominance – came to pass. They looked uncertain and their narrow defence was again shown up when Scotland chose to run from their own line, making good progress up the right-hand side rather than hoofing the ball straight back into English hands.With Arundell having now disappeared for the second time, England’s rigid gameplan badly needed updating. Ten Scottish linebreaks to three reflected the tenor of the contest’s first 40 minutes as accurately as any other stat and Borthwick’s side were already heading for their heaviest Six Nations defeat since they lost 29-13 to Ireland in 2023.Scotland 31-20 England: Six Nations player ratings from MurrayfieldRead moreEven the arrival of Tom Curry in place of Sam Underhill at half-time could not steady the sinking ship. An early scrum penalty did trim the score to 24-13 but another English calamity was just around the corner. Ford’s drop-goal attempt was charged down by the energetic Matt Fagerson and Jones was on his shoulder to sprint 60 metres for the bonus-point score.The rest was simply a matter of Scotland ensuring there would be no repeat of past collapses from winning positions, despite a late consolation try for Ben Earl. This result has also dramatically resuscitated their title hopes, with embattled Wales in Cardiff next up. Although, on the evidence of this spectacular turnaround, it would be wisest to assume nothing.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Scotland rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It was tough to watch such a gifted athlete discover the ruthlessness of his sportBryan Armen Grahamat the Milano Ice Skating ArenaSat 14 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 12.05 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleBy the timeIlia Malininreached the closing stretch of his Olympic free skate, the outcome was no longer really the story. The story was the expression on his face – not panic, not shock, but the dawning realization that a destiny he had controlled for nearly three yearshad slipped beyond his reachin the blinding span of four and a half catastrophic minutes.For the rising generation of men’s skaters, the 21-year-old Malinin has existed less as a rival than as a moving technical horizon. TheQuad God. The skater who built programs around jumps others still treated as theory, who pushed the sport into something closer to applied physics. Much like Simone Biles, who took in Friday’s contest from the Milano Ice Skating Arena’s VIP seats, his only competition was himself.The unbeaten run that stretched back more than two years through 14 competitions was only the baseline of the Malinin mythos. The prodigy from the northern Virginia suburbs wasn’t beating his opponents so much as bringing them to heel. Twenty-three months ago in Montreal afterwinning his first world titlewithhis buzzy Succession-theme routine, Malinin sat only feet away while Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama volunteered an extraordinary confession to reporters: “If we both perform at 100% of our ability, I don’t think that I will be able to win.”Anatomy of an upset: how Ilia Malinin lost Olympic figure skating goldRead moreOn Friday, as Kagiyama repeated the Olympic silver he won in Beijing despite an error-strewn performance of his own, Malinin did not simply lose gold. He lost the version of himself that had made the very idea of losing feel almost abstract.The shock was not that he’d finished unthinkably far off the podium in eighth place on a night when all his closest rivals skated below their best, all but gifting him the title. Nor was it that he made mistakes. Olympic champions lose titles on single edges and mistimed takeoffs all the time. What made this a meltdown for the ages was how quickly his program stopped resembling the poise and command Malinin had built his dominance on anddisintegrated into chaos. A popped axel where the hardest jump in the sport was supposed to live. A botched combination. A clattering fall where recovery usually followed. Another missed jumping pass at the point where his programs normally become inevitable. By the end, Malinin’s coach and father, watching from near the kiss-and-cry area, could only turn away.For most of the last three seasons, Malinin’s skating has been a controlled detonation. Drill the early quads and the rest of the program expands outward, each element building pressure on the field. On Friday, the detonation never came. Instead, Malinin simply folded inward.“The pressure of the Olympics really gets you,” he said afterward. “The pressure is unreal. It’s really not easy.”Pressure– a word he repeated at least two dozen times while facing the music in a febrile mixed zone late on Friday night – is often treated as cliche. But in sports built on timing and muscle memory, pressure is physical as much as emotional. It speeds time up. It narrows decision windows. It turns instinct into hesitation. The greatest athletes frequently describe the biggest moments as strangely calm: the game slowing down, the mind going quiet. Malinin’s brutal self-assessment hinted at the exact opposite.“Definitely not a pleasant feeling,” he said. “Training up all these years, going up to it, it honestly went by so fast. I didn’t have time to process what to do or anything. It all happens so fast.”He added: “My life has been through a lot of ups and downs, and just before getting into my starting pose, I just felt all of those experiences, memories, thoughts really just rush in. It just felt so overwhelming. I didn’t really know how to handle it in that moment.”Malinin arrived in Milan not just as the favorite, but as the architect of the sport’s technical future: the only skater to landthe quad axel, the only one building programs around seven quads, the only one capable of making “clean enough” look like domination. He’d even suggested that he’d been working on a quintuple jump to be debuted at some point in the not-so-distant future. But there were hints of his struggles throughout the week, from the team event programs that were each below his standards to the restless TikTok activity at 3am. At the highest level, performance is built on instinct. And when instinct fractures, even slightly, the entire system can come crashing down.Instead, the gold went to Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov, fifth after the short program, who delivered the kind of performance the Olympics has always quietly rewarded: clean, efficient, ambitious but controlled. Five quads. Positive execution. No deductions. No drama. Outside the arena, several dozen fans draped in Kazakh flags sang and celebrated past midnight in a steady downpour, feting their national hero:Gennady Golovkinon ice.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin congratulates Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov on his gold medal.Photograph: Andy Cheung/Getty ImagesThe contrast between Shaidorov and Malinin was almost philosophical. Malinin represents skating’s outer frontier: maximum difficulty, maximum risk, maximum possibility. Shaidorov, also 21, represented its oldest truth: the skater who survives their own program often comes out on top. That tension is not new. Olympic skating has always been less about theoretical peak difficulty and more about reproducing excellence under unbearable scrutiny.“Coming into the free program, I was really confident,” Malinin said. “And then it’s like it’s right there … and it just left your hands.”Malinin, who now faces a four-year wait before a shot at redemption at the 2030 Winter Games in the French Alps, when he will be 25, learned Friday the Olympics don’t care about momentum or narrative or technical revolutions. They care about what happens in a single performance window. For the Quad God, that window slammed shut faster than he could adjust.The loss, while deeply traumatic, will not define his career. Hewon gold in the team competitionearlier in these Olympics. He remains the sport’s most technically gifted skater and the one most likely to define where it goes next. Nathan Chen, who took in Friday’s proceedings from a seat in the press tribune, is proof the experience ofan Olympic crash-outcan lead toa brighter tomorrow.But if Malinin represents the outer limit of what skating can become, Friday night was a reminder of what it still is. A sport decided, ruthlessly and without sentiment, by who can hold themselves together long enough to reach the final pose.Explore more on these topicsIlia MalininFigure skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsWinter Olympics 2030featuresShareReuse this content"

Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. TheUS militaryhas used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.Critics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.AI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.This more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.The Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk.

Can law enforcement access this information – even when users aren’t aware officers may be viewing their footage? Two recent events have put these concerns in the spotlight.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.ASuper Bowl adby the doorbell-camera company Ring and the FBI’s pursuit of thekidnapperof Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, have resurfaced longstanding concerns about surveillance against a backdrop of the Trump administration’s immigrationcrackdown. The fear is that home cameras’ video feeds could become yet another part of the government’s masssurveillance apparatus.Ring’sSuper Bowlad appeared intended to inspire hope: a neighborhood harnessing the power of technology to find a lost dog: a distraught girl misses her pet, Milo, who has gone missing. Gone are the times of putting up “missing” posters. Simply posting Milo’s photo through the Ring app automatically alerts a host of nearby cameras to use AI to look for a match, the ad says. A neighbor then arrives on their porch with Milo, safe and sound. As they reunite, feel-good music plays. But the reference to the AI-powered feature Search Party, meant to mimic the activity of a real one, quickly triggered comparisons with a dystopian Black Mirror episode. Viewers wondered: if the company could quickly access hundreds of Ring cameras in a neighborhood to find a dog, what’s stopping it from targeting a person in the same way?In Guthrie’s case, the FBI released a video Tuesday showing a masked person at her doorstep. But the footage appears to have been retrieved from a Google Nest camera that officials previously said was disconnected and lacking an active monthly subscription for premium features. Without a subscription, users cannot typically store footage. The publication of the footage from Guthrie’s home indicated that law enforcement could still access “residual data located in backend systems”, in the words of FBI director Kash Patel;cybersecurity expertshave said this may be because doorbell cameras often have back-ups stored in acloud. It’s currently unclear whether law enforcement used a warrant.“There’s a very distinct and marked difference between what you have access to – in terms of whether you’re paying for it or not – and what the company has access to,” said Chris Gilliard, a data privacy expert who has researched how wearables and smart doorbells are contributing to mass surveillance.New images in the search for Nancy Guthrie:Over the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie’s home that may have been lost,…pic.twitter.com/z5WLgPtZpT— FBI Director Kash Patel (@FBIDirectorKash)February 10, 2026Ring, owned by Amazon, and Nest say they comply with law enforcement requests for data, including footage, when it’s legally required and in instances where there’s a threat to someone’s life. Ring also says that federal law enforcement doesn’t have direct access to the data from the doorbell camera, tellingWirecutterin a statement that “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them”. Ring has alsosaidthat the feature advertised as being able to find dogs can’t currently detect human biometrics. Nest has said in a transparency report that the company would not instantly hand over data to a federal agency with a search warrant. “We’d analyze the request to be sure the warrant wasn’t overly broad, then we’d make sure the information they requested was within the scope of the warrant,” thecompany stated.There’s been a swift backlash, as people have become more aware of surveillance concerns tied to smart home devices. Many people bought these devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages. Lawmakers from across the aisle condemned Ring’s Super Bowl ad, with the US senator Ed Markey writing in anopen letteron Wednesday that “it’s not hard to imagine the ways that Amazon – or law enforcement – could abuse this feature”. TikTok influencers called on people to “smash” their Ring doorbells, and Redditors shared tips on trying to getrefundson old Ring devices from Amazon. Graphics circulating on social media stated: “Your ring camera is an ICE agent.”Ring appears to be feeling the heat. On Thursday, Amazon announced that Ring had cancelled its partnership with Flock Safety, which runs a network of automated license plate readers across the US. Flock says it does not give ICE or the Department of Homeland Security direct access to its systems, butnewsreportshave documented an ongoing loophole:cases in which local law enforcement has used Flock’s tool in aiding federal immigration authorities.There’s a distinct and marked difference between what you have access to, and what the company has access toChris Gilliard, data privacy expertRing said in ablog postthat the integration with Flock would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated”. The company also stated that no customer videos had ever been sent to Flock, since the integration never launched, stressing a commitment to making neighborhoods safer.Data-privacy advocates are not convinced by Ring’s commitment to community safety, though. “Ring is just trying to protect its bottom line,” said Jeramie D Scott, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s surveillance oversight program. Without additional federal protections, Scott worries Ring will continue to expand its surveillance capabilities despite the recent backtracking.This isn’t the first time Ring has faced criticism over data protection. “Ring has a history of playing it pretty loose with people’s privacy rights,” said Beryl Lipton, senior investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commissionchargedthe company with “compromising its customers’ privacy by allowing any employee or contractor to access consumers’ private videos and by failing to implement basic privacy and security protections”. This, in turn, allowed hackers to “take control of consumers’ accounts, cameras, and videos”. Ringagreed to pay $5.8min a settlement with the FTC.Ring still has many partnerships with police, and with the return of its founder, Jamie Siminoff, who is now CEO, the company appears to bedoubling downon its original emphasis on fighting crime. Siminoff said last year that his cameras can almost “zero-out crime”, though experts like Gilliard are skeptical. After Siminoff’s return, the companypartnered with body-camera maker Axonto restart a tool that allows police to request footage through an online portal.“These companies – their typical strategy is to consistently push the envelope in small ways to acclimate us to more invasive uses of these things,” Gilliard said.Explore more on these topicsTechnologySurveillanceSuper BowlFBIfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The redundancies that were announced to staff on a video call, the axing of half its foreign bureau (including the war reporter in Ukraine) – not sinceP&O Ferrieshave layoffs been handled so badly. Former Post stalwartPaul Farhidescribed a decisionthat affected nearly half of the 790-strong workforce as “the biggest one-day wipeout of journalists in a generation”.Whyit happened is still baffling, at least for anyone not inside the head of one of the world’s richest men. Marty Baron, the Post’s former editor,highlightedthe owner’s “sickening” efforts to curry favour with Donald Trump in a “case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction”.Slate magazine, owned by the Graham family (previous owners of the Post),accused Bezosof “accelerating the [Post’s] decline on purpose” because of “external economic interests” such as Amazon and Blue Origin, his space business. Perhaps he agreed to savage cuts because it showed he really was the boss, or just because he could. In any case, his ownership of the Washington Post is yet more proof, if needed, that owning a newspaper is not about money; it’s about power and influence. In other words, it’s about politics.Washington Post editor acknowledges ‘genuine trauma’ over mass layoffsRead moreBezos, with his $266bn fortune,doesn’t need the moneythat a newspaper might bring in; his interest payouts make the Washington Post’s $100mannual losseslook like a rounding error. When he bought the paper in 2013, the age of Obama, Bezos splashed the cash on bonuses for reporters, used one of his private jets tocollectreporter Jason Rezaian from an Iranian jail and travelled to Istanbul tomake a speechabout murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Then, in the first age of Trump, who made no secret of his dislike for a paper known for bringing down corrupt presidents, Amazonlosta $10bn government computing contract. The resulting lawsuitblamed“improper pressure from President Donald J Trump … to harm his perceived political enemy – Jeffrey P Bezos”. (The US Department of Defense defended its selection process, saying there were no external influences.)The ability of Trump to use other means to flood the zone – social media run by himself or his big-tech pals – has made him even more dangerous in his second coming.Last week’s news was the culmination of a new mood at the Post that started in 2024. Bezos hadappointedan outsider for the first time, the British journalist and media executive Will Lewis, to be publisher just as opinion polls started to suggest that Trump would become the 47th US president. In the runup to the election, Bezospulledthe Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, on the grounds that endorsements create distrust; and insisted on a more free market-friendly orientation in its opinion pages. The decisionled, within days, to almost 250,000 subscribers deserting the paper.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Washington Post attend a rally held by guild members outside its office building on 5 February 2026.Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/ShutterstockAnyway, all this seems to go to show that uber-wealthy owners in the news industry can’t be trusted to put private interests over the public good. Or, as the award-winning editor Tina Brownsays of the Post debacle: “The purpose of having fuck-you money is to say fuck you, but it seems the purpose of fuck-you money is to have more fuck-you money.” And if the pesky newspaper that burnishes your reputation hurts your ability to make fuck-you money? Kill it – or at least let it fade into managed irrelevance.So what are the alternatives? There has been no shortage of ideas among those who care about the future of journalism. One of my favourites is the suggestion that Bezos’s ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, could pair up with other first wives of big-tech billionaires, such as Melinda French Gates, and use their divorce payouts to support the Post instead of their other philanthropic causes.A better, though possibly just as unlikely, idea is for Bezos to erect some legal frameworks to protect editorial safeguards. The best guarantees are embedded into a trust-based ownership such as that enjoyed by the Guardian. He could just stick a tiny fraction of his planet-sized fortune into a trust and have nothing to do with it.The most likely scenario is the most depressing for anyone who cares about freedom of the press. The Post will simply do less and less of the great journalism that has seen it lauded with Pulitzer prizes, until eventually no one thinks of it as thepaper of Watergateany more.The crisis at theWashington Postmarks a turning point in this new age of disillusionment, an era in which the excitement of the early web has made way for shame and bewilderment at how much we lose by allowing the rich and powerful to kill the parts of society that make it function better.Jane Martinson is an academic and Guardian columnist.

It’s a redefinition of itLisa PortolanLove has long been framed as a pursuit of the young, but this narrative lags behind realitySat 14 Feb 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 21.38 ESTShareAs Valentine’s Day approached we were once again flooded with the usual suspects: roses, chocolates, sophisticated dinners and glossy ads featuring young heterosexual couples staring earnestly into each other’s eyes. The problem isn’t just that this version of romance is exclusionary – though it is. It’s that it’s profoundly out of step with how love is actuallybeinglived, negotiated and reimagined in contemporary Australia.Culturally, love has long been framed as a pursuit of the young. From Romeo and Juliet to Normal People, from Bridget Jones to When Harry Met Sally, romantic fulfilment is depicted as something you secure early; ideally before your knees give out or your mortgage locks in. The message is consistent: find love in your 20s or 30s, settle down, and then coast (emotionally paired and narratively complete) until death do you part.That story no longer holds (if it ever truly did).In Australia, people over 50 areone of the fastest-growing cohorts actively seeking love– or, at the very least, rethinking what intimacy, partnership and companionship might look like in the second half of life. This shift isn’t marginal, it’s structural.Boyfriends are cringe. But is the #boysober trend a feminist reclamation or a neoconservative tilt? | Lisa PortolanRead moreResearch shows that close to a third of Australian divorces now occur after the age of 50; a phenomenon known as“grey divorce”. While overall divorce rateshave declinedsince their 1990s peak, separations among over-50s have bucked that trend. Empty nest syndrome, financial pressures and retirement adjustments are all major drivers but beneath these factors lies something deeper: a recalibration of expectations about happiness, fulfilment and selfhood later in life. For many, the end of a long marriage isn’t a failure. It’s a reset.This is where our cultural narratives lag behind reality.In my research on dating, gender and intimacy, I found that ideas about love remain stubbornlytemporal. There is still a perceived “right” time to marry, a sense that one should sow wild oats before settling down in one’s late 20s or early 30s. Miss that window and the language turns anxious: you’ve “missed the boat”, done things “out of order” or fallen behind the life schedule.For people dating in their 50s and beyond, that temporal anxiety is amplified. They are acutely aware that they are out of sync with the story they were promised and yet, paradoxically, often far more intentional about what they want.What became clear in my research is that older Australians come to love differently. Many women in their 50s, in particular, are seeking connection and companionship without cohabitation. They are reluctant to merge households, unwilling to take on unpaid caring roles for a new partner, and wary of financial entanglements that could jeopardise hard-won stability. This isn’t emotional coldness, it’s structural realism.After decades of gendered labour – caregiving, part-time work or interrupted careers – many women enter later life with less superannuation, fewer assets and greater financial vulnerability. Add to this rising rates of homelessness among older women and the romantic ideal of “starting over” through shared property or pooled finances begins to look less like love and more like a risk.Men and women do not arrive at later-life dating on equal footing, and pretending otherwise only reinforces outdated ideals of romance that no longer serve anyone.Then there’s the dating landscape itself. For many over-50s, dating apps arrived suddenly and without warning; a brutal technological intervention into a world where courtship once involved friends, workplaces and chance encounters. For some, apps offered an unexpected abundance: a buffet of possibility, a way back into desire. For others, the swipe-and-discard logic felt alienating, even dehumanising, a sharp departure from slower and relational forms of connection.Still, people adapt.What’s striking is that despite the upheaval, many older Australians report being content on their own. More than half say they are satisfied with single life, particularly women, who cite independence, peace and personal space as key benefits. This doesn’t signal a retreat from love. It signals a redefinition of it.We’re already seeing cultural green shoots. Programs like The Golden Bachelor have drawn large Australian audiences, suggesting a hunger for romantic stories that don’t centre youth. More broadly, as generation X moves into its 50s and 60s – the same generation that rebranded parenting, ageing and even grandparenthood (goodbye “Grandma”, hello “Gigi”), it’s unlikely they’ll accept inherited scripts about love without revision.Love is about to be shaken up again.The challenge now is to let our cultural narratives catch up with our social realities. Love doesn’t expire at 40. Romance isn’t invalidated by divorce. Intimacy doesn’t have to mean cohabitation, financial merger or lifelong sacrifice. For a growing proportion of Australians, love in later life is about alignment rather than aspiration, companionship rather than completion.Love doesn’t belong to the young, and the sooner we rebrand it the better off we’ll all be.Lisa Portolan is an academic.

Nobody needs ‘autumn oven gloves’Sat 14 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 10.27 ESTShareIt’s Valentine’s Day, which means you should have spent the last few weeks swapping all of the lamps in your house. If not, you still have a few hours: box up your beige lampshades (or better yet, throw them in the bin) and replace them with ones of red and pink hues. Then – if you want to feel mentally well – you must also change your lightbulbs, because “warm white lighting” is the best way to ensure your crimson decor doesn’t look “too harsh”.This is according to online lighting company Pooky, which is selling 43 “lust-worthy lamps” (and shades) for Valentine’s Day. A press release sent on behalf of the brand in late January proudly declared that Google searches for “seasonal decor” have increased 70% year-on-year globally, while queries about “Valentine’s decor” have soared 2,584% since the start of 2026. “The beauty of seasonal lighting,” said Pooky’s chief creative officer, “is that it’s easy to rotate. Store one or two Valentine lampshades, a set of rose-tinted bulbs and a handful of candles in a labelled box, and you can transform your home every February in minutes.”View image in fullscreenIndoor Halloween decorations in a family home.Photograph: thelittlegreyartist/AlamyThat’s all very well and good, but what if my “lusty lighting” box won’t fit next to the plastic tubs holding my “autumn oven gloves”, “Halloween curtain rods” and “Easter rugs”? Wouldn’t it be faster – better, even – to join the62% of Britonswho simply throw perfectly good homeware in the bin? After all, how else will I find the time on 16 March to swap from my Mother’s Day to St Patrick’s Day decor?Can I just ask: what are we doing?More than a quarterof Britons feel homeware trends are “changing at an increasingly fast pace”, and 70m items of home decorare thrown awayevery year. I’ll concede there are some things worth destroying the planet for (flying! We literally get to fly across the sky!), but surely not this? Surely we can all agree that the climate apocalypse isn’t a fair exchange for a “brown resin Valentines dog ornament” wearing heart-shaped glasses and a little pink bow? (It’s uglier than you think, please do not click.)It’s not that seasonal decor can never make sense. It’s the balm we’ve sought during the cost of living crisis, when many people find it too expensive to go out, and home is where the heart-shaped frying pan is. Socialising is costlier than ever, but novelty ceramics have seemingly never been cheaper. And it’s understandable that we want our living spaces to be cosy and calm when the world outside is anything but.But leaving aside the harm to the planet – and how often we do! – “fast homeware” is full of false promises. In the 41,000 TikTok videostagged“seasonal decor” (plus countless others hashtagged #autumnaesthetic or #springvibes), influencers promise that swapping out your homeware can boost your mood, spark joy and even “heal your soul”. For years, marketers and content creators have savvily used the names of happiness hormones to conflate shopping and personal wellbeing. TK Maxx has a page on its website called Dopamine Home Decor (under the umbrella of Home Seasonal Events).I hate to be the one to tell you this, but a spring-themed bath mat is not going to markedly improve your mental health. In reality, overconsumption has been repeatedly linked to lower wellbeing and evenpsychological distress. Personally, I know that the buzz of buying something is often quickly replaced with an empty sensation and a desire for more – the satisfaction somehow never seems to last.View image in fullscreen‘The year-round demand for novelty is not going anywhere any time soon.’Photograph: Pixel-shot/AlamyPlus, there are faster and cheaper ways to get a dose of dopamine (music, meditation and especially volunteering, for a start). And if you’re an aesthete, never fear! I actually know a fantastic little designer who redecorates seasonally, free of charge. Her name is mother nature, and she also swaps out the bulbs.Of course, I’m fighting a losing battle: online content creators must create content and supermarkets must generate ever-increasing profits, so the year-round demand for novelty is not going anywhere any time soon. If I can’t beat them, maybe I should join them – and charge for my ideas (a jester’s-hat butter dish for April Fools’ Day; an Ash Wednesday kettle). Or maybe I have one last trick up my sleeve to make you reconsider: think of your grandma’s home.She never swapped out the lamps – the things on her coffee table were the things onhercoffee table, collected over the course of a lifetime, consistent while you grew and changed. That stained, stainless steel teapot spoke to you from a different era; it showed you the world existed before you existed, it promised that things could endure after you were gone. Isn’t there meaning and happiness to be found in consistent homeware, in a home that reflects your personality, and in a personality that’s unwavering in the face of marketing trends? Wait, no. I’ve got it: bank-holiday shoe rack.Amelia Tait is a freelance features writer and the author of Lily Tripp: Diary of an Accidental Time TravellerExplore more on these topicsValentine's DayOpinionOnline shoppingRetail industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Theironyis hard to escape: as the prime minister is embroiled in the scandal of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and now hisformer aide’s linksto a sex offender, MPs are defending him on a platform that has in thepast monthallowed users tocreate sexualised imagesof women and girls.This says something about the unprecedented way in which X has been tied to modern politics since it was still known as Twitter, as well as how widespread the culture of indifference is to the violation of female bodies, both online and off. But it also points to a growing dilemma facing not just politicians, but all of us: is it possible to post ethically on social media any more? And when is it time to log off?It seems as though every major social-media platform has been contaminated to some degree. Since Elon Musk bought X, on top of deepfakes ofsexually explicit images, the site’s algorithm has ramped up itsboosting ofrightwingcontent, with Musk himself posting about how the white race was “rapidly dying” and other extreme views on race almostevery day of January. Facebook, longaccusedof mass data collection and involvement inRussia-backedelection interference,dumped fact-checkersweeks before Donald Trump’s second term. Instagram, also owned by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, was found toknowinglybe making teenage girls’ body images worse. And TikTok has been criticised for“exploiting” children, with under-13s exposed to self-harm content alongside dance crazes.The Guardian’srevelationthis week that Substack – the publishing forum some progressives fled to after other sites shifted rightwards – is making money from hosting Nazi newsletters sums up the no-win situation social-media users find themselves in. Substack, which has up to 50 million users worldwide, was found to be platforming writers espousing white supremacy, Holocaust denial and antisemitism, including an activist who described Adolf Hitler as “one of the greatest men of all time”. It’s all very 2026, isn’t it? Or 1936.Still, none of this would be as disturbing if the disgust wasn’t accompanied by a pull to keep posting. There are very real reasonsso many of us have failed to delete the apps, and not just because our dopamine-hungry brains have been trained to reach for our phones every five seconds. Over the past 15 years, for good or ill, social media has become a key way of connecting with others that – if we’re honest – many of us would struggle to fully break. That’s even more the case for marginalised groups, such asdisabled people, who are more likely to rely on online networks for socialising and practical help. Just as it’s simpler to take the moral stand to cancel Prime if you can get to the shops with ease, it’s much easier to “get off socials” if you can walk up the stairs to your friend’s flat, feel safe in an LGBT+ bar or afford a round at the pub.Social media can also be a literal lifeline for oppressed people, from Palestinians using Bluesky to crowdfund for food and medicine, to the lawyer of aprotester in Irannotifying the world of their imprisonment. That is the absurdity of social media now: the same platforms that let some users scroll mindlessly to see what colour Stacey Solomon is painting her kitchen enable others to track andescape Israeli bombing. Often, we are in the surreal state of witnessing both through our screens at once.Australia’s social media ban gives kids an opportunity to experience what millennials long for | Jodi WilsonRead moreThere is a deep irony in the fact the platforms we seek escapism in are increasingly the most glaring demonstrations of the very darkness we wish to avoid. On the rare occasions I check my X account, I am usually greeted within seconds by (in no particular order): racism, pro-Trump posts, anti-benefit/eugenist rhetoric, Islamophobia, AI images and/or naked women. Perhaps as damaging as the content itself is the (quite false) feeling that this small corner of the internet is somehow representative of the country or humanity at large. There are few more successful ways for bad actors to keep resistance low than exhausting good people into thinking the battle is already lost.There will be those in politics and public bodies who genuinely believe platforms such as X and Facebook help them reach the electorate, not least in an era when many older and disenfranchised people get their news – and plenty of fake news – from social media. There is certainly some truth in that. And yet theMandelsonand Downing Street aide scandals, much like the government using X to defend them, are a reminder of how the very worst behaviour quickly becomes normalised when it is, at minimum, being tacitly condoned by those in power. If Starmer wishes to show his government’s disdain for sexual abuse or the far right, logging off X would be a good start. Public opinion of politicians – and the current Labour party – is in the gutter. It seems unlikely that it will improve by them tweeting from it.Personally, I’d just like to post a photo of my dog without coming into contact with a Nazi. I’m not sure that’s the snowflake demandMusk and co want us to think it is.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We had become inseparable. A magazine sent me to the ATP festival at Pontins in Camber Sands to interview “the Beastie Boys of noise”, Wolf Eyes. The interview fell to pieces when the band, in a state of great psychic refreshment, all wearing Manowar T-shirts, refused to stop watching a Manowar DVD and signalled they would only answer questions if they related to Manowar.The rest of the day was exemplary – one of the best ever – walking on the beach, visiting record shops, watching the most incredible music curated by Sonic Youth. When Maria and I got back to our B&B room that evening, I fired up the CD player, which contained a pre-release copy of the new Wolf Eyes album, Burned Mind, containing the single Stabbed in the Face. But now its howling feedback and tinnitus machine noise sounded like a celebratory, ecstatic, love-filled symphony. People might think we’re being juvenile by saying Stabbed in the Face is our song, but it is the soundtrack of an incredibly joyous, optimistic time. We don’t listen to it that often now, though; our 14-year-old son says it upsets the dog.John DoranSharpe and Numan – Change Your MindFor years, I associated this track with big nights out. Its swooning synths and sing-along chorus made it the perfect contender for the lights-on moment on many occasions: epic, yet soft enough to sway around to with frazzled friends. But it took on new meaning when I heard it in the background of an Instagram video featuring someone I had just started seeing. In those early days of shy phone calls and infrequent in-person hangouts, I watched that short, blurry clip over and over again, yearning like a teenager, as the melody etched itself into my brain. The song quickly became something that reminded me of said person rather than just parties and, later, something we would dance to together as well.View image in fullscreen‘I associated this track with big nights out’ … Gary Numan at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1984.Photograph: Pete Still/RedfernsThat’s in spite of the fact that Change Your Mind is more of a breakup song, with a dejectedGary Numanpining over some unrequited lover, urging them to change their mind – sometimes aggressively so. But the woozy and sparkly production, paired with all the memories attached to it, makes all those bitter sentiments feel irrelevant. The fact that the 12in version stretches over a luxurious eight and a half minutes makes it the ideal soundtrack for overindulging the soppiest of feelings, whether it’s missing late nights with friends or fancying someone.Safi BugelAmy Winehouse – Stronger Than MeIf your man caught you listening to Stronger Than Me, he would surely think that you hate him: “Don’t you know you supposed to be the man? / Not pale in comparison to who you think I am.” The song is a modern-day equivalent of the scene in Euripides’ tragedy The Bacchae where frenzied women tear Pentheus limb from limb, an act called thesparagmos. It not only concerns a partner who disappoints during sex, but his physical and emotional weakness as compared to Winehouse. It is emasculating, mocking and of its time: “Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy.”Yet I have always found its frankness more romantic than spurning. I don’t get the sense that Winehouse isn’t in love with the man in question, only that she is willing to show him what his weaknesses are and appeal to his bodily instincts. She knows that endless talk can kill romance and affection, especially when you’re being fed bullshit, and that sometimes wordlessly stepping up to take on a caring or leadership role can help meet your partner’s needs. It is all somewhat illogical, reductive about gender roles and dismissive, but, at times, I’ve listened to this song to channel my bluntest assessments of how to get back on track. Sometimes, that is just to be held and “gripped” without words, rather than be fed with the same old “tired script”.Jason OkundayeEinstürzende Neubauten – Youme & MeyouCompared with the flying sparks and screaming of Einstürzende Neubauten’s early work, Youme & Meyou – with Blixa Bargeld crooning over melodic pulses made by rhythms tapped out on plastic pipes – is far from abrasive, yet it still had the power to teach me something about love. I first fell for Neubauten in part because they wrote romantic songs to places, rather than just people, but in this I missed some of their depth.I heard the lines “out there’s always a construction site / A Starbucks and yet another Guggenheim” and took this as being a song about the blandness of the globalisation of the urban environment in the early 21st century. It was only when my partner told me it made her think of us that I spotted what the title actually is, a dialogue between a me and a you in a relationship,and I realised thatI had been an idiot. In odd ways, it started to cement us together. You might not have Bargeld pegged as an agony uncle, but this is a song filled with wonderful lines about feeding love to make it endure, mutual understanding and realism – as he sings it, “if the future isn’t bright at least it’s colourful”.Luke TurnerLeona Lewis – My HandsWhen you’ve been single for 34 years, most traditional love songs have lost their lustre. Songs about heartbreak are now where I find hope for the romantic love that my life has lacked. When I first heard Leona Lewis’s desperately sad My Hands in 2010, I was just so moved by it. The song is about trying to rebuild your life after a breakup, but your body physically rejects every step forward. When Lewis’s voice almost breaks as she sings “ready for a new day without you”, it evokes the acute desperation of a person pushed to the brink of disintegration.View image in fullscreen‘I hope to one day know what that devastation feels like’ … Leona Lewis at the Hackney Empire in 2009.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe despair that washes over this song can only come from a place of a fully realised, intimate and deep romance. It made me stop and imagine how it would feel to love – and be loved – so deeply that you “don’t wanna start again” because your body aches just to feel the touch of your ex’s hand. I hope to one day know what that devastation feels like because it can only mean that I have truly been in love. If it’s weird to find that romantic, well then, my heart just won’t let me be normal.Jeffrey IngoldStephen Malkmus and the Jicks – Middle AmericaI couldn’t really tell you what Middle America is about. Malkmus’s lyrics to this gentle guitar ditty are typically opaque; all he’s said is that it’snot a commentary on the flyover states. To me, it sounds like love – more specifically, the sort of love I’d like to find.Having spent the past decade meaningfully single, I find it hard to relate to explicitly romantic songs: they’re too generic to be moving, too singular to be relatable, or too histrionic to be aspirational. Elliptical as it is, Middle America always evokes how I would like to feel in a relationship. There is something about Malkmus’s delivery that suggests he’s picking up a conversation that had no obvious start and never really ends – it just roams, as talk does with a partner.Malkmus’s narrator wonders aloud about time passing and “how to simplify”, the kind of problems you’d bring to a romantic relationship. In my reverie he engages with mine, offering gentle encouragement (“do your major duty”) or calling me on my bullshit: “When you get down to it, you wanted to.” He asks, “do you think you’ve got the nerve?” and sympathises without being a performative ally: “Men are scum, I won’t deny.” And he’s steadfast in his commitment and care without promising for ever or reaching for once-in-a-lifetime love: “I will not disappear.”Often, when I press play on Middle America, my shoulders drop and I take a proper breath for the first time in hours, day-to-day stresses suddenly surmountable. Between the lines of Middle America, I can glimpse some “unnamed star” and dare to hope it’s not so far away.Elle HuntPublic Image Ltd – This Is Not a Love Song (album version)Of course it’s not romantic. Just read the title!John Lydonwasn’t lying when he told us – repeatedly, over towering, brass-powered chords – that this was not a love song. Instead, it was a sneering, sarcastic attack on 80s capitalism, music industry greed and all of those who had accused the former Sex Pistol of selling out.It was also – two decades after its 1983 release – one of the staples of my DJ bag, a dead-cert whenever I played it at indie club nights across the country in the early 2000s. PiL’s biggest hit was cool enough to gain approval from the hipsters, yet also guaranteed to fill the dancefloor. I was delighted when the girl in the blue dress came up to the DJ booth during my set at Pigs in Leeds and requested it. She had caught my eye the previous week; now it turned out she had great taste, too. Of course I’d play it for her. I turned back to the decks and realised – to my horror – that I’d taken it out of my bag to listen to that same morning … and forgotten to put it back. Nightmare!Luckily, I had a chance to make amends. At the end of the night, promoter Ash handed me a bottle of champagne (OK, probably cheap sparkling wine) and told me to award it to the best dancer. Well, shewasa great dancer, but really I just wanted an excuse to talk to her.I stumbled across the dancefloor, desperately looking for her, but to no avail. Realising I maybe looked slightly obsessive, I admitted defeat and gave it to someone else. She must have gone home, I thought. Then she reappeared in the queue for the cloakroom. Her eyes matched her dress and she had a cute Manchester accent. I was smitten. Despite not having the record she wanted, and despite having just given some other girl a free bottle of fizz, she seemed happy to see me. Twenty-two years and two kids later, we both still love that record and the way it became part of our lore. It might not be a love song, but it was definitely the start of a love story.Tim JonzeOrchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark – Enola GayI met my first ever girlfriend when we both worked at Asda. I was part-time on Saturdays and sometimes after school, and she was full-time and already far more worldly. She introduced me to all sorts, including Iggy Pop albums, but because I was too young for pubs, most of our dates consisted of aimless walks arm in arm around Leeds suburbs.View image in fullscreen‘It spoke to my fears that ours would be a fleeting romance’ … Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImageOne place that did let us in was Primo’s, a Saturday electronic night in Leeds city centre. One night, we somehow ended up snogging while draped across the long velvety seats that ran alongside the dancefloor, until a chuckling bouncer gently lifted me up. Our prematurely halted encounter played out to the sound of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s Enola Gay, a synth-pop classic. Despite seemingly loved-up lines such as “this kiss you give, it’s never ever going to fade away”, it’s about the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, killing up tens of thousands of people. I’m not sure I knew that then, but the song’s haunting, melancholy synth riff also spoke to my fears that ours would be a fleeting romance. She dumped me a few months later, but if I ever hear Enola Gay playing anywhere, it instantly takes me back.Dave Simpson‘Utterly devastating’: Guardian writers on their favourite breakup songsRead moreHe Is Legend – The SeductionI’m sure there are many people out there who find certain heavy rock songs romantic, but I personally am more of the harps and harmonies persuasion. It’s not that I don’t like heavy music as a rule, I just don’t find it very conducive to candlelit dinners and the laying of capes over puddles, you know? Call me crazy but I don’t want to cuddle while guitars chug and a man roars incoherently at me, despite what my last relationship might suggest.While at university, I had the sweetest, loveliest boyfriend you could possibly imagine, a kind and generous man who had a powerful affection for the kind of technical metal I would rather put my head in a meat grinder than listen to. One day, he played me this song – which is not that heavy, and not that technical, and unlikely to be classified as truly metal by the heads. But with its banging hooks, relentless punk beat and drawling insouciance, it provided this shared musical ground to dance on together. Sure, it’s a skewed retelling of Romeo and Juliet but, aside from that, it’s essentially a man yelling at me while guitars chug. But whenever my boyfriend would put it on, I knew he was saying: “Hey, here’s that song we both like and I’ve put it on so we can enjoy it together.” And what could be more romantic than that?Kate SolomonExplore more on these topicsMusicValentine's DayPop and rockExperimental musicElectronic musicJohn LydonGary NumanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s as frank as everCharlotte HigginsSat 14 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThere is a long buildup before I get to seeTracey Emin– her two cats, Teacup and Pancake, preceding her like a pair of slinky sentries as she walks into the white-painted basement kitchen of her huge Georgian house in Margate. The lengthy overture is because – though I’ve been invited for noon – Emin is a magnificently late riser. Her average working day, her studio manager Harry tells me, runs from about 6pm to 3am. And so, while the artist is gradually sorting herself out, Harry takes me on a tour through her home town in the January drizzle, the sea a sulky grey blur beyond the sands.At last, Harry is ringing the doorbell, and Emin’s lovely housekeeper, Sam, is sitting me down in the kitchen, then finally here she is, dressed in loose dark trousers and top, with those faithful cats. Emin is recognisably the same as she’s ever been – the artist who scandalised and entranced the nation in the 1990s with her tent embroidered with the names of everyone she’d ever slept with; with her unmade bed and its rumpled sheets and detritus. She still has that sardonic lip, those arched brows, those flashing eyes. But these days she is surprisingly calm, slow moving, her greying hair swept back into a loose bun. This is the Emin who has worked hard, survived a great deal and, somewhat unpredictably, ended up a national treasure.She pours out cups of green tea – once, it would have been vodka and a fag, but there’s been no alcohol for nearly six years now, and she quit her 50-a-day habit a long while back. In the past few years, death almost claimed her and she clawed herself back to life again: in 2020, she was diagnosed with a vicioussquamous cell cancer, requiring dramatic surgery. “I had to have my bladder removed. I had a full hysterectomy. I had my lymph nodes removed, I had half my vagina removed, I had my urethra removed, part of my bowel removed,” she says, ticking off the losses. She is contained, quiet-spoken, and there are none of the flashes of anger she was once famous for, though she’s exacting as we talk, correcting me if she thinks I’m on the wrong track. Seven hours and more, the operation took. She also had a urostomy – surgery to create a stoma (hole in the abdomen) so urine can pass out into a collection bag. She often has hers beside her in a tote bag.View image in fullscreenEmin working in her studio in Margate, 2024.Photograph: Harry WellerLife without a bladder is “pretty heavy”, she tells me. Today, for example, when she got in the shower, she had a lot of bleeding from her stoma. Then there’s the whole business of the bag, which needs emptying into a loo maybe “every 15 to 20 minutes, or it might be OK for an hour. For a lot of people with urostomies, they don’t go to theatre, they don’t go to cinema,” she says. If you can’t get to a loo in time, it can overfill and burst, which isn’t great, especially if it happens in a public place. If she wants to do something as simple as take a nap at home, she says, even that’s tricky. “It wakes you up because of the pressure” and, worst case, “The bag will just fly off, and then all the urine will go everywhere. It’s 500ml of urine in a small bag, which doesn’t sound like much.” (It sounds like plenty, to me.)She has bowel problems on top of everything else. “You’ve got the blood, you’ve got the shit, you’ve got the pills – it really can get you down, because you can’t be free. Nothing can be improvised. Nothing can be spontaneous. When I go away, half my suitcase is full of medical supplies.” She’s not moaning, she keeps telling me: she knows she’s lucky. But it’s hard work. She got really upset, she says, about what to wear for her investiture as adamelast year. She had her bag strapped to her leg, which was OK, but uncomfortable. “I didn’t want to do my photos with the king holding a bag of urine,” she says.I reckon I was going to die, then they (she glances heavenwards) said, ‘I don’t think she’s all bad. Let’s give her a second go’Then there are the infections – urinary tract one day “that can go to a full-blown kidney infection the next. And then, if I’m really unlucky, a blood infection.” She had sepsis in September, she says: “And it took me about three months to get well again.” She’s on antibiotics much of the time for one thing and another. She worries about getting a cold or flu – there are no friendly hugs and kisses any more. “And I get so fatigued.” She is clearly extremely vulnerable, physically. But she gleefully shows me her lifeline: “It’s pretty strong, and goes right round into infinity,” she says, tracing it as it disappears round her wrist. “I reckon that I was going to die and then they, whoever they are” – she glances heavenwards – “they said, ‘I don’t think she’s all bad. Let’s give her another go, see what she can do.’”This is, then, her second life – andSecond Lifeis also the title of her forthcoming show at Tate Modern, her largest to date. Her brush with death changed everything – it was the spur to relocate permanently to Margate, to set up afoundation, to put in place things that could give back to her home town and carry on after her eventual death. There are still houses in London and Provence – but Margate is home now. Aside from her roomy painting studio, on his tour Harry shows me the high-rise where Emin has bought flats for artists to live in at low rent; theart schoolshe has created, where a second intake of students, nine of them, are working away; the artists’ studios she’s renting out at low cost; the building she’s going to convert into another 10; the former morgue that’s atraining kitchenfor long-term unemployed people; then there’s the derelict building along the coast that’s going to become a cafe and communitybathing club. Hers is a philanthropic property empire. Harry also shows me the hideaway Emin used to go to at weekends, before she moved into the big house in December. With a flourish, he opens a door from the bedroom and a sizeable toplit indoor swimming pool is revealed, like Narnia from the back of a wardrobe. Later, Emin worries about me mentioning it,because she thinks Guardian readers won’t approve – though speaking for myself, I was more dazzled than disapproving.View image in fullscreenMy Bed, 1998.Photograph: Tracey Emin. Photograph courtesy The Saatchi Gallery / Prudence Cuming Associates LtdThe Tate Modern exhibition is going to be huge, ranging right across her 40-year career. But she’s not calling it a retrospective – not least because the first work in the exhibition is the spikily titled My Major Retrospective 1963-93, made when she was 30 for her first solo show, at White Cube gallery. It consisted of photographs of the paintings she had made at art school and then destroyed – one of the turbulent chapters of her relationship with the medium. Among the more recent works will be a series of photographs she has taken of her own post-operative body – the blood, the stoma, the reality of life in a battleworn female body – shown opposite photos of her body she took as a young woman. There will be her installation My Bed – her soiled sheets, the environs littered with bottles, fags, condoms, all the self-revealing fragments of a chaotic life – which caused an uproar when it was shown as part of her Turner prize exhibition in 1999.Emin was a paradox – wildly successful, hugely famous, but also damned for her supposed self-absorption and narcissism. Looking back, some of this criticism looks plain sexist. A woman, especially a working-class woman, making art about her emotions and body was not seen as respectable, back then. Now, I think, the world has caught up with her. She tells me about what people made of one of her early films,Why I Never Became A Dancer(1995), which will be in the Tate exhibition. “At the time, people were saying, ‘Oh, it’s just Tracey prancing around.’ No! Listen to what I was saying,” she says vehemently, as if she’s slipped back 30 years and is confronting her critics. “See what the film’s about. Understand it.” The film tells a story of her adolescence – how she left school at 13, how she had a lot of sex with a lot of men in their 20s. And then, in 1978, at 15, she entered a disco championship. She was on the dancefloor, owning it, she was going to win – “And then they started: ‘SLAG, SLAG, SLAG.’” Most of the people taunting her were men she’d slept with. She ran out of the room in tears. But the film ends with her dancing – seizing joy from the men who tried to bring her down.When I see a 13-year-old girl now, I think, ‘Oh, my God, imagine someone having sex with that person. What the fuck is wrong with them?’“We’re talking about grooming, we’re talking about bullying,” she says now. “And, of course, you know, the ‘Slag, slag, slag’ didn’t just happen on the dancefloor. It happened in the high street. I was raped when I was 13. Then after that, about six months later, I started having sex with all these people – because I wanted to be in control. But, of course, I wasn’t. It was terrible. When I see a 13- or 14-year-old girl now, I think, ‘Oh my God, imagine someone who’s 20 or 25 having sex with that person. What the fuck is wrong with them?’” Her refusal of shame reminds me ofGisèle Pelicot’s stance: “Shame must change sides.” I ask Emin how she manages not to care what people think of her. “What makes you think I don’t? I do care, immensely,” she says.There are two rooms in the Tate Modern show devoted to works on abortion – Emin had two in the 1990s, the first almost killing her, after it turned out she had been pregnant with twins and one foetus was left inside her. It wouldn’t be easy to show such works in the US now, I suggest. Even though, for example, her filmHow It Feels(1996) doesn’t take a campaigning position, but simply does what the title implies. Emin tells me she has pulled a version of the Tate Modern show from the Guggenheim in New York, after the exhibition space available was, she says, reduced. “It was made impossible for me to do it because the space was getting smaller and smaller, and then it meant that my Tate show wouldn’t actually fit.” It would be a question of making the show smaller – but then, she says, “What work would they take out? The abortion work?” Was that what was discussed? “I don’t know,” she admits. “I just know I’m not doing a show there any more.” (The Guggenheim was approached for comment.) “If I have a show in New York,” she says, “it’s got to be exactly as I want it to be.”There’s an account in her book,Strangeland, published in 2005, of her rape when she was 13 – she was pushed into an alley by a man while walking home after a New Year’s Eve party. When she got home, her mum dusted her off and no more was said. It was kind of ordinary: the girls she knew used the phrases “broken in” or “broken into” when they’d been forced to have sex for the first time. When I express horror at how commonplace sexual violence seems to have been, how surely things have changed for the better, Emin laughs at my naivety. “It’s happening all the time. It’s happening around the corner … Right now, somewhere, not very far away, someone is either being beaten, locked in a cupboard, being raped, being abused, being coerced into something they don’t want to do.”Art is probably one of the last good things we’ve got left as human beingsAnd then, of course, there are the myriad ways in which being a young girl in the age of social media is even worse than it was in the 1970s. Her take on misogynist horrors such as Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok, which had been used todigitally “undress”and otherwise humiliate real women and girls, is, she says, “luddite”. “I keep telling young people: keep a diary, get a camera, learn to print your own photos. Don’t put it all in your phone, because everything in your phone belongs to someone else. And if you want to write a secret to someone, send a letter. There’s nothing wrong in slowing down and stepping everything back.” Taking your time, that’s what’s important, she says. It’s like looking at a painting. You have to do it slowly. “Art is to me, now, probably one of the last good things we’ve got left as human beings. And it was the same in the caves in Palaeolithic times.View image in fullscreen‘Making a beautiful painting isn’t about making power. It’s empowering yourself to feel something.’ Emin in her studio at the Royal College of Art, 1989.Photograph: David Dawson“There’s something about making something from ourselves which is beautiful and otherworldly as well. And we need all of those things right now to remind us that we can be good-spirited, that we don’t have to make corruption, we don’t have to make greed, we don’t have to make power,” she says. “Making a beautiful painting isn’t about making power. It’s empowering yourself to feel something, and then if you’ve done it correctly, other people look at it and feel something, too.”Emin had a turbulent childhood. Her Turkish-Cypriot father, Enver, had another family and was only around a few days a week. Then his hotel business collapsed and he abandoned Emin, her mum and twin brother Paul, plunging them into poverty. I wonder how, despite all that, she has such a positive relationship with Margate now. It was actually her mum’s death, in 2016, that was the first turning point, she says: it was then she decided she wanted to continue to have a connection with the place. And now, “even though my mum’s not here, I sort of feel she’d be really so happy to see what I’ve done. She was worried I’d gone up my own arse and become a bit of a twat, which I had at some points. I’m just trying to recalibrate what’s important in life.Artis the most important thing to me – and I know other things are more important to other people, but it’s art for me. So now I just live art, work art, do art, facilitate other people to do art … There’s a sense of peace. I’ve gone full circle in my life. I’ve come home. That is one of the nicest feelings in the world.”Margate has some of the highest rates of child poverty in the country. Emin tells me proudly about how art and culture are making a difference to the struggling local economy. There’s the huge success of the major gallery in the town,Turner Contemporary, and she’s involved in a pop-up arts festival that took place a few weekends ago, calledOff Season, which gets shops and restaurants buzzing in the dead of winter. But Kent county council is now run by Reform. In August, union flags went up overnight in the town, as they did around a lot of the country, part of a campaign linked to the far right. “I wanted to hire a cherrypicker and cut them down,” Emin says. “And then we realised that probably, if I tried to get a cherrypicker, it could be the same cherrypicker they hired to put them up.View image in fullscreenTracey Emin, Self-portrait 12-11-01 2001.Composite: © Tracey Emin.

Courtesy the Tracey Emin Archive“I like to reclaim things,” she adds. “Like duringCool Britannia[in the late 1990s], the flag was used as a positive thing for everyone.” When Emin had a bigshowin 2011 at the Hayward Gallery in London, there was a billboard poster for it showing her running down the street naked, trailing a union flag. “I got a phone call from what would have been Ukip at the time and they said, ‘We’ve noticed your poster holding the union flag – you’re a woman from our hearts, and we’d really like to meet up with you.’ And I said, ‘Yeah, obviously you didn’t notice how brown my arse is, did you?’ And I just put the phone down.” She adds, “My dad came here in 1948 from Cyprus, and he’s really dark skinned. My great-grandfather was from Nubia [modern Sudan]. My mother’s family were Gypsies. So as far as I’m concerned, I’m the most amazing British person you can have.”Ukip wanted to meet me and I said, ‘Yeah, obviously you didn’t notice how brown my arse is, did you?’She’s voted Labour all her life, she says – apart from twice forDavid Cameron’s Tories, in 2010 and 2015. (“Well it wasn’t that I was voting Tory,” she clarifies, “it was that I was voting for certain ministers that were supporting the arts” – though culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and arts minister Ed Vaizey failed to prevent huge cuts to the arts imposed by then chancellor George Osborne as part of his “austerity” measures.)The current political tone on immigration appals her – and she loathes Reform with a passion. “If the far right get in in this country, we are doomed. And everybody has to understand the significance of it. When friends say they’re not voting Labour because of what’s happened in the last two years, I say, ‘Then vote Tory, vote anything, vote Green, but don’t let Reform get in.’” She adds, “The immigration from asylum seekers in this country is minuscule, minor. Britain could take care of people wanting to come here, people could be processed and people could be working … Instead, we’ve got a country now that’s bordering on neo-Nazi rhetoric, which I find really abhorrent.”We speculate for a moment on what a potential Reform government might bring the arts. “Art institutions may not survive, but art will always survive. If you had Farage pushing down all the arts, saying things were degenerate, getting rid of it all, like Trump is doing now, you will have this bubble, bubble” – her voice rises like something out of Macbeth – “bubble of all the arts, that you will never be able to stop, ever. And they will rise up like the biggest fucking volcano these people have ever seen.”For Emin, the solution to poverty and lack of opportunity is always education – despite her own schooldays not being a success. She didn’t get on with academic work, and stopped going to school at 13. “My mum wasn’t around. She left home for quite a while. My nan would come sometimes. People would drift in and out.” She defends her mum fiercely. “It wasn’t my mum’s fault. Out of choice, she wouldn’t have left us – end of story.” At one point, Emin was caught stealing from Woolworths: “Really badly caught shoplifting. I got caught for nicking a pair of navy blue socks.” They were school socks, of course. “What the school should have done at that point was said, ‘Why is she stealing school uniform? What is going on?’ But people didn’t notice things like that, back then.”View image in fullscreenEmin teaching at her Margate studio.Photograph: Harry WellerWhen she was 15, she was effectively forced back to school by social services a couple of days a week, where she mostly sat in the art room, drawing. There, for the first time, she was encouraged, mentored – and she flourished. By sheer force of will, she got herself into art school despite not having O-levels or A-levels, battling people’s low expectations of her all the way. “It took me a long time to get to the Royal College of Art, but I did it. And now, you can’t go to art school unless you’re loaded.”I wonder if she has any regrets. As one childless woman to another, for example, does she regret not having kids? “I’m really, really, really happy about not having children,” she says. “You know how people are really happybecausethey have children? I’m really happy because Idon’t. And I’ve got lots of young people around me as well, which is really good, people who are creative. And I have really made my life as full as possible, behaving and doing things that someone with children couldn’t do.”Whatareher regrets then? “Number one: smoking. Number two” – she suddenly starts giggling – “taking it up the wrong hole.” Tracey, do you mean anal sex? We’re both cracking up now. “I mean that metaphorically as well … although I don’t even regret it because some of it was quite good.” She pulls herself together. “What I mean is a sensibility about understanding what I wanted and what my needs were. I should have taken much better care of myself, but I let myself get blown around, and that was silly.” Most of all, though, she says she regrets what she calls “the B-list years” – the mid-2000s for a goodish half-decade or so “when you look back and think, ‘God, was that the shallowest level of myself that I could ever be?’” Too much partying; not enough time devoted to the thing at the centre of her life: art.That was after she split up with her then partner, artist Mat Collishaw. Is she seeing anyone now, I wonder? “No, not really, no,” she says, slightly evasively. In her life she has dated men and women. “No, I’m not. I was having a relationship with someone for a while, but not a conventional relationship, and I had an affair for a long time with someone who I really was deeply in love with, and I still love. I’m still loving, I still love, and to love, really, is … is human. And I think to live without love is probably one of the saddest things for the self, for the heart, so I don’t want to live without love ever again. I’m quite happy now with unrequited love, as long as I can love – and I have my cats.”She’s absolutely certain, though, of one thing. “I don’t ever again in my life want someone saying, ‘What time you coming home? Where are we going on holiday? What we eating tonight? Did you eat the chocolate? No, it’s your turn.’ Never, ever – mind you, I never really had it, because it wasn’t like that with me … ” A certain self-containment, an ability to live her life as she wishes to live it, is what’s important now. “I like my sovereignty,” she says.Everything, now, is about the art. If the cancer, the touch of death, did one thing, it was to clarify utterly who she is and what she exists for. Painting is at the centre of her creative world these days. There are many canvases on the go in her studio, some she’s working on actively, some that might sit there for a few years until she turns to them again. She often paints over things she’s done – which are frequently, but not always, female figures a bit like herself, or couples or, at times, her mother – allowing one set of painted gestures to suggest the next, sometimes completely transforming the image along the way. Harry tells me that when they are in the studio together, “she talks about what she sees in the canvas, and then starts painting it in”.I ask her if she can describe what that feels like. “There’s the canvas, there’s me, and there’s this other space between us, and you have to go through it, that space, and you drag in everything behind you with you into it. It’s like going through a weird tunnel. And the painting is whatever you’ve dragged through the tunnel with you,” she says. “There are many ways to be a painter – art has many rooms. But for me it’s like an explosion of sorts. It’s like my heart being ripped open and then throwing it all on to the canvas.”She’s lit up when she says this. This is what she’s on this Earth for. It suddenly dawns on me: she’s happy – or at least happier than she has ever been. “Yes,” she says. “Even when I’m unhappy, I’m not as unhappy as I used to be. I do what I want to do. If I feel like painting, I’ll go and paint. If I don’t feel like painting, I’ll go and teach. If I don’t feel like teaching, I’ll go and take a walk on the beach. If I don’t want to walk on the beach, I cuddle my cats.” After the cancer, she says, “The big thing that I discovered was that I don’t want to die right now. You might think that’s obvious, but it’s not. I have spent a lot of my life being sad, being nihilistic and punishing myself mentally – and drinking and smoking. And then I realised: I could have my time back again.”Tracey Emin: A Second Life is at Tate Modern, 27 February-31 August. The Guardian is partnering with Tate to offer readers 2-for-1 tickets.

He wanted it to look like a “hybrid” of the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg bridges. Soon after, Macken, who grew up in Middle Village, Queens, moved his family to a small town upstate, more than 160 miles from the city. Macken loaded his bridge on the moving truck. It did not make the trip.“It got destroyed, and I was kind of bummed,” said Macken, who is now 63. “So I figured, let me build something better.”Twenty-three years later, that “something better” survived another truck drive – this time to the Museum of the City ofNew York, which now houses the project that spiraled into Macken’s life’s work.After the accidental bridge demolition, Macken focused on another New York landmark. He carved a mini replica of 30 Rock, the art deco skyscraper and centerpiece of Rockefeller Center. That went well, so he started adding on, using wood to render the surrounding Midtown neighborhood. His mini Midtown became mini Manhattan. Then, he decided to model all of New York’s five boroughs, block by block.View image in fullscreenJoe Macken’s miniature model of lower Manhattan.Photograph: David Lurvey/Museum of the City of New YorkThe result is a 50-by-27ft piece made of wood and cardboard, held together by glue and the sheer determination Macken needed to get it done. “This is all about consistency,” Macken said. “I just started cutting one little house at a time.” It took him 10 years to cover Manhattan, and then another decade to get through the rest of New York.In the late 60s and early 70s, Macken watched the twin towers rise from his childhood bedroom window. He remembers seeing cranes hoist girders into the sky. “It was my favorite building,” Macken said. So he put it in the model, which has replicas of both One World Trade Center, which opened in 2014, and the original towers. “No matter what, the [former] World Trade Center was going to be in there,” he said. “That was just a personal thing I wanted to do.”Before it arrived at the museum, Macken kept the model in a storage unit near his home. Macken, a former truck driver, stacks the boards into piles when transporting the piece. He tries to avoid another model bridge massacre by “driving slow”. “You have a couple casualties here and there, but nothing that can’t be fixed,” he said.The museum exhibits the model in a large, ground-floor gallery, arranged from due north to south. Manhattan, the borough used to getting all the attention, is dwarfed by the outer boroughs, reminding viewers that much of the city’s magic occurs far away from tourist hubs. “I’ve been thinking a lot about how knowable and unknowable New York City is to all of us, whether we’re from here or just have a mental picture of this place,” said Elisabeth Sherman, MCNY’s deputy director and chief curator. “It is both immediately resonant, and yet so hard to grasp. Joe did that in his own way, and now we all get to participate and appreciate it for ourselves.”View image in fullscreenA tiny boat floats near a miniature version of the Coney Island beachfront.Photograph: David Lurvey/Museum of the City of New YorkThere are binoculars placed on the outside edges of the model, so viewers can take a closer look at specific sections. People who live near landmarks can easily find their blocks – one museum employee pointed out their home on the edge of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park. This reporter had a tougher time trying to find her street, located in a gridlocked Brooklyn neighborhood.Sherman said that when museum staff first saw the model, “we were all standing around squealing, ‘Look, there’s our museum!’ ‘There’s the Met, there’s the Guggenheim.’ It’s this great act of recognition, and then it’s also witnessing [Macken’s] creativity, how he made this complex architecture out of very humble materials.”Sherman first heard of Macken the way many others did: last summer, the project went viral on TikTok, when 8 million people – coincidentally, that’s about the population of New York – turned into his delightfully lo-fi first video. In the clip, Macken stares directly at the camera, holding up downtown Manhattan, making sure to point out his beloved twin towers. It was not his deal – Macken said his daughter egged him on. “I’m totally clueless when it comes to that stuff,” he said. “It took me longer to download the app than it did to build this whole thing.”Explore more on these topicsArtNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a years-long party that eventually came crashing downAs told toOlivia LadanyiSat 14 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAt 13, what felt like almost overnight, I turned from a happy, musical-theatre-loving child into a sad, lonely teenager. Things I had cared about only yesterday were suddenly irrelevant, as I realised that nothing and no one mattered, least of all me. It’s an angst that adults often find difficult to remember or understand; as the famous line from The Virgin Suicides goes: “Obviously, Doctor, you’ve never been a 13-year-old girl.”Going to an all-girls Catholic school, I didn’t even really know that sex, drugs and alcohol existed, or that they had currency, until I watched Thirteen for the first time at 14, after seeing a still on Pinterest. The reckless rebellion the two best friends portrayed was seductive to me, and within weeks of watching the film, I’d met some girls from the co-ed school opposite who were having sex, going to parties and taking drugs. Soon, I was doing it all too.In the provocative 2003 teen drama, which launched the career of Evan Rachel Wood, 13-year-old Tracy gets her tongue pierced, then her belly button. So I got my tongue pierced, then my belly button. I swapped baggy Hunger Games T-shirts for crop tops, low-waisted jeans and push-up bras. I bleached my hair blond and I snuck out on school nights after my parents went to bed. They had no idea what I was up to. I went to parties in mansions, where we’d get really drunk and tattoo each other. I had sex for the first time. I took acid.Before this, I had felt severely uncool, as if I was standing in front of soundproof glass watching everyone laughing at a joke I hadn’t heard. Suddenly life was in colour again, and not just colour, but fluorescence. Now cool girls wanted to be my friend, and people at school were talking about me; I was interesting, I was somebody. At parties with these cool girls and hot boys, I felt important. Thirteen had taught me that if you did those things then you were cool, and if you were cool, you mattered.View image in fullscreen‘Their reckless rebellion was seductive’ … Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed in Thirteen.Photograph: Working Title/AllstarYou hear about people who party when they’re young and get tired of it before becoming adults, but that wasn’t what happened to me. I continued the hunt into my late teens, seeking adrenaline, validation, acknowledgment that I was special. Even though I knew it wasn’t healthy, it took me years to understand I didn’t always have to get so blackout drunk that I had to be carried home. I thought that was the whole point, and I was still trying to fill the void that had appeared when I was 13 by being the last one at the party.That ended in 2024with a psychotic episode.I was 20, living in university accommodation but not a student, working a nine-to-five job and getting wasted on a Tuesday for no reason. The only thing I had to look forward to was a holiday that I’d been saving for. But when we got there, I pushed things way too far. After days of not sleeping and taking whatever was offered to me, I entered a psychosis that lasted for two-and-a-half days. When I came back to myself and saw the fear in my friends’ eyes, I was forced to confront how I’d been acting since I was a teen, and the damage I’d normalised.My cultural awakening: A Queen song helped me break free from communist CubaRead moreThirteen offered me a script for how to survive the wilderness of adolescence through excess, and for a lonely teenage girl, that felt like a remedy rather than thewarningthe film intended it to be. I would have done those things eventually, but the immediacy wasn’t a coincidence. It was like being given an answer I’d been desperately seeking, then turning the corner and finding it waiting for me. But I’ve realised that what I was really running from was myself, and the emptiness I felt within. I thought I could hide inside fun nights and quick highs, but eventually, I had to face myself.I still want to matter, to feel interesting and alive, but now I find that in friendship, my work and creativity. Thirteen, which ends hauntingly with Tracy alone spinning on a roundabout, didn’t just teach me how to escape myself – it showed me the cost of doing so.AnonymousShare your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Plus the classics reimagined for a modern readerElla RisbridgerSat 14 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 14 Feb 2026 08.18 ESTShareOpposites attract. He falls first. Coffee shop. Forced proximity. Sports romance. University sports romance. Ivy League university sports romance! Best friend’s brother. Brother’s best friend. Slow burn. Age gap. Amnesia. Wounded hero. Single father. Single mother. Language barrier. The bodyguard. Fake dating. Marriage of convenience.If this list means nothing to you, you’re not a romance reader. Tropes, as these bullet-point ideas have come to be known, have taken over romance. Those who write, market and read romantic fiction use them to pinpoint exactly what to expect before the first page is turned. On Instagram, Amazon and bookshop posters you’ll find covers annotated with arrows and faux-handwritten labels reading “slow-burn” or “home-town boy/new girl in town”. Turn over any romance title and they’ll be there listed in the blurb.“They are the easiest way to signpost what a book is,” says Lucy Stewart, commissioning editor for romance at Hodder. “As soon as I say ‘enemies-to-lovers’ in an acquisition meeting, I’ve already communicated so much to a room full of people in just three words: I’ve told them it’s a romcom, what the hook is and where it sits in the market.”Tropes have always existed in romance, but only in recent years have specific categories developed as a way to categorise, market and even consume romantic fiction, and of course these have accumulated and evolved. A “hot billionaire”, for example, is always popular, though in recent years his style has shifted from Prince Charming to a bit of a beast, kind and generous giving way to reluctant and dangerous. “There’s only one bed” has given rise to “Oh no, now there are two beds”; or if you prefer historical romance, “There’s only one horse”.Publishers market their authors in this way, and often romance writers will write with particular tropes in mind, but it can be hard to know exactly where to draw the line. “Is love itself a trope? Is motherhood? Is marriage the same as ‘only one bed’?” posted the author Rainbow Rowellon Instagram, in the run-up to her new novel, Cherry Baby.Or take the new TV show Heated Rivalry, adapted from the novel by Rachel Reid about ice-hockey players on opposing teams who fall in love. It’s fairly obvious that the “enemies-to-lovers” trope is at play here – and “sports romance”, too. But there has been much discussion about the book’s representation of “MLM” (men loving men). Is that really a trope, or simply queerness represented?You can reduce anything down to tropes – grumpy v sunshine, pride v prejudice – but should we? What does it mean for the way we read – and for the ways we think about art? For tropes are, of course, not unique to romantic fiction. Mystery novels have them; as does science fiction. “The butler did it” is a classic trope.View image in fullscreen‘There’s only one bed’ …Illustration: Inès Pagniez/The GuardianChristopher Booker’s The Seven Basic Plots, now 22 years old, popularised the idea that there are no new stories; and his book drew on a theory of archetypes that Carl Jung developed a century ago. The psychoanalyst believed that some stories were so fundamental to the human experience they were essentially ingrained into the psyche from birth. Tropes exist in all fiction; indeed in all storytelling.“Anything you read is made of tropes. Shakespeare loved tropes. So did Dickens, Austen – anyone you can think of. It’s all tropes, all the time,” says romance writer Laura Wood. Before Romeo and Juliet’s “star-cross’d lovers” there was Pyramus and Thisbe. Fairytales offered a long line of hot, mean, rich men long before Mr Darcy became shorthand for an arrogant millionaire with a secret heart of gold.Not everyone is a fan of the way these archetypes have been appropriated for marketing purposes, however. “I completely despair at the way books are reduced to their tropes,” writer and reader of romance Eleanor Vendrell tells me, “as if a menu of characteristics is in any way representative of a story.” But aren’t they simply a way for readers to navigate a busy library or crowded online store? More books are being published than ever before, and they have never been easier to access. We are drowning in content: things to watch, things to hear, things to read. We have to have some way of categorising all these words, and all these ideas. “Tropes might make me pick up a book,” another romance reader tells me, “but I’ll stay or go for the writing.”“As soon as you start thinking about them, you realise you’re being fed them all the time,” a book publicist says. “If you click on a film on a streaming service, for example, it’ll tell you the tropes in the description so you know what to expect before watching.” There are, apparently, more than 36,000 different codes on Netflix – Small Town Scares, Twisted Christmas, One-Weekend Watches– to ensure the viewer is always presented with just the right content at just the right time.In literary terms, though, it’s mostly romantic fiction that has come to define itself by tropes – and to be derided for them, too. Of course, romantic fiction has always been at the frontline of a kind of culture war. “Reading romances”, or even just “novel-reading”, has been cause for concern among the cognoscenti for the best part of 300 years: Mr Collins, in Pride and Prejudice, is horrified that the Bennet sisters would rather read something from a travelling library than hear a sturdy sermon.Are today’s criticisms really so different? These books are derided as un-literary, formulaic. And what has happened to the thrill of stumbling on an indefinably brilliant novel by chance? “I don’t think that anyone needs to apologise right now (or ever) for seeking comfort in the familiar,” counters Wood. The world is full of chaos. There has to be room for reading as pure pleasure, for reading as escape. The genre of romantic fiction acts as a kind of playground for the reader. If the same basic plot point can unfold in a thousand different worlds in a thousand different ways, the reader can try a thousand different lives.“I rarely seek out tropes,” says Stewart. “[But what] I really love to find is a voice that embraces, celebrates and plays with the structures of a romance plot we already know really well.”“The – wrong – assumption,” she continues, “is that these tropes make romance books repetitive or boring or predictable. Brilliant writing – which exists in abundance in romance writing – knows how to surprise and trick the reader, even while doing something we think we already know. So, rather than feeling dulled when I see a trope in a romance book, I get a thrill out of seeing them coming. Oh, they’re on a road trip in a storm, are they? We are definitely driving head first into an only-one-bed scenario and I genuinely cannot wait to see how we land there … and what happens to the couple once we do.”If critics fear that trope-based storytelling is a threat to the delight of discovery and surprise, they might think of it as that stormy roadtrip: familiar landmarks, new detours, foreign snacks and lightning strikes. We fear it in the romantic novel most, perhaps, because only the romantic novel leans in. As in the best love affairs, these books and their readers wear their heart on their sleeve.Asking someone for their favourite trope is a deeply personal question – I, myself, could not have it waterboarded out of me – but there are dozens of forums and message boards where people share their most specific desires. Mostly, those books already exist. Mostly, there aremanypeople who share those dreams, or at least, can help a reader find what they’re looking for.A trope is to narrative as form or brushstroke is to a painting. It is possible, even usual, to like one more than others. I will always stop to look at a floral still life with big, deep colours and tiny little bugs. I like them old and Dutch. Dragging my mother round the Fitzwilliam Museum, one rainy day last autumn, we stood in mutual incomprehension before an exceptionally beautiful Rachel Ruysch. In vain I pointed out the beetle; the orange; the reflection of the 17th-century sky in the polished surface of the jug. “I think it’s lovely that you love it,” my mother said, generously. “I’m glad it’s here for you.”Which is, obviously, the only way to approach all art: it’s all for somebody. It’s all here for all of us, in infinite and glittering variety. The trope is a shortcut to delight. Here it is, the thing you wanted. Here is the thing you like best, the perfect book for you: something, somehow, as familiar as a friend, and as shiny as a jewel.Ella Risbridger is the author of In Love With Love: The Persistence and Joy of RomanticFiction(Sceptre).True romanceClassics reframed for a modern reader, by Sarah Moss and Sinéad MooneyBillionaire romanceLittle Women by Louisa May AlcottFour sisters growing up in 19th-century New England long for artistic fulfilment, exciting love lives, new clothes and good food. We meet them at Christmas, fantasising about brilliant futures while knitting socks for soldiers in the American civil war and preparing to give their Christmas dinner to starving refugees. Unfortunately, dreams of fulfilment and glamour contradict their parents’ Puritanism, so the girls will have to catch husbands without appearing to try. Meanwhile, over the garden fence, teenage Laurie is the heir to his grandfather’s immense fortune, and luxuriates daily in exotic fruit and ice-cream, playing his grand piano and fencing. Meg is too old for Laurie. Beth dies young. Jo can’t repress her queerness enough for anyone but a middle-aged German professor who needs help with his boys’ school, but once pretty blond Amy gives up her dreams of an artistic career, Laurie’s wall-to-wall carpets and opera tickets are all hers.Fake datingThe Wings of the Dove by Henry JamesKate Croy needs money. Her secret fiance Merton Densher needs money. They need a plan to enable them to marry. Solution: fake date a dying American heiress. Enter Milly Theale, who is rich, radiant and not long for this world. Kate encourages Merton to marry Milly so that they can eventually live happily ever after on his inheritance. Unfortunately, Merton catches real feelings, and Milly catches on to the scam. Fake dating becomes moral panic in a Venetian palazzo. Awkward, but everyone remains terribly polite, in extremely long sentences.Friendzone to loversFar from the Madding Crowd by Thomas HardyBathsheba Everdene inherits a farm. Her most reliable employee, Gabriel Oak, saves dying sheep, gives good agricultural advice, and quietly becomes her emotional support. After she rejects his proposal, he does the mature thing and sticks around, saving her hayricks from lightning and being respectful and competent in the background. Bathsheba, meanwhile, disastrously samples the local dating pool. Sergeant Troy is good at swordplay, bad at farming and in love with someone else: a walking red flag in a uniform. Obviously, Bathsheba marries him anyway, with predictably chaotic results. Troy fake-dies after gambling the farm into near ruin, then really dies when one of Bathsheba’s other ill-advised exes goes mad and shoots him. Throughout, friendzoned Gabriel remains loyal, practical and emotionally literate. Eventually Bathsheba realises that a man who fixes stuff and never causes problems is … really attractive.Sunny v grumpyTo the Lighthouse by Virginia WoolfMrs Ramsay’s daughters dream of “a wilder life”, perhaps in Paris, “not always taking care of some man or other”, but she herself is literally and figuratively married to the English bourgeoisie, and determined to enjoy it no matter how moody her husband and his tedious friends. She has her best epiphanies while knitting and weeding. Unlike many straight women in literature and perhaps life, she has found a way to love men without eroticising power. Mr Ramsay doesn’t notice the flowers she grows or the meals she cooks. She knows that he often thinks he would have written better books if he hadn’t married her, but even so he has “an eye like an eagle’s”, and somehow admiration for his great thoughts fuels her enduring sunshine.Holiday romanceA Room With a View by EM ForsterLucy Honeychurch arrives in Florence with her cousin Charlotte. They are meant to enjoy Italy in a respectable way, which means avoiding excitement, physicality, and anything Italian. Fortunately, the unsuitable George Emerson appears – brooding, impulsive and oblivious to social rules. Italy does what it always does in English novels: it causes inconvenient emotion. Lucy faints at a murder, George catches her mid-swoon, and they later share a kiss in a field of violets – an event so shocking that it nearly destroys the British empire at one fell swoop. Lucy, oscillating between desire and decorum, immediately suppresses the memory and flees back to England, where she becomes engaged to Cecil, a man with all the charm and spontaneity of an income tax form. George inconveniently reappears, reminding Lucy that passion, sunlight and honesty exist, even in the home counties.Sarah Moss’s latest novel is Ripeness (Picador). Dr Sinéad Mooney researches modernism and women’s writing."

They are all included in the V&A’sDesign 1990-Now galleries, which reopen to the public this week.The galleries, which run across two rooms on the upper floors of the museum, also house a collection of antique books. The displays cover six different themes including housing and living, crisis and conflict, and consumption and identity, rather than in a strict chronological order.View image in fullscreenThe ‘Please offer me a seat’ badge.Photograph: Olivia Singleton/V&A MuseumWith 250 exhibits, including 60 new additions, this can mean different takes on one theme across decades, as with the women at work section. It features a power suit from 1986 – but also a plastic-lined bra worn by women working on production lines in China to avoid being searched, and a pair of fast-fashion jeans like those made in the factories at theRana Plazabuilding in Bangladesh that collapsed due to a structural failure.‘Regrets? Number one: smoking. Number two: taking it up the wrong hole’: Tracey Emin on reputation, radical honesty – and ReformRead moreThe exhibits also demonstrate how history repeats itself, by using designs decades apart. This is clear with a poster calling for “No More Racist Murders” after the death of the teenager Rohit Duggal in 1992, which is displayed next to one commemoratingEric Garner, the Black man killed by a white police officer in 2014.There are 11 objects sourced fromRapid Response, a scheme that allows members of the public to suggest contemporary objects to be included in the museum’s collection. On display here are Snake Island stamps, which became a symbol of Ukraine’s resistance to Russia, a “life medal” given to those imprisoned for environmental action, and that Labubu.View image in fullscreenAn 80s boombox.Photograph: Jaron James/Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonCorinna Gardner, the V&A’s senior curator of design and digital, worked on the update. “The ambition of these galleries has always been to think that everybody who enters these spaces wakes up in the 21st century,” she said at a preview. “So how can we inform an understanding of today through the past? But also maybe think about a collective sense of what a future that we all might want can be, and the role design plays within that? It’s material things through which we navigate our place in the world.”Fresh insight into the objects we live with is everywhere – an Ikea lamp, for example, that is part of a manufacturing-at-scale section. “It’s designed as much to be compact for transport as it is to be beautiful in the home,” says Gardner.View image in fullscreenThe burkini was made after the designer saw her niece struggling to play netball while wearing a hijab and a long-sleeved top.Photograph: Robert Auton/V&A MuseumAn Apple home computer from 1977, and an accompanying advert suggesting the bliss of working from home, demonstrates the beginnings of something that is now a mainstay. “A computer in the home was a novelty at the time,” says Gardner. “There’s the idea that this husband [pictured in the advert], one might assume, is working away while his wife is kindly making dinner in the rear.”The backstory of familiar or newsworthy designs can be fascinating. The first ever baby monitor, designed by Isamu Noguchi in 1937, was inspired by theLindbergh baby kidnappingfive years earlier. The popularisation of plywood as a commercial material dates back to Charles and Ray Eames making a plywood splint to hold soldiers’ legs while in transit during the second world war.The burkini was made in 2004 after the designer Aheda Zanetti observed her niece struggling to play netball while wearing a hijab and a long-sleeved top. An unassuming-looking section of carbon-fibre rope, meanwhile, is the innovation that allows a building like Saudi Arabia’s 1km-high Jeddah Tower to power the lifts that serve all floors.The final section focuses on data and communication, and design over the last 25 years. This is where Edward Snowden’s laptop –borrowed from the Guardian’s archive– is displayed. “The archivist called it ‘an object we need to hold on to, because it’s so fundamental to our history’,” says Gardner. “The sense of the contestation of the public realm, the digital public realm, is manifest in that object.”View image in fullscreenNigeria’s 2018 World Cup kit.Photograph: Kieron Boyle/V&A MuseumThe Labubu is also here – surrounded by the antique books, and the librarians who look after them. It’s an example of how design can sometimes disrupt the usual environment of our every day. “One of my favourite moments as we’ve been reinstalling these galleries has been the giggles from the librarians because they were looking down at the Labubu,” says Gardner.Such reactions are what the V&A wants from the reworking of the gallery – whether from staff members, regular visitors or school groups of children and teenagers who might be surprised to see Labubus, football shirts or iPhones in a gallery. “Design museums, typically and historically, have been about celebrating excellence, and they do that very well,” she says. “These galleries are very much intended to be discursive …. The ambition is to be really expansive and open about that question of what design is.”Explore more on these topicsV&AExhibitionsDesignHeritageMuseumsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The campaign group is sending the venue vegan ham as an alternative.Jennifer White, an associate director at Peta, welcomed the decision, saying she hoped it would remind people “that all pigs areindividuals with personalitiesand not body parts to be chopped up”.Peppa Pig’s Big Family Show is touring the UK and Ireland until September. White saidPetacontacted Grimsby after reviewing theatre menus and noticing a startling amount of pork. The venue agreed to the request, and Peta said it hoped others would follow suit.In the letter to the theatre, Peta wrote: “As the fictional Pig family comes to life on stage, real pigs lose their lives for the bacon and sausage in your cafe. It’s a jarring contradiction: encouraging children to cheer for Peppa and her family one moment, then inviting them to eat the flesh of pigs the next.View image in fullscreenAn indoor commercial pig farm.Photograph: Farlap/Alamy“Like Peppa and [baby sister] Evie, real pigs are playful, curious, and social. But on theUK’s industrial pig farms, most spend their entire short lives confined to filthy sheds without sunlight.”The letter acknowledged that the show would not depict Peppa and Evie “convulsing in a gas chamber” but said “the products of this real-life suffering can be found in your cafe”.The auditorium told Peta it would remove pork products from the Stage Door cafe menu as a “considerate gesture” during the show’s run on 3-4 March.White said she hoped the Grimsby decision – and any similar moves elsewhere – would prompt meaningful conversations between parents and children about the ethics of eating animals. She encouraged families to order Peta’sfree vegan starter kit, which features recipes and practical advice.First broadcast in the UK in 2004, Peppa Pig is now shown in more than 180 territories and 40 languages.When Evie Pig was born last year, Grazia published aninterview with Mummy Pigin which she revealed the baby’s gender and speculated on what they might call her. “We’ve got SO many ideas for names,” she said. “Too many, frankly! Oink!”Alongside more than 400 TV episodes and the touring stage show, the franchise includesPeppa Pig Worldin the New Forest, praisedby Boris Johnson in 2021in a rambling speech to the Confederation of British Industry.2:09Boris Johnson praises Peppa Pig in bizarre CBI speech – videoUrging business leaders to visit, he said: “I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass transit systems. Even if they’re a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.”White said she hoped all theatres and arts organisations would reflect on their menus.In November, Peta said it had persuaded Chichester Festival theatre to drop pork products from its menus during a run ofThe Three Little Pigs.Explore more on these topicsChildren's theatrePeppa PigTheatreFarm animalsPetaVegan food and drinkVeganismnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s travelled to a distant planet to prove his mettle, by taking on the Kalisk, the only creature in the universe Predators are afraid of.

After a brief, awkward interaction, the two couples agree that a) the double entendre of the resort’s name is hilarious, and, b) they can amicably share for the duration of their stay.

In 1982, after competing in the World Pugilist championships in Hong Kong, I hitchhiked around Japan for a month or so, then headed for Korea via ferry in January of 1983. I’d heard air fares were cheap from Korea. No internet back then!While boarding, I was approached by a very attractive Japanese woman, with limited English, who told me that if I bought one box of bananas and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black label, I could pay for most of my trip in Korea. These items were very much in demand back then.Her name was Hitomi. We ended up talking on the ferry – I had absolutely no Japanese, and she was learning English as a hobby. She and her friend were travelling to Korea to buy clothes and accessories to sell in Japan. I didn’t know anything about Korea, so she suggested we travel together.View image in fullscreenHitomi and Kerry Cox in Tokyo circa 1990We stayed in Busan for a week, then in Seoul for another. Together, we’d visit local temples or Busan Tower. We’d just met – I didn’t think there were any romantic feelings.It turned out air fares were expensive in Korea, so Hitomi suggested I come back to Japan and spend some time in Miyazaki, Kyushu, where she lived with her mother. They lived in a valley, surrounded by rice paddies and koi ponds, with no other residences for a kilometre or so. Life was very simple. Hitomi’s mother was amused by me, and treated me well – at the time.Hitomi and I spent a lot of time traveling around Kyushu, visiting older people living on their own, others living with disabilities. She would often bring small gifts. I was becoming very attracted to her kindness, her always-cheerful personality, her lilting voice and laugh. She was beautiful on the inside and out. One local told me they thought she was an angel.One day we visited Takachiho, a famous mountain gorge. Because of the snow and ice, we decided to spend the night in a local tavern. That night she asked me when I would return home. I told her I was falling in love with her and wanted to stay longer. She said: “Me too!” I had no idea she felt the same way, and was ecstatic. We kissed. It was soft and delicate, just like her.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningEventually my visa ran out and I had to return to Australia. She came as far as Narita to see me off; we kissed forever and I almost missed the plane. We had plans for her to come to Australia as soon as she was able. I wasn’t thinking as far as marriage – this whole affair was completely unexpected for us both– but we were keen to see where it would lead.The moment I knew: on our second date I thought, ‘You’re kissing the man you’re going to marry’Read moreAs soon as I got back I realised Hitomi was the one. We had the odd phone call – expensive back then, so we primarily communicated through letters, in English. I have no idea how much she understood my writing although I tried to keep it as simple as I could, and I had an enjoyable but often difficult time understanding what she had written. All that mattered was the “love you” at the end.One day a mutual friend called: Hitomi is in Tokyo and wants to meet you … We hadn’t seen each other in years.She was trying hard to come to Australia but her mother was dead against it. So after a year I went back to Japan and hitchhiked down to a business hotel in Kyushu. Hitomi was working late, and I was just waiting in my room for her to arrive. There was a knock on my door. I opened it and she rushed into my arms, and a year’s worth of feelings spilled out. It was not a very romantic place, but I’d already decided I was going to ask her to marry me. And she said yes.Her mother did not approve. Looking back, I can understand: I was an unknown quantity, a foreigner who was possibly going to take her daughter away. If Hitomi and I were going to be together, I would have to come to Japan.View image in fullscreenKerry Cox and Hitomi on their wedding day, in Thames, New Zealand in 1990I went back to Australia to start applying for a visa. Unbeknownst to me, her mother was burning all my letters, and hung up whenever I tried to call.When I finally arrived back in Japan in 1988, I couldn’t contact Hitomi at all. She’d entered a singing competition, won a recording contract, and was travelling the country as a professional singer. Her manager and mother were blocking my attempts to contact her – their verdict was Hitomi had obligations and I would just complicate things.This was a gut punch. Knowing I wasn’t welcome in Miyazaki, I stayed in Tokyo, enrolled in Japanese language school, and worked in pubs, pachinko parlours and gyms.One day a mutual friend called: Hitomi is in Tokyo and wants to meet you. We met at Shinagawa station in a coffee shop. We hadn’t seen each other in years. She had matured, and was as beautiful as ever, with her same sweet voice and manner. By this time, my Japanese was better than her English and she was pleasantly surprised. After that, we rekindled our relationship very quickly. We were madly in love. We were now 30 years old and, according to her mother, no one else was going to marry a woman that old!In 1990, seven years after we first met on that ferry, we had a wedding ceremony in a beautiful old church in Thames,New Zealand. Hitomi wore a white wedding dress, then later changed into a kimono, which certainly turned heads in my small home town. Hitomi’s mother wore a kimono too – she’d come to accept that we could never be apart. My parents were totally enamoured of Hitomi, and said to me on the day: “If you stuff this up, don’t bother coming home!”‘For 40 years, I could never take my eyes off her’: Hitomi and Kerry Cox in Yugawara, Japan in early 2022.Photograph: SuppliedWe built a beautiful life together in Japan, with our two sons, and supported each other through thick and thin.Hitomi passed away three and a half years ago. I consider myself lucky that we were able to find each other again, after so many years apart. We always said it was fate that we boarded that ferry. If we had a choice, we would have married much earlier. For 40 years, I could never take my eyes off her. She was always the most beautiful woman in the room.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

His quiche is rich and creamy, with beautifully crumbly pastry, and my benchmark for these store-bought versions.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I tasted all of the quiches cooked according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Overall, the quality was lower than I’d hoped for, with many relying on ultra-processed ingredients, such as palm oil, emulsifiers and, often, caged-hen eggs. Free-range products didn’t always communicate this clearly on the packet, so it’s worth checking the ingredients list. Also, some described their pastry as “buttery” when they don’t contain any butter, and are instead made with vegetable shortening (palm and rapeseed oil). Encouragingly, however, a few gems emerged, with wonderfully simple ingredients, light and fluffy free-range custards, crisp all-butter pastry and generously filled.While the best are less processed, high welfare and rich in flavour, none of the quiches quite mastered the pastry in the same way as Meller. Although the outer layer crisped up in every case, the base was often undercooked and slightly stodgy in the middle.The best supermarket quichesBest overall:M&S portobello mushroom & mascarpone quicheView image in fullscreen£4.25 for 230g at Ocado (£1.85/100g)★★★★☆A small quiche, suitable for one or two, with a golden-brown top and a generous scattering of thick-cut sauteed mushrooms.
