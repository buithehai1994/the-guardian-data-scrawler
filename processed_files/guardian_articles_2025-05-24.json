What followed would transform my understanding of parenting, disability and the breadth of what makes a meaningful lifeArchie BlandSat 24 May 2025 01.00 EDTShareI look back at the last day of our old life with a kind of wonder now: the million summer freedoms, the complacency of our ease.I watched the cricket with Max on my knee. Friends came to visit, and Ruth fed Max while we talked about our new neighbourhood among piles of books and packing boxes. Max gurgled regally as I changed one of his famous nappies. I organised our phone chargers and put his birth certificate carefully in a drawer with our passports and the mortgage statement. Then I hung a picture in what would soon be his room: a print fromMaurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are, of a little boy sailing bravely across the ocean, with “Max” emblazoned on the prow of his ship. I stood back and admired it, feeling all three of us to be limitless, and wondering what would happen next.Ruth called her mum and gave her the latest; I told one group chat I thought Ring doorbells were for dickheads, and asked another what had been happening at work during my paternity leave. I ate half a chocolate bar, then forgot about it. Finding it a week later levelled me. This melted Dairy Milk, left for me by another person entirely, a stranger from an antique land.Then I have an in-between memory. I woke at five and stumbled to the bathroom to drink from the tap. The house was silent. Maybe the unknowable internal dominoes had already started to fall, or maybe they could still have been stopped. Maybe I could have decided to get Max up early, for no particular reason. Gina, the night nanny helping us through the move, would have thought me strange, but it would have been fine. Or if I had picked him up for a cuddle and put him straight back. Or if changing any single moment in his life or mine might have made everything different. A different bedtime. A different bed. A different house. A different dad.Just before six, the day already too hot, the pallid dawn creeping around the blinds: Gina’s voice, bursting into our room, screaming, blurred by a dream. I don’t remember her words. She is holding Max towards us, maybe hoping we will say she is wrong and he is fine. But he has no pulse, and he is not breathing. He is limp, cold, the colour of marble.Then I am calling 999 for the first time in my life while Gina starts CPR. I am saying our address again and again, begging the operator to start telling us what to do. I am distractingly aware that I am naked in the presence of someone I hardly know. Now Ruth takes the phone, and under the operator’s instructions we move Max from the bed to the floor. Now Ruth calls out a rhythm while I press at his little chest with my clumsy thumbs, then pause for Gina to breathe into his mouth.There is a voice in my head. You and Gina should not be dividing this responsibility, it says. You have introduced a layer of confusion. You should have taken charge. These are the things you have to get right at the most important moment of your life. This is happening. You are his father. This isyourjob. These will always be the things that you did. You are failing, and now your son is dead. “Please, please,” I say, sobbing as I count. All three of us are saying it. “Please, Max, please.”A police car is nearby, and they arrive a few minutes after six. Ruth runs down to let them in, I think. We stagger dumbly back, and let someone lead us out of the room.We are told to ride with him in the back of the ambulance because there is every chance he will not survive the journeyMax is still on the floor when the paramedics arrive a few minutes later, their notes tell me, but the police have done an excellent job with a defibrillator. The paramedics attach pads which adjust the shock to his size. He has no pulse. They push a tube down his throat to stop his tongue from blocking his airway. Then they put a bag over his nose and mouth which forces air into his lungs. Max is gasping once or twice a minute. But his heart starts beating again.At six minutes to seven, we leave for the hospital. At some point I must have found some clothes.I sit in the front of the ambulance and say thank you to the driver. When we get there, a paramedic tells us Max has opened his eyes. I cannot calibrate what this means. Perhaps it will be a near miss, a story we will tell.Max is rushed past us into A&E. I haven’t really seen him in an hour, just the cloud of people and equipment that attends him. Ruth, Gina and I are taken to a cramped waiting room, full of stacked chairs. I stare at the ceiling. An insect crawls along a fluorescent light.We are accompanied by a placid hospital staffer who keeps offering us cups of tea. Two police officers join us, and before we get any update on how Max is doing, they ask us for an account of what happened. Gina is talking a lot, I guess motivated by a reasonable horror of getting the blame, explaining that she had noticed the silence in place of his usual snuffling and stirring, but that she did not know how long it had been. Ruth and I barely speak, but I understand that all three of us are yet to be eliminated from their inquiries.We try to go to him, but are kept at a terrifying distance. Instead, we make a series of calls that irreversibly write our private crisis into the world at large.I know, as I hear my mother pick up, that I am about to compel her to enter one of the worst experiences of her life.Eventually, a doctor comes to see us. Max’s blood pressure is stable. But he has had to be sedated so that a mechanical ventilator can be pushed down his throat. He has a very poor blood oxygen saturation level of below 60%. One possibility is a heart and lung machine, which will do the work on his behalf.View image in fullscreen‘Gradually, the impact became unignorable.’Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianI think I have heard most babies who need this do not survive. The doctor’s gloss is the first of many annihilating euphemisms in the weeks ahead. “This is basically an end therapy,” she says. “It is the most we can do.”Whether this is ultimately necessary or not, Max must be moved to a specialist hospital at once. Another doctor from the acute transportation team comes in to explain. He is likely to have suffered a brain injury, and he is in a kind of induced coma. We should ride with him in the back of the ambulance, she says, because there is every chance he will not survive the journey. That was her phrase: every chance.We say goodbye to Gina, and I hear myself tell her that none of this is her fault, that she saved his life.We climb into the ambulance and huddle around our boy, seeing him for the first time as a patient, grotesquely encumbered with wires and tubes. I sob again at the sight of his funny little face. The sirens sound different from inside, the speed feels nothing like fast enough.Ruth saves me from despair. She tells me we will take it in turns to tell Max a reason we love him. We lean very close and revive each other with his myriad idiosyncrasies, a litany of his infinite seven-week-old self. I feel that if we stop, he will go. In this way, we cross London to Great Ormond Street.I’ve thought a lot about why I’m writing this. I know that I’m repelled by the kind of spiritual vultures who might scour Max’s story for shareable aphorisms, and that ideally, I’d like to slap them with an injunction. On the other hand, I also know that what happened has changed me utterly, and confronted me with things about the world that I had never even tried to understand: how unbelievably precarious it all is, the breadth of what constitutes a meaningful life, and the medieval state of anxiety that the disabled world still produces in the typical one.I hate the way that disabled lives recede out of view because other people are too squeamish to talk about them, and I want to confront that tendency. Mostly, though, I think Max is already a thousand times more interesting than anyone I’ve ever met, and I want to tell you about him.The three of us are only in the foothills of what I now understand to be our real lifeAs an advance on the parts of his story that are much less of an intergalactic bummer, I should tell you the first thing that really made me laugh. A few days after we arrived at Great Ormond Street hospital, some extremely nice friends sent us balloon letters spelling out Max’s name. When my friend Lizzie and I went to collect them, we found a harassed driver trying to wrestle them out of his van on a double yellow line.“I hate delivering here,” he observed, scanning the street for ambulances and traffic wardens somehow left cold by his generosity of spirit. “I’ve got kids. What’s he in for? It’s always bad news!” He continued in this vein for a bit, the letters X A M bouncing against his idiotic ears, until Lizzie put her hand up to interrupt. “Sorry,” she said, “but are you not the stripper?” So that was a bright spot. When I say our mood had already lifted a little, you have to understand that our perception of what counted as good news had changed radically.On day one, a police officer hovered at the entrance to Seahorse ward, as the paediatric intensive care unit is more palatably known, lest we try to finish the job we were still under suspicion of having started. Before we were allowed to see Max, we sat through half an hour of mollycoddling in a faded waiting area. Nothing sounded true until the doctor said, “It is likely there has been an insult to the brain.” I was brought up short by the term, which seemed to carry the right note of reasonless cruelty. I wasn’t wearing any socks, I now noticed, and my feet stuck to the coarse fabric of my shoes.Then, at last: there he was. He had a blue tube going into his right nostril, and a white tube coming out of his left one. Two others came out of his mouth, fixed in place by medical tape. Medical equipment towered over him, and he lay under a cooling blanket, very small and still, at the top of a bed that might have fit 10 of him.On day two, we were brought away from his bedside for an update from the neurologist in another dismal meeting room. The doctor took us through the results of an electroencephalogram (EEG), a relatively crude measure of brain activity, and a CT scan. “There appears to be damage to the brain stem,” he said.Then he said we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that Max had lost the ability to breathe on his own, and consciousness itself. The 1,746 pages ofmedicalnotes I got from the hospital later are mostly impenetrable, but two routine words, in a direct message to a colleague from a consultant who had seen the EEG, will never leave me: “Oh well.”View image in fullscreenMax with his parents, Ruth and Archie.Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianThe next day they brought us back for another debrief, this time on an MRI scan, which would provide a more precise view. “We can see damage to the cerebral cortex, and swelling to the basal ganglia, which is the part of the brain that controls language and movement,” the doctor said. “That could mean epilepsy and seizures. As he gets older we would look for signs of cerebral palsy. And we don’t know how the injury has impacted his ability to speak, or to swallow safely.”We stared at a cross-section of Max’s brain. The doctor went on, “What we can also see now is that there isnodamage to the brain stem.” He held his hands out as if describing a fish, emphasising what he said next with first the left, then the right. “Where before we were thinking aboutseveredamage, we would now put it atmoderate to severe.” Good news. Trying not to let hope in, I groped for the right language: what does that mean about consciousness? About his self, about his soul? “There are other parts of the brain that affect cognition,” he said, correcting my terminology. “It’s wait and see. But he’s starting to trigger his own breath, and that’s a positive sign.”We went back to our place next to Max, and distributed the news to our families, stationed at hotels and coffee shops nearby in anticipation of their allotted hour at his side. Then we sat quietly and watched the nurses as they went about their comforting business. I said the same thing to myself again and again: no better time to be Max in the history of the human race. No better place to be Max than exactly where he is.Sometimes his eyes flickered open, but we had been warned that this was not a sign of awareness. Ruth and I read to him, and stroked his forehead and ears. He was very far away, and it seemed impossible that he would ever grumble and belch in our arms again.But Max started to breathe on his own, and to produce great hacking coughs – a horrible and blessed sound that suggested his gag reflex, crucial to eating safely, was unimpaired. On the fourth day, they started to warm him up. At some indeterminate point, he was awake. Now he seemed to look at us, and to complain, if not to cry. We couldn’t hold him yet, but Ruth gave him her milk through a tube, transfiguring a process of medicinal sterility into an act of maternal love. And I read to him again, wondering if he could hear, or if we would tell him about this one day.I told him the story of his intrepid namesake, who sailed away to a terrifying and seductive place, and found his way home. It feels corny to tell you this because it’s so implausibly on the nose, but I suppose I no longer believe that anything is sentimental if it is true. I brought the book close enough to show him the pictures, and read:And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.So he gave up being king of where the wild things are.But the wild things cried, “Oh please don’t go -we’ll eat you up – we love you so!”And Max said, “No!”Over the next couple of weeks, Max underwent heart tests, lung tests, metabolic tests, genetic tests. Nothing showed up on any of them. Meanwhile, the police left the scene of what they eventually determined was not a crime. “We’re probably never going to know definitively what happened,” a consultant said. “Our best guess is it was a case of Sids [sudden infant death syndrome] interrupted,” an event so rare that there are no meaningful statistics pointing to its frequency. I wanted to know if this was ordained before Max was born, and could therefore be recognised as a part of him; or if it might not have happened, a far more horrifying prospect. But nobody can tell you those things, either.I had been thinking a lot about Gina, dwelling in my unsilenceable sense that although this wasn’t her fault, the decision to outsource some of our parenting meant that it must be mine. The truth is that I am ashamed, and I know that this feeling will never completely leave me. But being told that Max’s injury appeared to be the result of something beyond anyone’s control at least muted that reproachful voice a little.Even so, what befell Max quickly came to feel like some merciless cosmic rebalancing. I have had every kind of luck in life, cascading from the accident of my birth to sane, well-off parents to my education, my job, my friends, meeting Ruth, and then the joy of Max’s arrival. My dad died, and it was terrible, but that is supposed to happen. At some point, I think I just assumed that I was going to get out intact.Over our time at Great Ormond Street, I developed a warped, concentric taxonomy. At the very centre were Max and Ruth, who could have anything they wanted. Then came the other kids we met, and their families; then the doctors and nurses and porters and volunteers. I could usually get from the bedside to the front entrance and feel wrapped in a spirit of mutual benevolence. If one of those people had taken a piss on my shoes, I would have shrugged and put it down to nervous exhaustion.The street outside was a mixed zone; balloon merchants and Uber drivers might not have felt the weight of our catastrophe, but at least they had collided with it. Beyond that, I quickly felt that I needed body armour or, ideally, a baseball bat with nails in it. Nobody here knows fuckinganything, I wrote in a note to myself, perhaps unfairly assuming that these people were floating through life as I had for the last 39 years. Late one night, a drunk teenager planted himself in front of me on the pavement, asked for the time, and told me to lighten up. I worked through alarming visions of beating him senseless all the way back to our room.View image in fullscreen‘There are good signs in the way he laughs and gets excited.’Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianThe whole world seemed decadent.Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerbergnegotiated the terms of a cage fight; disgruntled holidaymakers told the newspapers of their anger aboutan air traffic control problemthat left them “marooned”. Meanwhile, I asked the neurologist if I could be right in my conviction that Max had looked at me. As she answered, she picked up a stuffed animal and thrust it suddenly at his face. He didn’t flinch.But then, after we got him home, an August day commemorated by exclamation marks in my notes: sitting in his bouncer, Max contemplated a rattle being waved maniacally in front of his face, and smiled. When I flashed the rattle towards him, he blinked in surprise: his impassive response of a week earlier, it turned out, was no more than the artefact of a colossal opioid hangover. I felt forgiven for every shitty thing I’d ever done. For the first time, we let ourselves believe that Max was here, and that he would not be going away.The diagnosis won’t be formally confirmed until he’s two years old, but in early 2024, we were told Max has cerebral palsy: that is, parts of his brain that should route instructions to his muscles had been permanently injured by the loss of oxygen when his heart stopped.At first, they told us to be optimistic that Max would eventually walk and talk. On the five-pointGross Motor Function Classification System, where five denotes the most severe physical impairment, an assessment suggested he was almost certainly somewhere between level one and level three. “The difference between one to three and four to five is very significant,” one doctor said. “So that’s really good news.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Max is nearly two now. It is still too early to reach any firm conclusions about cognition, although there are only good signs in the way he peers after someone when they leave, and laughs at peekaboo, and gets excited when he sees his milk bottle. He has so far been spared seizures or the need to be fed through a tube into his stomach, which are very significant pieces of good fortune. But on that early prediction, our hopes have been gradually distilled: from walking and talking to mobility and communication. From as “normal” a life as possible to as good a life as possible. And from independence, and doing everything for himself, to a more expansive definition of freedom.It’s not that Max is a slow learner: it’s that he hasso much moreto learn. Where other kids seek a driving licence, he is tasked with the invention of the internal combustion engine. When his attention is elsewhere or he is asleep, he will move a limb with heartbreaking ease, but when he tries to do something, the signal gets scrambled. He makes a range of entertaining sounds to indicate his opinions, but the muscles in his mouth resist any instruction to form a consonant; he doesn’t roll from his front to his back much, or sit up without support, and he struggles to pick up objects or release them from his grasp. On that five-point motor function scale, we now think he’s probably a four. There’s a lot we can do to help Max, but we aren’t going to change that fundamental reality.The word we kept hearing was “neuroplasticity”: the idea that the brain may be able to somewhat adapt to an injury, and forge new pathways for the blocked instructions, if given the chance through repetition. The potential for those changes is greatest in the first couple of years, so we felt hopeful, but also under intense pressure to do as much physiotherapy as possible.For a while, we were overwhelmed. People would remind us, in case we didn’t realise, that we should be sure to make sure to be Max’s parents as well as his carers, something that’s a lot easier to say when your kid somersaults out of bed and plays the Fisher-Price xylophone likeEvelyn Glennie. But gradually, things got better. The main reason for that is Ruth.It’s a funny thing: you fall in love with a beautiful Canadian smartarse for her ability to make you collapse in laughter by enumerating your manifold flaws, and she turns out to be an indomitable hero. Ruth’s greatest peacetime virtues map neatly on to the job description for a top-tier parent to a kid with a disability: her fearlessness is now directed at intransigent bureaucrats instead of difficult landlords, her unwavering loyalty now applies to Max as well as her oldest friends, and her boggling adaptability now means that, as well as figuring out life on a new continent, she can sketch out your shared place in a totally different world.I’m also not sure what we would have done without Rachel, a nanny and carer who has Coca-Cola for breakfast and uncooperative healthcare practitioners for lunch. Rachel, who dresses mostly in black, hates our dog and gets to work on an extremely illegal scooter, has worked with kids with disabilities for many years, and she’s seen plenty of things that make our situation look like a breeze. She is tough as tungsten, devoted to Max, and very good at physiotherapy routines.Which is lucky, because there are a lot of them. Poor old Max: where most parents are cooing at their indolent progeny as they chuck another bowl of mashed banana on the floor, or dumping them on the rug with a pile of bricks and the vague instruction to follow their instinct, we were coaching him through a regime of baby sit-ups and commando rolls that brought to mindswelling trumpets and a young Sylvester Stallone.I worry we are guilty of trying to ‘fix’ Max and feel queasy about all the things we can afford that others can’tIn the early days, we considered several treatments that turned out to be ludicrous quackery. Now, alongside the mostly excellent NHS services we are granted by our postcode, we swaddle Max in intricate orthotic straps supposed to help with his alignment and proprioception, and stick little electrodes to his spine and glutes. We use up half our holiday to attend physiotherapy “intensives” that run for weeks at a time. Most of the rest last year went on trips to North Carolina, where Ruth got him on to a world-leading stem cell trial at Duke University. Max has spent a thrilling couple of months trying out an eye-tracking communication tablet, orEyegaze, and taken to it with such magical ease that we hope the NHS will cover the brutal cost of getting him one permanently; we stick little laminated symbols to a board – “Eat”, “Drink”, “More”, “Finished” – to provide an analogue alternative in the meantime. Our house now resembles a steampunk scrapyard, full of industrial-looking equipment that helps Max in one way or another.Nothing amounts to a miracle cure. I worry that we are guilty of trying to “fix” Max, and I feel queasy when I think about all the things we can afford to do that so many parents like us simply cannot. Max seems to be making real progress, but we are doing so many things at once that we have only a hazy sense of what helps and what doesn’t. Making him a one-baby randomised control trial would be more rigorous, but he would be past his period of maximum gain by the time we understood what was really worthwhile. I often think of that old marketing saw: “Half my advertising spend is wasted. The difficulty is I don’t know which half.”I am telling you all this in part, I must admit to myself, because I don’t want your vision of me as a parent to be only that of the man who paid someone to feed his son in the night. And this, then, too: on our last day at the local hospital, an A&E doctor told us that when she heard what had happened, she could not understand how Max had made it in with a fighting chance. That she thought about us and Gina with admiration all the time, and that the three of us had undoubtedly saved his life, saved his life, saved his life.Nobody knew exactly what to say, and a few people just drifted out of sight. A surprisingly large number of others concluded that the comforting thing to do was to draw a comparison between their own offspring’s minor ailments and what happened to Max. We heard about skin conditions, joint problems, minor bouts of jaundice, and an asthmatic who later went to university, which also happens to be my own tale of triumph over adversity. In one memorable case, someone told me about a toddler who carried the burden of a squint that ultimately resolved on its own. My son is a heavily sedated two-month-old and he still reads the room better than you, is what I later wished I had had the presence of mind to say in reply.The line I hated the most, blandly repeated whenever someone couldn’t think of what to say, was that it must have been “scary”, as if we’d lost him in the supermarket. I cultivated a sense of grievance about these absolute doughnuts, who made me feel like a woman on a terrible Hinge date:just ask me some questions!Their clucking seemed to be a way of pulling their own coat tighter against the storm, instead of offering it to us.In my head, London was full of rubbernecking acquaintances thinking mostly about how lucky they were, and eliciting lurid details about our mental collapse from the people who cared enough to come and see us. I liked to speculate to Ruth about how they were spending their evenings. Life is so precious – hold them close tonight, these fictional villains were texting their group chats, before turning back to their takeout and Grand Designs, or drafting another Instagram story going out to all the new parents finding it so tough: You’ve got this!!! I wanted to tell them we viewed their version of parenthood, their challenges with nap schedules and self-weaning, with the same righteous condescension as they viewed people who didn’t have kids. I wanted their children to be eaten by lions, despite the pastel anti-lion cages they had installed around their beds.I don’t feel that way any more. The truth is that it was very hard to say the right thing to me last year. People’s thudding comparisons to their own robust brats were, above all,pretty funny. A squint, come on. I partly held on to them because they gave me something to fulminate about to the people I was really intimate with, not because they had done us any harm.View image in fullscreen‘Gradually, things got better. The main reason for that is Ruth.’Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianI wish, now, that I had spent more time reckoning with the devotion of the people who loved us, all the more bewildering because I was so bad at asking for it. Our families’ sustaining presence at our sides; the dozens of people who signed up for a meal train that lasted 64 days and only stopped because everyone agreed I was getting alarmingly fat; the friends who took on deadening logistical roles, unpacked our house for us, and just would not bloody leave us in peace. I will never forget finishing lunch at a friend’s and realising that one of our hosts had taken Max to the next room, where I found him companionably installed in front ofMr Tumblewith the other kids, wholly included without any special effort on our part for the first time. Or hearing second-hand about Ruth’s best friend finding a toy figurine in a wheelchair to normalise Max’s likely future for her own son, a bridge that she built without ever telling us herself. None of it could really help, in one sense. But it made it impossible to persist in my conviction that we were utterly alone.In the first few months, the fact of Max’s injury mostly had to be taken on faith. I’d never really spent much time around babies before, and everything he did looked perfect to me. I enjoyed the way friends who were anxious not to seem like they were scrutinising him for flaws traduced their own children for our benefit, too. I’m so sorry about Norman, they’d say, unprompted: he’d eat his own shit if he wasn’t too stupid to know where his arse is, he’s pond scum, he’s pathetic, he should be in a secure facility.Gradually, though, the impact became unignorable. Kids with cerebral palsy often have a lot of trouble in the midline, the central zone where so many of life’s vital activities take place: to hold a toy proffered beneath his eyes, Max would extend his arms to their widest wingspan, then inch one hand gradually towards the centre, saying OOOH as he went, until you met him with the prize halfway. I always thought of 2001’s shuttle, docking with a space stationto the strains of a Johann Strauss waltz. There was such charm and determination in the way he worked against the grain of his disobliging neural pathways: I knew this wasn’t how it usually worked, but the effect was much too lovely to feel altogether sad.By last summer, we thought we were robust enough to go away for a few days with friends whose son had arrived around the same time as Max. Timmy was a sweet little guy, and as it turned out I resented him deeply, in the way you resent the Maldives sunset your friend posts on social media while you sit at your desk.One morning, as I gave Max breakfast in his supportive chair, Timmy staggered into the kitchen holding a plastic bottle, dropped it, picked it up again, laboriously unscrewed the lid and put it in his mouth, picked up a piece of cutlery from the floor and tapped it on the table. I tried to count the little gifts of information about the workings of the world that this short drunkard would have taken from that sequence, and found myself crying quietly. I wanted to shout for everyone else to gather round, in the way you do when a showy closeup magician presents himself at a wedding: Gordon, get over here! You’ve got to see what this kid can do with a spoon!We can’t invent hope. But we can find a way to live without faking it, to forge something good out of this anger, and this loveAs a white man named Archibald, I always suspected I was missing something about the impact of privilege; now it became viscerally clear. In the autumn, as we continued our dutiful re-entry to the world, a friend listened attentively to an update on Max’s progress and then, after the conversation had moved on, drifted into a paean to the pleasures of later childhood. His own son was reaching the age where they can happily wander to school on their own, he said dreamily. I suppose he had no inkling, as I smiled through his description of independence as an indispensable part of being a fully realised person, that the only thought in my head was how that would never be the case for Max.On one of those trips to North Carolina, we waited at the boarding gate, showing Max a video on Ruth’s phone. A sweet old lady came over and complimented us, correctly, on how handsome Max was; then she asked whether we ought to be showing him television at his age, reminded us how important these years were for his development, and went back to her seat.As we waited for the flight to board, and muttered to each other about how totally she could go and fuck herself, I felt an unprecedented compulsion to do something. I rehearsed what I wanted to say with Ruth a couple of times, and then went and found her.“Hi, sorry, I just wanted to mention something,” I gabbled. “It’s just to say our son spends more time with a screen than other babies because he has a disability that makes it very difficult to play with toys. So maybe if you see someone parenting in a way you don’t approve of, you should think about what else might be going on.”She looked a bit stricken and said, “No, dear” twice, and I went back to my seat, trembling with the thrill of it. “He has a disability”: I had never said that to a stranger before. Max took a giant shit, and burped beatifically. Then an English guy in a gilet loudly called his pimpled son a “fucking retard”, and I stared furiously at my shoes.Afew weeks ago, during the usual battle of wills over dinner, Max did something very surprising. I reloaded the spoon, and he did it again, so I put my camera on, and asked Ruth to come over and give an opinion. We offered him another chance to accept a bit of dinner and, as he often does, he puckered his lips and turned away. Then, in something like desperation as I chased him with shepherd’s pie, he put his tongue to the roof of his mouth, and the great wail that followed started with a consonant. Ruth burst out laughing. I turned to the camera, triumphant and beseeching. “Come on!” I said. “That’s definitely ‘No’!”Everyone I sent it to enthusiastically agreed. I floated around for a few days on the strength of it. Since then, though, the incident has drifted out of view. Max communicates, loudly, all the time, but I can’t honestly say that anything since has engendered the same confidence that he’s deliberately forming a consonant. Maybe we projected the whole thing. What’s surprising is how I feel about it. If you had explained this sequence to me a year ago, I think I would have sunk into despair. Today, the honest truth is that whether this turns out to be a first step or a false dawn, I simply do not care.View image in fullscreen‘To ask if I would undo it is to ask if I want some other kid. I don’t. I want this one.’Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt/The GuardianVersions of the same question come up a lot in the accounts I have read from people with disabilities and their parents: would you undo it? In one sense, it’s an idiotic query, as relevant to reality as the matter of who would win in a fight between 100 duck-sized horses and one horse-sized duck. But it is hard to put away.I don’t mean to be glib. If I could press a button that made Max’s life easier by granting him everything he has been denied, I would do it in a second. But if the question is whether I would takemyselfback to being the genial ignoramus of two years ago, I’m much less sure. I wish this had never happened, of course. But life would feel thin without it. I understand things about myself and the world now that I can’t wish I didn’t know. All of the noise about what on earth I’m here for has melted away. I think I am a better person, if a sadder one.The realisation that brings clarity is this: the more time passes, the more the hypothetical about undoing it becomes an invitation to wish Max away, to erase all the things that I love about him. When I watch him using his Eyegaze with such cheerful skill, I get so carbonated with pride that I feel like I’m having a panic attack. If Max never speaks, that isn’t frightening any more; if he ends up turning out tongue twisters, I’m curious to see what that’s like, too.I don’t remember the recitation Ruth and I made on that ambulance ride, to be honest, but I can supply a new version in a second. The YIKES grimace he pulls when he’s at the apex of his arc on a swing and absolutely unsure about whether this is a good idea. The high kicking glee of a few minutes in his walker. His Godzilla thirst for trampling on my face if I hold him in the air. His turds, somehow. His amazement when he realised it was the button he was pressing that made the plastic frog burp bubbles. The warm weight of him in my arms as I rock him to sleep, and the way he gazes at me when I sing him a song. When I think about my question at Great Ormond Street now, I think I was right not to ask about cognition: that his personhood is not subject to medical assessment. And that Max was the boy who went away, but he is also, thank God, the boy who came back.There was a time when choosing this Max over some theoretical other felt like a betrayal: I had a recurring idea of this other possible boy, stuck in limbo, wondering why I had abandoned him. He still comes to me, sometimes. But there is nothing at all apart from the things that happen. To ask if I would undo it is to ask if I want some other kid. I don’t. I want this one. And so I have to let that figment go.Sometimes, people tell us to hold on to hope, or to believe in Max. But those invitations miss the point completely. We don’t have to believe in Max, because he’s right in front of us, farting. We can’t invent hope. But we can find a way to live without faking it, to forge something good out of this anger, and this love. In that determination, we can create the fertile soil for hope to take root when it decides to arrive.It is too soon to say if this feeling is the beginnings of a philosophy, or a fantasy. The three of us are only in the foothills of what I now understand to be our real life. How long until we have to leave our three-floor terraced house? How will our backs cope as Max grows? How will it feel as his disability becomes more visible to others, and as he starts to understand it himself? Will he want to live with us or move out one day? And what happens when we die?To this list of mine, Max will add a thousand questions of his own. The answers to all of them will certainly come. In the meantime, he and Ruth are downstairs, engaged in a lively discussion about what’s for dinner. That is the next question, and I want to help them answer it.Some names have been changed.Explore more on these topicsFamilyParents and parentingSudden infant death syndromeChildrenDisabilityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What secrets would the data reveal?Jeremy EttinghausenSat 24 May 2025 06.45 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 11.57 EDTShareShe is always listening. She is unfailingly polite. She is often obtuse. She is sometimes helpful. She frequently frustrates. She isn’t great with bashment artists. Or grime. Or drum’n’bass. She needs to be spoken to slowly and clearly, as you’d talk to an aged relative with diminished faculties. She doesn’t like French accents.‘“Alexa, how long do wasps live for?”“Alexa, how long do wasps live if you hit them with a tea towel and then a saucepan?”In September 2016, a new presence appears in our house, squatting on the kitchen counter between the kettle and the coffee machine. It is blandly futuristic, a minimal cylinder with an LED ring that glows blue to alert us to the fact that it is ready, poised to answer our questions or carry out our instructions, as long as those instructions are clearly stated and fall within a narrow band of available “skills”.More often than I’d like, the solid blue glow is replaced by a rotating wash of green to tell us that anAmazonorder is on its way. Occasionally, the light is red: this happens when someone has turned off the microphone to seize control of the device and impose their music on all of us. Our Amazon Echo is primarily used as the family Bluetooth speaker, and a glance through the music played on it demonstrates that there is very little common ground between our differing tastes. In a household with three young people, the kitchen is a place of musical education and dispute, with the Echo the communal weapon of choice.Our Echo is one of the early ones: essentially a smart speaker connected to a server where the fairly rudimentary Alexa voice assistant attempts to turn our requests and questions into actions and answers. More recent incarnations have screens that allow you to make video calls or stream TV programmes, inevitably, through Amazon Prime. And, when Amazon releases its long-awaited, generative AI-enabled update in the next few weeks or months, my aged unit will be incompatible with Alexa+. It won’t remember my favourite movies or meals, and it won’t help me plan a night out or book an Uber or find a babysitter. But given what Alexa (and, by extension, Amazon) has heard and analysed and stored in the nine years they have been eavesdropping on us, I am happy to settle for our first-generation Echo’s more limited capabilities.Our requests ranged from prosaic to troubling and downright bizarre – there was very little we didn’t ask AlexaLast year, I realised that my relationship with Amazon predated my mortgage, my marriage, parenthood, two distinct careers and a host of other significant life moments. To see if I could distil anything of value – the contours of a 21st-century adulthood, perhaps – from all the information Amazon holds about me, I requested all the available data usingan almost impossible to find link. Would I be reassured or disturbed when I found out what Amazon and Alexa knew about my family?A couple of days later, I received an email containing links to gigabytes of information: particulars of every purchase I’ve ever made – from the noir novel I bought on the day that Amazon UK launched to the 28th pair of headphones acquired in as many years. Records of every page turn of every Kindle ebook I’ve opened, every moment of Prime content I’ve watched, measured by the second. And, of course, the details of every interaction we have ever had with our Echo; every question asked, every song requested, every timer set.They don’t make it easy to find gold among the fields of data available for download. Folder and file names are opaque and unhelpful. Competence with spreadsheets is useful and a subscription to a powerful AI assistant is advantageous. Time and patience are necessary. One folder contains nothing but thousands and thousands of sound files, all with the same date and each with a nonsensical string of characters instead of a name. It is definitely fun to click on these at random and hear the voices of various family members mispronouncing band names, asking for Pokémon jokes or demanding that Alexa “play a fart noise”. But without any semblance of order to the files, going through 15,000 of them (“Alexa, never mind”) would truly be a sisyphean task. Or a briefly entertaining family parlour game.Fortunately, along with the sound files, Amazon provides spreadsheets and spreadsheets of text-based data that reduces the amount of time needed to assess our Alexa usage from months to days. Using these spreadsheets and searching for the word “play”, I can see that nearly half of the 15,000 “utterances” registered by Alexa have been instructions to play a song, album or playlist, while 1,823 of them have been the setting of a timer. In our 15,000 utterances we have only said “please” to Alexa 41 times, though, in our defence, we only told her to fuck off twice.These commands allow me to trace the development of the musical tastes of my children: from being a Kanye-obsessed schoolboy, my oldest has diversified his listening, with Bowie and the Smiths appearing as data clusters during university holidays. My middle child’s musical awakening begins with Loyle Carner, though more recently she has apparently developed a liking for vocal jazz. And the youngest has thankfully exited herphonkphase and now fills the kitchen withriot grrrlas she empties the dishwasher. Looking through the list of music played, I see little evidence of my wife’s musical preferences in the data, aside from her oft-used “Alexa, volume down, VOLUME DOWN” instruction.Then, in one cryptically named folder, I find a rich seam of precious material: transcripts of more 1,500 questions that we have asked Alexa since 2018. Ranging from the prosaic (“Alexa, how many days until 28 October?”) to the troubling (“Alexa, what is hentai?”) to the downright bizarre (“Alexa, do jellyfish have bottoms?”), these questions indicate that there is very little we won’t ask our little speaker-dwelling friend. Once I’d read the transcripts of everything we’d asked, I saw that we use Alexa as a surrogate, filling in for all sorts of roles that might be missing due to physical absence, knowledge gaps, or lack of attention or patience.We are lazy. Alexa has given us the opportunity to let someone (or something) else do the reading and learning and thinking for usAt different points over the last six or so years, Alexa has been our on-call veterinarian, substitute teacher, big sister, parent, therapist, adjudicator and whipping boy, on top of her familiar roles as DJ and voice-activated timer. She has helped with maths homework, reassured us that, no, bananas are not poisonous to dogs, taught us how to say “so cool” in French (“tellement cool”) and settled the argument of whether Canada is bigger than Russia. My mistake – thanks, Alexa.But she has also advised us on things we can do to make ourselves happy; informed us what might be the appropriate age to start dating (“A good age for teenagers to start dating is 16,” says Dr Eagar of HealthyChildren.org. “A parent can add or subtract a year depending on the teen’s maturity level.”); offered techniques for getting to sleep (“Try lowering the thermostat and try blocking out any outside light”); and suggested how long a girl’s first period might last (“From two to seven days”). She has stoically borne the brunt of our frustration (“Alexa, you’re a bitch”); refused, I presume, to “Tell Jeff Bezos that Alexa sucks” (“I’m not quite sure how to help you with that”); and passively dealt with our pathetic attempts to flirt with her.“Alexa, are you single?”“I am happily single”“Alexa,kiss me”“OK – mmmwwwah”Without listening to every single sound file, it’s hard to be certain who is asking Alexa what. But we have two Echo devices in our household and the data shows whether a request came from the Echo Plus in the kitchen or the original Echo on our daughter Coco’s bedside table, where it has sat since around her ninth birthday. It has played her hundreds of hours of audiobooks, participated in playdates and sleepovers, collaborated in cheating on maths homework, and offers a rare glimpse into the secret inner world of a networked tween.So I now know that it was Coco who wanted to know what it is to be omnisexual and what omniscient means. And it’s Coco who wants to know what happens when you mix all the colours of the rainbow, what would be the best name to call a leopard, and wants Alexa to sing her a song about cats. Coco is simultaneously the most polite member of the family to Alexa, regularly wishing her a good morning or goodnight, and the rudest: both utterances of “Alexa, fuck off” are attributed to her device. The transcripts from Coco’s Echo reveal her waning interest in Pokémon, her inability to tell the time (“Alexa, how long until 8.45?”) and her problems getting to sleep. What they also clearly show is that, out of the five of us, Coco is the most comfortable talking to a voice assistant – half of the entries in the dataset come from her device – and that there are no boundaries to what she will ask Alexa, with the mix of repetitively mundane to profoundly existential sometimes generating its own abstract poetry.“Alexa, swear”“Alexa, swear”“Alexa, say a bad word”“Alexa, don’t say knickers”“Alexa, knickers”“Alexa, what does knickers mean?”Coco’s relationship with Alexa is, in our family at least, uniquely hers. For a start, she is of an age where she wants to know the answers to questions that may be too personal or embarrassing to ask a parent or sibling. And then she is the only one of us who has an Echo in their own private space. Coco tells me she speaks to Alexa less now than she did two or three years ago, partly because she knows that I’ve seen transcripts of everything she has asked, but mainly because she now has her own phone and WhatsApp and can chat with “like, actual friends”. I asked her why she didn’t come to talk to us about her problems getting to sleep, and she said that most of these questions to Alexa happened late at night when she didn’t want to disturb us or let us know she was still awake. She denies ever swearing at Alexa, but admits that there were occasions when she had friends in the room where things turned a little raucous and Alexamighthave been the victim of bullying.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Steven Gregor/The GuardianI’ve learned plenty through the Alexa-enabled glimpse into Coco’s psyche, and the rest of us have, to a lesser extent, revealed ourselves through our questions and demands. We are, for example, opinionated and argumentative, the Echo in our kitchen being regularly called on to adjudicate on disputed facts, most recently “Alexa, are ducks and geese the same thing?” We didn’t know how old Zendaya or Michael Bublé or Jeremy Corbyn or 67 other celebrities are, and this knowledge was at some point important to us. We are lazy and wasteful, and Alexa has given us the opportunity to let someone (or something) else do the reading and learning and thinking for us.Alexa, what shouldI do – eat the rest of my sandwich or throw it in the bin?Most years, Amazon UK’s PR team issues a press release containing listicles of the most-asked Alexa questions from the past 12 months, from which I’ve learned that we are not outliers in our usage and behaviour. We are as interested in celebrities as everyone else, though less interested in how tall they are or how much they earn. We differ in that we don’t use Alexa for recipes, and no one in our house has ever said “Alexa, you’re the best!”, which in 2022 was the eighth most recorded utterance about Alexa’s personality. And if our Echo usage is replicated nationwide, my back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest that Alexa will have set more than 3bn timers in the UK last year, and responded to tens of millions of polite or not so polite commands every day..In2023, 60% of UK households had a smart speaker, up from 22% before the pandemic. Of these,72% are Amazon Echo devices. More rough calculations on my part produce the truly astonishing figure that there are nearly 12m Echo devices in the UK. Of course, many of these may well be unplugged and sitting on a shelf, deaf, dumb and dormant. But, clearly, millions and millions of us are comfortable with having an eavesdropper in our homes, listening out for our shopping orders, queries about our favourite sports teams, compliments and insults, score settling, music requests, and revealing, personal, inquiries. And they’re not just listening and responding, but sending the sound files and data to Amazon’s servers, where they are stored, processed and analysed, giving the most sophisticated retailer in history access to a treasure trove of information on who we are, what we want, what we need and what we desire.Isn’t it all a bit creepy?Amazon makes it clearthat while Alexa is always listening, she is not always sending audio to Amazon’s servers, only streaming audio to the cloud when a “wake” word has been detected and verified. Amazon says “Alexa is a continuously improving service”, and the requests it collects and stores from our usage helps it to train its speech-recognition services and provide better recommendations of music to listen to and “skills” to enable. It is possible to delete all the data Amazon keeps on file and also choose not to have any voice recordings saved, though text transcripts will be retained for 30 days. I’ve been fairly blase (naive, perhaps) about allowing an Echo to eavesdrop on our lives – but given that Amazon says that humans review some, albeit “an extremely small sample”, of data gathered from Alexa, it is probably worth followingmathematician Hannah Fry’s adviceto keep Echos and similar devices out of bedrooms, bathrooms and other intimate spaces. It’s something that I might have considered if I’d known before now that Coco was using Alexa for life advice.But what I’ve gleaned from looking through everything we’ve asked Alexa is the melancholy realisation of what is missing in our home and in our lives. We don’t know nearly as much as we think we do, and we need Alexa (and Siri and Google) to fill in the gaps. We often don’t trust each other, and rely on a neutral third party to mediate. And, as parents, we are not always in the room, physically or metaphorically, when we’re needed. We can’t or won’t always be there to help with homework or offer life advice or simply just provide reassurance. But for many of us, and especially for Coco, Alexa is always willing and always available, if not always capable. Above all, Alexa is always present. I can’t say the same for myself.Explore more on these topicsAmazon AlexaAmazonSmart speakersInternetSmart homesFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From Monday, visitors to Brockwell Park would have seen calling cards left by both sides. The provocation? A sturdy 3-metre-high boundary fence, encircling large swathes of the 50-hectare (125-acre) stretch that has been designated for music festivals this summer. Daubed on the structure were signs of discord:graffitied messagesin stark white lettering. “You fucked our park,” read one. “We fucked your wall.”Brockwell is now the hottest front in a conflict that has started to rear its head in the capital every summer. A week ago, it made the front pages in the form of a bombshellhigh court rulingagainst Lambeth council. The authority responsible for the park lost a case brought by Protect Brockwell Park (PBP), a group oflocal residents and park userswho argued that the council hadnot obtained the proper planning permissionsfor the back-to-back run of events scheduled to take place behind the boundary fence.It had used permitted development rules to rubber-stamp the events quickly, on the basis that they would only block off a substantial section of the park for 28 days. In reality, this wasn’t true, the residents argued. Factoring in erecting and dismantling festival infrastructure, it was actually more like 37 days where public park access would be restricted. The council should have been subjecting these events to a full planning application process – including public consultation – before granting approval. The judge found in PBP’s favour.Yet the festivals remained on the park’s summer schedule. As the date of the first event – Wide Awake, an alternative music shindig headlined by the rappers Kneecap – approached, Lambeth rushed through a certificate of lawfulness, allowing for public comment, and on Friday the festival opened its gates.The clash has captured public imagination, igniting a now well-worn narrative of nimbys versus nightlife. The PBP campaigners are being cast by some as meddling, out-of-touch “gentrifiers”, akin to affluent folk moving into a buzzy area and immediately lobbying for a beloved local pub or scrappy independent music venue to shut down because they want to retire to bed by 10pm. As a left-leaning millennial, I’d normally be inclined to side with the festivals. After all, we must protect our endangered cultural sphere from further attacks.Except what is happening here isn’t so clear-cut. Over the past few years, the city’s parks have become increasingly available for hire. TheLondonsummer day festival, as in other cities, is now an institution and there has been a proliferation of commercial events concentrated in certain large parks: Victoria, Finsbury and Brockwell are top of the list.Behind every “summer series” of festivals is an unhappy residents’ group.People who live near to and rely on these green spaces feel they are being shut out of public land that should be for all of us to benefit from, in favour of what they perceive to be commercial interests.Many of the large events being objected to are not even remotely close to resembling the accessible, community space of a local pub.Two of the park’s festivals, Field Day and Mighty Hoopla, are run by the promoters Superstruct, owned by parent company KKR, an investment firm. Artists have pulled out of Field Day citing KKR’salleged links to Israel. (KKR has declined to comment on these allegations, referring the Guardian to Superstruct’s statement that after its acquisition it remains “independently run”. Field Day has put out a statement saying it “stands with the people of Gaza”.)The heart of this issue seems to be how cash-strapped councils are becoming increasingly beholden to commercial interests to the detriment of the public. A weekend festival that welcomes 50,000 people can expect to raise about £500,000 for local authorities. Councils argue that this money goes back in the public purse, allowing them to continue funding free community events such as Lambeth’s beloved Country Show, though there doesn’t seem to be much transparency over exactly how much cash is raised or where it is allocated.But when you strip away the jargon, what is essentially happening is the privatisation of local parks. As well as concerns about the long-term impact on ecology, campaigners point out this often takes place in boroughs where many don’t have access to private green space. In Lambeth, with its many flats, this counts for60% of households. Adding salt to the wound for residents is the lack of opportunity for public interjection. In the neighbouring borough of Southwark, the council conducts consultations for events proposed for local parks. Residents have their say, andrecently indicated their approvalfor a music festival in Southwark Park. No high court battles there.As for arguments about gentrifiers shutting down fun, they seem rather misplaced. The objectors are local people; the festivals are the interlopers, attracting tens of thousands of mostly young revellers who swoop in for the day (with daily ticket prices for the events starting from about £80), have their fun, then leave again. Complaints about such events may have once been the preserve of the nimby contingent, but the movement has grown in line with the increasing length and impact of the park takeovers.That’s not to say the festivals have no benefit. They provide secure summer work in an increasingly unstable industry. Small businesses – such as food trucks serving attenders – obviously do well out of them. And they are undoubtedly popular – there’s a reason big companies have snaffled up events such as Field Day and Mighty Hoopla. But the involvement of such corporations has kicked an existential threat into high gear.The ultimate issue is the way that private interests have managed to successfully position themselves as the gatekeepers of possibility. That cultural events can only happen if we sell off public space. That we can’t maintain local services without money from private equity. That we should just accept the routine privatisation of taxpayer-funded assets as the price of having a good time. Is this a model we want to entrench?London may be ground zero, but what is happening here is likely to be the bellwether for cities across the UK in the coming years. Very few want to see the festivals scrapped altogether. But a worrying precedent is being set. One long-term Brixton resident, himself a dedicated organiser of parties, reluctantly conceded to me recently: “I’d welcome smaller, better-managed events that don’t disrupt access or damage the park and that benefit the borough. But this current situation has become unbearable.”Moya Lothian-McLean is associate editor at Mill MediaExplore more on these topicsParks and green spacesOpinionMusic festivalsFestivalsLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

She’s completely adored everywhere she goes, and I adore her as well. I fell for her when she was Charlene in Neighbours – I was a student studying drama in the 80s and the only drama that any of us cared about was Neighbours. Australian girls were the pin-ups for everybody in England.There was a studio in the UK called London Studios where we filmedQIfor years until it closed down. There was a picture outside my dressing room of Kylie Minogue singing to Kermit the Frog. She looked so exquisitely beautiful, and Kermit, of course, is very cute as well. After a wrap party, I’d had a few wines so I tried to get it off the wall to take it home. It was so screwed on that all I did was crack the glass and cut my finger. I was like, “Oh my God, what am I doing?” There was almost certainly CCTV in that corridor. And blood splattered on the picture.Jeanette Winterson: ‘I’d like to go up in space as a very old lady and just be pushed out’Read moreI am very enamoured of Kylie Minogue. Subsequently to the picture incident, I actually ordered a Kylie wristwatch. There is a picture of her on the face of the watch, which presumably is lifesize because she is a very, very small lady.You are about to tour Australia for the first time in a decade. After all your visits, is there anythingyou still don’t quite understand aboutit?The antipathy towards New Zealand! It’s so extraordinary. The hostility is off the scale. New Zealand’s beauty doesn’t take away from the extraordinary natural beauty of Australia. You’ve got fantastic marsupials. There’s no denying it. Why do you guys hate each other? But it’s the same if you go to Devon and Cornwall. These are two of the most beautiful counties in Britain – and they detest one another! The thing that kills people who live in Cornwall is that you have to go through Devon to get to it.What is your most controversial pop culture opinion?Will Ferrell should have won an Oscar for Blades of Glory. They never give it to a comedian, do they? In that film you cannot take your eyes off him. It’s an astonishing performance. There’s one bit where he’s got no shirt on – I love him because, like a normal person, he hasn’t been to the gym. He’s just a regular bloke with three terrible tattoos. He turns around and says to someone, “Checking out my ink?” It just makes me laugh so much. I also think he should have won an Oscar for Elf: “You’re sitting on a throne of lies!”Where is the weirdest place you’ve been recognised?There is always a urinal involved. I was at a festival where they had these urinals in the gents where you all face one another – so you’re obscured from the waist down, but you end up looking people in the eye while you’re trying. There is nothing that stops the flow quicker than someone staring you in the face. Anyway, someone started shouting, “Oh, it’s him. It’s him. It’s that bloke. You’re not funny. You’re the one with the lisp on that show.” You know, loads of abuse. I’m standing there thinking, can you all just shut up for five seconds so I can wee? Eventually I left without peeing.Me and the kids absolutely love The Mandalorian – looking back now, that’s the moment to be a Mandalorian, in your helmet. No one would ever be rude to a Mandalorian. He’d wipe the floor with you, while he’s having a wee.Do you ever get calledJonathan Creek?Oh God, yeah. “Jonathaaan!” I’ve also been called Jonathan Ross. Wrong Jonathan – and I’m not even Jonathan! Nowadays people think I’mJames Mayfrom Top Gear. I get that a lot. I was on a train and I saw a kid coming up from about three carriages away, looking at me the whole way. He stood right in front of me and said, “Oh no, that’s not James May.” And he turned around and went away!Once, when I was a teenager, someone – very generously – compared me to James Dean. I don’t look like James Dean, obviously, but I liked the comparison! But to go from James Dean to James May is a terrible, crashing descent. No disrespect to James May, but he’s not James Dean. Also, James Dean died in a car crash and James May has been driving like a lunatic for 30 years. Life is unfair.View image in fullscreenCaroline Quentin and Alan Davies in Jonathan Creek in 1996.Photograph: Larry Ellis Collection/Getty ImagesWhat is the best piece of advice you havereceived?“Enjoy yourself.” It was said to me by a Canadian comedian called Mike Wilmot, who is a gnarled and grizzly old guy and a very funny, quite dark comedian. I was coming back to standup in 2011 after 10 years away. I’d become very recognisable from television and I missed standup, but comedy clubs were sometimes very tricky for me. It upset me, because it’s the thing I love to do the most. So I got some stuff together and went to try some new material at a night in London. I was waiting to go on and I was obviously giving off trepidation and fear, so Mike Wilmot came up to me and said,[gravelly voice]“Hey. Enjoy yourself up there.” Honestly, I remember that before every single gig I do now.Do you get hecklers?Not really. I actually try to encourage it because, when you’re touring, you want to find out a little bit about the place you’re in. I remember doing a show in Blackburn in Lancashire. I said, “What’s Blackburn like? What’s the absolute shithole of the area?” And they all went, “Burnley!” TheyhatedBurnley, which is about 20 miles away. So I went, “Is anyone in from Burnley?” And a load of people went, [cheerfully] “Yeah!” The people from Burnley said they refer to Blackburn as just “Bastard” – they won’t even say the name of the town!I like a bit of interaction with the audience. The best heckle I ever had was when I was younger. I used to wear these lime-green moleskin trousers and someone shouted, “Are you colour blind?” The audience all laughed and it took me a couple of minutes to get them back. If you really want to upset a comedian, heckle them about their appearance.What has been your most cringeworthy run-in with a celebrity?I was lucky enough to meet and work with Bob Monkhouse, the famous comedian and TV host. When he met new people, he would put his hand out with a big smile on his face, and he’d say,[reassuringly]“Bob Monkhouse.” Which I think just put people at ease, because everyone knew it was Bob Monkhouse. So I thought, “Oh, that’s really good, I’m going to do that.”So one time I metKriss Akabusi, who was this Olympic medallist who has a very effervescent personality – he was popular and had a television career after his hurdling career ended. When I met him, I put out my hand, and I said,[reassuringly]“Alan Davies.” And he said, “Nice to meet you, Dave.”He had no idea who I was. I’m not Bob Monkhouse. Some people know who I am. Some people think I’m called Jonathan. But Kriss Akabusi had no idea who I was and to this day I cringe about it. Why did I do it? I’d be better off saying, “Bob Monkhouse.” He’s such a nice bloke, Kriss Akabusi, but he thinks I’m called Dave to this day – we never met again.Alan Davies: ‘I didn’t want my shack of feelings blown down’Read moreAre you able to wheel out facts you learned from being on QI?I only have one fact that has stayed in my brain, because I can’t remember anything. Multiple times on the show I’ve said, “I don’t know how I know this but … ” and they go,“You know this because we did it in series G!!!”This is the fact: when the Vikings left Scandinavia in their longboats and went looking for land, they took ravens with them. They would release a raven and it would fly incredibly high – and, if it saw land, it would fly towards it. So you follow the raven, right? If it doesn’t see land, it comes back to the boat because they can’t land on water. That’s the only fact I can remember and I’ve been doing QI for 23 years.What is the strangest thing you’ve done for love?Katie, my now wife, and I were in Germany. We’d been on a boat on Lake Starnberg, which is south of Munich. Beautiful place, you can see the mountains of Austria and so on. But we couldn’t see anything that day because there was an absolutely terrifying electrical storm. We thought we were all going to die. So we got off the boat at this little place called Tutzing. There was a guy who ran a kiosk on the jetty there and it was really raining, so we’re hiding under his awning and he said[in a German accent]“You want a beer?” So we did. Then he went “You want some snuff?” I’ve never had snuff in my life but I said OK. So he gave me this menthol snuff – it was like chewing gum for the brain! And about two minutes later I proposed to Katie. So the strangest thing I’ve done which resulted in love was snuff. We’ve been married for 18 years – worked out all right.Alan Davies is touring his new show Think Aheadacross Australia in November and DecemberExplore more on these topicsAlan Davies10 Chaotic QuestionsKylie MinogueWill FerrellJonathan CreekJames MayComedyQIfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Was he aware, the worker asked, about the problems with carer’s allowance?Devereux, on a flying visit to the DWP outpost, asked for details and promised to look into it. A few days later, Devereux’s office received a long and detailed note, complete with 80 anonymised case studies, setting out how years of shortcomings in the administration of the carer’s allowance benefit had wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money and inflicted untold hardship and misery onthousands of unpaid carers.Enrico La Rocca, a civil servant based in Preston’s carer’s allowance unit, wrote in the memo: “I have raised this issue many times with management up to directorate level and I have been consistently disappointed and depressed by the lack of will to improve things. I hope you will be able to put this right.”La Rocca’s warnings, shared with his union, centred on the issue of carer’s allowance overpayments. The benefit is paid to about 1 million unpaid carers – people who carry out the arduous and demanding task of providing round-the-clock care for frail, sick or disabled loved ones. It is the UK’s lowest-value benefit, worth £83.30 a week.Those who claim it are allowed to work part-time but there is a strict limit on how much they can earn: if they earn a single penny over that limit – £196 a week – their entire benefit is considered to be an overpayment, a debt that is then owed to the DWP.This so-called “cliff edge” means a carer who earned £1 more than the threshold for 52 weeks would pay back not £52 but £4,258.80. The effect had created a debt trap, and La Rocca could see thousands of people falling into it.La Rocca, a carer’s allowance specialist with two decades of service under his belt, had become increasingly alarmed, but his attempt to raise the alarm in the Preston car park was not the gamechanging intervention he hoped it would be.Instead, it would be the first in a series of spurned opportunities to put things right. What followed was agroundhog day sequenceof DWP complacency, inertia and cover-ups.The DWP would deny there were problems; when the problems became no longer deniable, it would typically insist carers themselves were at fault and promise that new technology would ride to the rescue. There would be no apologies. Little would change. The injustices borne by carers, meanwhile, would rumble inexorably on.By the time aGuardian investigationexposed the scale of the scandal last year, the cost of that failure to put things right eight years previously had become vividly real: hundreds of thousands more carers caught in a web of avoidable misery and debt over minor rules breaches, thousands more prosecuted for fraud, and hundreds of millions more pounds of taxpayers’ money wasted.The invisible world of unpaid carers would leap on to the front pages of national media, become a staple of daytime TV and a political talking point. It would be regarded as a social policy disaster. And, as a result of the way it pitted a vast and ruthless bureaucracy against powerless and vulnerable carers, it would be routinelycompared tothe Post Office scandal.Criminalising careLast year, Vivienne Groom, then 59, wept as she stood in the dock at a court in Chester. A shy, quiet woman with an unblemished criminal record and without even a parking ticket to her name, she had been convicted of benefit fraud and handed a 12-month community order.She was told the £16,000 inheritance left to her by her late mother, to whom she had provided full-time unpaid care for years, would be confiscated by the state. To do so, the government was using the proceeds of crime laws – legislation designed to seize the ill-gotten mansions and speedboats of gangsters and drug smugglers.Groom’s crime was to have earned marginally more in her part-time job in a Co-op store than was allowed under strict carer’s allowance benefit rules. For five years while caring full-time for her elderly mother, who had had a stroke, she supplemented her meagre carer’s allowance – then £60 a week – by working 16 hours a week for the minimum wage.View image in fullscreenVivienne Groom cared for her elderly mother after she had had a stroke and supplemented the £60 a week carer’s allowance with a part-time job at Co-op.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAt a hearing the previous November, the judge seemed to accept Groom’s claim that she had made an “honest mistake”. As Groom had admitted guilt, the judge had little option but to convict her, but he made it clear he would not send her to prison – despite benefit compliance officers having told her she faced up to seven years in jail. There were a “wealth of mitigating factors” in her favour, the judge pointed out, and no aggravating ones. “You were doing the best for your mother,” he declared.Although Groom said she did not know she was breaching carer’s allowance earnings rules, the DWP did – or at least it should have known. Over the five years during which she received carer’s allowance, the Guardian estimates the DWP would have received between 15 and 50 electronic alerts warning that Groom had breached earnings limits.Had civil servants checked the alerts at the beginning of her claim in late 2014 they could have telephoned her, warned her of the infraction and cancelled the benefit. The amount she would have had to repay would have been nearer £1,500, way below the £5,000 threshold for criminal prosecution, and a tiny fraction of the £17,000 she was eventually forced to repay. Had the alerts been checked, Groom’s inheritance and her reputation would have remained intact.Instead, the data highlighting Groom’s inadvertent earnings infringements were repeatedly missed by the DWP. She was not an unusual case in this regard. According to the National Audit Office, around this time just under 12% of the 3,000 earnings alerts arriving at the department’s carer’s allowance section each month were being checked.That its own administrative shortcomings were in part responsible for the overpayment seems not to have crossed the DWP’s mind when it referred her case to the Crown Prosecution Service. Vivienne’s husband, Geoff, summed up the bitter disbelief and injustice felt by many unpaid carers about their treatment: “Viv is being punished now for looking after her mum,” hetold the Guardianwhen the ruling was handed down last year. “The DWP are the criminals here. This can’t be right.”The cliff edgeThe Guardian has seen evidence of scores of similar examples of “cliff-edge” cases, where minor earnings breaches resulted in life-changing debt. In one case a Lancashire school dinner lady was allowed to accrue overpayments over a five-year period from 2013. Her earnings never exceeded the limit by more than £14.52 in any week; in some periods she overstepped the weekly threshold by just 29p. During the entire period she earned just £1,900 more than she was allowed. Under the “cliff-edge” rules she was forced to repay £14,000.But it was not just the cliff edge itself that created such a huge overpayment. For years the DWP has received regular electronic alerts from HMRC warning it if a carer has potentially earned more than the weekly carer’s allowance earnings limit. In theory, by hiring enough staff to check the alerts and act on them speedily, it could identify and eliminate overpayments within days. But as Groom found to her cost, it appeared reluctant to do so.The real-life consequence of this underpowered data-matching policy was to push carers who worked part-time around the edges of the earnings limit into a random high-stakes lottery: a breach of the limit might be spotted by DWP straight away, it might rumble on for years before finally being detected, or it might never be spotted at all. A carer who fell foul of the earnings rules might randomly end up repaying nothing, £70 or £17,000.La Rocca’s February 2016 memo to Devereux highlighted this. “Because of the limits CAU (Carer’s Allowance Unit) have put on data-matching in recent years, overpayments that we could have picked up after less than a year have been allowed to extend to two or three years or even longer,” he wrote. It was “routine” to identify earnings-related overpayments of £5,000 or more, he added. He’d even seen one for £24,000.Five months later one of La Rocca’s managers replied to the memo. The issues he raised had been investigated. They grudgingly admitted that administrative failures had indeed occurred, but said an action plan was now in place – “the overarching control environment will be enhanced”, the jargon-heavy email promised.No thanks were offered to La Rocca for bringing the failures to light. Clouded in management-speak as it was, the message was crystal clear: La Rocca should lay off now; the problem was sorted and the case closed.Meanwhile, a stream of avoidable overpayments continued to flow across La Rocca’s desk. He wrote to the DWP’s financial controller in March 2017 to warn that little seemed to have changed, but he was rebuffed. Everything was in hand, he was assured, and there would be no “further correspondence” on the matter.Increasingly frustrated, he wrote to Devereaux’s successor as DWP permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, a year later in August 2018. What horrified La Rocca was not just that the DWP had allowed thousands of carers to build up massive overpayment debts, but the department was preparing to prosecute hundreds of carers for benefit fraud.“I cannot see how the department can justify instigating a fraud drive on these cases … when [the] DWP is at least partially responsible for allowing their overpayments to continue unchecked,” he wrote. He added, again with eerie prescience: “I would not be surprised if part of the true picture of the unfortunate circumstances behind these cases emerged at some point and the department would inevitably be seen in a bad light.”La Rocca did not get a reply until November 2018. A senior DWP director, writing on behalf of Schofield, refused to accept there was much wrong with carer’s allowance compliance work. The onus was on carers, not the DWP, to report “changes in circumstances” such as earning over the limit, regardless of whether they knew that had done so.Besides, they added, in what was clearly intended to be a clincher, the department’s earnings compliance technology was being upgraded as part of a drive to prevent overpayments.Audits, alerts and more missed warningsLa Rocca felt his concerns were again being swept under the carpet. However, unpaid carers were about to get a very public champion. Frank Field, a veteran Labour MP and the respected chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee, had got wind of the issue.Field had begun to extract carer’s allowance data from the DWP, What he uncovered profoundly shocked him. Not only were tens of thousands of claimants running up carer’s allowance debts, but the amounts were huge.In 2016, when La Rocca first raised the issue with DWP top brass, the largest overpayment debt was £47,800; the following year it was £42,000. In 2018, Field discovered a claimant had been hit with a £48,500 bill, a breach that had clearly gone undetected by the DWP for many years.The massive financial risks triggered by the carer’s allowance trap were being unfairly placed on unpaid carers, Field realised. He wrote to the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, demanding an urgent investigation. “It is deeply concerning that the department has allowed claimants to accrue such eye-wateringly large overpayments,” he said. “More than just an oversight, these figures suggest that systematic failings or gross incompetence – or a combination of the two – are at play.”He went on: “It is carers who will bear the brunt of these failings as the department seeks to claw back the money from people who can ill afford to lose it.”Field launched a work and pensions select committee investigation into carer’s allowance. Its conclusions, published in early August 2019, were devastating: the design of the benefit in effect “set carers up for a fall”. Years of complacency and under-resourcing had allowed overpayments to “spiral out of control”, not least because of the DWP’s reluctance to properly check earnings alerts.It said carers had been heavily penalised for making “honest mistakes”. The committee was furious that Schofield, who had appeared before MPs two months earlier, had refused three times to apologise for the mess. The inquiry set out no fewer than 19 recommendations for change. The DWP, it concluded angrily, had “stuck its head in the sand and done nothing”.If at this point there was political pressure to fix carer’s allowance – and the DWP had promised MPs it would do so – it was not to last. Within months, in December 2019, a general election was held. The committee was disbanded and Field and other key MPs lost their seats. Three months later, Britain was in Covid lockdown. The righteous head of steam building around carer’s allowance disappeared.What did not disappear was the broken benefit that was quietly continuing to ruin lives, and the fundamental flaw that with every passing week was tipping more carers into debt and potential criminality.‘Never again’In April 2024 the Guardian revealed that tens of thousands of unpaid carers were still inadvertently running up massive overpayments each year, hundreds of whom had been prosecuted for fraud. Scores of carers contacted us, each with vivid and harrowing tales to tell. Many were angry that the same politicians who glibly praised them as “unsung heroes” were happy to oversee a brutal system that was seeminglyquick to label them as fraudsters.The scandal of a minor benefit administered in a cruel and unfair manner had become an issue for daytime TV and late-night political debate. Emboldened, carers began to fight overpayment decisions in tribunals –and win. But despite broader awareness, families were still being caught out.In January this year, Guy and Oksana Shahar, a couple who cared for their autistic son, Daniel, 15, received a letter from the DWP. “Important,” it read in bold type. “You have been paid more carer’s allowance than you are entitled to. You now need to pay this money back”.The sum being demanded by the government was staggering: £10,180.45.View image in fullscreenGuy and Oksana Shahar and their son Daniel. Oksana juggled her caring duties with two part-time roles.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianOksana, a dinner lady who had a zero-hours contract to do shop work in Sports Direct, was certain this could not be an earnings breach related to carer’s allowance. As a carer, she had followed the unfolding scandal carefully and thought she was safe from its pitfalls. But when the letter from the DWP arrived, she realised the fine margins by which a carer could be ensnared in the debt trap.Oksana had overstepped the earnings limit by an average of £1.92 a week over a five-year period. In some weeks she was paid just 38p more than the threshold – but for that tiny infraction she is being forced to repay £64.60 each time, the rate of carer’s allowance at the time.The debt, Guy said, would “devastate us financially”.Almost 10 years on from La Rocca’s warning to Devereux in the Preston car park, the letters are still being sent and carers every week are unknowingly falling into debt. So far 600 have been convicted in court and legal action against more is continuing.In April last year, Keir Starmer – soon to become prime minister – was asked about Groom’s case on a visit to the north-west of England. “Something has gone very wrong here,” he replied. “We cannot allow that to happen again.” In October, Liz Kendall, Starmer’s work and pensions secretary, vowed to “put things right”, and in December the Labour government announced an independent review of carer’s allowance overpayments and promised a“new settlement”.The Labour government has introduced some early changes to reduce overpayments being created by extending the earnings limit and promising to fully investigate100% of earnings alerts.A DWP spokesperson said: “We understand the huge difference carers make, as well as the struggles so many face. The carer’s allowance overpayment rate is now the lowest on record and we are increasing funding and bringing in more staff to check 100% of alerts to help prevent carers falling into debt.“But we want to go further. That’s why we’ve launched an independent review of carer’s allowance, to explore how earnings-related overpayments have happened and what changes can be made.”But for carers with debts to pay, and for those who may yet still fall into the carer’s allowance debt, the promises of politicians have not left them any less vulnerable. Groom, who took care of her elderly mother until her dying breath, remains a convicted criminal, and her life inheritance now belongs to the state.Thecarer’s allowance scandal– because of which 144,000 carers are repaying more than £251m – continues to claim victims and will do so for the immediate future as the DWP works its way through thousands of backlogged overpayments.The injustices and cruelty of the system may be with us for some time. The Shahars are appealing against the overpayment demand. “It just seems so unfair that it’s not even real,” said Guy, words that would undoubtedly echoed by hundreds of thousands of other carers. “In any sort of ethical world, this would not happen.”"

No sir. Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, the Tennessee lawmaker explained that he is a red-blooded American male who does not “drink out of a straw” because “that’s what the women in my house do”. And no self-respecting man wants to be like the women in their house, do they? Yuck.Why did Burchett feel the need to tell us all what he likes to put in his mouth? Because the Fox News hostJesse Wattershas some very strange ideas about masculinity and, back in March, came up with “rules for men”. These include: don’t drink soup in public, don’t cross your legs, don’t drink from a straw (it makes your lips purse in an “effeminate” manner), don’t drink milkshakes and “don’t wave simultaneously with two hands”.The Fox News host is so proud of these rules that he now has his producer running around Washington DC asking lawmakers their thoughts on Watters’ guide to masculinity. Burchett, as we’ve seen, is fully on board. So is the Missouri senator Josh Hawley, who has written abook called Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs.Meanwhile, in a stunning example of ClickHole’s “The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point”meme, Ted Cruz seemed a little more dubious. “Jesse Watters has rules for men,” Watters’ producer told Cruz. “He said men should not have male best friends. What do you think?” Cruz replied: “Jesse needs a friend.” I think he needs a lot more than that.The livestreamed killing of an influencer could be femicide – a misunderstood crisis | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWatters has said his rules for men are just a bit of fun. But it all starts to become a little less funny when you look at the massive impact Fox has on the US, and how influential Watters himself is.More than 4 million peopletune into Watters’ primetime show and the man is constantly reinforcing toxic ideas about gender. Watters, for example, has suggested that he doesn’t really think fathers are responsible forraising their daughters. “When you raise a son, you are responsible for that son,” Watters said last year. “It’s not like raising a daughter, it’s different.” He’s also denigrated fathers wholeave work earlyto spend time with their children.Watters, who is on his second marriage, to a much younger woman who was anassociate producer on his showat Fox News, also has some very disturbing ideas about how to approach women. Want to know how he courted his second wife? He’sboasted on TVthat he let the air out of her car tires. “She couldn’t go anywhere. She needed a lift. I said: ‘Hey, you need a lift?’ She hopped right in the car,”Watters laughed. (He laterclaimed it was a joke.) By the way, Watters was still married at the time. Fox News likes to style itself as a paragon of family values, but these are the values it promotes.Again: Watters isn’t just some kook with a niche show. A large body ofresearchshows that Fox NewsshapesAmerican politics. There is a direct line between the misogyny and rigid gender roles amplified on Fox News and laws that treat women as nothing more than incubators and walking wombs. There’s a direct line between the sort of attitude towards women that Watters espouses and the fact that abrain dead womanin Georgia is being kept alive to carry out her pregnancy because of the state’s abortion ban. Watters may say his rules for men are just a bit of fun, but his viewers are gulping it all down. Obviously without a straw.Pregnant news anchor stays on air during laborIt’s funny how Watters seems to think “effeminate” is a slur when you’ve got women like the local news co-anchor Olivia Jaquithcalmly delivering her newscasteven after her labor contractions began. “I’m happy to be here and I’ll stay on the desk for as long as I possibly can,” Jaquith said. “But if I disappear, that’s what’s going on.”Number of US white nationalist groups falls as their views go mainstreamA newreportby the Southern Poverty Law Center found a 5% drop in hate and extremist groups in 2024.The Guardian reportsthat this “can be attributed to the fact that many feel a lesser sense of urgency to organize, because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education and society in general”.‘World-first’ gonorrhoea vaccine to be rolled out in England and WalesIt’s been described as a “landmark moment for sexual health”.Famous men’s toxic fandoms have become a tool for punishing womenSocial media has given Darvo (the “deny, attack, reverse victim and offender” manipulation tactic used by abusers) a whole new dimension,writes the Guardian’s Tayo Bero. “[P]owerful people now have an army of rabid fans ready to do that work for them.”New clinical guidance calls for pain relief during IUD insertionTikTok may haveplayed a rolein this:over the last few years, women have been recording the experience of getting an intrauterine device, sharing it online and discussing how their pain is taken seriously by doctors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Facial ID quietly becoming part of police’s arsenalDaniel BoffeyandMark WildingSat 24 May 2025 12.41 EDTFirst published on Sat 24 May 2025 12.00 EDTSharePolice believe live facial recognition cameras may become “commonplace” inEnglandand Wales, according to internal documents, with the number of faces scanned having doubled to nearly 5m in the last year.A joint investigation by the Guardian andLiberty Investigateshighlights the speed at which the technology is becoming a staple of British policing.Major funding is being allocated and hardware bought, while the British state is also looking to enable police forces to more easily access the full spread of its image stores, including passport and immigration databases, for retrospective facial recognition searches.Live facial recognition involves the matching of faces caught on surveillance camera footage against a police watchlist in real time, in what campaigners liken to the continual finger printing of members of the public as they go about their daily lives.Retrospective facial recognition software is used by the police to match images on databases with those caught on CCTV and other systems.According to one funding document drawn up by SouthWalespolice as part of a proposal to put the West End of London or Cardiff rail station under live facial recognition cameras and released by the Metropolitan police under the Freedom of Information Act, it is believed “the use of this technology could become commonplace in our city centres and transport hubs around England and Wales”.The first fixed live facial recognition cameras will be fitted for a trial in Croydon, south London, later this summer.The expansion comes despite facial recognition failing to be referenced in any act of parliament.Campaigners claim the police have been allowed to “self regulate” their use of the technology. Officers have in the past used a setting that was subsequently shown to disproportionately misidentify black people.After a court of appeal judgment in 2020, which found that South Wales police’suse of live facial recognition camerashad been unlawful, the College of Policing provided guidance that “the threshold needs to be set with care to maximise the probability of returning true alerts while keeping the false alert rate to an acceptable level”.There remains nothing in law to direct forces on the threshold or technology used.The policing minister, Diane Johnson, told parliament earlier this month that she recognised “a need to consider whether a bespoke legislative framework governing the use of live facial recognition technology for law enforcement purposes is needed” but the Home Office is yet to provide details.Facial recognition cameras were firsttrialled in Londonand south Wales from 2016 but the speed at which police forces are rolling out the technology has accelerated over the last 12 months.The investigation by the Guardian and Liberty found:Police forces scanned nearly 4.7m faces with live facial recognition cameras last year – more than twice as many as in 2023. Live facial recognition vans were deployed at least 256 times in 2024, according to official deployment records, up from 63 the year before.A roving unit of 10 live facial recognition vans that can be sent anywhere in the country will be made available within days – increasing national capacity. Eight police forces have deployed the technology. The Met has four vans.Police forces have considered fixed infrastructure creating a “zone of safety” by covering the West End of London with a network of live facial recognition cameras. Met officials said this remained a possibility.Forces almost doubled the number of retrospective facial recognition searches made last year using the police national database (PND) from 138,720 in 2023 to 252,798. The PND contains custody mug shots, millions of which have beenfound to be stored unlawfullyof people who have never been charged with or convicted of an offence.More than 1,000 facial recognition searches using the UK passport database were carried out in the last two years, and officers are increasingly searching for matches on the Home Office immigration database, with requests up last year, to 110. Officials have concluded that using the passport database for facial recognition is “not high risk” and “is not controversial”, according to internal documents.The Home Office is now working with the police to establish a new national facial recognition system, known as strategic facial matcher. The platform will be capable of searching a range of databases including custody images and immigration records.Lindsey Chiswick, the director of intelligence at the Met and the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council lead on facial recognition, said surveys showed that four in five Londoners were in support of the police using innovative technology, including facial recognition cameras.This week, a registered sex offender, David Cheneler, 73, from Lewisham, wasjailed for two yearsafter he was caught alone with a six-year-old girl by a live facial recognition camera. He had previously served nine years for 21 offences against children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So policing needs to start operating a little bit differently. People talk about harnessing AI like it’s some crazy horse we want to saddle but we do need to harness the opportunities that technology and data can bring us.”Chiswick said the Met’s policy was to take “really quite small steps and review them at every stage” but that there would be a “benefit in potentially some sort of framework or statutory guidance”.The Met is deploying its facial recognition cameras at a setting that testing suggests avoids any statistical significance in terms of gender or ethnicity bias when it comes to cases of misidentification.Chiswick said: “I don’t want to use a biased algorithm in London. There’s no point on all counts. I think for government, there’s a question, isn’t there around artificial intelligence? And I think clearly the public sector is going to use, and want to use AI more and more.“I think the questions around who then decides where algorithms are purchased from, what training data is used, what countries might this technology come from and then, when you use it, are you obliged to test it and if you’re obliged to test it, are you then obliged to operate at a certain setting? That’s not really questions for law enforcement.”The Home Office declined a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionSurveillancePoliceUK civil libertiesCrimeEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Those who repeatedly fail to build or sit on land could be fined with a “delayed homes penalty” or blocked from future planning permission by councils.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, said the government had taken “radical steps to overhaul the planning system to get Britain building again after years of inaction.“In the name of delivering security for working people, we are backing the builders not the blockers. Now it’s time for developers to roll up their sleeves and play their part.“We’re going even further to get the homes we need. No more sites with planning permission gathering dust for decades while a generation struggle to get on the housing ladder.”The plans, which form part of a government working paper onspeeding up housebuilding, would apply to developments of 50 or more homes.The prospective fines would be based on lost council tax revenue and could be imposed by councils on developers who fall at least 10% behind schedule without good reason. As a result, a developer who is failing to build 50 homes that would each raise £1,500 in annual council tax could face a £75,000 fine. This change would require new legislation and would only apply to future planning permissions.Ministers will also test a new requirement for developments with more than 2,000 homes to include a mix of affordable and commercially sold housing by default, on the basis that this could lead to faster construction.The government hasintroduced legislation to speed up planning decisionsand boost housebuilding by removing avenues for legal challenges and reforming the compulsory purchase order process.View image in fullscreenThe OBR recently estimated that housebuilding in the UK would rise to its highest level in 40 years.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PALabour committed in its manifesto to deliver 1.5m homes during this parliament, which ministers have admitted is a challenging target. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated this spring that housebuilding would rise to its highest level in 40 years and contribute to the UK’s economic growth.The government has committed£2bn for 18,000 new social and affordable homes, £1.29bn for the warm homes social housing fund, £800m in top-ups to the current affordable homes programme, and £2bn for regeneration projects that the government says will add to the total number of available homes. A further £600m will deliver training for new construction jobs.The Telegraph reported on Friday that Rayner is pushing for further investment in social housing as part ofnext month’s spending review, which will set departmental budgets for several years.Rayner has spoken about her belief in the need for more social housing. She told a conference in November that she wanted to remove the “shackles of stigma” that is too often associated with social housing.“This is personal for me,” Rayner said. “Because I know that a secure, affordable home is not a luxury or simply nice to have. It’s the foundation on which everything else is built. When I was growing up, we didn’t have a lot, but we had a safe and secure council home. And later, when I needed a home to raise my son, I was given my own council home. I haven’t got to where I am today in spite of coming from a council house, but because of it.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyHousingAngela RaynerHousing marketCommunitiesLabourReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

The convictions were overturned by parliament last year.Many are still awaiting damages despite the previous government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts.Bates has also accused the Department for Business and Trade, which administers the compensation schemes, of reneging on assurances given when they were set up and told the Sunday Times a promise they would be “non-legalistic” had turned out to be “worthless”.He said he was given a final “take it or leave it” offer, which amounted to 49.2% of his original claim after appealing and being referred to the scheme’s independent reviewer, Sir Ross Cranston.The campaigner is now calling for the creation of an independent body that would administer compensation schemes for public sector scandals but cautioned: “I can already hear the sharpening of goose quills across Whitehall as the civil service prepares to snow politicians under with reasons it would not work.”He added: “The sub-postmaster compensation schemes have been turned into quasi-kangaroo courts in which the Department for Business and Trade sits in judgment of the claims and alters the goalposts as and when it chooses.“Claims are, and have been, knocked back on the basis that legally you would not be able to make them, or that the parameters of the scheme do not extend to certain items.”The group litigation order (GLO) scheme was set up to achieve redress for the 555 claimants who took thePost Officeto the high court between 2017 and 2019.Under the GLO, claimants can take a fixed sum of £75,000 or seek their own settlement.If there are disputes in individual cases, they are referred to an independent panel for review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anyone unhappy with their offer can have their case reviewed by a panel of experts, which is independent of the government.”Earlier this week, it emerged that hundreds of former post office operators will be compensated by the Post Office afterit accidentally leaked their names and addressesin June 2024.The Post Office said individual payouts will be capped at £5,000, although higher claims may still be pursued.Explore more on these topicsPost Office Horizon scandalPost OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

The eldest of the children was 12.Nasser hospital reported that one of Najjar’s children and her husband were injured but survived.Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital, told the BBC he had operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy.Groom said he had been told the father, who is also a doctor, had “no political and no military connections and doesn’t seem to be prominent on social media”.Footage shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry – and verified by the BBC – shows bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of the building near a petrol station in Khan Younis.The news was confirmed by the hospital in Khan Younis where Najjar works, according to the BBC. Her husband had just returned home after accompanying her to work when the building was struck by Israeli airstrikes.“Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us,’’ Youssef al-Najjar, a relative, told Agence France-Presse. “We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!”View image in fullscreenAlaa al-Najjar visits her injured husband in the intensive care unit.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMohammed Saqer, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told the Guardian: “Dr Alaa al-Najjar watched with her own eyes as the charred bodies of her seven children were pulled from beneath the rubble – while two remain missing – all while she was on duty at Nasser medical complex.“Harrowing details recounted by Ali al-Najjar paint one of the most heartbreaking tragedies to befall a paediatrician who dedicated her life to saving children, only to have her own motherhood stolen in a moment of fire and deafening silence.”It was later reported that nine children had died.Groom, who is volunteering at Nasser hospital, attended to al-Najjar’s surviving child, Adam.“The last patient on my list today was an 11-year-old boy who seemed much younger as we lifted him on to the operating table,” Groom told the Guardian.“His injuries were bad enough but the background, I think, was worse. His father was very badly injured but nine of his brothers and sisters were killed.”“It is unimaginable,” said Groom. “The father [al-Najjar’s husband] is a physician here at Nasser hospital. We’ve asked about him and he has no political or military connections … it is a particularly sad day.”Dr Victoria Rose, who is volunteering alongside Groom, received a video of the aftermath of the attack.“The video shows all of the children being pulled out of the fire and they are absolutely charcoaled to a crisp. It is so horrific,” she said.On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the Guardian: “Yesterday, an IDF aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis.“The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety. The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”Thee IDF said it had targeted more than 100 sites across the Gaza Strip over the course of the day, as it intensifies its military offensive despite aid agencies warning that the Palestinian population is plunging deeper intomalnutrition and famine.At least 79 people have been killed in Israeli strikes acrossGazain a 24-hour period, leading up to Saturday evening, the territory’s health minister said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise due to ongoing attacks.On Friday, 30 people and members of the Dardouna family were killed in airstrikes, including very young children. One of the photos – shared by newly awarded Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Mosab Abu Toha – shows the body of a girl less than a year old being pulled from the rubble, still wearing her pyjamas.Hamas described the airstrike on the home of Najjar as “a horrific massacre”, adding: “This heinous crime clearly expresses the sadistic nature of the occupation, and the level of the deep-rooted spirit of revenge that drives Netanyahu and his gang of murderers and human monsters.”Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupiedPalestinian territories, said the attack represented a “distinguishable sadistic pattern of the new phase of the genocide”.Israel may start allowing aid groups operating in Gaza to take charge of non-food assistance as pressure mounts to get more aid into the battered territory, according to a letter obtained by the Associated Press.The letter says food distribution would be left up to a newly established group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by the US and Israel but is not yet up and running. Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid but the United Nations and aid groups deny there is significant diversion.Israel had blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for nearly three months, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians. Experts have warned of a high risk of famine, and international criticism and outrage over Israel’s offensive has escalated.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was the voice of the man who would question me – sometimes for two hours, sometimes for eight hours.“And I would just hang on his voice all that time, fantasising about who this person was from his voice. And I had an intuition that someday this voice would be an aspect of something I’d write or shoot and give a creative life to.”After being presented with the Palme d’Or,Panahi thanked his family and collaborators, and said: “I think it’s the moment to ask everyone, all the Iranians with opinions different from others, in Iran and throughout the world … I’d like to ask them one thing: Put all the problems and differences aside. The most important thing is surely our country and the freedom of our country.”The victory means a remarkable sixth consecutive win for US studio Neon, following its triumphs for Anora, Anatomy of a Fall, Triangle of Sadness, Titane and Parasite – the first and last of which went on to sweep the board at the Oscars.Second prize – the Grand Prix – went to JoachimTrier’s domestic dramaSentimental Value, which stars Stellan Skarsgård as a tricky film-maker who attempts to reconcile with his daughter after years of estrangement by casting her in a new, highly personal film.The film is a reunion for Trier and Renate Reinsve, who starred in his 2021 hit, The Worst Person in the World.Meanwhile the jury – or third – prize was a tie between the Spanish director Oliver Laxe’s Sirat and the German director Mascha Schilinski’sSound of Falling. The director Hasan Hadi won the first film prize – the Camera d’Or – for The President’s Cake, the first award ever given to an Iraqi film in Cannes.Best actor honours went to Wagner Moura forThe Secret Agent, which also won the best director prize for Kleber Mendonça Filho, whileThe Little Sister’s star, Nadia Melliti, took best actress.The special prize was presented at the start of the ceremony by the jury president, Juliette Binoche, to the Chinese director Bi Gan for his trippy meditation on the death of the universe,Resurrection. The Dardennes brothers won best screenplay forThe Young Mother’s Home.‘I think of those I left behind in prison’: Iran’s Jafar Panahi on life as a banned film-makerRead moreBinoche’s majority female jury also included the Italian actor Alba Rohrwacher, the Indian director Payal Kapadia, the French-Moroccan writer Leïla Slimani, the American actors Halle Berry and Jeremy Strong, the South Korean film-maker Hong Sang-soo, the Mexican director Carlos Reygadas and the Congolese film-maker Dieudo Hamadi.Binoche saidthat It Was Just an Accident “really stood out”. She added: “It’s very human and political at the same time because he comes from a complicated country, politically speaking … The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today. So we thought it was important to give this film the paramount award.”The festival was marked by real-world drama, from the sentencing of one of its former lions, Gerard Depardieu, on sexual assault charges on the first day of the festival, to almost-daily diatribes against Donald Trump’s movie tariffs plan by film-makers including Wes Anderson, Robert De Niro and Richard Linklater.The festival also featured a controversial galahonouring Kevin Spacey, a delegateinjured by a falling palm tree, and thebanning from the red carpetof an actor accused of rape.On the final day, a power cut believed by many to be sabotage hit the festival headquarters for five hours; the closing ceremony proceeded regardless thanks to backup generators.Competition awardsPalme d’OrJafar Panahi, It Was Just an AccidentGrand PrixJoachim Trier, Sentimental ValueBest directorKleber Mendonça Filho, The Secret AgentBest actorWagner Moura, The Secret AgentBest actressNadia Melliti, Little SisterJury prizeSirat, Oliver Laxe and Sound of Falling, Mascha SchilinskiSpecial award (Prix spécial)Resurrection, Bi GanBest ScreenplayFourOther prizesCamera d’OrThe President’s Cake, Hasan HadiCamera d’Or special mentionMy Father’s Shadow, Akinola Davies Jr.Short film Palme d’OrI’m Glad You’re Dead Now, Tawfeek BarhomShort film special mentionAli, Adnan Al RajeevGolden Eye documentary prizeImago, Déni Oumar PitsaevGolden Eye special jury prizeThe Six Billion Dollar Man, Eugene JareckiQueer PalmLittle Sister, Hafsia HerziPalme DogPanda, The Love That RemainsFipresci award (competition)The Secret Agent, Kleber Mendonça FilhoFipresci award (Un Certain Regard)Urchin, Harris DickinsonFipresci award (parallel sections)Dandelion’s Odyssey, Momoko SetoUn Certain RegardUn Certain Regard awardThe Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo, Diego CéspedesJury prizeA Poet, Simón Mesa SotoBest directorTarzan and Arab Nasser, Once Upon a Time in GazaBest performanceCléo Diara, I Only Rest in the Storm; Frank Dillane, UrchinBest screenplayHarry Lighton, PillionSpecial mentionNorah, Tawfik AlzaidiDirectors’ FortnightEuropa Cinemas Label awardWild Foxes, Valéry CarnoySociety of Dramatic Authors and Composers prizeWild Foxes, Valéry CarnoyAudience Choice awardThe President’s Cake, Hasan HadiCritics’ WeekGrand prizeA Useful Ghost, Ratchapoom BoonbunchachokeFrench Touch prizeImago, Déni Oumar PitsaevGAN Foundation award for distributionLe Pacte, Left-Handed GirlLouis Roederer Foundation Rising Star awardThéodore Pellerin, NinoLeitz Cine Discovery Prize (short film)L’mina, Randa MaroufiSociety of Dramatic Authors and Composers prizeGuillermo Galoe and Victor Alonso-Berbel, Sleepless CityCanal+ short film awardErogenesis, Xandra PopescuExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalFestivalsJafar PanahinewsShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, that’s all now been resolved a year ago. But here we are, had it not been for that random visit to my local GP, I would never have known that I was at that point carrying prostate cancer, and if it had not been seen to, it could have been a very different ending and a very different outcome to my life.“The reason I’m very happy to talk about it is because if there’s one man out there over the age of 45 go and see your GP. Go and get the blood test done.”Earlier this year, prostate cancer became the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in England, surpassing breast cancer for two consecutive years. In 2023 there were 55,033 prostate cancer diagnoses.On Sunday, the former US presidentJoe Biden was diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancerthat has spread to his bones.Sharkey urged men to get a blood test for the disease, which can be treated easily in its early stages. “Now, for one in eight of you, you will be put in the same journey I’ve had and it’s quite astonishing to think that in this country right now, one in eight men have prostate cancer,” he said. “Most of them don’t even know it. So go and have the blood test and if you’re lucky, you’ll walk away.”He also expressed his “admiration” for the six-time Olympic gold medallistChris Hoy, who disclosed in October he has “two to four years” left to liveafter being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer which had metastasised from his prostate.“I have such unbelievable admiration for Chris Hoy over the last couple of months. If you end up where Chris is, well you’re now looking for a very different outcome and not the one you were expecting for your life, my friend. So, for a blood test – go get it done right now.”Explore more on these topicsMen's healthFeargal SharkeyProstate cancerHealthMennewsShareReuse this content"

Complete and utter euphoria. Stina Blackstenius’s second-half goal stunned the three-time European champions Barcelona to deliver Arsenal’s second European title. On the final whistle it was red and white pandemonium as stunned Gunners seemed to not know what to do with themselves – hugs, tears, disbelief.They started so brightly, playing with the freedom and joy that they had not afforded themselves until they had reached this final. There is nothing to lose once you pass that semi-final hurdle and everything to play for in a one-off game and a free-scoring Barcelona, who scored 128 goals in 30 league games this season, looked slightly shocked by the resistance they faced.‘Super proud’: Slegers hails Arsenal after Women’s Champions League successRead moreAt the Estádio José Alvalade, expectations of a result were low, a glimmer of hope delivered by the gutsy second-leg comebacksagainst Real MadridandLyon, in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively, and the sublime way they have played at times this season.The sense of fun was born from the wider mood around the fixture and that spirit was evident on the pitch too. There was a fearlessness about Arsenal: instead of resorting to a double pivot against the holders, Renée Slegers, who was given the job full-time in January after taking interim charge following Jonas Eidevall’s exit in October, stuck with a formula that had worked for them in the second leg of their semi-final against Lyon andagainst Manchester Unitedon the final day of the Women’s Super League season. Arsenal were not in Lisbon to sit back, they were there to take the game to the Catalan giants and their pressing play and organisation in the opening half were superb.Their battling approach and the freedom with which they played clearly frustrated the champions and Slegers’ side had the better chances of the half: Caitlin Foord’s header wide of the far post, Chloe Kelly’s volley over the bar, a disallowed own goal with Kelly offside in the buildup and Cata Coll’s save from Frida Maanum, all close but not close enough.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly holds off Caroline Graham Hansen and Ona BatllePhotograph: Jose Breton/APReaching the break with the game goalless was an achievement against a Barcelona side playing their 100th Champions League game, their first coincidentally against Arsenal in the 2012-13 last 32.The serious attitude Arsenal as a whole have taken towards the women’s team was evident in the stands – the co-chairman Josh Kroenke had come from Denver to join assorted members of the hierarchy and David Dein, the former vice-chairman and former president of the women’s team. That stood in sharp contrast to the indifference shown to Manchester United Women by their minority owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, whose absence at the past two FA Cup finals was widely derided.TheBlaugrana, seeking a hat-trick of wins, stepped up a gear in the second half but Arsenal’s defence, which shipped 12 goals in their final three games of the WSL season, stood firm.They needed one chance, one escape into the Barça half, and it came in the 74th minute. A rare Arsenal corner was cleared but worked back in to the former Barcelona player Mariona Caldentey, who paused before finding Beth Mead hovering on the edge of the box. The England forward played in her fellow substitute Blackstenius and the Swede fired low past Coll.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Inside the debate sparked by London festival rowDiffering interpretations of public access rights are at heart of Brockwell case pitting campaign group against festival fansLanre BakareArts and culture correspondentSat 24 May 2025 08.03 EDTFirst published on Sat 24 May 2025 07.25 EDTSharePublic parks have been a cherished part of British life since the 19th century; for the Victorians they represented a “commitment to cultivate public good within the public realm”.But differing interpretations of this vision for municipal green space are at the heart of a debate over a very 21st-century issue: music festivals.This week, the row over mass music gatherings in Brockwell Park, southLondon, injected fresh impetus into some age-old questions: what are public parks for, who should have access to them, and for how long?On one side stand the thousands of festivalgoers who attend the events in south London. On the other is Protect Brockwell Park (PBP), the campaign group that counts celebrities such as Mark Rylance among their number. The latter won a high court victory a week ago against Lambeth council whose decision to grant festival organisers use of the park was deemed “irrational”.PBP’s argument is one of proportion.Festivalsare fine in principle, as long as there are not too many. But their critics have questioned whether a small but powerful group should be able to limit the enjoyment of so many.View image in fullscreenPeople walk past a high metal fence surrounding a temporary festival area in Brockwell Park, south London.Photograph: Carl Court/GettyThe author Emma Warren, who is attending the City Splash festival at the park on bank holiday Monday, noted that the high court verdict came in the same week that the supreme court ruled people hadthe legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor.“This is being billed as the need for collective space versus protection of nature,” Warren said. “But actually, I see it as part of a long-established pattern. This is about a small number of people trying to limit a larger number of people’s access to space.”For Jen Hawkins, of PBP, however, the ruling represents the laying down of a much-needed marker. “A few years ago they reached a kind of a happy medium whereby, yes, it annoyed a few people, but it was tolerable, and it wasn’t fencing off people from their precious green space,” she said. “I think this last year was a tipping point when the ground was completely trashed for the whole of spring and summer.”This weekend, thousands will attend the Mighty Hoopla festival in Brockwell Park, when Daniel Bedingfield will belt out his garage classicGotta Get Thru This. On Saturday, the chorus might just carry a bit more weight than usual for organisers whose resolve is being tested.The Brockwell Park row is taking place against a backdrop of rising costs for staging festivals, which has led to a record 72 events being postponed, canceled or having folded in 2024 as ticket prices soared.View image in fullscreenBrockwell Park on 21 May.Photograph: Carl Court/GettyDespite the challenges, the festivals persist. Wide Awake and the Mighty Hoopla are two of seven events taking place in Brockwell Park. Victoria Park, in Tower Hamlets, hosts All Points East and Lido; Gunnersbury Park welcomes several gigs, including the Smashing Pumpkins, the independent dance music festival Waterworks and Fearne Cotton’s Happy Place festival. While a series of concerts are taking place at Crystal Palace, including a sold-out show by Deftones and Weezer.Hawkins said PBP was not “anti-festival”. The group would like to have the Brockwell Park dates moved to later in the year so the park was accessible in summer, an ecological assessment of the impact the events, and the introduction of “fallow” years.John Rostron, the chief executive of theAssociation of Independent Festivals, said organisers already had to meet a long list of requirements to get licences. “You have to go through the local authority, which is a representation of the local community, to get a licence and meet all of the relevant health, safety, crime and disorder targets,” he said.View image in fullscreenJohn Rostron: ‘Not everyone is going to be satisfied.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“You can do all of that work but it doesn’t mean that every single person is going to be satisfied. We’re giving a lot of air time to the handful that are dissatisfied,” he said.Warren asked: “Is it a nuisance to gather and listen to music together, or is it a nuisance to complain about that behaviour? It strikes me that the idea that a small number of very opinionated and unelected people can stop collective and communal activity is very culturally specific. Globally, this is not normal.”The issue of who uses public spaces and for how long is not limited to the capital: in Liverpool there is a debate about Radio 1’s Big Weekend taking over Sefton Park in the city this summer.PBP said its campaign was about holding Lambeth council to account and claiming back space from the big companies that owned some festivals. The Mighty Hoopla was bought in 2023 by Superstruct, whose parent company was in turn bought last summer by the US private equity firmsKKRandCVC.Those who object to music events shutting off parks are branded nimbys. But this time, I’m on their side | Moya Lothian-McLeanRead moreSome acts have pulled out of Field Day, citing KKR’s holdings in Israel, while campaigners called for the event to “publicly distance itself” from the investment firm. Mighty Hoopla put out its own statement, which said it wished “to state our clear opposition to KKR’s unethical investments”.Hawkins argued that only “a tiny amount of money” was going back into the park, with much of it going to the companies. “They’re the real winners out of this.At present all the scheduled events will take place in Brockwell Park, after the council submitted a new application, but more legal challenges could emerge as the summer progresses.“I honestly do not know what’s going to happen next,” Hawkins said. “I’d like to think it really has set a precedent for future years, both for Brockwell Park and hopefully other public parks across the country, that councils can’t misuse their planning powers and get away with it.”Donatus Anyanwu, a Lambeth councillor and cabinet member for stronger communities, said: “Overall, we believe our events create an important cultural offer for our young and creative borough, while also enabling us to keep London’s biggest free community festival, the Lambeth Country Show, as a free and safe event.”Explore more on these topicsFestivalsAccess to green spaceMark RylanceLondonLocal politicsLocal governmentMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was Britain’senergy system operatorrequesting an immediate deluge of electricity to help prevent a wide-scale blackout crippling Britain’s power grids.The response was swift, and in the end just under one million people were left without power for less than 45 minutes. While trains werestuck on lines for hoursand hospitalshad to revert to backup generators, that phone call prevented Britain’s worst blackout in a decade from being far more severe.Almost six years later, the owners ofDinorwig, and its sister plant at Ffestiniog on the boundary of Eryri national park, formerly Snowdonia, are preparing to pump up to £1bn into a 10-year refurbishment of the hydropower plants that have quietly helped to keep the lights on for decades.Ffestiniog was one of the first pumped hydroelectric systems in the UK when it opened in 1963, while nearby Dinorwig – the largest and fastest-acting pumped storage station inEurope– followed in 1984. The refurbishment could mean the plants continue to provide reliable clean energy on demand for decades to come – and serve as giant grid batteries to store Britain’s renewable electricity for when it is needed most.Miya Paolucci, the UK boss of the French energy company Engie, one of Dinorwig’s owners, said refurbishing the plant will cost a third of the investment needed to build a new hydropower plant on a similar scale, making the overhaul an “intuitive” decision to secure another 25 years of life from the “much-loved” power station.View image in fullscreenDinorwig is known locally as Mynydd Gwefru (electric mountain).Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBritain has used gravity and the flow of water to generate electricity since 1878, when a hydroelectric generator first powered an arc lamp atthe Cragside manor housein Northumberland. The project involved dropping water 100 metres vertically to turn a Siemens generator that would go on to power a series of newly invented incandescent lightbulbs in the country house.Dinorwig and Ffestiniog use the same principles as the Cragside manor house to generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of almost 2 million UK households in a matter of seconds. When power is plentiful, the plants use electricity to pump water from a lower reservoir up to an elevated dam. Later, when power supplies are tight, the water is released to drive the turbines, generating power.Dinorwig or Mynydd Gwefru, as it is known locally, can be called upon to generate electricity within 75 seconds by releasing 86,000 gallons of water a second down a cavernous 500-metre vertical tunnel. The water crashes into six turbines, each weighing about 500 tonnes, which generate high-volume blasts of renewable power on demand.Illustration of how water is released down a tunnel from a reservoir to drive a turbineOverall, hydropower makes up only 2% of the UK’s total electricity – but often at times when its electrons are at their most vital to keeping the lights on. It provides many of the key benefits of large fossil fuel power plants – but without the carbon emissions.Unlike wind and solar farms, hydropower projects can be called upon by the system operator at specific times when the grid needs more generation to meet demand. The spinning mass of its generators can also help to stabilise the frequency of the power grid at about50Hz, the level required to avoid power outages. In the event of a blackout, hydropower can even help to restart the power system.View image in fullscreenDinorwig is the largest and fastest-acting pumped storage station in Europe.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut after 140 years generating electricity it is hydropower’s potential as an energy storage technology that is key to its future. Pumped hydropower can effectively work as a long-duration battery by using renewable electricity when it is abundant to pump water up into a reservoir and release the water to generate electricity when renewable energy wanes.Unlike grid batteries, which are often designed to charge during the day and discharge electricity at night, long-duration energy storage systems can store energy for hours, days or even weeks so it can be used when needed.The government hopes to bring forward investment in 18GW of storage by 2035, of which 10GW should be long-duration storage such as hydropower. But pumped hydropower projects are struggling to find a place in Britain’s energy landscapeView image in fullscreenThe control room at Dinorwig power station.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThere are geographic hurdles: there are only so many vast mountains and brimming reservoirs, and the projects can alsoprovoke concerns within the local community. But in locations where they are viable developers have been left to wait for government officials to confirm the details of its financial support framework.One of the UK’s biggest renewable energy developers, SSE, hopes that its Coire Glas project in the Scottish Highlands could be the first major pumped storage hydro scheme built in the UK in more than 40 years.The project could power 3 million homes for up to 24 hours, and would nearly double Great Britain’s total current electricity storage capacity, but it needs the final details of a government support scheme before SSE can fully commit to the project.View image in fullscreenDinorwig can be called upon to generate electricity within 75 seconds by releasing 86,000 gallons of water a second.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianA House of Lords report published late last year warned that a large-scale rollout of long-duration energy storage technologies was “not being treated with sufficient urgency”.The report found that a wide-scale rollout would allow more renewable power to be available, potentially lowering the overall cost of electricity for consumers.Better energy storage could, the committee said, make the grid more flexible and avoid paying to switch off wind and solar farms when there is more clean power being generated than consumers can use.Paolucci said: “Flexible storage is essential for net zero carbon operation of Britain’s electricity system. It helps balance the system by ensuring there’s always a large volume of ‘back-up’ power on standby, that can be delivered in very fast timescales if required. We’re very proud to contribute to the electricity security of supply and green energy ambition of the UK with these extraordinary assets.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryHydropowerEnergyRenewable energyWalesEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Known for his role as Alex Larden on House Husbands and for presenting shows such as The Voice Australia, he had increasingly been sucked into padel tournaments.“My agent went crazy: ‘What were you thinking? What’s your bread and butter?’” McMullen says. “I was like, ‘God, you’re right. I should open a padel centre.’”That was 2023; now he has three sites in Sydney and Canberra, including one in Moore Park with a sauna, ice baths and DJ decks. While Racquet Club does have pickleball courts as well, McMullen is firmly a padel man. “I think it’s the best game ever invented,” he says.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsPickleball may be one of the fastest growing sports in Australia, not least because courts are popping up in breweries. But padel is snapping at its heels. Australia is relatively late to the party, but there are now 14 padel clubs around the country, and the delirium that the sport attracts overseas, in Europe and South America in particular, is feeding the buzz over here. (Incidentally, McMullen advises you don’t poshly pronounce “padel” as “padelle”, since to do so would mark you out as someone who “goes to Barcelona once and refuses to say the name without a lisp”.)View image in fullscreenDarren McMullen plays padel at the Racquet Club in Sydney.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianBoth padel and pickleball appeal to wannabe or retiring tennis players, since they’re less hard on the body (particularly thanks to the underarm serve) and can be played with a lower skill level, but they also attract a broader demographic because of the sociability of being doubles sports. Pickleball, originally invented as a family game, is played on an open 13.41 x 6.1m court with a plastic ball, while padel is played on a 20m x 10m glass-walled court (for squash-like returns), using a ball that’s more like a tennis ball.The upstart sports have attracted the attention of celebrity fans, too. Team Padel includes tennis pros from Rafael Nadal to Pat Rafter, who is Padel Australia’s founding ambassador, while Lionel Messi co-owns a padel team and Cristiano Ronaldo owns clubs. Team Pickleball counts Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf (who both have signature pickleball paddles), and Billie Eilish and Coldplay have stopped by Racquet Club for a pickleball playoff.There’s a sense of tribalism that arises from loyalty to one sport or the other. The Telegraph UK called this jousting “the battle for the new middle class favourite sport”.“Pickleball’s a fantastic game,” McMullen says generously, “but it’s agame, not a sport.”So which should we emotionally invest in – is this rivalry just VHS v Beta all over again, with one bound for extinction? The Guardian asked three players with skin in the game.Which requires more skill?Rosa Morris is a former tennis player who gave up when a shoulder injury got in the way of her overarm serve. She and a friend were trying to find unusual things to do, which led them to dragon boat racing, axe throwing and then pickleball. She now competes internationally and reached No 1 in Australia for masters. Yes, pickleball can be fun, but as Morris says “I never do anything for fun”.“The speed of pickleball is incredible,” she says. “The ball comes rocketing at you and you’ve got to change direction very quickly. The rallies you have at the net are called fireflies or hand battles. It’s like ping-pong on steroids.”Morris isn’t sure about padel. “I’ve watched a bit of it,” she says. “It’s crazy. They can go out of the door and play the ball and it looks like no one can ever win a point; it goes on and on.”View image in fullscreenRosa Morris, who won gold in the Australian Pickleball Masters.To this attitude, McMullen replies, “I could give my mum, who’s never played a racket sport, a pickleball paddle and she’d be able to have a back and forth.”No matter how skilled a player is, there’s always an opportunity for injury. Rob Daley is chief operating officer of Game4Padel in Australia, which has clubs expanding across Victoria and an ambassador in Andy Murray. He also plays on the national senior men’s padel team and half-jokes that padel could become our new most dangerous sport in the same way that squash was in the 80s, when middle-aged executives suddenly started exerting themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Geelong-based GP (and occasional pickleball player) Adrian Jury told the Guardian that he had heard radiologists were seeing an epidemic of Achilles ruptures in older players who’d had a few drinks before hitting the court.Which is more affordable?Depending on the site and time, Game4Padel charges $50-$80 for an hour of padel and $20 for pickleball, while Racquet Club charges $60-$100 for a hour of padel compared with $30-$50 for pickleball. “When you take into consideration that each padel court costs $100,000, we spend close to $2m fitting out a warehouse, and our rent is close to a million dollars a year, I would say it’s quite reasonable,” McMullen says.By contrast, Pickleball courts often get marked out on existing volleyball, badminton and indoor soccer courts, making them much cheaper. “The lines get freaking confusing,” says Morris, who prefers to travel 90 minutes to use a $50-an-hour purpose-built court.Which is likely to make it to the Olympics first?Game4Padel plans to develop junior programs and high performance programs, to develop the sport’s growth and get a young generation Olympic-ready.“There’s an arms race to try and get a spot in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics,” Daley says. “Padel’s a fair way in front, but there’s a pretty big checklist to tick off and probably a few things that the governing body is still a bit short on. With pickleball, there’s no single international governing body … and if you haven’t got that, the reality is you’ve got no chance.”View image in fullscreenPadel players at the Racquet Club in Sydney.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianMcMullen is frustrated by all the red tape. In part, it’s a lack of enthusiasm from local councils and constituencies – “It’s like we’re asking to put in a fucking nightclub” – but he also cites the ambivalent approach ofTennisAustralia, who promote padel, but who also recommend that the integration “not come at the expense of well-utilised tennis facilities or tennis programming”. In other words, tennis clubs aren’t encouraged to surrender a court to accommodate padel.Rivalry aside, in the end all three players think that interest in one sport will naturally boost interest in the other. And tennis will come around. Eventually.Explore more on these topicsFitnessTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Beware the giant bone monsters!Martin BelamSat 24 May 2025 14.35 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 14.36 EDTShareIn a season full of stories about stories and littered with fourth-wall breaks, this was a Doctor Who episode distilled into a fairytale, with Archie Panjabi delighting in playing up the wicked Rani caricature and Ncuti Gatwa’s Doctor reduced to a passive, then persecuted, bystander.It was odd seeing the Doctor and Belinda (Varada Sethu) as a contented married couple, WandaVision style, enjoying the kind of boring day-to-day existence that Matt Smith’s Doctor showed inThe Power of Threeis impossible for him to live, without getting restless.View image in fullscreenThe Rani (Archie Panjabi) and Mrs Flood (Anita Dobson).Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonConrad (Jonah Hauer-King) appeared to be holding the world together and taunting our heroes with his mock CBeebies Bedtime Stories show, but it looked to be taking it out of him. Anita Dobson as Mrs Flood/“a” Rani was good value as ever. Was that a hint of conflict on her face about the whole plan when she was comforting Conrad?Millie Gibson as Ruby Sunday continued to prove that she is better suited to leading this show through episodes where the Doctor isn’t really being the Doctor than being on board the Tardis itself, although her introduction to the underworld of ignored and dispossessed people with disabilities did slow the pace of the episode.View image in fullscreenMillie Gibson as Ruby Sunday in Wish World.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/Samuel DoreThen there were Jonathan Groff, Ruth Madeley and Bonnie Langford in the mix too. And a run-through of previous Doctor’s faces that sidestepped where exactly Jo Martin’s Fugitive Doctor fits in by slotting her in between 13 and 14, where we know she definitely doesn’t belong.The Giggle reared its head, too, this time creepily voiced by the stolen baby. It has been a continued presence this year. Mr Ring-a-Ding did the Stooky Bill giggle, and its waveform appeared about the Harmony arena last week. What can it all mean?Sum it up in one sentence?What ifDoctor Whodid WandaVision, but with added giant bone dinosaurs?Life aboard the TardisThis was more about life aboard the redressed Unit set, which also housed much of the action in last year’s two-part finale. It was reassuring to see that in whatever timeline we are in Col Ibrahim (Alexander Devrient) has the hots for his boss, Kate Lethbridge-Stewart (Jemma Redgrave). We will see more of that pair in forthcoming spin-off The War Between the Land and the Sea.View image in fullscreenCol Ibrahim (Alexander Devrient), being watched over by Jonah Hauer-King’s Conrad.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonFear factorMuch as he did in 2008’s Turn Left and in his dramaYears and Years, Russell T Davies explored here a vision of contemporary Britain that had turned more authoritarian. The script may have focused on “doubt” being the thought crimes committed, but it was clear that Davies was drawing parallels with regimes where you can be dragged out of your home and disappeared for being gay, for being political, for being different, for your family being suspicious of you. It was more chilling than any of the science fiction in the episode, and a timely warning.Mysteries and questionsIt is hard to know where to begin. Everything was a mystery, in an episode that was nearly all set-up and no payoff. We don’t know what the bone monsters are. We don’t know where Belinda has disappeared to. We don’t know why Poppy is there.More than anything, we don’t know why they billed this era as a soft reboot where people could jump on with the aim of attracting a new younger audience, and then crammed it full of things that first appeared in episodes in the 1970s and 80s and have barely been referenced since. Baffling. Fun at times, but baffling.View image in fullscreenVarada Sethu as Belinda, who believes she is married to the Doctor.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/Maxine HowellsDeeper into the vortexWe first encountered the Doctor’s alias of John Smith in Patrick Troughton’s 1968 adventureThe Wheel in Space.Omega, a Gallifreyan solar engineer, made his debut in the 10th anniversary rompThe Three Doctors, and cropped up again 10 years later during the Peter Davison era in 1983’sArc of Infinity.The Gallifreyan Seal, sometimes known as the Seal of Rassilon, first appeared on Gallifrey during 1976 Tom Baker storyThe Deadly Assassin. However, the prop was recycled by designer Roger Murray-Leach, having previously been seen in 1975’sRevenge of the Cybermenas an emblem of the Vogans. They are not to be confused with the Vogons and their terrible poetry in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.Turning people into animals may be a fairytale trope, but the first transformation Frau Rani caused in Bavaria, turning the mother into violets, echoed her tactics in 1985’sThe Mark of the Rani. Kate O’Mara’s incarnation of the Time Lady had landmines that turned people into trees when they stood on them.Dugga Doo, from last week’s Interstellar Song Contest, has become such a cult hit that the BBC has produced a full-length version of the song without the dialogue over the top of it, and on Wednesday launched a 24/7 YouTube livestream with the earworm on a constant loop.Dugga Doo at the Interstellar Song ContestNext timeIt’s the season finale.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Let’s start with a caveat: we have serious issues with the concept of readymade, long-shelf-life hummus. Some dips lend themselves to tub life, but for us, hummus is like bread: something that should be made fresh daily. Indeed, inour restaurants, we make a batch every day, and the tubs we sell in the deli are good for three.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We also want to challenge the idea that readymade hummus is a “healthy” snack. Freshly made with chickpeas and tahini, and seasoned with lemon, salt, garlic and maybe a little cumin, yes, hummus is wholesome. However, most of the ones we tested had added oil (olive oil in the better ones, vegetable oil in the rest), and some included preservatives and other additives, making them ultra-processed foodstuffs and decidedlynothealthy.For most of your hummus needs, we recommend buying from a specialist or, better yet, making your own using good-quality tinnedchickpeasand tahini. It comes together in seconds and tastes far better than anything you can buy. Still, even we aren’t above a readymade dip now and then, and hummus really is the perfect companion to an office spread, a long train ride or an impromptu picnic, so we may as well know the good from the bad.The best supermarket hummusBest all-rounder:Ramona’s Original Heavenly HoumousView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 500g at Tesco (70p/100g)£3.50 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (70p/100g)★★★★☆This really tastes of chickpeas, which is great and, not surprisingly, it contains more chickpeas (66%) than any of the others tested. Not too lemony, highly seasoned, but in a good way. Quite a few additives, though.Best splurge:Moorish Smoked HumousView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 150g at Morrisons (£1.30/100g)£1.95 for 150g at Sainsbury’s (£1.30/100g)★★★★☆A very leftfield hummus, but one we thoroughly enjoyed. The smoke comes through powerfully and pleasantly. It’s vinegary, too, which is unusual, but it works in this context. Pleasant texture and mostly natural ingredients. Great as a dip or sandwich filler.Best bargain:Sabra Houmous ClassicView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 250g at Ocado (£1/100g)★★★☆☆Smooth, easy to eat and with a resealable lid. The seasoning is balanced, but the texture is a bit greasy and fatty. It’s also loaded with oil, preservatives and additives, and has a suspiciously long shelf-life, which is not so good if you’re avoiding UPFs.‘Just one was enough to turn my middle-class worldview to dust’: tinned and jarred chickpeas, tasted and ratedRead moreAnd the rest …Waitrose No 1 Extra-Virgin Olive Oil HoumousView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 170g at Waitrose (£1.62/100g)★★★☆☆The packaging is good and easy to open. It’s not resealable, but the quantity is suited to a single sitting. The texture is grainy, the seasoning heavily citric, and the oil makes it claggy and almost too rich.

The glass jar is classy, but there was a weird, watery residue on top. The texture’s oddly bouncy (not unlike grout), and the flavour is what you’d imagine grout tastes like. That said, bar the citric acid, it’s all natural.Sainsbury’s Classic HoumousView image in fullscreen99p for 200g at Sainsbury’s (50p/100g)☆☆☆☆☆Appealing container in a paper sleeve, but that’s where the positives end. Vile on every level: looks like thin glue (it’s split and congealed), the chickpeas are chalky, gravelly and undercooked, and have an aftertaste that lingers in a way that makes you want to brush your teeth for ever. Avoid at all costs.Tesco HoumousView image in fullscreen99p for 200g at Tesco (50p/100g)☆☆☆☆☆Tastes exactly like the Sainsbury’s version, and we suspect it’s made using the same misguided recipe by the same manufacturer.

They bemoan how university course changes are replacing deep skills with competency checklistsStephanie ConverySat 24 May 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 22.15 EDTShare“Rachel, bad news,” the text message read. “They’re disconnecting the loom tomorrow.”Rachel Halton still doesn’t know who made the decision, in October 2022, to summarily decommission the $160,000 Jacquard loom that had been a cornerstone of RMIT’s renowned weaving and textile design courses for 20 years.Nearly 3 metres high and weighing more than half a tonne, the loom was an intricate machine of polished wood, steel, compressed air and mechatronics: simultaneously a grand monument to the golden age of the textile industry and a modern tool for weaving strands of yarn into intricate fabrics. Halton knew she couldn’t let it end up in landfill.View image in fullscreenJacquard looms use punchcards – an early form of code – to guide the lifting and lowering of threads.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The Guardian“It was my day off and I got up, jumped out of bed and just went down there,” Halton says.The loom was the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere, and one of only a handful in the world, bought for the university’s Brunswick campus in the early 2000s, soon after Halton started teaching there. It “elevated what you could do as an artist”, she says. Students enrolled just to have access to it. International artists visited especially to weave on it. It became integral to Halton’s creative practice.Art school in Australia: amid the cuts and closures, what could the future look like?Read moreWhen she arrived at campus that October morning, ready to “chain myself to that tree”, the only other person there was the man coming to decommission it.“He disconnected it in front of me,” Halton says. “It felt like taking a family member off life support.”Others felt the same. Word spread that the loom was headed for the skip and a ramshackle collective of weavers, teachers, students and alumni hashed out a plan to save it. They paid a sympathetic technician a case of beer to disassemble it safely, hired a trailer from a service station to transport it and squeezed the whole thing into a former student’s lounge room while they tried to find it a more permanent home.One member of that collective, a textile artist, Daisy Watt, says the episode felt like “a perfect snapshot of the state of everything” aboutthe way higher education treats fine arts and crafts: where valuable tools and increasingly rare skills are condemned by, as Halton says, “a decision at the end of a spreadsheet”, while community groups and guilds with scant resources do their best to salvage the remnants.The warp and the weftThe loom’s clunky name belies its significance. Traditional Jacquard looms used punch cards – slips of cardboard with rows of holes, an early form of code – to guide the lifting and lowering of vertical (warp) threads, as fabric is assembled, thread by thread, across the horizontal (weft). This ARM AG CH-3507 loom could be operated by computer or by hand, enabling complete control of every thread, making the design possibilities endless.View image in fullscreenWatt and technician Tony de Groot work together to restore the loom.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianWatt has “a very special affinity” with the loom. It isn’t just the time she spent working on it at RMIT, or that it sat in her home for months after it was rescued. She’s also been using her coding skills – self-taught – to update its electronics. It’s as though technology is lapping back on itself, given that Jacquard punch cards inspiredthe basis of modern computing.“We normally think of craft in isolation from technology but it’s just this gorgeous, messy thing,” Watt says. “A piece of effective craft technology based on making something beautiful.”Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAt the time the loom was bought, textile design at RMIT was taught as a stream within a diploma of arts – a course that “people would relocate their whole lives for”, according to a teacher, Lucy Adam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

This dispensed with a traditional curriculum and focused instead on job-oriented “units of competency” determined by industry and subject to strict oversight.Federal and state governments claimed the reforms were necessary to streamline qualifications and weed out subpar training providers. Teachers and trade unionists argued they would diminish education and result in systematic de-skilling, whittling down what the labour theorist Harry Braverman called “conscious and masterful labour” to the performance of “simple and ignorant tasks”.The testimonies of textile design teachers at RMIT suggest that, despite their best efforts otherwise, this is exactly what occurred.View image in fullscreenDe Groot looks through instructional literature that was salvaged with the device.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianThe course became “extremely dry and lowest common denominator”, Adam says. Resources were throttled and student contact hours cut by more than half. Despite the drawcard of the loom, there was no longer time to properly teach students to use it. Halton incorporated it into students’ work where she could, doing the setup, pack-up and maintenance herself.Adam, whosemasters thesisinterrogated the impact of the changes to vocational education, says that for trades that are simultaneously technical crafts and creative arts – textile design, ceramics, cookery, metalsmithing, woodworking and others – a checklist of competencies is “not really the point”.“It’s a really old-school rote way of teaching, unless you’re an incredibly skilled teacher and can work around the blandness of it,” she says.An artist and teacher, John Brooks, also rues the narrowness of the course structures. For example, one unit’s assessment requirements include describing the process of turning a computer on and off. “So much energy is spent on compliance that the actual core skills we’re teaching are collateral damage,” he says.Adam once had a student who described the training package as akin to “filling out a visa application over and over again”. “That just made me really sad,” she says. “Where is the mastery? Where is that deep skill?”View image in fullscreenThe loom’s new home in Ballarat.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianIt’s a decline not restricted to Tafe. Ella*, a third-year fine arts student at the University of Tasmania, tells Guardian Australia that there are no classes there beyond first year in 3D mediums including ceramics, which is her focus, or furniture, sculpture or time-based media. There are no art history classes either.“It’s really affecting how developed students’ knowledge is of the contemporary arts scene,” Ella says. Her lecturers try to adapt the courses as much as they can to “freshen it up”, she says – but students desperately need a better technical and theoretical foundation.Prof Lisa Fletcher, from the University of Tasmania’s arts faculty, says the university understands the importance of the arts, strives to provide “a strong and sustainable offering” for students, and is keen to to hear feedback as the department prepares for a regular review of its fine arts degree.Crafting the futureThe loom is now in a loading dock in Ballarat, an incubator space for which the rescue collective pays peppercorn rent. The city has pledged to maintain and nurture rare and endangered crafts. Some have nearly been lost: leadlighting, for example, wasan almost-extinct tradein Australia until a small group of artists revived it, lobbying hard for years to bring it back into the Tafe system and establishing a course at Melbourne Polytechnic. But it is an exception to the rule.Looms with a view: weavers give ancient craft a modern twistRead moreWatt and the other weavers hope the loom will eventually be accessible for people to work, teach and create on again. As Brooks says, the less these skills are practised, the fewer places there are to learn them, “the more chance we have of losing them”.A spokesperson for RMIT says the university decommissioned the loom because it needed upgrading, and that it was obliged to give students access to “reliable, modern equipment” that would prepare them for their entrance to the workforce. Meanwhile, the space the loom inhabited is now occupied by a military-funded textiles project. The rooms require a security clearance to enter. At the end of last year, RMIT closed enrolments for its certificate four in textile design, after the state government ended subsidies for the course.But there is a glimmer of hope. Adam didn’t give up. She proposed a new diploma, which has just been approved. And she’s not the only person at the university trying to maintain space for her craft, even as that space keeps shrinking. At the time of writing, the university was about to take delivery of a new piece of equipment: smaller, less sophisticated but still a $100,000 computer-controlled Jacquard loom.* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsAustralian educationCraftAustralian universitiesTextile artVictoriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A red number 7 blinks across the pitch from the fourth official’s board. Seven minutes of injury time: it’s a lot. Against Barcelona, it’s an age. Against this Barcelona, in this heat, in this game, it may as well be all of eternity.But you push through. You pace yourself. Beth Mead goes down under a challenge; there’s 30 seconds right there. Kim Little rolls the ball up the left touchline to no one: eight seconds. Daphne van Domselaar hesitates over a free-kick, squeezing out those seconds like drops from a towel. You push through because whatever happens in these seven minutes, however those minutes make you suffer, seven minutes is still less than 18 years.Arsenal 1-0 Barcelona: Women’s Champions League final player ratingsRead moreThere is a whistle, and then there is a scream, and then there is pure confusion. Arsenalhave planned this gameto the very last detail, rehearsed every last contingency, mapped out every possible scenario. But not this one. Some run; some stagger. But in these earliest moments of triumph, wherever they are on the pitch, somehow it feels telling that the first instinct of these Arsenal players is to find each other.Meanwhile Barcelona collapse, not just in distress but in a kind of violent shock: a shock that seems to consume them physically, to shake every fibre of their being. As if they cannot truly believe anyone woulddareto do this to them. Next to the centre circle a podium is hastily being erected, a confetti cannon winched into place, and they still can’t believe it’s not for them.People often say, with a vaguely fatalistic subtext, that you have to play the perfect game against Barcelona. Which is all very well, but then what happens when you make a mistake? Arsenal did not play the perfect game, even if several individuals got pretty close. But they won anyway, because they understood that finals are not simply a form of expression but a form of combat, not simply a vehicle for skills and stratagems but a vehicle for courage.And we should be clear at this point what kind of courage we mean. This is not simply the courage of crunching tackles and lunging blocks, of putting your head where it hurts. It is the courage of playing the forward pass when the backward pass is on, of keeping the ball on the ground when every impulse tells you to get rid, of taking your time on the ball, because there is always a little more time than you think.It is the courage of starting well, having a goal disallowed, missing chances, but not succumbing to fatalism. Of Leah Williamson stepping in to win the ball, even though she risks getting turned. Of flooding the area with bodies even though you know how well Barcelona can transition. Of showing the greatest team in the history of women’s club football all the respect they deserve, but not an ounce more.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson gets clear of Barcelona’s Aitana Bonmatí during an imperious display by the Arsenal captain.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersArsenal’s goal, a masterclass of grace under pressure, was perhaps the best example of this. Mariona Caldentey receives the ball on the right wing, and immediately the options flutter in front of her. The first-time cross is on. The sliding pass to Katie McCabe in the channel is on. Instead she waits, waits for the picture to unblur in front of her. And eventually Mead presents herself, and the pass is perfect, and the shot from Stina Blackstenius is perfect, and in the most perfect twist of all, she’s actually onside this time.For Arsenal, this changes everything. There will be a parade on Monday, and a mural on the side of the Emirates, there will be award ceremonies and tie-in merchandise, there will be functions and reunions. Over time Lisbon 2025 will take its place in the club’s mythology, as surely as Meadow Park 2007, White Hart Lane 2004, Anfield 1989.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For those fans today who were not fans 18 years ago, Arsenal have slowly become the sort of club that dares but does not do, that fails elegantly and succeeds rarely, that wants to win but ultimately does not need to: a trendy leisurewear brand with a football team attached. These are traits that hard-wire themselves over time, and yet can be magically undone in the course of one sweltering afternoon.Arsenal are European champions. Those four small words now define how this club sees itself, how these players step on to the pitch, how opponents treat them, how prospective signings view the project. For Little, for Williamson, for Blackstenius, for Renée Slegers and for Clare Wheatley, the director of women’s football, and the Arsenal board, it is a form of vindication that will sustain them in their toughest moments. Each of them will walk a little taller on Sunday morning.Most days, nothing changes. The games and the sessions and the seasons all blur into one eventually. But then there are the days that will be remembered in perfect clarity, forever: days when a plan comes together, days when the wheel of history is stopped in its tracks. Together, Little and Williamson clasp the trophy, raise it aloft. The music plays. The confetti flies. When it lands, nothing will be the same again.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

They earned the right thanks to a season of hard toil and nerveless endeavour. They sealed the deal by staring down more experienced opponents in this playoff final, expressing an appetite for victory that would not be quenched. Two goals of top-flight quality got them over the line, and delirious communion with their supporters at the final whistle sealed a small moment in history.They don’t talk much about the romance of the playoffs, they’re just too brutal for that. A year’s work can be overturned in an instant. A collective loss of form, an individual lack of concentration, and years of planning and ambition can be set on fire. The playoffs break hearts more than they make dreams come true and, often, celebrations at Wembley are followed by tears just a year later.Sunderland snatch promotion to Premier League by beating Sheffield United in playoff finalRead moreSunderland may well return to the second tier next summer, but in the way they embraced their task at Wembley on Saturday was a reminder that the things wise men say are always there to be challenged.Régis Le Bris’s team had upended all expectations this season by holding on to the coattails of the Championship’s parachute clubs with a squad of unheralded and youthful talent. For the first 70 minutes, it looked as if they might be edged out by a team that were a little cannier and with the kind of bench that only Premier League revenues can buy. But they stuck to their aims, rode the shifts in momentum, Le Bris made his changes and Eliezer Mayenda and Tommy Watson did not think twice before seizing their moments in front of goal.It was Patrick Roberts who made the equaliser, his pass with the outside of the right boot cutting through the Blades’ midfield and beyond the outstretched Jack Robinson to find Mayenda, who rifled the ball in the top corner. Roberts was one of four players in the squad who had featured against Wycombe in the League One playoff final three years ago. A second, Luke O’Nien, was the first to congratulate Mayenda, bursting from the bench despite having exited the play himself after dislocating a shoulder just two minutes in.In added time, Watson decided the match by latching on to a horrible mistake by Kieffer Moore to hit a shot just as unerring as Mayenda’s, but this time low and from range, into the corner. The 19-year-old tore his shirt off and burst towards the stands, his eyes sharp, his fist clenched. Another Sunderland academy graduate, Watson has played just 900 minutes of league football in his career. He has also already agreed a £10m deal to move to Brighton this summer.In that one detail you are reminded of the limits of any misty-eyed thinking when it comes to English football in the 21st century. Watson is unlikely to be the only young talent to move on from the Stadium of Light this summer. Jobe Bellingham, imperious at the base of the Sunderland midfield, has already been linked with following in his brother’s footsteps and a move to Borussia Dortmund. There will be suitors for the creative midfielder Chris Rigg and full-back Trai Hume, whose crossing was a constant danger.View image in fullscreenTommy Watson fires home Sunderland’s late winning goal past Michael Cooper.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersBut Sunderland did not allow themselves to be overtaken by cynicism. Instead they chose to dream: of glory, of success through conviction, of completing a turnaround for a club that was floundering just a few years ago. They were backed in equal part by their supporters, who made the noise before the game, during and, of course, afterwards.Sunderland had the highest average attendance in the Championship this past season at 40,000, a figure that would make them ninth biggest in the top flight too. They are a big club in most of the ways that matter. But in this match, in this moment, they drew on the motivation and the enthusiasm of the underdog. Their opponents, meanwhile, gave off the air of a side that have reached the heights and been chastened by what they found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They dug in on the edge of their box and invited Sunderland on.The steady stream of former Premier League players from the bench – Ben Brereton Díaz (later subbed off again), Tom Davies – could not change the dynamic. A year after a chastening Premier League relegation there was a sense that the Blades just did not want promotion as much and swathes of empty seats suggested their supporters felt the same.Sunderland may yet find themselves bearing the same emotional scars, but as they contemplate a season among the Premier League giants they have a window in which to think big. They look determined to embrace it.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedSunderlandanalysisShareReuse this content"

They reckon UnionBordeaux Bèglesare the best-supported rugby union club in the world. To be in Cardiff was not to be disabused of the notion. Rugby is massive in France, on a par with football, and bigger in the southern half of the country. It creates a different kind of animal.Northampton were proud, brave, inventive –but in the end overpowered. The narrative was wild and, Saints might say, liable to have gone either way. A raucous stadium – for Northampton are one of the best supported in England – was treated to crazy fluctuations in fortune, tries scored and overturned, penalties, knock-ons and high tackles subject to review after review.Saints accuse Bordeaux of ‘foul play’ towards Henry Pollock in post-final fracasRead moreBut when the dust settled, the reality of a top club in the sport’s biggest market imposed itself onNorthampton, champions of England maybe, but a side who have hit their straps this season only in this competition. What a job they have made of it.It has almost been tacitly accepted in English rugby that glory days in Europe may have to wait for a while, so much more powerful and deep are the squads in French and Irish rugby these days. Saints and Harlequins worked wonders to make the semi-finals last year, but to go a step further again was a triumph against all odds for the former, given their injuries and the vagaries in form.Alas, the echoes of their previous appearance in this final,here in 2011, were all too poignant. Back then they rattled up a 22-6 lead against Leinster by half-time, only to ship 27 unanswered points. No such indignity this time. Alex Coles scored tries at either end of the first half to level 20-20 at the break. But the spectre of a scoreless second half returned, despite Henry Pollock’s dash to the line from a lineout early, chalked off for a tug by Coles. Bordeaux ground out eight unanswered points for the win.Pollock’s was but one of a number of incidents subjected to trial by TMO. He had another effort chalked off five minutes from the break, marginally offside when he touched down Fin Smith’s chip ahead. Bordeaux had two of their own disallowed, one for a forward pass between their deadly wingers, Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Damian Penaud, the latter adding another two tries to his tally and collecting the player of the tournament award.View image in fullscreenHenry Pollock runs in to score a try that was later disallowed.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBy the end Northampton were still swinging but exhausted. They had picked a team to take the match to the opposition, but it was shot through with risk, a statement of boldness or, some might wonder, a devil-may-care roll of the dice. One surprise recovery from injury is one thing, but to unveil five of them in your squad might not be the sort of gamble a club with a bigger budget would take.Alas, two of them, James Ramm and George Furbank, were off within the first five minutes, the latter on a stretcher. Suddenly, Northampton had used two of their three backs replacements and one of those was Ollie Sleightholme, out since the Six Nations after ankle surgery. He probably had not banked on playing more or less 80 minutes. Especially not against Bielle-Biarrey and Penaud, the world’s deadliest wingers.View image in fullscreenBordeaux’s fans showcased French passion for rugby in Cardiff.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAAnother surprise was to see Coles line up in the back row. He was another to take a knock against Saracens last week. He seemed to be struggling even in the captain’s run on Friday, but there he was with heavy strapping on his knee. Happily, he left any struggles behind him to have the game of his life, one of those locks absolutely in his element in the extra space of life in the back row. Those tries showcased his talents, powering his way through defenders for the first, deftly handling and galloping in support for the second.But there could be little argument with the result. Bielle-Biarrey played most of the match at full-back, after Romain Buros left for a head injury assessment, just as Tommy Freeman did after Furbank left. The pair of them were superb in their different ways, even if Freeman took a spell in the bin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maxime Lucu took the match award, continuing to show off how he deserves more than to be considered Antoine Dupont’s understudy. And his partner, Matthieu Jalibert, was bewitching, particularly in that first half, central to Bordeaux’s three first-half tries, beating seven men to set up the second, for Cyril Cazeaux.They all added to the colour of the occasion. The French fans took the streets of Cardiff by storm before the match, chanting, drumming, marching, the British standing around somewhat bewildered with their cameraphones out to record the pageant. So it continued throughout the match.Early in the professional era, one of rugby’s grand old cities merged its two deadly rivals. They are a blueprint for how to negotiate the transition from rugby’s amateur ways to a bold modern synthesis that harnesses rare energy for the sport.The new club’s first trophy, secured in its first European final. They are colourful and passionate. Worthy winners of that other great product of the professional era. Call it what you will, Heineken, Champions, Europe, it continues to bring out the best in rugby.

On the eve ofEngland’s victory inside three days, the captain was asked about the chances of Jacob Bethell, away playing in the IPL, returning for next month’s series against India.“If you talk about nailing down a position, Beth has done himself the world of good with the performances he put in [in New Zealand over the winter],”Stokes said. “I think you can put two and two together.”View image in fullscreenBen Stokes said he made it clear to Ollie Pope how much he values the England batter.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersHis comment was widely interpreted that Bethell would return to the starting XI, butafter Pope, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett all scored centuries as England cruised to victory by an innings and 45 runs Stokes said he “made it pretty clear” that Bethell was guaranteed no more than “coming back into the squad”.“That was written to suit an agenda that was being said away from what is in the team,” he said. “It is unfortunate that you say something and it can get twisted. I made it very clear to Popey the night before this Test that is not the case. He’s my vice-captain and he’s been incredible.“Popey knows how much I value him, not only as a player but also as a leader, as a vice-captain. He’s someone who I lean on a lot out there. He’s very good in particular when I’m bowling, about a few things that are a lot easier to miss when I’ve got my bowling head on. So, just a big misinterpretation.”Shoaib Bashir posted career-best figures of six for 81, finishing with nine in the match as England coasted to victory with more than four sessions to spare. “He’s got some unbelievable natural ability, his height and how much he puts on the ball and his ability to be able to change from square seam to upright seam, the skill is undoubted,” Stokes said of the 21-year-old.“The big progression with him is building towards a dismissal more and not getting a bit too giddy. That was the word he used out there. It’s scary to think about the start to his career that he’s had. To be where he is now, it’s super, super exciting. I can say it’s impossible for him not to get even better than what he is now.”England’s progress was slowed by half-centuries from Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza and by Ben Curran’s 104-ball 37, all three among Bashir’s victims. “On that first day we weren’t really up to par,” the Zimbabwe captain, Craig Ervine, said. “With our big quicks we didn’t get enough in the right area – when you can do that, especially in these conditions, you ask a lot of questions and unfortunately we didn’t do that, which made it difficult to control the scoring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You’d have two sides going for the title – perhaps three or even four, all playing teams of similar standard and motivation. You’d have maybe six teams contesting the three relegation slots, possibly playing each other, and also a skirmish for European qualification.Ideally all 10 games would mean something and there should be times over the course of the afternoon when each side have the set of results they need to achieve their aims. And there should definitely be a moment when it becomes apparent that a harassed television presenter has forgotten or overlooked a goal so viewers can mutter furiously at the screen: “For heavens’ sake, that putsBrentfordin ninth.”In reality 10 live games is probably too much to ask – and the disorientating experience ofthe final night of the Champions League group stagesuggests it may be too much to comprehend anyway – but six of Sunday afternoon’s games potentially have something riding on them and one is a bona fide head-to-head, winner-takes-it-all clash.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest fans have had plenty to celebrate this season, proof positive that it is possible for a side promoted via the playoffs not only to survive but to prosper.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoThere has been a lot of talk about this being a poor or an anticlimactic season. While the latter term may be fair with regard to the title race and the relegation battle, the former certainly is not. The title race was in effect over from 18 January, the Saturday when Liverpool wonwith two late goals at Brentfordand Arsenal threw away a two-goal leadat home to Aston Villa. The relegation battle was done once Wolves hadbrought in Vítor PereirawhileLeicester went for Ruud van NistelrooyandSouthampton for Ivan Juric. The most crucial issues were decided early.‘Football is not complicated’: Andoni Iraola on Bournemouth, birdsong and playing betterRead moreBut as to the allegation this was somehow a season lacking in quality, it is always worth remembering that multiple themes can be true simultaneously. Arsenal and especially Manchester City have had disappointing seasons by their standards and that meant Liverpool were not challenged as they might have been. Arsenal, having drawn too many games, will finish second for the third season running but having offered less of a challenge than in the previous two years, while City could yet miss out on the Champions League if they lose at Fulham and Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa all win. Equally, none of the three promoted sides ever looked remotely good enough to survive.It is worth, though, asking why they struggled so much and why City and Arsenal were punished for wobbles. The major reason is probably the general strength of the middle ranks of the Premier League – which is why Liverpool’s consistency deserves more praise than many seemed prepared to give them. Every team from Newcastle in fourth down to Crystal Palace in 12th have had games they will remember fondly and would be more than worthy English representatives in European competition next season.Bournemouth, for instance, played some exceptional football at times, beating Arsenal (twice), Manchester City and Newcastle. They have a centre-backthey have already sold to Real Madrid for £50mand a full-back they look like selling to Liverpool for £40m, yet they go into the final day of the season with no chance of European qualification. There have been times recently whenAndoni Iraola, one of those coaches named by Pep Guardiola as shaping the football of the future, has been frustrated by his side’s occasional inability to manage games as he would like, but this has been the greatest season in Bournemouth’s history.View image in fullscreenWhat Brentford have achieved with the second-lowest wage bill in the Premier League is remarkable.Photograph: Katie Chan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockOf the 30 richest by revenue in the world, 14 are Premier League clubs. On the one hand, that suggests the strength of the league and the power of its marketing. But that brings its own problems and highlights perhaps the biggest issue football has, which is that almost no one in authority thinks holistically.Money for one or two clubs as, say, the Club World Cup will provide, can unbalance a domestic league. One country prospers and others are left behind. The Champions League now – as a competition to be won rather than a generator of cash – essentially exists for four countries plus Paris Saint-Germain, while others scrabble for crumbs that will make them wealthy enough to ensure domination of their domestic leagues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What Brentford have achieved with the second-lowest wage bill in the Premier League is remarkable, but they are almost uniquely well run. To have even a chance of survival, promoted sides need either a world-leading algorithmic approach to transfers, as Brentford andBournemouthdo, or a manager of rare gifts, such as Marcelo Bielsa (and, perhaps, although he seems rarely thought of in this light, Thomas Frank).And then there are Nottingham Forest, who have shown that it is possible for a side promoted via the playoffs not only to survive but to prosper, even if it has taken 57 signings with a net spend of £125m over the past three years – and afour-point deductionfor breaches of profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) – to do so. Against that, the transfer activity of the side they face on Sunday in what is in effect a straight shootout for Champions League qualification looks almost restrained. Chelsea in the same period have made 42 signings at a net cost of £660m: 99 signings battling it out for Champions League cash feels a perfect symbol of the modern world.This is where the positive impact of PSR can be seen. Manchester United cannot spend their way out of trouble. If Chelsea lose, they will find ambitions restricted. Forest, meanwhile, could suddenly be elevated, probably not to be regular Champions League qualifiers, but at least to be fairly secure in mid-table, adding further heft to the Premier League’s middle class.Which is good for the Premier League, and maintains its traditional strength – recently challenged – as a competition of consistent quality that can be won by more than just a couple of super-clubs. But at the same time, there are consequences for the rest of the pyramid and for the rest of Europe and the world.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueInside footballBournemouthBrentfordNottingham ForestcommentShareReuse this content"

So his pole position for Sunday’s Monaco Grand Prix is a moment to savour, a performance he has been attempting to nail since claiming the No 1 spot at the season-opener in Australia.On a curcuit that rewards confidence and commitment like no other, Norris had both in spades for a mighty lap in the final seconds of qualifying, threading the needle on the streets of Monte Carlo to beat the Ferrari ofCharles Leclercinto second place by 0.109 seconds and his teammate Oscar Piastri into third. Lewis Hamilton suffered a crash in FP3 and Ferrari were able to repair the damage from which he recovered to a strong fourth place. However after the session was concluded the British driver was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Verstappen in Q1.Adrian Newey out to build car that will tempt Max Verstappen to Aston MartinRead moreThe pole is Norris’s first in Monaco and McLaren’s first here since Fernando Alonso took top spot in 2007. It was the perfect comeback after he felt frustrated with his early season form in qualifying. The British driver has struggled to adapt to this year’sMcLaren, particularly over the single lap and has fallen behind Piastri in the title fight.“I’ve been working to improve, to do a better job,” he said. “Today was probably the first time since Australia that I’ve really put it all together. It’s not like I’m driving quicker. I’m driving in a better way, in a smarter way but there’s been a lot of work that’s gone on.“Even if it was pole in any other track, it probably would have been the pole that’s meant the most to me. It probably means even more that it’s in Monaco but more because of what’s happened over the last couple of months. It may not seem like a lot, but for me it’s quite a big thing.”Norris has been insistent he remains confident and the team have been tuning the car to accommodate him better and now might hope he has shrugged off his qualifying hoodoo. Starting at the front of the grid is a chance for him to stage a comeback in a closely fought title race. Piastri leads the British driver by 13 points with Verstappen 22 points back in third.However, the serious business of the weekend remains ahead and therein lies the rub for Norris, asFormula Oneis hoping that his fine lap will not presage another routine procession to victory. Certainly this year Monaco is something of a wild card. With the introduction of the mandatory use of three sets of tyres during the race, all drivers will have to take at least two pit stops in both wet or dry conditions.The rule was introduced in an effort to improve the “sporting spectacle” with overtaking on the narrow track rendered all but impossible by the wide and heavy cars. It was instigated after an early red flag last season allowed a free tyre change, the drivers managing their rubber in a procession to the flag.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton recovered from an early crash to come fourth but then got a three-place penalty.Photograph: Andrej Isaković/APAs is so often the case at Monaco, however, qualifying was an absorbing session that swung between the leading protagonists. In Q3, Norris and Piastri had claimed the top spots and Leclerc could not match them. For the final laps the McLarens once more went out early and Norris was again immense, taking the provisional pole by one hundredth of a second. The pair then stayed out for a cool down lap before going again.Leclerc, however, was far from out of it, and seemed to have done enough only for Norris to snatch pole at the last gasp by a tenth of a second, in 1min 9.959sec.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Afterhis defeat to Matteo Arnaldi in Spain, his third in a row, the 38-year-old pulled out of the Italian Open andended his partnership with Andy Murray.Although he found some form and rhythm in Geneva, Djokovic was second-best for much of the final, narrowly losing the first set before trailing by a break from early the deciding set against Hurkacz. At 4-2 to Hurkacz in set three, the big-serving Pole had not lost a point on serve in the set. As the pressure mounted, and Hurkacz’s forehand crumbled, Djokovic turned the match around before closing out an emphatic final-set tiebreak.Instead of celebrating another stellar achievement, Djokovic will have to immediately shift his focus to the French Open, which begins on Sunday. He will face Mackenzie McDonald of the United States in the first round, a match that is unlikely to take place until Tuesday. He must recover well physically after a hard week.Meanwhile, Emma Raducanu says she is working hard to regain full fitness in time for her first-round match in Paris after struggling with back spasms at theStrasbourg Open against Danielle Collins. “It’s not feeling 100%,” she said. “I had a spasm in Strasbourg and just been trying to manage it as best I can doing treatment.

The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, should be alive, and justice must be meted out to their assailant. This brazen act of political violence in the heart of the nation’s capital only underscores the obvious: all this violence – whether it’s in Washington DC, Gaza, Jenin or Israel, and whether it’s by bullet, bomb or forced starvation – all of it must end, and it must end immediately.What weknowso far is that shortly after 9pm on Wednesday evening, a gunman approached a group of four people who were departing an event at the Capital Jewish Museum that had been hosted by the American Jewish Committee. (It’s beenreportedthat the event “focused on bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza through Israeli-Palestinian and regional collaboration”.) The suspected gunman, identified in media accounts as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, had been seen pacing outside the museum when hespottedthe group of four leaving the building. He opened fire on the group, fatally wounding two at close range. He then entered the building, where he was detained by event security. He can be seen onvideoin handcuffs and chanting “free, free Palestine”.A biblical hatred is engulfing both sides in the Gaza conflict – and blinding them to reason | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreNeedless to say, criminal actions such as this reprehensible murder do not advance the cause of Palestinian liberation or anyone’s freedom. This stupid and horrific act must be opposed not only for its immorality but also because the world needs to focus on pressuring Israel to end its blockade of Gaza and allow the flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory before tens of thousands of Palestinians – including14,000 babies, according to the United Nations – die from forced starvation in the coming days.Already, the Israeli government is using the murder to wag its finger at Israel’s critics and deflect from its own actions. In a press conference in Jerusalem, Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister,blamed“leaders and officials of many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe” for inciting violence against Israel, incitement which he said led “in a direct line … to this murder”.Millions are stating their loud opposition to Israeli actions without resorting to murderous political violence. In fact, that’s exactly what we must doThe idea that European leaders are directly responsible for this heinous murder is nothing short of ridiculous, of course. But it does show how nervous the Israeli government is about a new wave of criticism being directed against its assault on Gaza. Earlier, on 21 May, the UK development minister, Jenny Chapman,toldthe BBC that Israel is “using hunger as a weapon of war” in Gaza. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, alsocalledIsrael’s planned military escalation in Gaza “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive”, and Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, recently stated that Britain “cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve” and that levels of suffering in Gaza were “utterly intolerable”.In addition, the UK has suspended free trade talks with Israel, and EU foreign ministers are reviewing the European Union’s trade agreement with Israel over its blockading of food, water, medicine and other needed supplies for Gazans’ survival. While these actions are welcome, they’re also a case of too little, too late. And despite a partial UK arms embargo on Israel, the UK government stillapproved licensesfor £127.6m of military equipment to Israel, more than the combined total for 2020-23,accordingto the group Campaign Against the Arms Trade.In other words, the violence is intensifying, enabled in part because those who arm Israel continue to do so. It’s also expanding, and not just on to the streets of Washington DC. Consider what happened on the same day as the tragic killing of the Israeli embassy staffers. A delegation of diplomats representing 31 countries were on an official mission to observe the humanitarian situation in the West Bank city of Jenin, which has also been undersustained assaultby Israel for the last 120 days. The Israeli military shot towards the delegation of diplomats, and later claimed the group had “deviated from the approved route”.Once upon a time, to be a diplomat meant you were afforded a certain amount of security, but those were times when we, perhaps naively, believed there were rules governing warfare. What do we have now? Shots fired as diplomats carry out their jobs. Food used as a weapon of war. Young embassy staffers assassinated in public.This killing must end. We all know it, just as we know that it must start with an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the return of all captives taken on 7 October and after, and the full resumption of aid into Gaza. The details of what happens in the medium and long term, for both Israelis and Palestinians, can and must be forged through honest dialogue and not by the mass displacement and extermination of the Palestinian people.But rather than heeding this lesson, we will likely witness in the days ahead an all-out push to discredit those who oppose Israel’s military campaign, which has been labeled a genocide by multipleinternationalhuman rights organizations, among many others. Israel’s foreign minister has already started. In his press conference, Sa’arclaimedthat it was the talk that Israel is committing “genocide, crimes against humanity and murdering babies” that “pave[s] the way exactly for such murders” as happened in Washington DC.But genocide, crimes against humanity and babies being killed are all happening, and millions are stating their loud opposition to Israeli actions without resorting to murderous political violence. In fact, that’s exactly what we must do, and we must do that now, louder and stronger than ever, before this violence grows and spreads further, consuming even more innocent lives in its monstrous path.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionWashington DCGun crimeUS crimePalestinian territoriesWest BankIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

This terrible conflict has made me question thatSat 24 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 10.27 EDTShareIhave seen images on my phone screen these past months that will haunt me as long as I live. Dead, injured, starving children and babies.Childrencrying in pain and in fear for their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers. A small boy shaking in terror from the trauma of an airstrike. Scenes of unspeakable horror and violence that have left me feeling sick. Sometimes I skip over these photos and videos, afraid perhaps of what I will see next. But more often than not, I feel compelled to bear witness.I know I am not alone. So many of us, privileged in our comfort and safety, have watched the suffering of the children ofGazathrough social media, images mixed in jarringly with ads and memes and pictures of other people’s children, smiling and safe. It renders the horror even more immediate: these could be your kids, or mine, or any kid you know, but for the lottery of birth.Many thousands of people have used their voice to speak up for these children and their families, whether in writing to politicians, making donations to charities and aid organisations, or taking to the streets. Yet this war on children continues, and there is an overwhelming sense of powerlessness to help them. It is hard to imagine how it can get any worse, but worse it gets with news this week that14,000 babiesare suffering from severe acute malnutrition, according to the UN. The reason is deliberate starvation: famine as a weapon of war or, as Human Rights Watch puts it, a “tool of extermination”.This overarching sense of impotence when confronted with unimaginable horror is creating a mass sense of moral injury – a form of profound psychological distress that can happen to people when they are forced to act, or indeed not act, in ways that are in direct opposition to their values or moral code. I first came across the term when speaking to medical professionals who were developing PTSD during the pandemic. Doctors, nurses and care workers were in anguish at not always being able to provide treatment to patients who so desperately needed it, owing to a lack of equipment, resources and leadership, and the sheer volume of seriously ill people.Nowhere will this kind of distress be more keenly felt than in Gaza itself. For the medical professionals and aid workers there, sadness, guilt, betrayal, even, that you can’t help everyone must be a daily reality. When it is your job to help, to feed, to treat, being unable to do so is a profound trauma.And for Gaza’s parents it must be torture of the most excruciating degree to see your child crying in hunger and be unable to feed them. I often think of the babies who were in the neonatal intensive care unit under bombardment – that photograph of the newborns in al-Shifa hospital laid seven to a bed to keep them warm and alive. I wonder about their mothers, many of whom will have been forced to give birth without proper pain relief and equipment. Where are they now? How many of them survived? And what did that do to the medics who tried so hard to save them?But I have also started to wonder about the impact of moral injury by proxy and at scale. I am in no way putting it on a par with what people on the ground are experiencing. But that feeling of powerlessness and, as an extension, complicity: what does it do to those around the world who feel what is happening is wrong? What is the impact of witnessing so much profound suffering – even through a screen – and feeling unable to act or to force others to act?I now understand why my mother stopped watching the news after I was born. It was because she couldn’t bear it. I too have felt a temptation to look inwards since having my son, to cocoon us in the warmth and safety of our privileged lives. But the internet means it’s more difficult to detach – the news runs in continuous parallel to our lives, eroding borders. There have been many nights when I have put my son to bed, his belly full, his pyjamas clean and soft, and I have cried silently for these other children who are not being tucked up in warm beds. In the early hours when he would wake for milk, all I had to do was go to the fridge and pour him some, and we would sit, listening not to the sounds of bombs but to the birdsong that seemed to fill the skies.The contrast between his safety and their peril feels to me obscene. Could that be a kind of moral injury? There is something about being in the daily company of a little person – their innocence, their vulnerability, their silliness, their loving nature – that makes the pain of any other child feel like a profound affront. But I know you don’t have to be a parent to feel horror at what is being inflicted on Gaza’s children in the most visceral way. I believe – or at least I used to – that it is ingrained in us, as humans, to feel a collective responsibility towards children, and that this collective responsibility can extend beyond borders.What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreFeeling powerless in the face of such egregious injustice can result in a loss of trust or faith, not just in governments and institutions but also in the moral order of the world, and its ability to protect children. I wonder what the impact of this will be: will it, as certain politicians no doubt hope, result in a numbness that presents as indifference? Traumatic events can result in a lack of affect – millions more people should be marching and raising their voice – but they can also be channelled into righteous anger.I certainly feel a profound loss of faith. Something I felt to be true about humanity – that people are fundamentally good, that we owe it to children to protect them – has shifted because of this conflict. I walk around with a feeling of heaviness that I cannot seem to shake. Thousands of miles from Gaza, I am changed by the past 18 months. I have learned that, for some people, compassion for children has political limits. What does one do with that terrible knowledge once it sits inside you like a leaden stone? I don’t seem be able to find an answer.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But in the British city where slaver Edward Colston’s statue was pulled down, I found cause for optimismSat 24 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 03.20 EDTShareIt has been five years since George Floyd, a Black man who lived in Minneapolis, wasmurderedby Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. The killing, captured in a distressing 10-minute video that quickly flooded social media timelines, sparked something that felt like an international revolution: protests took place across the world, forcing countries and cities to reckon with their present and historical treatment of Black people.In Britain, protests reached fever pitch when activists in Bristoltoppled a statueof Edward Colston, the slave trader and deputy governor of the Royal African Company, and hurled it into the harbour. Bristol, once a major slave-trading port, had maintained a veneration of Colston that was increasingly divisive. The statue in particular had been a key focus of tensions: attempts to add a second plaque acknowledging Colston’s role in the slave trade werefrustrated in 2018. For many Bristolians, the direct action provided a moment of long-overdue relief.Colston now resides, supine, inside the city’s M Shed museum. Visiting earlier this month, I felt that this had been a worthy outcome: he no longer towers over Bristolians in a kind of psychological domination, yet nor has he simply been made invisible. The statue has been historicised within that specific moment in 2020 andcontextualised against a timelineof Bristol’s connections with transatlantic slavery. It is one of the key successes of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.But five years on, the bigger questions still remain. What are the real, felt consequences of that moment? Speaking to people visiting Colston, I asked a 70-year-old white man called David, who has lived in Bristol since 2011, if he felt that the toppling and theBlack Lives Matter movementhad made a real difference to the city. He told me that there is “a lot more to be done to change the way people think”, and then informed me that, about half a mile away, outside Colston’s former plinth, was a hard-right demonstration organised by the UK Independence party. They were calling for mass deportations and lamenting the supposed “destruction” of the city by “far-left thugs”. I went to check it out.Though they were outnumbered by counter-protesters, the hard-right protesters were there – making grimly visible that there is clearly still a battle under way for the heart, soul and mind of this country. Yemi, a 22-year-old counter-protester carrying a Jamaican flag, told me: “I actually think the BLM protests fuelled even more hate on their side – because they saw how many people were against racism and Colston, it caused more hate in them and they felt more entitled to protest. So I don’t think much has changed.” She also thought that the statue should have been left in the water. “The harbour is where they brought us in from. I thought it was very fitting for it to stay there.”It is easy to look back at 2020 and feel fascinated, aggrieved, even fooled. I find it quite strange to reflect on. The murder of an African American man led to a kind of “gold rush” in Britain and in the US, where, particularly in the cultural sector, money and opportunities were handed to Black people as an apology for decades of neglect and underinvestment.Many of these gains and commitments have petered out. In the US, the Black portraiture “boom” of 2020 has come to ascreeching halt, with Black art now going unsold. In the UK, the number of Black writers publishing books hasplummeted since 2020. While dispiriting, this could have been foreseen, considering how opportunistic and cynical the industry can be. A Black man named Patrick Hutchinson landed a book deal simply for having carried a far-right protesterover his shoulder. There were only 152 days between the event and the book’s publication. I have not heard much from Patrick since then. You can buy the book for £2.15 on Amazon.View image in fullscreenPlacards from a BLM demonstration in Manchester are left next to a mural of George Floyd, 6 June 2020.Photograph: AlamyMuch of the response also became unfocused to the point of parody and distraction. Politicians “taking the knee” became an internet meme. Theremoval of episodesfrom shows such as The Mighty Boosh and The Dukes of Hazzard from streaming platforms was an overreaction that mostactivists did not ask for, and seemed to take oxygen out of the movement.Disputes over pop culture began to obscure the target of the protests: police violence, and how it disproportionately affects Black people in the US, the UK and all over the world. Five years on, this problem is still very much with us.In March, Julian Cole, who had been in a minimal conscious state after being violently arrested by Bedfordshire police officers in May 2013,died in hospitalat the age of 31. To date, the Crown Prosecution Service has not brought charges against the officers responsible,citing a lack of evidence. In 2022, it was revealed that, two years previously, a 15-year-old Black school girl in Hackney,Child Q, had been strip-searched by police and that racism was likely a contributing factor. The disciplinary hearing for a gross misconduct case has beendelayed until this year. Last year,there was indignationafter Metropolitan police officer Martyn Blake was acquitted of the murder of an unarmed Black man, Chris Kaba, who he shot dead in 2022. (Blake is set to face agross misconduct hearing.)Meanwhile, any progress made since 2020 to address the institutional racism of police forces in Britain has come under significant political pressure.Campaigners have been frustratedat the stalling of police reform, with Black-led organisations at a Stephen Lawrence Day conference calling on the government to complete a follow-up to the 2023Casey report, to set about a real transformation of the force. There has also been a sinister inversion of reality after last summer’s “race riots”: the swift justice response led to themyth of “two-tier policing”, suggesting that police are more heavy-handed with white, far-right protesters, despiteactual evidence of biasagainst young Black people.It’s easy to forget but the Colston Four, who toppled the statue, were subject to a gruellingtwo-year legal battle(they were acquitted by a jury of criminal damage).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The dynamic of an uprising quickly reaching its peak before petering out and even triggering a backlash can feel disappointing. But it is typical for the course of history that great moments of social upheaval are eventually cannibalised or absorbed into a status quo, with participants left feeling thwarted, or even sheepish about their optimism. As my Guardian colleague Nesrine Malik wrote of theperceived failure of the Arab spring: “What the Arab spring came up against was a universal conundrum – how to convert the forces that demand equality into those that deliver it.”The muscle memory of those protests was certainly built on to the benefit of mobilising pro-Palestinian marches across the country in the wake of the onslaught against Gaza. And longer-term projects are unfolding – BLM UK’sinvestment of £350,000into funding Black-led organisations is a real success, while several organisations that had historically profited from enslavement pledged reparatory action in the wake of Colston’s toppling, including the Guardian, with itsLegacies of Enslavementprogramme.At M Shed inBristoltoo, I was reminded of the importance of planting those small seeds of change. A small white child walking out of the museum asked his mother what “I can’t breathe” meant, as he read it on one of the placards surrounding Colston. His mother began to calmly explain everything that happened in 2020. We might lament the lack of true progress in racial justice, but we can be confident that a blueprint for education, resistance and mobilisation has been established by that moment. Next time, and there will be a next time, we will be better primed to go. With the challenge of a surging global right, it will be more urgent than ever to retain focus and not repeat mistakes.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

If this sounds like the stuff of speculative fiction, it’s because there’s literally a Handmaid’s Taleepisodeabout this. And while the TV show based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 book may have gotten many things right about the soul of authoritarianism and a violently patriarchal society, living that reality is even more sickening.Fetus of brain-dead Georgia woman kept alive due to abortion ban is growing, says familyRead moreAnyone who thinks this is about the life of Adriana Smith’s child is fooling themselves. This is the state, boundary testing to see how far they can take their efforts to have full reproductive control over American women, and gauging how much the American public is willing to tolerate.It isunclearwhether Smith’s baby will survive, and according to the family, Emory University Hospital is keeping her on life support because the hospital is afraid of contravening Georgia law. Meanwhile, state lawmakers and abortion rights opponents have put their hands up and don’t want to be associated with the optics of this tragic mess. In a mid-May press release, the Georgia attorney general’s officeclarifiedthat the state’s anti-abortion law does not require Smith be kept alive.“There is nothing in the Life Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” the statement reads. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”So who is responsible for this? And are we to believe thatGeorgialawmakers are powerless to stop this hospital’s apparent misreading of the state’s own rules? Even if the latter were the case, the damage from conservatives’ anti-abortion crusades and the ensuing legislative crackdown has already been done. Hospitals such as Emory have no incentive to weigh the ethical implications of their actions because they have the spirit of the law to consider, regardless of how lawmakers try to play semantic tricks to get around their own culpability.When it comes to public opinion,some have arguedin favor of this nightmare based on the fact that Smith is brain dead, and so keeping her alive doesn’t actually “harm” her. What’s next? Women in comas being impregnated because … why not? Vulnerable women being lobotomized and used as incubators? Should the state be able to forcefully impregnate every woman whose body is capable of carrying a baby? Where does it stop?Meanwhile, all the conservative posturing over the sanctity of human life is easily dismantled when you consider the fact that banning abortions effectively issues a death sentence to any pregnant person who is at risk. And what about the issues that took Smith to the hospital to begin with? Her family says she went to see doctors at around eight weeks pregnant with intense headaches, and received medication the same day. The next day, she woke up gasping for air, and was rushed back to the hospital where doctors discovered blood clots in her brain. Smith was declared brain dead shortly after.Black women are themost likelyto die during childbirth, are most likely to experience pregnancy-related complications and regularly see their issues dismissed and minimized when they seek help. Was Smith’s life not valuable when she was here? Why is the body of a brain dead woman receiving more care than she did when she was alive?Stories like Smith’s are also a grim reminder of how desperate society is right now to reduce women to their reproductive capacity. From draconian laws that force women to endure life-threatening pregnancies, to the trad-wife and pronatalism renaissance, it’s clear that women’s ability or willingness to carry babies is the political and ethical lightning rod of our time, and the “life” of a foetus has become a convenient tool to wield in the efforts to control women’s bodies.But Black women have always known this. And Smith’s story is deeply triggering for a demographic that has not only seen the worst of what childbearing in the US medical system is like, but also has a history of being used as test dummies for gynaecological experimentation.“We didn’t have a choice or a say about it,” Smith’s mother, April Newkirk,said. “We want the baby. That’s a part of my daughter. But the decision should have been left to us – not the state.”It should go without saying that a person’s agency should be respected whether they’re conscious or not, but we’ve gotten so used to seeing women’s bodies as a means to a political or economic end that ideas like this no longer register as what they are – utterly unconscionable.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionGeorgiaReproductive rightsAbortionGenderHealthUS healthcarecommentShareReuse this content"

Between the hours of dawn and midnight, with a few lactic minutes in between, I am a feeding machine for a new person.And it is this, perhaps, that has led to my somewhat strange new eating habits. Pregnancy may traditionally be the time associated withcravings and aversions– the old cliches of sardines and jam, coal and creosote, bread and crackers. But here, in my postnatal feeding frenzy, I’m eating nettles by the handful. I am chomping on sticky weed. I have beenbiting the heads off dandelions(bitter – like really serious dark chocolate) and sucking the nectar from inside honeysuckle. This recent chlorophyll gala has, of course, coincided with England’s greatest month: May. Some of us love the look of May, some of us enjoy the smells. But for me, this year, the greatest heady, verdant, leaf-rich pleasure of my life is to eat May by the bushel.The sheer amount of dilute dog pee I’m ingesting must be through the roof, I suppose, but I don’t really care. The number of edible plants and flowers in Britain right now is dazzling. My latest love is a plant called hedge garlic. Or, if you’re in the Midlands like me, Jack by the hedge (he sounds like the villain from a Grimms’ fairytale, or the kind of singer-songwriter we all regrettably slept with in our twenties).Alliaria petiolata, to give it its Latin name, is a wild member of the brassica family and has a thin, whitish taproot scented like horseradish, triangular-to-heart-shaped leaves and small white flowers. Friends, once you see it, it’s everywhere. You can eat it from towpaths and bike lanes and public parks if, like me, you’re not embarrassed to be seen bending down beside a lamp-post and pulling up your lunch.View image in fullscreenHedge garlic growing in Suffolk.Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianIf you don’t live in the sort of lush, woodland world where wild garlic covers the ground like concrete then hedge garlic is a fantastic alternative; the taste is oniony, garlicky and even a little mustardy. Of course, like absolutely everything that grows wild, it has a toxic lookalike in the form of lily of the valley. In fact, once you start Googling, pretty much everything edible seems to have a potentially dangerous twin, from mushrooms to flowers to roots. Buttercups are extremely poisonous, as are daffodils.So please make sure you are referring either to an expert or a very well illustrated book before you start to chow down on your local undergrowth, and it’s a good idea to wash anything you pick in salt water to get rid of insects, as well as dog wee. But to be extra safe you could stick to these few, extremely identifiable friends: nettles (both the leaves and the seeds), dandelions, clover, sticky weed (that plant that people squished against your school jumper when you were little and is sometimes known as cleavers) and daisies. A friend of mine serves up slices of bread and butter topped with daisies to her small children as a mind-bending treat. She is yet to be burned as a witch.Of course, I am in the incredibly privileged position of living somewhere in which food is, to a greater or lesser degree, widely available. I am able to boil rice and buy eggs and stock up on strawberries because I am a relatively wealthy woman living in a country that has not quite, as yet, cut itself off entirely from global food markets. I am not eating undergrowth out of necessity, and for this I am grateful every day.Am I worried about the sewage in our rivers and the microplastics in our soil and the pesticides leaking into our ponds? Of course I am. But it is also true that Britain right now is a lush and emerald salad bar that I cannot hold back from. Pesto, bhajis, soups, salads, pizzas, pakoras, fritters, sauces – I’m putting these plants in everything. I’m literally mowing down the greenery around my house, munching through the stalks and leaves like a small, pink horse in a pair of plimsolls and I don’t care who sees. Because my iron levels are up, my skin is good and it’s all gloriously free.Just imagine what I’ll be like when the apples and blackberries arrive.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Better than our grandparents’ generation, who swept their complicity under a thick rug of silence. Better even than our parents,whose revoltsin the late 1960s rarely led to any serious reckoning with the legacy of the Holocaust.Born in the late 1980s, my generation learned about Auschwitz early on. We visited former concentration camps and studied the Nazi regime not as an alien aberration, but as a warning: this is how democracies die. Today, with the far-right AfD and ethno-chauvinismon the rise, that warning has never felt more urgent.In the run-up to the Germangeneral election in February, tens of thousands marched against the AfD. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency hasclassified the partyas rightwing extremist, and the new government has pledged to keep cooperation with it toa bare minimum.And yet much of the resistance feels hollow. Germany’s vigilance against revisionism is selective at best. This week, the winners of Germany’s most highly endowed journalism award – the Herbert Quandt Media prize –were announced. The awardexplicitly celebratesthe legacy ofHerbert Quandt, an early SS supporter who played a central role in the Naziwar economy. Quandt oversaw battery plants where thousands were abused, exploited – and killed.With his father, Günther Quandt, Herbert Quandtsubjected up to 57,500 peopleto slave labour in battery factories. The Quandt family fortune was built on these crimes. Günther Quandt acquired Jewish-owned companies after Nazi expropriations (so-called Aryanisations). Herbert Quandt personally helped secure some of those deals and oversaw the planning of a satellite concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. After the war, he continued to work with hardline former Nazis from Joseph Goebbels’ propaganda ministry.The Quandts were “denazified” through a superficial process that in effect shielded them from any serious accountability. In 1960, Herbert Quandt became BMW’s largest shareholder. Today, his heirs, Germany’s richest family, control BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and hold major stakes in the country’s chemical and tech sectors.In 2007, aTV documentaryexposed the extent of the family’s Nazi-era crimes. The Quandts responded by commissioningan independent studythat revealed even deeper entanglements with the Nazi regime. Gabriele Quandt, Günther Quandt’s granddaughter, later said herfamily had been “wrong”to avoid confronting the truth about its Nazi past for so long.But journalists from Die Zeit, Der Spiegel and Germany’s public broadcasterscontinue to line up for the prize – in effecthelping to whitewash the legacyof a figure who, even after the war, aligned himself with former Nazi propagandists once tasked with silencing the free press. What does that say about German media organisations? About the stories Germany tells about itself – and the ones it refuses to tell?The annual award, founded in 1986, comes with a €50,000 prize fund. This year, it went to Die Zeit and three public broadcasters, selected from 230 submissions. That’s 230 journalists applying for an award named after a man who – in any just world – would have stood trial for war crimes. If the contenders had misgivings, they were apparently insufficient to keep them from applying.Nor does accepting the Quandt prize appear to carry any reputational risk in Germany, with even progressive outlets seeing the prize money as welcome support for quality journalism. This is not AfD-style revisionism, but it is a form of amnesia, cloaked in liberal respectability. The jury includes some of Germany’s leading media figures from titles as prominent as Handelsblatt and Axel Springer’s Bild and Welt.But this isn’t just a story about the Quandts. It points to a broader German refusal to confront the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide. Some of Germany’s wealthiest families – includingFlick,Porsche,BahlsenandStoschek– built their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labour. As the Dutch journalist David de Jonghas documentedin his book, Nazi Billionaires, most of them were seamlessly absorbed into West Germany’sso-called economic miracle. Many defend their legacies to this day – or, like the Quandts, use prizes toburnish their modern philanthropic standing.This kind of amnesia isn’t limited to boardrooms. Streets across Germanystill bear the namesof colonial administrators. In several cities, you can walk down Lüderitzstraße or Wissmannstraße – street names honouring men who helped orchestrate Germany’s genocide in today’s Namibia and brutal colonial campaigns across other parts of Africa. The German government stillrefuses to pay reparationsto the descendants of the Herero and Nama people, the primary victims of its genocide in Namibia – offering instead “development” aid packages negotiated not with the descendants of victims, but with the Namibian state.After the war, Germany rebuilt its international reputation on its policy of officially acknowledging its past crimes. But that reckoning is carefully curated – embraced when it flatters Germany’s self-image, ignored when it threatens personal gain or broader strategic interests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A few hours later, Wadephul stood at a press conference in Jerusalem andexpressed “understanding”of Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza.Friedländer, who had died days earlier aged 103, spent her final years warning against dehumanisation. The contrast could hardly have been starker.It’s easy to condemn the past when it costs nothing. Speaking out about enduring injustice or the atrocities of your allies takes more courage.Germany’s current approach to remembrance culture is selective and contradictory. The government relies on “historical responsibility” to refrain from challenging the Israeli government for its abuses in Gaza. Yet at home, the political and media class seems in denial about cultural patronage enabled by fortunes made possible by Nazi-era crimes.My argument is not about rebranding an individual media award. It is about the continued collective lack of accountability and transparency when it comes to the Nazi era. In the current political climate it is also about asking if postwar Germany’s “never again” promise retains its meaning, or is being reduced to a slogan, observed only when convenient.Hanno Hauenstein is a Berlin-based journalist and author.

KCNA said the rehabilitation plan was pushing ahead.South Korea’s military said US and Seoul intelligence authorities assessed that North Korea’s “side-launch attempt” of the ship failed, and the vessel was left listing in the water.View image in fullscreenNorth Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called the launch accident a ‘criminal act caused by absolute carelessness’.Photograph: KCNA/ReutersKCNA, however, reported that an “underwater and internal inspection of the warship confirmed that, unlike the initial announcement, there were no holes made at the warship’s bottom”, calling the extent of the damage “not serious”.Satellite imagery shows the warship, covered in blue tarpaulins, lying on its side, with the stern swung out into the harbour, but the bow remaining on the side slipway, according to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.Based on its size and scale, the South Korean military said the newly built warship is believed to be similarly equipped to the 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea launched last month.Pyongyang has said the Choe Hyon is equipped with the “most powerful weapons”, and that it would “enter into operation early next year”.Seoul’s military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to help Moscow fight Ukraine.Analysts say the warship involved in Wednesday’s accident may have also been constructed with Russian assistance.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaAsia PacificKim Jong-unnewsShareReuse this content"

The new rates would come into effect from 1 June.The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, posted on X after a call with the US trade representative Jamieson Greer and the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick: “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both.“The European Commission remains ready to work in good faith. EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump had posted on Truth Social, the social media website he owns: “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on trade, has been very difficult to deal with.”He went on to claim there was a $250m annual trade deficit with the EU. “Our discussions with [the EU] are going nowhere,” he said, before adding there would be no tariffs for products built or manufactured in the US.Trump later told reporters: “I’m not looking for a deal – we’ve set the deal,” before immediately adding that a big investment in the US by a European company might make him open to a delay.The EU is one of the US’s largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (€528bn; £443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.The US imposed a 20% “reciprocal” rate on most EU goods from 2 April, but halved them a week later to allow for trade talks. It has kept 25% import taxes on steel, aluminium and vehicle parts in place and has threatened similar moves on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other goods.In the same press conference, Trump said hemight add a 25% levy on all Apple and Samsungphonesbought by US customers. That would be in place at the end of June, he said.

The French trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, said Trump’s new threats did nothing to help negotiations.“We are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but we are ready to respond,” he wrote on X.The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told the Ansa news agency that the aim remained “zero-for-zero tariffs”.Speaking to reporters in The Hague, the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, backed the EU’s strategy in trade talks and said the EU was likely to see this latest announcement as part of the negotiations. “We have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US,” he said.Micheál Martin, the Irish taoiseach, said Trump’s suggestion was “extremely disappointing”. He continued: “I have always been clear in my view that tariffs are damaging to all sides.”In a statement posted on X, he said: “Tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up, they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships, as well as disrupting wider global trade.“We do not need to go down this road. Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward.”The head of the EU’s trade committee, the German MEP Bernd Lange, has threatened to apply counter-tariffs against the US. “We will not allow ourselves to be pressured and will objectively attempt to begin negotiations next week,” he said in comments reported by the GermanDie Weltnewspaper. “If the negotiations are unsuccessful, the European Union is strong enough to implement countermeasures, such as counter-tariffs, to offset the economic damage.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionDonald TrumpEuropeUS foreign policyStock marketsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Two others remain in hospital.A 41-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder and remained in custody, the Met police said.Reading a statement at the scene in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, Supt Steve Allen, from the Met’s local policing team, said: “I can confirm a woman and three of her children died at the scene.“A further two members of the same family were taken to hospital and continue to receive treatment.”He added: “The wider family have been informed, and officers will continue to support them at this incredibly difficult time.“We remain in the early stages of our investigation. However, one man was arrested outside the house. He remains in custody and is being questioned by officers.”Officers were called at 1.22am to help the London fire brigade, who were tackling the blaze.Eight fire engines and about 70 firefighters were sent to the site, the LFB said.

Honestly, you have no idea how close they came to pulling us.”During their set at the Coachella festival in California in April, the Belfast band led the crowd in chants of “free, free Palestine” and displayed messages on the stage’s screens including: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people”. After the performance, the band’s manager, Daniel Lambert, said they had received death threats.View image in fullscreenKneecap’s Naoise O Caireallain, right, and JJ O’Dochartaigh holding up a Palestinian flag on stage in Brockwell Park.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/GettyThe band’s commitment to speaking out on Gaza remained unaffected by the recent controversy, however. The band donated their fee for the Wide Awake headline slot to Médecins Sans Frontières.Outside the park gates, Laura Tiernan, 56, from the Socialist Equality party, handed out leaflets expressing support for Kneecap. She said: “There’s been enormous support for the band and for the stand they’re taking. People have come to listen to their music but also to show their solidarity.“At stake here are fundamental issues of democratic rights to stand up for a people who are being ethnically cleansed and are the victims of a genocide,” Tiernan said.The trio staged a surprise gig in central London on Thursday in response to the terrorism charge against Ó hAnnaidh.View image in fullscreenKneecap performing in front of a ‘Free Palestine’ backdrop at the Wide Awake festival.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/GettyEarlier in the day, the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke from the main stage and called for the UK government to halt arms sales to Israel. “The idea that the last vision of life that so many emaciated, hungry, desperate children should see is a fence at the edge of Gaza and beyond that fence lies food, lies water, lies medicine, lies anaesthetics and antiseptics and all the things they need – they are being deliberately starved to death,” he said.Hours before their performance on Friday night, Kneecap released a new single titled The Recap, which opens with a Sky News bulletin about the counter-terrorism investigation into the band.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Conversely, such arrangements are rare in east Asia, where office-centric culture prevails, and most full-time workers in Japan and South Korea still commute daily to the office.The popularity of home working in the UK has previously been attributed to the cost and length of commuting, particularly in London and south-east England.“This isn’t just a post-pandemic hangover – British workers have clearly decided they’re not going back to the old ways. Remote work has moved from being an emergency response to becoming a defining feature of the UK labour market,” said Dr Cevat Giray Aksoy, a G-SWA co-founder and associate professor at King’s College London.“This shift is forcing businesses, policymakers, and city planners to reimagine everything from office space to transport to regional growth,” added Aksoy, who is also an associate research director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.Despite the introduction ofstrict return-to-office mandatesat a handful of large companies, including the retail company Amazon and theasset management firm BlackRock, home working levels have stabilised in the UK since 2023, in what the researchers called a “labour market equilibrium”.Men and women work from home at similar rates in every leading region of the world, the study found, although the desire for home working is strongest among women with children. Parents surveyed said they were more likely to adopt hybrid work, while those without children prefer either fully office-based or fully remote working models.Younger respondents showed a stronger preference for working from the office, as a way to get noticed by senior colleagues, or to learn informally from their peers.“Hybrid work is no longer the exception, it’s the expectation,” Aksoy said, adding that the research had not found any strong evidence that remote work came at the cost of productivity for organisations.This could not, however, be said for fully remote roles. “Its impact on productivity varies dramatically depending on the type of job and how it’s managed,” Aksoy said. “In many cases, fully remote roles are concentrated in call centres or data entry, jobs that are already under pressure from automation and AI.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By late 2024, 55% of women said they would seek a new job if required to return to the office full-time.Researchers have previously suggested that some companies have issued strict return-to-office mandates as a way to shed excess staff hired under fully remote arrangements during the pandemic.​Explore more on these topicsWorking from homeWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

Scotland has had a right to roam since 2003.In opposition, Labourcommitted toa Scottish-style right to roam, where there would be an assumed right for English people to walk around the countryside. However, theparty U-turnedafter pressure from countryside groups.The environment secretary, Steve Reed, has ruled out the idea, saying: “Our intention is to increase access to the countryside, but in a responsible way, not as a free-for-all.”Phil Brickell, theLabourMP for Bolton West, said: “The barriers preventing millions of people from enjoying and caring for our countryside are a legacy of a bygone era and urgently need replacing.“It’s time to resolve the issues of access to the English countryside once and for all. That must mean legislating for a widespread right to roam covering land and water, which removes access islands, allows responsible wild camping in national parks and increases connectivity to nature for everyone, regardless of where you live.”Andy MacNae, the Labour MP for Rossendale and Darwen, added: “It’s a relief that the supreme court have recognised the range of activities that make up outdoor recreation. The government now have the opportunity to build on this, not only expanding our right to access nature but also the activities we can enjoy when in it, such as kayaking, climbing or wild camping.“At the heart of this must be an effort to expand access to the widest possible group of people. Nature should be there in our cities, towns and new housing developments, so that anyone can access green or blue spaces within 15 minutes.”The two MPs are part of a new all-party parliamentary group for outdoor recreation and access to nature that will be producing research and calling on the government to extend access to nature.Alex Sobel, the MP for Leeds Central, said of the ruling: “We need to make this the start of a much wider access to nature than people currently enjoy.”The Liberal Democrats are also calling for greater rights of access over the English countryside, starting with a legal right to wild camp across the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In opposition, Labour spoke about extending the right to wild camp across the UK. I hope they will put those words into action and expand access rights for walkers and campers across the country.”There are fears that government policy will reduce access to green spaces for people across England. The Guardian has recently revealed that housing developerswill be able to buildon once-protected green spaces without having to replace the loss of nature in nearby areas.New nature areas, parks and community gardens created to offset the removal of green spaces to make way for housing developments may not even have to be in the same county, under the new planning and infrastructure bill.The government is resisting attempts to enshrine legal access over more of the English countryside.The nature minister Mary Creagh said: “Wild camping under the stars is one of life’s great pleasures, so I welcome today’s ruling which upholds that right on Dartmoor’s common land. This government is passionate about bringing people closer to nature by creating nine national river walks and three new national forests.”Explore more on these topicsLand rightsLand ownershipLabourDartmoorAccess to green spaceGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Some are pointing to the polarized political climate in the Trump-led country, which itself is mounting an aggressive immigration-related crackdown.Muhunthan Paramesvaran, an immigration lawyer at Wilsons Solicitors in London,told the New York Timesthat inquiries had risen “in the immediate aftermath of the election and the various pronouncements that were made”.“There’s definitely been an uptick in inquiries from US nationals,” Paramesvaran told the outlet. “People who were already here may have been thinking: ‘I want the option of dual citizenship in the event that I don’t want to go back to the US.’”Zeena Luchowa, a partner at Laura Devine Immigration, which specializes in US migration to the UK, was more explicit in pointing to the “political landscape” amid Trump’s government. Luchowa told the outlet that the rise was not limited to US nationals – but also other nationalities living there.“The queries we’re seeing are not necessarily about British citizenship – it’s more about seeking to relocate,” Luchowa said to the Times.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of the 5,521 settlement applications from US citizens last year, most were from people who were eligible via spousal or family links.Paramesvaran said such applications were likely to climb because the UK government had extended the qualification period from five years to 10 before they could apply for settlement. But Labour government politicians have hinted that some applicants may be able to skirt those requirements.That echoes one aspect of Trump’s thinking in the US, where he has floated the idea of an immigration “gold card” – in essence, an extension of theEB-5program that extends green cards to foreign investors and their families.TheUK home secretary, Yvette Cooper, told parliamentearlier in May that “there will be provisions to qualify more swiftly that take account of the contribution people have made” and said the British government “will introduce new, higher language requirements” because “the ability to speak English is integral to everyone’s ability to contribute and integrate”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationImmigration and asylumUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The owner of another grave, who did not wish to be named, said she was also prepared to pay the £3,000 cost to exhume her husband, and would demand reimbursement from the cemetery.Anna Seifert-Speck is also considering exhuming the remains of her husband, Simon Speck, a sociologist who died in 2019. “I am thinking of exhuming him. I’m planning to be buried there myself and I’m not prepared to be put behind a wall. It is over my dead body, in both senses of the term.”View image in fullscreenPlans for the gardener’s building at Highgate cemetery have outraged grave owners.Illustration: Highgate cemeteryPigott-Smith’s widow, the actor Pamela Miles, said the building would be a “horrific” intrusion to a “wonderfully tranquil place”. She said that beforePigott-Smith died in 2017,they had loved going to the cemetery after doing charity readings on the site. “I bought a double grave on the mound when my husband died, intending when I died to join him there,” Miles said in a planning objection to Camden council.She added: “Grief is a very powerful emotion and needs peace and quiet in beautiful surroundings. This building is a disgrace and an insult to caring loved ones.”She also accused the cemetery’s owners of being “grossly underhand” in failing to consult grave owners about the plans.Catherine Hall, an emerita professor of history at University CollegeLondon, said she was not considering exhuming her husband’s remains but was “very distressed” by the planned building. “It’s awful and it’s so close to Stuart. It must be altered. I don’t see how Camden can pass it with such strong opposition.”She added: “The building would impinge in deeply troubling ways on the vistas, the peace and the tranquillity that are so important to our capacity to visit Stuart’s grave and mourn his passing.”View image in fullscreenStuart Hall’s grave in the mound area of Highgate cemetery.Photograph: Matthew Weaver/The GuardianOthers objecting to the building say it would spoil the views looking south from Karl Marx’s tomb. Sara Wood, the widow of the architectNicholas Wood, who died in 2021, described the building as an “urbanised box” with “prison-like windows”.In her objection to the plans, she wrote: “The path from the Karl Marx tomb will have an intrusive garage-like shed poking up, and his actual burial place will lose its quiet, isolated, historic charm.”The owners of the site, the Friends of Highgate Cemetery (FHC), have promised to look again at the details of the proposed building but they claim that no alternative site is available.Hall said: “They say they’ve looked at everything, but have they? I’m disturbed and upset by the insensitivity of the trustees to the feelings and expectations to those of us who are grave holders.”Ian Dungavell, the chief executive of FHC, said: “We have apologised for the upset that the proposals have caused.” He said revised plans for the gardener’s building, including changing the entrance to a lower level and preventing public access to the toilet, would be discussed with grave owners at a meeting on 3 June.But he defended the location of the building: “We wish could put it somewhere else, but despite extensive looking we haven’t been able to come up with another location.”He added: “There are other buildings in the cemetery that are very close to graves. These are facilities for the gardening team who look after the entire 36-acre site.”Dungavell conceded that grave owners should have been consulted earlier in the planning process, and blamed the delay on the cemetery’s database. But he said those who objected still had an opportunity to influence the plans.Explore more on these topicsLondonTim Pigott-SmithStuart HallDeath and dyingLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

She declined to rule out narrowing or replacing EHCPs altogether.EHCPs outline the exact support a child with Send should receive in school, potentially including one-to-one assistance, speech and language therapy, tailored teaching strategies or specialist equipment.Without an EHCP, schools are under no legal duty to meet a child’s specific needs.For many families an EHCP is the only mechanism they can use to secure specialist help for their child, especially in mainstream state schools where most children with Send are taught.Some plans apply in special schools, which are set up for high-needs provision. Private schools are not legally required to deliver EHCPs and councils are not obliged to fund them, though some do so by agreement.Asked whether ministers would scrap or restrict EHCPs, McKinnell said: “No decisions have been taken yet on how we deliver …. The change we want to see is just better support for children at the earliest stage possible. And clearly the system we’ve inherited is not delivering that.”She added: “Parents have a real battle to get support that should be ordinarily available in school.” Pressed again, she said: “I think parents would agree that if we had a well-functioning system, if we had that good early support, then you wouldn’t need a complex legal process to access an education.“Even when families secure an EHCP, it doesn’t necessarily deliver the education that’s been identified … We’re listening to parents. We’re working on a new system. It’s not fixed yet.”The Department for Education’s strategic adviser on Send, Dame Christine Lenehan, said this month that the government was questioning whether EHCPs were “the right vehicle”.12:57How children with special educational needs are being failed in England – videoOn Friday, the government announced a £3m expansion of its early language support for every child (Elsec) scheme, which integrates speech and language specialists into nurseries and schools to identify Send needs earlier.McKinnell said the Elsec programme, which has already supported 20,000 children, would be extended for another year and expanded to reach thousands more children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The more we can do that at the earliest stage, the more we can save families the challenge and stress of having to seek out support.”More than 576,000 children and young people in England had an EHCP as of January 2024. But only half of new plans were issued on time last year, according to government statistics. Hundreds of families have been waiting for more than a year.The system has become so overwhelmed that more than 21,000 parents appealed to tribunals last year, often just to get an assessment or basic provision in place. Families won in 95% of cases.Since taking office last July,Labourhas pledged to address the longstanding challenges within Send provision, which has been described as hostile to families, aiming to create a more inclusive and efficient system.Campaigners say the legal protections at the heart of Send provision must not be sacrificed.Katie Ghose, the chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, said: “Hundreds of thousands of children rely on these plans to go to school safely and learn. This would represent a fundamental break from four decades of political consensus that disabled children need legal guarantees to access education. Without that, the government risks sending more children out of school and into a system where their needs are simply not met.”Tania Tirraoro, the co-director of Special Needs Jungle, said: “We won’t accept the removal of disabled children’s rights without a fight. This isn’t about improving provision – it’s about saving money. If EHCPs are taken away from mainstream settings, early years and 16- to 25-year-olds outside special schools will lose protection too. That will push more children into special schools, alternative provision, or out of education entirely.“It seems like this Labour government has launched an entire assault on disabled people of all ages, including the Pip [personal independence payments] cuts and removing universal credit from under-22s, including disabled young people unable to work. Do they want to support disabled people to thrive or not?”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsChildrenChildren's healthMental healthSchoolsPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision means the end of centuries of meat and fish trading in the capital.Three fishmongers fromRidley Road marketin Hackney say they depend on Billingsgate for their business and will go bust if it closes down. Along with their spokesperson Alicia Weston, the founder of Bags of Taste, which teaches cooking skills to people living in poverty, they are fighting to stop parliament from rubber stamping the markets’ closure.The corporation, the governing body that runs London’s Square Mile, is the owner and operator of both sites, but is not permitted to close down the markets independently.A quirk of their long and storied pasts, the markets were established by acts of parliament that fix them to the existing sites. This means they canonly be closed when parliament passes a private bill, repealing the legislation and allowing the land to be used for other purposes.The markets have been granted a stay of execution until 2028. In the meantime, the corporation has said it is offering compensation to Smithfield and Billingsgate traders and is helping them find new locations, but is no longer planning to build a joint replacement site.Fishmongers Waheed Aslam, Zafar Iqbal and Mohammed Amjad Choudry have objected to the bill, and they say they have the support of a small group of MPs who are opposed to the closure.The Mediterranean fish shop on Ridley Road was started 30 years ago by Aslam’s father. Aslam and his business partner Aras Swara, visit Billingsgate market, the UK’s largest inland fish market, early in the morning, five days a week, to choose fresh sea bream, snapper, salmon and coley for the shop.View image in fullscreenWorkers at the Mediterranean Fish Shop at Ridley Road market, one of the fishmongers contesting the parliamentary bill which aims to close Billingsgate market.Photograph: Joanna Partridge/The Guardian“At the market we can choose what we buy, if there’s no market, those who are selling will have a monopoly,” said Aslam. “If there is no Billingsgate, we can’t get all this variety,” added Swara, gesturing to a chest freezer containing 13 different types of frozen prawns.Aslam has previously tried buying from wholesalers, but said he was not able to buy the required quantity of fish, or was disappointed by the quality.“We supply quite a few restaurants around the area, and it would affect them too if the market closes,” he added, as his two employees gutted and cleaned sea bass ordered by a local Caribbean restaurant.The history of a food market around Smithfield – close to Farringdon train station – goes back more than 800 years. The London Museum isin the process of movingto part of the site, which is intended to become a cultural development. Billingsgate, which was moved in 1982 from a City location by the river to a building near the Canary Wharf financial district, has been earmarked for housing.The volumes of meat and fish traded at Smithfield and Billingsgate have fallen significantly since their peak around the turn of the 20th century amid the rise of supermarkets, according to an independent report on the importance of food markets commissioned by the corporation after its decision not to build the Dagenham site.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This includes practical support, such as brokering discussions with landowners and developers, and assisting a smooth transition”.“We just want assurance that an alternative market will be opened,” said Aslam. “We have a livelihood on the line.

The agreement was viewed as a first step towards a permanent ceasefire between the two countries.The prisoner swap, in which 1,000 prisoners will be released from each side, was meant to bring Russia andUkrainecloser to achieving a lasting ceasefire deal. Friday’s swap brought 390 Ukrainians back home, and on Saturday the Russian defence ministry said 307 prisoners from each country were exchanged.“We expect more to come tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said, with the Russian defence ministry also saying it expected the swaps to continue.The overnight attack prompted people to shelter in Kyiv’s subway stations. Missile debris and unintercepted bombs caused damage in six districts of the city, with plumes of smoke rising from where they landed. Two children were among those injured in the attacks.The Obolon district was hit particularly hard, with at least five people being wounded and a residential building heavily damaged, Ukrainian officials said.View image in fullscreenA Kyiv resident observes the damage to her flat in a five-storey residential block hit by a drone.Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPAThe air raid alert in Kyiv lasted more than seven hours. The strikes followed several days of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia, including Moscow, which prompted the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to vow retaliation.Olha Chyrukha, a 64-year-old from Kyiv, standing outside an apartment building damaged in the bombings, said: “I wish they’d agree to a ceasefire. To bomb people like this …”Other people said their homes had been made uninhabitable by the attacks.Prospects for progress towards a ceasefire seemed dim, with the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying on Friday that the place for the next round of talks had yet to be chosen.Lavrov said Moscow would hand Ukraine a draft text stating its conditions for a truce once the prisoner swap had been completed.

Donald Trump has made ending the conflict a key foreign policy aim of his administration. The US president asked Ukraine and Russia to attend renewed talks to achieve a peace deal, a request to which both countries have nominally agreed.European leaders have accused Moscow of stalling in peace talks while Russian troops try to capture more Ukrainian territory.On Saturday, Russia’s defence ministry said that it had captured the settlements of Stupochki, Otradne and Loknia in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Sumy regions.After the attack on Kyiv, Zelenskyy accused Russia of seeking to sabotage peace talks, a claim Moscow has also levelled at Ukraine.“With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. “Ukraine has proposed a ceasefire many times … It all has been ignored.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyKyivnewsShareReuse this content"

So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.”Galloway also rattled off figures maintaining that Tesla’s sales were down 59% in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 66% in Denmark, 50% in Switzerland and 33% in Portugal.Musk in recent months hadsoughtto intervene in various European political affairs,including Germany’s federal electionand theUK’s row over grooming gangs– particularly on X, the social media platform he owns.After his meddling put off many in Europe, a lucrative EV market, Tesla’s Chinese competitor BYD outsold the Austin-based company on the continent for the first time ever in April, according to a report from Jato Dynamics, which supplies automotive industry intelligence.“This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway said to his co-host, veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher. “Tesla was a great brand.“He’s alienated his core demographic.”The federal job and spending cuts attributed to Musk stem from his involvement leading the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) during Trump’s second US presidency, which began in January. Musk landed the role after his super political action committeedonated$200m to Trump’s successful run in November to return to the White House after he lost the 2020 election as the incumbent.Opinion polling since hassuggestedstrong disapproval of the work Musk has done for Trump, including some research showing a majority of voters dislike the way the businessman and Doge have dealt with federal government employees in particular as the so-called “department” slashed jobs.Toward the end of April, Tesla was reporting a 71% dip in profits – and, on an earnings call with Tesla investors, Musk said he would start pulling back from his role at Doge beginning in May.Musk said his work getting the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done” and therefore his “time allocation to Doge will drop significantly”.One nonpartisan research group, the Partnership for Public Service,estimatedin late April that about $160bn in cuts touted by Doge were on track to cost roughly $135bn.Explore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskMarketing & PRTeslaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He was protected from being returned to his home country under aUS immigrationjudge’s order at the time, but the Trump administration put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead.The US district judge Brian Murphy found the man’s deportation likely “lacked any semblance of due process”. Ina declarationto the court, the man, identified by his initials OCG in legal filings, said that since he was returned to Guatemala two months ago, “I have been living in hiding, in constant panic and constant fear”.An earlier court proceeding determined that OCG risked persecution or torture if returned toGuatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the US.“No one has ever suggested that OCG poses any sort of security threat,” Murphy wrote in his order. “In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.”Murphy’s order adds to a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations.Last week, Murphy, a Biden appointee, found that the Trump administration had violated an order he issued barring government officials from deporting people to countries not their own without first giving them sufficient time to object.In a hearing, the homeland security department said that seven immigrants had been deported Tuesday on a flight to a third country, but they refused to say where the men were going. It waslater revealedthat the men were told they were being sent to South Sudan.Arizona governor pauses deportation for Guatemalan who gave birth days agoRead moreIn that case, Murphy said that the government had given the seven men little more than 24 hours’ notice that they were being removed from the US, which he called “plainly insufficient”, and could result in a finding of criminal contempt.Other cases that have been spotlighted for rapid deportations include that of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was sent to El Salvador. The US supreme court ordered the government to “facilitate” Ábrego García’s return, but the White House has said it is not within its power to do so.That case sparked a legal joust over the supreme court’s practicable meaning of “facilitate”.In his ruling, Murphy noted the dispute over the use of the verb, saying that returning OCG to the US is not that complicated.“The Court notes that ‘facilitate’ in this context should carry less baggage than in several other notable cases,” he wrote. “OCG is not held by any foreign government. Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government’s objectives.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationGuatemalaMexicoLGBTQ+ rightsUS politicsShareReuse this content"

One cover consists of an image of a toilet cubicle graffitied with the text “Punk rock ruined my life.” Another is a shot of a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump’s face.Entitled For David, from Terry, the images are billed as a tribute to the US film-makerDavid Lynch, who died in January.The fashion and identity commentator Caryn Franklin describes Richardson’s return to newsstands as disappointing. “I am questioning why we would allow this man back to do more of the same, since there was no reckoning, no accountability and no apology from him,” she says.Fashion must now move on from female exploitation – and Terry Richardson | Namalee BolleRead moreSpeaking to the Guardian over email, Ashley Heath, the owner and editorial director of Arena Homme+ and its sister title POP, said he wanted to make clear that “publishing this portfolio is in no way an attempt to rehabilitate Terry Richardson’s career as a commercial fashion photographer, as is being claimed.“The work is in no respects ‘fashion’ … The magazine includes much content that is not fashion, and has done for more than 30 years. Terry Richardson’s portfolio is a powerful, personal tribute to the late David Lynch. No more, no less. I believe it is great work and is profound at this particular point in time on a number of levels. I would urge anyone to look at the entire portfolio, especially if David Lynch means anything to you. He is certainly a hero to us at Arena Homme+.”At the height of his career, Richardson was one of the most successful fashion photographers in the world. He regularly shot for GQ and worked on advertising campaigns for brands including Gucci. He directed pop videos for Beyoncé and photographed Barack Obama on the eve of his 2012 re-election.His work was known for its shock factor and regularly featured partially clothed or naked women, sometimes simulating or engaged in sexual acts. A 2004 book and exhibition entitled Terryworld includedseveral images of models fellating the photographer, who garnered the nickname “Uncle Terry”. Richardson has always claimed his shoots were consensual.Allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Richardsonfirst came to light in 2001. In 2010 the writer and podcaster Jamie Peckrecalled a shootwith Richardson when she was 19 in which he pressured her into performing a sex act. Following Peck’s piece,many more women came forwardalleging abuse. By 2017 he wasdropped by Condé Nast, publisher of titles including British Vogue. Fashion houses such as Valentino also cut ties with him. In November 2023, he wasaccused of sexual assaultin two lawsuits.Fashion insiders say although Richardson has been blacklisted, he has continued working on various projects behind the scenes. Now he appears to be pivoting from private to public. In January, the Paris and LA-based brand Enfants Riches Déprimés released a campaign shot by Richardson alongside a photobook entitled Rats at the Ritz.Images includea woman handcuffed to a restraining bar.Richardson’s images for the Arena Homme+ portfolio include a child standing on top of a jeep holding a gun, and a bolted door with the words “The world’s not safe anymore” carved into the wood.Richardson’s return comes at a time whena succession of white menhave been appointed creative directors at fashion houses.A report in 2024highlighted that just 24% of power posts in fashion such as chief executive are held by women.Sara Ziff, the founder of Model Alliance, an advocacy group for models in the US, says choosing Richardson over talented and ethical creatives, many of them women and people of colour, is “the old guard trying to generate controversy in an effort to maintain relevance”.A spokesperson for Condé Nast said the group has “no plans to work with him”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The stylist Jeanie Annan-Lewin says the decision by the magazine to work with Richardson and then to refuse to engage with readers suggests it doesn’t “care about women”. She says speaking out in the industry has repercussions: “I know that I won’t get work with those publications.”Heath said: “The decision to publish was certainly not made lightly, I realised the portfolio is powerful in part because of Terry Richardson’s own journey. There is no cheap shock value intended, as has been claimed. That said, Lynch’s oeuvre does mine the dark underbelly of American life; sex, power, money and evil are all central concerns. The portfolio and magazine cover makes explicit reference to the ‘Spooky village’. This is Terry Richardson’s America, it is the wider world … and it is certainly social media.”Franklin says the industry needs to become more politicised. Highlighting how the male gaze feeds into misogyny, she says: “This type of behaviour has been normalised by male photographers and brands who operate on the belief that sex sells. It’s girls and women every time that pay a price.”Representatives for Richardson were approached by the Guardian for comment.Richardson has previously denied all the allegations, saying that gritty, sexual imagery is simply part of his style, and that the stories are “hate-filled and libellous”.“I collaborated with consenting adult women who were fully aware of the nature of the work and, as is typical with any project, everyone signed releases,” he said in the same statement. “I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do.”Richardson is not the only oneinstigating a soft relaunch. On Tuesday, the actor Kevin Spacey, who has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, was presented with a lifetime achievement award at Cannes.Explore more on these topicsTerry RichardsonPhotographySexual harassmentMagazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

But then a band called Minor Threat taught me it was radical to be sober – and it changed my lifeAllan Bain; as told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSat 24 May 2025 02.00 EDTShareIstarted drinking when I was 14. It was how we’d have fun as kids in Aberdeen – I didn’t come across any youth clubs or anything particularly productive. You drank beer or alcopops in some shady lane, and you drank so quickly that you’d get drunk but then be sober enough to get home at 11pm so your parents wouldn’t notice anything. It wasn’t drinking for pleasure: binge drinking was just what everyone – regardless of social groups – seemed to be doing.During my teenage years I worked at a newsagent and I would read Kerrang! every week, which was extremely formative for me in discovering music. It’s incredible how many new bands I was introduced to, and just how my music taste evolved – from nu-metal bands such as Korn to Rage Against the Machine and, most influentially, Fugazi.One day in 1999, when I was 16, I read about the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. Ian MacKaye, a member of Fugazi, was an important figure for me: he had a very specific way of approaching music and was fiercely independent. I was inspired by him, shaving my hair and wearing a beanie. A friend even started calling me Bain MacKaye. His previous band, Minor Threat, were active in the early 80s and had been part of what became known as the “straight edge” movement, a subculture of hardcore punks who turned away from drugs and alcohol in reaction to punk’s excesses.Not taking drugs or drinking alcohol seemed like the most radical way to be rebelliousIn Minor Threat’s song Out of Step, MacKaye sings lyrics such as “I don’t drink”, but he shortens it to “don’t drink”, so it sounds more like he’s telling you to do the same, which to some degree he is. It wasn’t so much the music itself that grabbed me, it was more that I became interested in this perspective of questioning the mainstream.I wasn’t particularly rebellious: I didn’t talk back to teachers or have a problem with my parents. So the concept of being straight edge and not taking drugs or drinking seemed like the most radical thing I could do in a middle-class environment.To begin with, not drinking was just experimental, then it became a challenge. With time, I started to see the good in it. You never know how you’re going to react under stress or grief, and from an early age I had just ruled out drinking as a way to deal with these things. I had also developed an ability to speak my mind or just have the balls to speak to new people sober, not needing something to help ease social anxieties.I was the odd one out among my friends. They’d wonder why I was doing it and probably made fun of me, but I was never excommunicated from my circle. Still, when I went to university in around 2003, one guy said to me: “You shouldn’t come inside a pub if you’re not ready to drink and smoke in it”. People would often ask me if I was religious or if there were alcohol problems in my family. There always had to be a reason, like it wasn’t a choice to be sober. That’s what was so appealing – it just seemed so radical to be sober. And I have been ever since. It is largely a force of habit nowadays, not the teenage rebellion I felt back then, though I do still listen to Minor Threat from time to time.Sobriety has given me a very different experience in life. At university I spent a lot of time with foreign students who were slightly older than me.Alcoholwas still a part of their social circle but in a more sophisticated way. That group included the person who became my wife. I now live with her in Finland, where I work as a lab technician. In Finland the phrase straight edge, orstreittari, is well known to describe the lifestyle of those who don’t drink or do drugs, but not many people know its roots – an 80s hardcore punk band.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

Though it powered through a mild opening to become a solid summer hit, on the 1995 charts it sits below Father of the Bride Part II and Congo (though congratulations are in order; it did edge out both Grumpier Old Men and Mortal Kombat). Even among otherMel Gibsonvehicles from the 90s, you might be surprised to learn that Maverick, Conspiracy Theory and Payback all posted stronger numbers.Crash at 20: is it the worst best picture winner of all time?Read moreBut Braveheart stuck around, both in theaters and in the public consciousness. It wasn’t necessarily tipped as an awards contender at the time of release – Gibson had only directed one other movie, a small-scale drama called The Man Without a Face – but wound up nominated for 10 Oscars and winning half of them, including a best director prize for Gibson. He wasn’t nominated for his performance, but it became a career signature, his rousing speech and blue facepaint instantly absorbed into his iconography. He plays William Wallace, a Scottish warrior who leads a rebellion against King Edward I in the 13th century, when Scotland’s dead king left no heir and England swooped in to conquer. The details of the story, which positions Robert the Bruce (Angus McFadyen) as a politicking compromiser, are inspired more from an epic poem than the historical record, which presumably aided its easy-to-follow epic pull.The movie itself is sort of a print-the-legend affair, too, rather than a parade of perfect scenes. Its three hours are full of hacky touches: plummy introductory narration getting the audience up to speed on the historical context; dialogue that underlines motivations at every turn; the occasional embarrassing tribute to its star’s virility; Gibson’s trademark zany broadness peeking through at odd times. Worst of that material is the running subplot about the king’s gay son, where Gibson sees fit to stage the scene where the king throws his son’s lover out a window to his death like a grim slapstick punchline – because to Gibson, that’s precisely what it is. (King Edward may be a cruel tyrant, Gibson seems to be saying, but he sure isn’t weak like his mincing son!) At times the movie resembles nothing more than an R-rated version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves – and some accounts of its historical accuracy or lack thereof would bear out that comparison.What most people are thinking of when they think about Braveheart is a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film, where Gibson’s Wallace, face striped in that memorable blue, gives his stirring speech about living a long life of regretting a lack of freedom, then leads the Scotsmen into a long and impressively gory battle, ending in triumph. Half an hour later, there’s another, less victorious for the Scots, also memorably gory. And of course, the capture, torture and defiant death of William Wallace at the end of the film is a notable culmination (though by no means end) of Gibson’s fixation on chronicling extensive bodily punishment, a grimmer Catholic-guilt precursor to what Tom Cruise puts himself in the name of stunts.This may have been the precise point where Gibson became better known for taking that punishment than as a romantic lead; presumably less remembered or cherished among Braveheart’s fans is Wallace’s unconvincing dalliance with Princess Isabella of France, played by the decade-younger Sophie Marceau. The ease of reducing Braveheart to its highlights-reel essentials makes it a throwback to the have-you-actually-watched-this-lately epics of decades earlier – not the durably brilliant likes of Lawrence of Arabia or Spartacus, but rather more akin to the biblical epics that don’t get quite as much play as The Ten Commandments.View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes of Braveheart in 1995.Photograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/AlamyOf course, that’s where Gibson would go next as a director, and as surprisingly modest a grosser as Braveheart was in its day, The Passion of the Christ was shockingly huge nine years later. Yet despite that massive hit and his Braveheart Oscar in tow, Gibson’s directorial career never really reached its full potential. Some of that was his own doing, as drunken, hate-filled antics came to dominate his public image right around the time he unleashed his, ah, Passion. But his peers were clearly ready to forgive (how else to explain the Oscar attention afforded to the similarly martyr-focused and gory Hacksaw Ridge?) and directing offered a clear opportunity to stay a little further from the spotlight while remaining in control of his films. His most recent project, the terribly generic (though recognizably Gibson-y) Flight Risk landed with a thud this past January.Maybe Braveheart, successful as it was in the long term, made it harder to accept Gibson as a matinee idol with flashes of intriguing darkness, and easier to see him as a passionate madman who could really draw some blood. Or maybe it was just a hard one to top in the affections of so many bros. Regardless, the movie itself re-established a beachhead at the Oscars for mega-sized epics. After the Dances with Wolves victory at the top of the decade, the anointed best pictures got a little more eclectic for a few years: horror thriller The Silence of the Lambs, elegiac revisionist western Unforgiven, Spielberg’s masterly Schindler’s List, the picaresque comedy-drama Forrest Gump. Braveheart came along and waved the flag for subsequent winners like The English Patient, The Lord of the Rings and especially Gladiator. Thirty years on, that style of film-making feels more distant than it did back in 1995, its resources more likely to be poured into expensive fantasy. Of course, Braveheart is its own form of expensive fantasy, too, selling the power of its own brawny dumbness. For a few hours, it summons enough powerful sweep to convince the audience that Gibson, weird hang-ups and all, might be a star for the ages.Explore more on these topicsMel GibsonDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Get stuck in!Rhik SamadderSat 24 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 05.25 EDTShareSchopenhauer defined genius as someone who aims at a target the rest of us can’t see. Which raises a philosophical paradox – how do we know they’ve hit it? I was moved to such musings while watching this week’s pick, a singular piece of art that functions unlike anything else on TV, and calls the medium itself into question. No, it’s not Police Interceptors.In The Rehearsal (Monday, 10pm, Sky Comedy), comedianNathan Fielderblends documentary, social experiment, performance art and absurdist satire in a devised method all his own. He has ordinary people tackle emotionally fraught situations from their lives, by role-playing them with hired actors in meticulously recreated sets that mirror significant personal locations. It’s arch, but the stakes are real. Thefirst seriesopened with a man who wanted to apologise to his pub quiz teammates for cheating, before pivoting to a woman who wasn’t sure whether she wanted to become a mother. Mamma mia!Here we go again – and this new series ups the ante. With undertones of Malcolm Gladwell, Fielder identifies that aviation disasters are mostly a result of communication awkwardness in the cockpit. Can he help first officers speak up when they notice pilot errors, and thereby stop people dying in plane crashes? Is comedy the right vehicle for this? Is that funny? Fielder sets out his stall, while stepping over a blood-covered actor who whispers “Help” from a wreckage of twisted fuselage. Do you remember your first olive – the sensation of not being sure what you were eating? This is like that.The furrow the show ploughs is fantastically winding, and bone dry. Fielder’s monotone narration is matched by his clownish, Beckettian imagination (and limitless HBO budget). In one experiment, a triplet of cloned dogs are trained to become more like their deceased donor. A compressor transports air across the country to recreate the atmosphere of a specific city. An airport is reconstructed, with 70 actors playing the public, flight crew and shop assistants. Fielder uses cranes and gargantuan puppets to experience the babyhood of heroic pilot Chesley Sullenberger in a Freudian scene of horrifying proportions. I won’t spoil it here – but it may spoil you for ever.The visuals are part of what makes this appointment TV. In another strand, Fielder intervenes in the dating life of a shy first officer – enlisting a group of actors to surround and mimic him, to illustrate the theory that working in packs builds confidence. Fielder encourages one of these actors to pursue a romantic relationship with the subject. He then sets up a warehouse of rooms of actors recreatingthatrelationship. When those simulated relationships turn sexual, he brings in the actors’ real-life partners to observe from behind a monitor. He piles ethical grey areas on top of each other like problematic pancakes.View image in fullscreenNo one’s doing it like Fielder … The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.Since Nathan for You in 2013, Fielder has warped the tracks of reality TV, pushing its artifice into surreal places. Controversy, too. He has been accused by participants of emotional manipulation. Which is the point. I don’t know if the real subjects here are also actors, or if Fielder cares about aviation safety. The show could be a lampoon of gestalt therapy or the moral hypocrisy of television, or a fever dream arising from its creator’s own anxieties. “I’ve always thought sincerity was overrated,” reflects Fielder casually, the sort of thing you’d read in a Sartre novel. “It just ends up punishing those who can’t perform it as well as others.”I knew one genius in my life, many years ago. A man who, after a short while in anyone’s company, saw through them like an X-ray. Without judgment, he was able to lay bare people’s deepest insecurities and dreams, unpick their social persona and even predict their fantasies. Everyone hated him. They thought he was a witch.Likewise, The Rehearsal won’t be to everyone’s taste. I’m not even sure it’s to mine. A self-cannibalising satire of television ethics might be too smart to be beloved. But you should watch it. Inscrutable, wilfully awkward, wayward, serious of purpose and a shaggy dog story, no one’s doing it like Fielder.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherNathan FielderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Can Tinseltown halt the exodus and reclaim its spot as the home of movie-making?Lois Beckettin Los AngelesSat 24 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 16.27 EDTShareWhen Adam Scott was working on the hit TV show Parks and Recreation in the early 2010s, theLos Angelesstudio where the show was filmed was packed – “every stage was filled and working”.These days, he told his former co-star Rob Lowe in amuch-discussed recent podcast conversation, “it’s quiet over there” – in part because “it’s just too expensive to shoot here”.“Nothing shoots inLos Angeles,” Scott said.“Nothing!” Lowe replied.The two television stars are a case in point. Severance, Scott’s hit sci-fi streaming show, has been largely filmed in New York and New Jersey. And this year, both actors are scheduled to shoot projects in Ireland – Scott for a horror film with an Irish director, but Lowe as the host of an American gameshow with American contestants.The reason, Lowe argued, was money, particularly the massive tax credits that other jurisdictions offer film studios to bring their productions outside of Hollywood.“It’s cheaper to bring 100 American people to Ireland than to walk across the lot at Fox, past the sound stages, and do it there,” Lowe said.Hollywood has long faced competition for its film-production business, both from other US states like New York, Georgia and New Mexico, and from the UK and other European countries. The UK in recent years has seen a major boost in prestige film and TV productions set there, withBritain earning the nickname “Brollywood”. Even the film Barbie, a quintessentially California tale, was partially shot in theWarner Bros studios in Hertfordshire.But in the wake of the devastating Los Angeles fires this January, this drop in the number of productions shot in Hollywood has begun to spark panic and anger within the industry.Recent statistics highlight the reason for concern. The number of productions shot on location in Los Angeles hasdropped more than 30% in the past five years, with 2024 recording one of the lowest number of total shoot days in decades, second only to 2020, during the disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic. According to Film LA, a non-profit that tracks local production, only20% of shows for North American audiencesare now filmed in California.View image in fullscreenHomes destroyed by the Palisades fire in January.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesLos Angeles’s struggles come amid alarger contraction in the global film and TV industry, with studios pulling back from thebig-budget eraof the streaming wars amid broader economic uncertainty.But some in the industry worry thatCaliforniadiscounted its global competitors for too long – and that it may now pay a permanent price.“When it’s a homegrown industry, you sometimes take it a little bit for granted. You don’t recognize that there’s a possibility that it can dissipate, or go elsewhere,” said Rebecca Rhine, the western executive director of the Directors Guild of America, and the president of the Entertainment Union Coalition, an alliance of seven major Hollywood unions. “I think it was maybe some arrogance, and maybe some lack of foresight.”A large coalition of Hollywood workers are now rallying for California to increase its tax credits for film and TV shoots from 20% to 25%-35%, to make the state more competitive with other states and countries that offer as much as 40% in tax credits.The Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, hasproposed more than doublingCalifornia’s current film and TV tax credit program from $330m to $750m.The need is dire, according to workers in many segments of the California industry. Officials with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (Iatse) estimate that in the past three years, their members alone have seen roughly 18,000 jobs disappear, most of those jobs in California.“The last couple of years have been pretty devastating,” said Malakhi Simmons, the vice-president of Iatse local 728, representing studio electrical lighting technicians. “Our members are used to jobs starting and stopping. There’s a culture of hanging on till the next job, [but] with the contraction of the industry, those jobs haven’t come back.”View image in fullscreenGavin Newsom speaks in Sacramento this week.Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/APDonald Trump’s contribution to the debate was a recent social media suggestion that he protect Hollywood by imposing tariffs on films shot outside the US, a stray remark that has roiled an already chaotic situation. A-list stars and blue-collar Hollywood workers are now pushing to bring more production back to Los Angeles, with the help of streamlining and tax subsidies at the city, state and even national levels.“There are so many people I know who do everything they can to shoot here, and their perspective is: ‘It doesn’t even have to get me exactly there on the [tax credit] percentage, it just has to be close enough, because on everything else, California wins,” said Susan Sprung, the CEO of the Producers Guild.But with Los Angeles facing a $1bn budget shortfall, California as a whole facing a deficit of $12bn, and social programs of all kinds facing big cuts, not everyone is on board with devoting hundreds of millions to boost Hollywood productions.Film credits and filming feesAlexandra Pechman, a Los Angeles-based writer and director, is one of nearly 25,000 Hollywood workers and other locals who backed a petition early this year asking California officials to offer three years of expanded tax credits to productions filming in Los Angeles in the wake of this winter’s historically damaging wildfires.“You learn very quickly, as a screenwriter or director in Los Angeles, seeing your peers constantly leaving the city, that there’s incentives to be filming pretty much anywhere other than LA,” said Pechman, one of the co-founders of the Stay in LA movement.Preparing the budget for her independent feature film, The Murderous Miss Highsmith, gave her a first-hand look at the complex math of international tax credits.Her film, for which she is still laying the groundwork to shoot, explores the fraught life of Patricia Highsmith, the author of The Talented Mr Ripley. It’s set in Italy, Santa Fe and London, but to meet its budget, the film will have to shoot in a single location, one approved by the project’s financial backers.Pechman considered a range of European countries, looking at “what tax incentives program offers us the best route”. She recalled that Hungary offered a 30% rebate at the time, and Croatia also offered up to 30%. Italy was offering an even higher rate, but her film’s financier ultimately preferred Malta, which was offering a 40% tax rebate. “Malta will just play as those places, and we would shoot some interiors that are meant to be New York, or other cities, in Malta,” she said.For film productions to get a tax rebate, Pechman said, they need to spend a certain amount of money, but many kinds of expenses qualify, from travel agents to lodging to catering – “so that’s all obviously boosting the local economy”.Governments often also demand employment quotas in certain departments of the film to qualify for film production tax rebates, so productions bringing in technical talent from the US also need to hire a certain percentage of local talent, “so a lot of shows end up hiring a lot of trainees”.Trump wants tariffs on ‘foreign’ movies. But there’s a reason no one wants to shoot in LA | Dave SchillingRead moreWhen she was scouting in Malta last summer, she said, she met a lot of experienced local film workers “who had come up through these trainee programs”.“That’s exactly what’s not happening here [in Los Angeles],” she said. “People are graduating from USC film school and moving to LA to start their careers, and there aren’t these programs and incentives to help people get their foot in the door.”Pechman’s husband is a showrunner who has shot in many cities, from Winnipeg to Toronto to Atlanta, she said. “He’s never shot a show in LA,” she said, except for some exterior LA shots for a show otherwise filmed in Canada.“We just have to do something, or people are going to leave,” she added.Other factorsAnother big ire is permits. Getting permits to shoot across the Los Angeles area can be expensive and logistically difficult, even for smaller crews that work on documentary and commercial shoots.“Whenever you’re interfacing with the government [in LA], those systems don’t totally feel like they’re up to speed with the modern era,” said Aaron Ohlmann, a director and executive producer at the production company Special Order.At one recent shoot, “we had to pay a third party $2,000 to manage those permits”, he said. At another, which was “a quiet interview in someone’s living room”, he said, “we paid $1,000 for a FilmLA monitor who did not once lift his eyes from the glow of his phone. An additional $85 went to a fire marshal who never arrived. The permit itself was $900.”Pechman said she was shocked to find that it was much easier to do a small shoot on the streets of New York City than in Los Angeles – even though virtually every part of Los Angeles sees much less foot traffic than the packed avenues of Manhattan.In many public areas of New York City, it’spossible to film without a permitas long as the crew and the gear are limited, she said: “You cannot do that in LA.”The permitting fees and restrictions in Los Angeles are especially burdensome for film students and indie filmmakers, who argue “it’s already hard enough right now” in the industry, Pechman said, and they emerged as an important concern in Stay in LA’s grassroots advocacy.FilmLA, the non-profit created to coordinate permitting across the many cities of greater Los Angeles,raised its feeslast year. It receives no government funding, and part of its fees go to paying for the work of the agency as it coordinates permits across the many jurisdictions of the greater Los Angeles area. Paul Audley, the group’s president, defended its fees as “cost-competitive” and “in line with regional averages”, and said that “film offices from across the world reach out to study FilmLA and how we work”.In late May, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass announced that she wanted tomake it easier to film in LA, directing city departments to reduce red tape and cut some costs and fees, and make it easier to film at city-owned properties such as Griffith Observatory, changes the Los Angeles Times called “relatively modest”.View image in fullscreenKaren Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Audley said Bass’s proposal could have a big impact on fees, because “municipal oversight is the biggest cost factor. Fully 60% of permit-related cost comes from use of public property and public safety personnel.”While some have pointed at labor cost increases as a factor in driving productions abroad, union leaders have pushed back at suggestions that wins for labor in 2023’s historic double Hollywood strike have rebounded and contributed to the decline in Los Angeles production rates.“We reject the idea that somehow paying people decent wages and providing benefits and retirements with dignity is the problem,” Rhine, the Entertainment Union Coalition head, said.“We do not believe that wage increases have anything to do with productions moving overseas or out of state,” a spokesperson for Sag-Aftra said in a statement, saying the union attributed the recent decreases to tax incentives elsewhere, currency exchange rates and ​​the “overall drop in the market demand for scripted, dramatic programming”.Global shiftsThe big tax subsidies other countries are offering to film and TV productions came alongside a broader democratization of media production around the globe. The shift has been driven in part by the increasing quality and decreasing prices of cameras and other film technology, making production more accessible to many more people, said Ohlmann, the documentary director and producer.Decades ago, “if you wanted to work with film, you had to come to LA – the technology was here, the people were here. Anything that shakes loose rolls west”, he said. “Now, “you have technology in the hands of storytellers, and the ability to access an audience everywhere – and you see less reason to be all collecting in a single place”.Ohlmann and his colleagues, who have done small-crew shoots in 60 countries, used to plan “completely self-contained” international shoots, with every crew member and camera flown in. Now, he said, “the world has gotten smaller, and it’s easier to travel lighter, because you know you’ll be able to pick up talent and gear more easily”.When Werner Herzog was in the Amazon shooting his 1972 epic Aguirre, the Wrath of God, “and their director of photography gets yellow fever or their film camera gets dropped into the bottom of the Amazon, they were out of luck”, Ohlmann said. Today, a similar film shoot could probably find a replacement camera, and someone’s cousin who knew how to operate it, “a couple miles from where they were shooting”.Even through this globalization of the film industry, LA has remained a major gathering place for film workers. Though they have technology that theoretically allows editors to work remotely “from anywhere in the world”, most editors that Special Order hires are still in New York or Los Angeles, because “it’s still hard to match the level of talent you see in LA”.But locals are now worrying that LA’s creative workforce is being pushed to a tipping point, after five years of economic hardship, first during the pandemic, then as production halted during the writers’ and actors’ strikes, and now, as fears about artificial intelligence stealing jobs overlap with the terror and devastation of southern California’s growing wildfires.Sky-high housing costs across California had already made daily life a struggle for most people trying to work in Hollywood: in Los Angeles, a family of three with an annual income of more than $100,000 a year isnow considered “low income”, and the median price for a home ismore than $1m.The destruction of thousands of homes in January’s wildfires onlymade the local housing crisis worse. About 300 Iatse union members lost their homes to the fires, Simmons said. Across the broader entertainment union community, he said, the number was at least 1,000 members.“Our members are really hurting,” he said. Longtime workers “are running out of savings, moving to other states or staying with family”.Newer workers who have come into the field more recently “are losing faith”.“What our members need most are jobs,” he said. “Jobs create that stability to rebuild.”A wide swathe of unions have backed increases in California’s tax credits for film and TV production, with workers showing up to lobby state lawmakers in Sacramento, and sending an estimated 200,000 letters in support of the increases, arguing that the tax credits are not a handout to big corporations, but an essential local jobs program.Not everyone believes the tax credits are the answer to the industry’s problems. Michael Thom, a University of Southern California professor who researches the economic impact of these tax credits across the US,submitted testimonyto state lawmakers that multiple peer-reviewed studies found that the “incentives fail to stimulate enough economic activity to justify their substantial cost”.‘It feels empty’: is Hollywood film and TV production in a death spiral?Read moreThom said he was not surprised that lawmakers in New York, California and elsewhere continued to support spending hundreds of millions of public dollars on film-industry subsidies despite their lackluster returns.“Film incentives, like those for other industries, are hard to resist: they allow politicians to give away taxpayer money (not their own, of course) and label themselves a ‘job creator’,” Thom wrote in an email. “Couple that with intense lobbying from the industry, unions, and some bureaucrats, and it’s a foregone conclusion that politicians will continue to waste money on these things.”Corey Jackson, a Democratic member of the state assembly with a doctoral degree in social work, has also spoken out about the need to prioritize core social services, not film-industry subsidies, during California’s budget crisis.“If we were back in the period where we have more money than we can spend, this would be a no-brainer,” Jacksontold the Los Angeles Times. But in the current economic environment, “this should not just be a slam-dunk”.Union leaders and others argue that the film industry is more deeply embedded in southern California’s economy than in other states, and that more film production would have a ripple effect, helping everyone from florists to hotel workers to the mechanics who manage the airplanes that big-budget films blow up.“It’s an emergency,” Pechman said. “Hollywood could be a place where people go to the Walk of Fame and say: ‘Oooh, this is where people used to make movies.’”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

It kicks off the Brockwell Live series of one-day festivals, but last week a residents group, Protect Brockwell Park,won a legal caseagainst Lambeth council over the planning of the events. Protect Brockwell Park had argued the live events would damage the south London park’s ecology and put the public space out of use for local people; Brockwell Live stated that they “take our stewardship of Brockwell Park seriously”.Yet the legal travails pale into insignificance next to those faced by today’s headliners, Kneecap. The Northern Irish punk-rap trio last month facedoutrageafter a Coachella set in which they condemned Israeli “genocide” in Gaza and projected slogans on stage including “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine”.After the furore Rapper MoChara waschargedthis week with expressing support for a proscribed terrorist organisation. Kneecap said in a statement: “We deny this ‘offence’ and will vehemently defend ourselves.”View image in fullscreenFestivalgoers wait to hear Kneecap perform on stage at Wide Awake in Brockwell Park, south London.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/GettyIndeed, these setbacks don’t appear to have deflated the trio. Following English Teacher’s vexed, yearning indie and CMAT’s personality-plus, punky take on country and western, Kneecap emerge in front of a collage of recent TV coverage. “Anybody been watching the news?” inquires Chara.Flanked by fellow rapper Móglai Bap and DJ Próvai, the latter clad in his usual Irish-flag balaclava, Chara reports that tonight’s show only just went ahead. “They tried to stop this gig,” he claims. “We’re being made an example of. The Israeli lobbyists are trying to prove to other artists: ‘If you speak out, we’re going to hit you where it hurts most.’”The trio started out eight years ago as Goldie Lookin Chain-style comedy rappers performatively lauding Irish republicanism and their own dissolute lifestyles – a style still evident in numbers such as Fenian Cunts and the Garda-baiting Your Sniffer Dogs Are Shite. Chara now jokingly suggests that the 20,000-strong crowd might like to reconvene outside his hearing at Westminster magistrates court on 18 June, “and bring a nice big bag of ketamine”. Yet the comedy would not work were Kneecap not a great live band: Rhino Ket is a pulsating electro-throb over which they celebrate being “K-holed off my head”.They indulge their nihilistic whimsy and quest for narcotic oblivion further in Get Your Brits Out, a flight of surrealist fantasy in which they imagine a debauched night out with Arlene Foster and other former leaders of the DUP. “Guess who’s back on the news, it’s your favourite republican hoods,” gurns Bap, which certainly has the virtue of accuracy.Their activism is patently heartfelt rather than posturing radical chic. Protesting again that Gaza is being “bombed and starved”, Kneecap lead one final crowd chant of “free, free Palestine” before declaring on the closing H.O.O.D: “Lowlife scum, that’s what they say about me”. Próvai and his balaclava vanish into the moshpit. What a craic.Explore more on these topicsMusicEnglandreviewsShareReuse this content"

But their joint adventures end in a friendship breakup, essentially because Craig is too weird. (Warning: mild spoilers ahead.)After losing his only pal, Craig becomes obsessed with him, and the film becomes a sort of Fatal Attraction for male friendship. Craig will stop at nothing, including violent crime, to restore the connection he briefly felt with Austin, or at least get revenge on him.Friendship review – Tim Robinson spirals in a darkly hilarious comedyRead moreIt’s all very funny – and, at least for this man, delightfully hard to watch. Craig worships Austin, who’s on TV, plays in a very loud band and knows secret passageways through the local sewer. But, as is Robinson’s trademark, Craig can barely function socially himself. He panics when the two hang out, constantly says the wrong thing, embarrasses himself on a guys’ night, and accidentally injures Austin and damages his home.As the comedianEddy Burback put it, the movie is “a true horror about how devastating it is to be a dude who can’t hang”.This, of course, applies whatever your gender. But here, the masculine rituals felt brutally resonant, dredging up buried feelings stretching from summer camp to bachelor parties: the moment when Craig can’t quite scramble up a ledge and needs Austin’s help; his total ineptitude at boxing; his belief that buying a drum set or showing the guys a tiny dagger he owns will somehow win their respect.Friendship comes amid what’s been described as a “friendship recession” among men. In 1990, 55% of men said they had at least six close friends; in 2021,the figure was 27%, and one in seven mensaid they had none. Researchers such as Richard Reeves havepointed to a huge gapbetween men and women when it comes to emotionally supportive friendships and the ability to share feelings. The film’s tagline plays on this much-discussed phenomenon: “Men shouldn’t have friends.”I feel like the message of the movie is: don’t try and make friends as an older manDevin Glass, moviegoerSo what do real-life men think of all this? I recently consulted a few after a screening of Friendship at the Vista Theater inLos Angeles, owned by noted man Quentin Tarantino. Perhaps unsurprisingly in a city that loves movies and feelings, the screening was packed on a Sunday afternoon. The crowd was fairly homogeneous in terms of age – mostly thirtysomethings – but mixed in terms of gender. The film, directed by Andrew DeYoung, generated plenty of conversation, as evidenced by the lingering crowd under the marquee afterwards.Jesse Amorratanasuchad, 38, said Friendship matched his experience of male friendship “to the Nth degree”. His male friend, Travis Francis, 30, felt similarly.View image in fullscreenOutside the Vista Theater in Los Angeles on 18 May 2025.Photograph: Matthew Cantor/Guardian“I think everybody wants to have other men in their lives,” Amorratanasuchad said, adding that it can be difficult. He and his wife, Emily Pando, 35, have been reflecting on the issue recently, particularly as they watch their nephews grow up. “It’s so difficult for men because they don’t have positive friendships and friend groups,” Pando said. “We were just talking about how amazing it is if somebody from gen Z or gen alpha makes it to a certain age without becoming an incel.”In one of the film’s most memorable moments, Austin’s friends gather for a beer, sharing their troubles and offering one another support before spontaneously breaking into a rendition ofGhost Town DJ’s My Boo(“at night, I think of you/I want to be your lady, maybe”). It’s a fantasy of what friendship can be. “I took that moment of them singing as what it is like being in female friendships, or even like a girls’ bathroom, which guys never get to experience – gassing each other up,” Pando said.Amorratanasuchad agreed: “You have to really muster up your courage to be like: ‘Yo, I like your outfit’ or ‘How are you actually feeling?’”Menspeak a different language, Francis said: “You give them shit, and they give it back.”It was particularly difficult to “break that barrier” with childhood friends, Amorratanasuchad said, but in a hopeful sign, friends he had met more recently were more able to “show up emotionally”. He and Francis had been friends for five years, apparently without resorting to felonies.Devin Glass thought the film had a more specific type of friendship in mind. “I think it was about men trying to spark up friendships later in life, which is really awful,” he said. “I feel like the message of the movie is: don’t try and make friends as an older man.”Glass is only 33 and appeared very socially competent, but still, said: “I related a lot.”His friend Chris Jobson, 32, said the movie was a little too extreme to fully relate to; he said a different Paul Rudd movie, I Love You, Man, felt like a “more real” depiction of male friendship.But their friend Spencer, 31, who preferred not to give his last name, didn’t buy the idea that the film had anything to do with its title. “That’s where it started, but I felt like it just evolved into a case study on psychosis,” he said. “I felt depressed half the time, and then just overwhelmed … I was so incredibly uncomfortable.”I heard similar stories of discomfort from other men, and I felt the same – but for the opposite reason. We’ve seen plenty of cringe comedy in recent years, but this was particularly difficult to take, even as I laughed along. My theory: it’s because, as absurd as Tim Robinson’s character was, he remained almost believable. There was a sense that I have spent my life trying not to be this very man, that sometimes I’ve come too close, that someday my so-called friends will find out that I really am just a Craig, a fake, secretly confused by the ways of my species and my gender in particular.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsMenLos AngelesWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Navalny’s autobiography,Patriot, is a burning testament to what it looks like, in our fast-darkening world, to stand up to malignant corruption, to global bullies, to murderous domination. His writing is fantastically witty, egotistical, warm, swaggering, furious and relentlessly, insistently optimistic. It is his optimism that blasts through the book like a heat furnace. In prison, he tells his wife, Yulia, that he is likely to die there – “even if everything starts falling apart, they will bump me off at the first sign the regime is collapsing. They will poison me.” He says it is better not to pretend. When she agrees, they embrace in joy. “That was great! No tears.” This book reminds us that real resistance is powered by heat and light, by the stubborn belief that things might be otherwise.Impossible Creaturesby Katherine Rundell is published by Bloomsbury.Brave New Worldby Aldous HuxleyChosen by Chris Packham, nature writerView image in fullscreenI read this at 14, in the 70s, and it gave me nightmares. It was published in 1932, in the shadow of rising fascism, by a man who feared the rise of the machines. Now, 50 years after I first turned its pages, I have nightmares about the new world: a world living in the shadow of rising fascism and evasive truth, and fearful of AI. A world in the grip of a new dystopia: climate breakdown. But still Aldous Huxley’s novel fuels bravery. I found myself in that book, only as a child I didn’t recognise it. It is the book that made me the imperfect, flawed, brand new savage that I am.Fingers in the Sparkle Jarby Chris Packham is published by Ebury.Word for Word by Lilianna LunginaChosen by Yulia Navalnaya, campaigner and widow of Alexei NavalnyView image in fullscreenI love books in which a personal story becomes inseparable from the story of a nation. In Word for Word, Lilianna Lungina recounts her life as a translator in the Soviet Union – and through it, the entire 20th century flows. She seemed to witness everything: the fear, the hope, the silence, the change. She met so many of the people who shaped Russian culture, and lived through every turning point. As I read, I kept learning about my own country – and, unexpectedly, about myself. It made me think deeply about what changed in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union – and what, heartbreakingly, stayed exactly the same.One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against Thisby Omar El AkkadChosen by Madeleine Thien, authorView image in fullscreenThis book, a reckoning with the carnage we are witnessingin Gaza, does a thousand vital things. It writes into wordlessness and grief; it confronts our complicity. Most of all, it refuses to give up what we hold dear – each other. This is a work whose impetus is love, so fragile a thing in this world.The Book of Records by Madeleine Thienis published by Granta.We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our FamiliesbyPhilip GourevitchChosen byChloe Dalton, author and foreign policy adviserView image in fullscreenI was 20 years old and studying English literature at university. There was no way this book was on the syllabus, so I must have stumbled across it. It’s an account of the Rwandan genocide, which left me believing that war crimes can be prevented – we just often choose not to act. Fourteen years later, as adviser to the foreign secretary, I helped create a campaign to require governments to prevent mass rape and sexual violence from being used as weapons of war, as happened in Rwanda and continues in so many countries today. I can trace a line between reading that book and my work.Raising Hareby Chloe Dalton is published by Canongate.The Golden Notebookby Doris LessingChosen by Elif Shafak, authorView image in fullscreenI read this when I was young, and it inspired and empowered me in so many ways. It tells the story of a writer who keeps notebooks in different colours (black, red, yellow, blue), each reflecting her search for meaning across various aspects of life – personal, political, literary and psychological. Regarded as one of the key texts in the women’s movement, its intellectual and emotional depth is captivating. The tension and harmony between different components of our lives was an important subject in the 1960s, but perhaps even more so in today’s deeply fractured world.There Are Rivers in the Skyby Elif Shafak is published by Viking.Stokely Speaks: From Black Power to Pan‑Africanismby Stokely CarmichaelChosen by Kehinde Andrews, academic and authorView image in fullscreenI was lucky enough to grow up in the legacy of British Black Power, so my house was filled with revolutionary material. But I only picked up Stokely Speaks because of its hilarious cover, with Stokely Carmichael with a mini-afro, brandishing a gun. At the time, I was struggling with my identity, attending a school that made it clear that to be Black was to be labelled as unruly and placed in a lower set. Stokely Speaks opened my eyes, and made me unafraid to challenge the system that had tried to break me. His book set me on the path I am on today.Nobody Can Give You Freedomby Kehinde Andrews is published by Allen Lane.The Order of the Dayby Éric VuillardChosen by Philippe Sands, author and lawyerView image in fullscreen“Twenty-four calculating machines at the gates of Hell.” Thus does Éric Vuillard characterise the industrialists who gathered in February 1933 to pay homage to Germany’s new regime.The Order of the Day, which won France’s Prix Goncourt in 2017, came to mind with images of tech titans standing to attention at the recent US inauguration, and accounts of thecapitulationby American law firms to presidential threat that followed. History may not repeat itself exactly, but its insights – and those of the literary imagination – will offer clues if we want to see them.38 Londres Streetby Philippe Sands is published by W&N.Who Cooked Adam Smith’s Dinner?by Katrine MarçalChosen by Laura Bates, author and feminist activistView image in fullscreenThis powerful book upends centuries of economic theory by pointing out a fundamental flaw: that throughout history, most economists have failed to acknowledge the hidden, neglected, unpaid labour of women. If they fail to include the myriad ways in which women’s work underpins our societies and our economies, doesn’t that make their calculations useless? Katrine Marçal’s willingness to ask bold questions, and to question ideas that have long been considered the bedrock of our economic and societal systems, is as refreshing as it is inspiring. Best of all, it empowers readers to start asking difficult questions of their own.The New Age of Sexismby Laura Bates is published by Simon & Schuster.No Destination: Autobiography of a Pilgrimby Satish KumarChosen by Mike Berners-Lee, author and climate professorView image in fullscreenThis life story of Indian-British activist Satish Kumar tells of his inner and outer journeys as a peace campaigner and environmentalist. He walked around the world without money, delivering packs of tea to world leaders with the message: “If you are thinking of pressing the nuclear button, stop and have a cup of tea first.” He founded Resurgence & Ecologist magazine and Schumacher College for ecological studies in Devon, where he now lives. What is inspirational is his universal respect, his clarity of purpose, his colossal sense of adventure and his appreciation of the moment.A Climate of Truthby Mike Berners-Lee is published by Cambridge.The Death of the Heartby Elizabeth BowenChosen by Tessa Hadley, authorView image in fullscreenWhen I was trying and failing to write fiction as a young woman, a lot of the 20th-century male writers I most admired seemed to have finished with realism and the novel, as if its illusionism and its aim at lifelikeness were childishly naive, belonging to an unsophisticated earlier time. When I first read Elizabeth Bowen’s The Death of the Heart, what joy and confirmation to find her sweating, in the 1930s, over every sentence, in her magnificent effort to capture the effects of the real, so solid and so fleeting – swans on frozen water in the park, a drunken fumbling in a seaside cinema, an airless London bourgeois home. This truth to life was what I always wanted as a reader; she gave me heart that it was worth striving for as a writer.The Partyby Tessa Hadley is published by Jonathan Cape.The People of the Abyssby Jack LondonChosen by Ferdia Lennon, authorView image in fullscreenI first picked up this book on the recommendation of George Orwell, which is pretty solid as book recommendations go. At the turn of the century, Jack London, best known for Call of the Wild and White Fang, travelled to London to explore its East End. What he encountered there disturbed him. In the largest city of the richest and most powerful nation in the world, he found poverty on an unimaginable scale. Through the personal stories of factory workers, vagabonds, workhouse inmates and discharged soldiers, the other side of the empire is achingly and compellingly revealed. As an Irish person, you take it as given that the British empire is not something to be celebrated, but until I’d read this book, I think I held quite a binary view of who the winners and losers were. What I hadn’t quite grasped, until London brought it home to me in such a vivid and humane way, was the terrible cost of keeping the vast machine of an industrialised empire running, not just for those who were colonised, but also for the great masses at the heart of the empire who had supposedly won.Glorious Exploitsby Ferdia Lennon is published by Fig Tree.The Bluest Eyeby Toni MorrisonChosen by Kate Mosse, authorView image in fullscreenGrowing up in rural Sussex in the 1960s and 70s, living very much the same kind of narrow provincial life my parents and grandparents had lived before me, it was only through the BBC’s Six O’Clock News that I got glimpses of worlds very different from my own. The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison’s beautiful and uncompromising debut novel, changed all that. Not only did it make me look beyond my own experience to the realities of a more complicated, more varied world, but it showed the power of fiction. Set in 1941 in rural Ohio in the years following the Great Depression, the narrative is centred around Pecola and the hardships, abuses and misunderstandings she suffers. It’s heart-breaking – a story of powerlessness, race, dislocation, survival and poverty, and what it means to be female. Essential reading and a novel that changes each time you return to it.The Map of Bonesby Kate Mosse is published by Mantle.I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud …and Other Poems You Half-Remember from School, edited byAnaSampsonChosen by Len Pennie, poetView image in fullscreenI never used to think that I might fit into poetry, or that poetry might fit into me. It was to be studied, not enjoyed; analysed, but never truly understood. Poetry in the school context provided me with a list of concepts and techniques, allowing me to successfully pick at the bones of someone else’s imagination, readily regurgitating what I’d gleaned in the exam hall. Anything I didn’t really get was due to a lack of intellect, and anything I didn’t really like, a lack of taste. I’ve read and reread this anthology many times since my parents gave it to me; every time I find something new to chew on.poyumsby Len Pennie is published by Canongate.Predictably Irrationalby Dan ArielyChosen by Joanne Harris, authorView image in fullscreenI first met Dan Ariely on a tour of the US, and read his book out of curiosity. Nearly 20 years later, I still have my copy and revisit it regularly: it made me completely reassess the decision-making process I used to take for granted, and which I (wrongly, like most people) assumed was based on rational thinking. In fact, as Ariely says in the book, humans often make impulsive, irrational decisions, and once we understand how this works, we can sometimes avoid the pitfalls into which such thinking can lead us. It’s an upbeat, accessible book, with a genuinely revolutionary message: and once I’d learned to identify some of the behaviours described, I started to see them everywhere.Vianneby Joanne Harris is published by Orion.TheHay festivalruns until 1 June.

I think there’s a cautionary tale to the way artists are silenced; it’s often the thin end of a very thick wedge. And it’s undeniable that this is happening globally now. Oppression comes in many forms, and it’s touching all our lives to greater and lesser degrees.”In the US, Donald Trump hasexerted control over which cultural pursuits the government backs, from taking the reins of the Kennedy Center to targeting “improper ideology” at the Smithsonian Institution. In the UK, Arts Council England became mired in controversy last year when it warned that “political statements” could break funding agreements after discussions with the government aboutartists speaking out over the Israel-Gaza war.A recent report by Freemuse saidartistic freedom was more threatened globally than ever, citing a culture of “censorship (including self-censorship), imprisonment, travel bans, misuse of defamation, harassment, blasphemy legislation, misuse of anti-terrorism legislation” and violence.Blanchett said the idea for a new fund was born after “a group of us collected at the global refugee forum 18 months ago, and pledged to one another that we would find a way to highlight displaced perspectives and help them find a more mainstream audience”.It comes amid a global crisis, with 122.6 million peopleforcibly displacedowing to war, persecution or human rights abuses, according to the UN. This amounts to one in 67 people worldwide, with 71% of displacements occurring in low- and middle-income nations.“Forced displacement around the world is one of the greatest challenges that we face as a species, yet it’s often outside the mainstream cultural conversation. When I started working with UNHCR 10 years ago, the numbers of forcibly displaced people around the world were approaching 60 million. They’re now over 120 and rising,” Blanchett said.“I think it’s very easy to be overwhelmed by those numbers and to disconnect from the individuals behind the numbers.Refugeesare often stigmatised, demonised and ostracised. They are often used as political footballs. But during my travels with UNHCR, I’ve heard stories of resilience, and great humour, and have even found portals into my own experience. I found that I have much more in common with these people than the mainstream media would make me believe.”The Australian actor, who has appeared in dozens of critically acclaimed films, including Tár, Carol and Blue Jasmine – and whocreated the 2020 Australian series Statelessabout unlawful detention in Australia – said it was important to find common themes in other people’s stories and experiences.Film-making, she said, was a way to “break down” the barriers between us. “We’re told that refugees are coming for our jobs or going to disrupt civil society. But in fact, these people have so much to offer. They’re architects, lawyers, doctors, plumbers, they’re people who are highly skilled, whose lives have been put on hold, but their humanity has not,” Blanchett said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His new, untitled short is set after the death of an exiled writer as his family tries to fulfil his wish to be buried according to his will.The director said: “When I first heard about this fund and its incentives, I felt comfort, seeing that there are people who have this care and concern for us.“It reminded me of the very specific moment when I was fleeing my country, when I was a step away from crossing the border. I looked at my homeland for one last time, and thought about all the other people who had to leave their roots, their culture, behind, and fight for their freedom of expression.”Rasoulof said that, despite his experiences of “captivity and interrogation”, he didn’t flee Iran for comfort or security. “It’s not about that.

A couple of months later my relationship of six years broke down. That summer was the darkest period of my adult life. It felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me and I was self soothing in ways that I’m not proud of. My mental health was spiralling. My morals were out the door and I hardly recognised myself.By the next April things were turning around. I was seeing a therapist and working on getting my mental and physical health back.It was around this time I was out partying one night at the gay club, Universal, on Oxford Street in Sydney. I was letting my hair down, having a hell of a time, when the sea of people on the dancefloor parted and saw this beautiful Latino guy. I stopped in my tracks, suddenly, he was all I could see. When we locked eyes for what couldn’t have been for more than a few seconds, it felt like a lifetime.The moment I knew: once her migraine had subsided, I told her I loved herRead moreWe chatted later that night and over the coming months got to know each other as friends.By the springtime romance had blossomed. I was learning more about him and while he was strikingly attractive and extremely fun to be around, on a deeper level I started to realise just how much respect I had for him as a person.He’d arrived from Colombia six years earlier, without a word of English and no family or friends. What he’d been through before coming to Australia and what he’d achieved since was awe-inspiring to me. This kind of deep admiration certainly wasn’t a hallmark of previous relationships I’d had.As the year came to end we still weren’t official but we decided to take a holiday to Bali together. On the day we were due to leave I was turned away at the airport thanks to a tiny tear in my passport. We decided Danny should go on without me.It seemed like the universe was putting the brakes on, but I decided to go home and rebook my ticket. I put on a disguise, went back to the airport and made it through customs. I surprised him in Bali eight hours later. We got our new year’s kiss and cemented ourselves as a couple.View image in fullscreenMatty Mills and Danny quad biking in Bali in December 2023.Photograph: Matty MillsAs romantic as that moment was, it was a conversation a few months later that confirmed my love for him absolutely.One thing that was obvious about Danny right from the start was how compassionate he is. He perceives human frailty in a way most of us can only aspire to. In my own life, I was carrying a lot of anger about my upbringing and the impact my mother’s struggles with alcoholism and addiction had on me. Our relationship was fraught and as much as I loved her, my judgment and disappointment was palpable every time I saw her. It was horrible for everyone.One day as I complained to Danny about how difficult this all felt for me, how unfair it seemed and how taxing it was, he looked at me warmly and gently asked: “Well how do you think she feels?”When I asked him to explain, he reminded me to count my blessings and remember what my mother had lost throughout it all. Maybe what your mother needs is your love, not your judgment, he said.This knocked me for six. It was such a mature, heartfelt, sincere response. I’d never had anyone frame it that way for me. His tender perspective allowed me to see for the first time how much my mum had suffered too. I knew then what I needed to do to shift the patterns we were entrenched in. It changed everything.The moment I knew: he bared his soul in a performance and I fell for his sensitive sideRead moreThe wisdom and kindness he showed in that situation just blew me away. And it was brave of him too, I could have taken it really badly, but in that instant I knew that he was the one. I could see then and there that whatever we faced in life together he would always be there to show empathy, reserve judgment and take me to higher ground.Anytime I’m faced with a dilemma, he’s the first person I turn to. He’s shown me time and time again how deep his integrity runs and that he has my best interests at heart. I never really had good role models like that around me. So, as much as he’s my partner, more than that, he’s an inspiration too.Matty Mills is an ambassador forThe Push-Up Challenge, which helps raise awareness of better mental health for Australians.

Halfway there I find the tortoise lying on his back on the path. He can’t have been there for more than an hour, as he wasn’t there when I came out.“What happened to you?” I say, setting him on his feet. But it’s pretty obvious what happened: he tried to exit the garden bed by climbing over the border of diagonally laid bricks and overbalanced. It’s an obstacle he surmounts without difficulty between five and 10 times a day in the warmer months, but occasionally – perhaps once every four years – he puts a foot wrong. So far, I have always been there to turn him back over.I walk away, because the tortoise always gives the impression of preferring to be left alone with his humiliationThe mishap comes less than a week after he made hisfirst serious escape bid in about a decade, slipping out through the open side door and getting all the way across the street before some estate agents found him. It’s easy to think of the tortoise as being self-regulating and largely content, when in truth he is simultaneously vulnerable and wily – always probing the garden’s perimeter for security weaknesses.“Let this be a reminder of how poorly you’d fare out there,” I say, pointing towards the road. Then I walk away, because the tortoise always gives the impression of preferring to be left alone with his humiliation.In the kitchen I find the oldest one drinking a large coffee and staring at his laptop. He works from home on certain unspecified days of the week, this apparently being one of them.“Hey,” I say. He watches as I go to the coffee machine, empty out the old grounds and fetch myself a cup.“There’s no milk,” he says.“Ugh,” I say. “Now I have to put on shoes.”Stomping to the shops, I think about the sudden spike in our milk consumption. The oldest one has returned home indefinitely. Because of this his brothers drop by more often, generally without warning. Supper plans get changed, beers are opened and the evening is suddenly dominated by frankly insane arguments about the middle ages. It’s not that I don’t enjoy the sound of a house filled with merry laughter and clinking glasses, it’s just that I’ve got used to having all that by prior appointment only.The shop is out of two-litre containers of milk, so I buy two one-litre containers. I have a strong urge to write my name on one of them.In the afternoon the day turns hotter still. The tortoise sits outside my office door in the shade of a rosemary bush, perhaps imagining for a moment that he’s back home in Greece – a place, I would like to remind him, where I’ve seen lots of empty, bleached, upside down tortoise shells lying around. The sky turns hazy and the air grows close, as if presaging a coming storm. But then the sun comes out again.I start thinking about supper, but this raises a question I can’t answer: how many will we be?The tortoise has pushed himself deeper into the rosemary, which is where he’ll spend the night. I head to the house to assess the situation. My wife and I arrive in the kitchen at the same moment, from opposite directions.“What are you doing in here?” she says.“Never mind that,” I say. “What are you doing in here?” There is a thoughtful pause.“Can’t remember,” she says.A key turns in the front door lock, and the middle one walks in. His hair is matted to his head, his sleeves are dripping on to the floor, and his shoes squelch as he walks.“You’re soaking wet!” my wife says.“I just got caught in the worst downpour I’ve ever seen,” he says.“But it hasn’t rained here at all,” I say.“Hail, lightning, flash floods, everything,” he says. “It was crazy.”“Take everything off and put it in the dryer,” my wife says.“Not a drop,” I say, “I was going to water the garden later.”The oldest one walks in.“What happened to you?” he says.“Do you want to stay to supper?” my wife says.“Yeah,” the middle one says, a puddle forming under him.“So that’s four,” I say.“No, I’m going out,” the oldest one says.As I stare into the fridge it occurs to me that the more often people are here, the more likely it is someone will find me when I end up on my back on the garden path.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The latter is important, because to get this mighty berry to reach its delicious potential, we need to dehydrate it (that is, remove as much water as possible and then hit it with lots of flavour). You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it. In this recipe, after roasting, I’ve used one of my favourite braising liquids – a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame – to bring the aubergine back to life.Soy sauce, sake and sesame oil-braised auberginesCooking sake can be bought in larger supermarkets and Chinese grocery stores (if you can’t find it, use a nice drinking sake that will go nicely with the meal instead). Cook the rice before starting on the aubergines and cover it with a lid – it will stay warm for an hour.Prep10 minCook35 minServes43 large or 4 medium aubergines(1.1kg)4 tbsp sunflower oil, or rapeseed oil5 tbsp light soy sauce¼ tsp fine sea salt6 tbsp cooking sake2 tsp light brown sugar2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar5 tbsp toasted sesame oil3cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 red bird’s eye chilli, slit lengthways100g spring onions, halved across the belly, then cut lengthways into long, thin strips (and rinsed, if need be)Toasted sesame seeds, to finishCooked plain rice, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two large trays with baking paper. Trim the tops off the aubergines, then cut each one into eight long wedges. Put these in a bowl with the sunflower oil, toss with your hands to coat, then lay the wedges side by side on the oven trays. Bake for 25 minutes, until soft.Meanwhile, make the braising liquid. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar and three tablespoons of toasted sesame oil.Put the remaining two tablespoons of sesame oil in a small frying pan on a medium to low heat and, once hot, add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for two minutes, until pale golden. Add the spring onions, stir for a minute, then add the soy and sake mixture, take off the heat and mix well.When the aubergines have had their 25 minutes, transfer them to a smaller, lipped baking tray, laying the wedges on top of each other. Stir the braising liquid again, then pour it all over the aubergines and shake the tin to make sure all the aubergines are covered. Roast for a further 10 minutes, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with rice alongside.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkMain courseJapanese food and drinkSpiritsVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

What it deems to be interesting is fed to millions of users, giving it huge cultural sway, from fashion to music and politics. It is also increasingly influencing what we eat.Supermarkets were once the trendsetters, studying popular items on restaurant menus and recreating them on their shelves. Now the big shops are the ones being influenced, says Zoe Simons, a brand development chef at Waitrose.“The power has flipped,” she says. “Before, we relied on what was popular at restaurants or we had to wait months for data to come through. Now, because of TikTok andInstagram, our accuracy has gotten so much better.”View image in fullscreenDubai Chocolate bar with green kadayif and pistachio.Photograph: Katsiaryna Maiseyonak/AlamyIt is not hard to spot this influence in action: matcha lattes, made from Japanese green tea, have exploded in popularity on social media, and now feature on menus at Pret a Manger, Starbucks and Gail’s. This week, Britain’s biggest bakery chain, Greggs, attributed better sales growth toa mac and cheese that “went viral on TikTok”, with a video of the snack played more than 3m times.Perhaps most notably: the “Dubai chocolate” bar, invented by Sarah Hamouda, a British-Egyptian living in Dubai, became a huge viral hit. Onevideoof a food influencer eating the bar, which contains a filling of pistachio cream and tahini with knafeh (a traditional Arab dessert), has more than 120m views on TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance.Now supermarkets are using artificial intelligence tools that track online recipes, social media discussions and restaurant reviews to react faster to these trends. Where product development projects used to take months, products can hit the shelves in as little as a few weeks.The Dubai chocolate bar, for example, has inspired a range of pistachio treats from big shops in the UK. Lidl launched its own version, as did Lindt, and whenWaitrose launched it in March it imposed on customers a two-bar limit.But in the fields of the global agricultural sector – far from screen-addicted British shoppers, UK supermarkets or even TikTok’s headquarters in Singapore – producers are struggling to cope with the sudden, huge spikes caused by rapid food trends.View image in fullscreenIced matcha to go! A pop-up store serves matcha.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/PAThe popularity of the Dubai chocolate bar has already contributed to a shortage in the green nut. In the past year, pistachio kernel prices have risen from €6.65 (£5.59) a pound to €8.96 a pound, an increase of nearly 35%, according to the data monitor platform Tridge. It is on track to hit €10.80 a pound by the end of the year, Tridge said.That is despite the fact that production of the nut has expanded rapidly. The US is now the biggest producer of pistachios in the world. American pistachio farms, which are mostly in California, collectively account for 43% of global production, making an even larger contribution in its category than America’s market share in its traditional agricultural exports such as corn, cheese and beef..It is a similar story in the matcha industry. A spike in demand for the green powder prompted tea companies Ippodo and Marukyu Koyamaen in Kyoto toimpose purchase limitslast year. That was again despite huge ramp-ups in production in an attempt to meet demand: Japan produced 4,176 tonnes of matcha in 2023, nearly three times the quantity in 2010.The shortage has not been easy to navigate for Hanife Hursit, a 25-year-old who three weeks ago opened a matcha and coffee shop with her father, Ram, in King’s Cross, London.“Right before my first stock, my suppliers said we might have to wait for a while,” she says. “The shortage is a big issue, it’s blown up everywhere.”But the opening of Frothee, Hursit’s cafe, attracted a huge queue of customers, mainly young women, on the first day.The young entrepreneur, who used to work as a social media manager and has a personal following of more than 19,000 accounts on TikTok, has built her menu around drinks and flavour combinations trending online. They include strawberry, brown sugar and jasmin-flavoured matcha lattes.View image in fullscreenHanife Hursit, co-founder of Frothee with her father, Ram, in Caledonian Road, King’s Cross, London.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“I knew how much it had blown up online and I knew it was going to reach a peak where everyone loved matcha,” she says. Many of the drinks have been inspired by at-home recipes trending on TikTok, she adds. “Earl grey matcha is our bestseller by far,” she says. “Whatever I put on the menu was crafted by my For You page and also by what I love.”The temptation to add pistachio flavours on her menu has been strong, but rapidly rising wholesale costs have been a barrier. “I said to our baker: ‘Should we try a pistachio product?’ But it’s just too expensive, even at wholesale prices.”The environmental cost may also prove to be another barrier for sellers in the future, Mzingaye Ndubiwa, a market analyst at Tridge, adds.“The pistachio nut is a water-intensive crop cultivated mainly in California or Iran, which are known for their drought-torn regions,” he says. “Ultimately leading to the overuse of groundwater, the increased demand from the international market puts immense stress on water systems that are already scarce.”There are fears too that rapidly expanding the cultivation of a single crop, driven by social media trends, could contribute to deforestation for monoculture farming, which in turn harms wildlife. “Because of this, there is an increased reliance on herbicides and pesticides, which contaminate soil and water systems,” he said.“Trends steered by social media can fuel environmental decline if it disappears as quickly as it appeared.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryTikTokInstagramSupermarketsRetail industrySocial mediaFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The National EmploymentSavingsTrust (Nest) has grown to be the largest workplace pension scheme by member numbers, with more than a third of UK employees enrolled in it .It’s 20 years ago this year since a government commission recommended creating “a low-cost, national funded pension savings scheme” into which individuals would be “automatically enrolled”. That led to Nest being set up as a publicly owned body to invest people’s pension savings.Data shared with the Guardian reveals that, to date, some Nest members have almost tripled their money once you include employer contributions and investment returns. That beats what they would have made from other savings products such asIsas.We looked at what Nest is doing with your retirement savings.View image in fullscreenNest invests in UK ports infrastructure, including Leith in Edinburgh.Photograph: Sally Anderson/AlamyWhat goes inSet up as a public corporation as part of the government’s automatic enrolment revolution, Nest was described at the time as “the biggest shake-up in UK pensions for over 100 years” and designed to get millions more people paying into a pension.Auto-enrolment requires all employers to automatically put eligible workers into a workplace pension where both parties pay money in. It even applies to those employing just one person, such as some people who employ a nanny, carer or gardener.The regime officially kicked off in 2012 and affects everyone in work aged between 22 and the state pension age who earns more than £10,000 a year and does not already have a suitable workplace pension.Employers must choose a provider to run the scheme for them. This provider takes the money and invests it to generate returns. Big-name employers that are using, or have used, Nest to enrol at least some employees into a pension include the BBC, McDonald’s and BT.You may not be in Nest yourself, but if – for example – you have a child or grandchild who started working during the last few years, they may well have a Nest pension pot. Most members are aged 20 to 39.Other providers include The People’s Pension, now:pensions and Smart Pension – but with more than 13.7 million members, Nest is by far the biggest.The investmentsDo you have an iPhone? Do you shop on Amazon? Do you use Google? If you have money in Nest, your pension may be riding on the fortunes of the big US tech firms behind such products and brands.As of the end of March, the top eight shareholdings of Nest’s default “2040 retirement date fund” were: Apple; Microsoft; the US-based computer chip maker Nvidia; Amazon; Google’s parent company Alphabet; the Facebook owner Meta; the investment company Berkshire Hathaway; and the carmaker Tesla.Some members may be uneasy about how much of their money is crossing the Atlantic, in effect helping to make tech oligarchs such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg even wealthier.View image in fullscreenTesla is one of Nest’s top eight holdings.Photograph: TeslaThat said, while a sizeable chunk of people’s money is invested in global shares, Nest is increasingly moving into investments such as private assets (including private equity and infrastructure) and private credit (basically loans to businesses).In the UK, for example, it has invested in everything from windfarms, including the huge Hornsea 1 project off the east coast of England, and solar farms, including one in Reading. It has also bought into port operators such as Forth Ports, which runs Tilbury, and shopping centres such as the Dolphin in Poole, Dorset.Nestrecently announcedit would be helping to build thousands of new homes for rent through a link-up with other organisations. Manchester’s New Jackson neighbourhood has been named as the first site.View image in fullscreenNest also invests in windfarms, such as the Hornsea 1 project off the Yorkshire coast.Photograph: Orsted/EPAOne interesting business in Nest’s portfolio is Deep Green, which uses the heat generated by datacentres to help UK swimming pools save money and ultimately stay open by reducing their costs.Nest’s private market holdings include loans to a five-star hotel in Paris and a French cinema group, and investments in timber – for example, it part-owns a forest in Washington state in the US.The performanceView image in fullscreenTravel and leisure facilities such as five-star hotels are among Nest’s interests.Photograph: Panther Media GmbH/AlamyWe asked Nest to provide performance data, plus figures for how much people who joined the scheme at the start may have in their pension funds now.It based its calculations on someone on an average annual UK full-time income of £37,000 who, since October 2012, has made pension contributions each month at the minimum level. The figures are based on them saving into Nest’s default 2040 retirement fund.The individual would have paid in £7,605, and their employer £6,172. They have received £1,901 of tax relief on top – paid into the fund – and benefited from £5,482 of investment growth. Lop off Nest’s charges – £521 in this case – and their fund is worth £20,639 (as of the end of April this year).However, the figure for someone using Nest’s “higher risk” fund – for those willing to take more risk in the hope that their pot will grow faster – is £21,011. For its ethical fund option, the figure is £19,082.Trillions of dollars were wiped from global stock markets in early April after Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs, but markets later rallied, and the good news is that those three figures are all slightly higher than they were at the end of March.Nest’s 2040 retirement fund has delivered a total cumulative return of 199% up to the end of April 2025, assuming someone signed up on day one, while the higher risk fund delivered 236%, and the ethical fund 208%.View image in fullscreenPensions have recovered from recent falls after the US president, Donald Trump, embarked on his tariff war.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAA typical global investment fund has delivered a return of about 212% over the same period, while a typical Europe (including the UK) fund has delivered 188%, according to the data provider Morningstar Direct.The ‘small pots’ problemWhile Nest has more than 13 million members, the most recent data showed that more than 9 million of them were “non-contributing” members who were not topping up their pots. Many are people who started a job and were put into the Nest scheme, but then quit that job for another one, leaving their pot behind.View image in fullscreenIf you are unsure whether you have money held with Nest, check your paperwork as you should have received a welcome pack.Photograph: Avpics/AlamyA very rough calculation suggests the average Nest pension pot size is perhaps a little more than £3,800. That disguises a wide range of values: while some pots will be sizeable, others will have perhaps just a few hundred pounds in them.If you are unsure whether or not you have money held in Nest, check your paperwork – it will have sent you a welcome pack shortly after your employer put you into the scheme.Nest hasa page on its websiteon identifying your pension pots. You can also call its member help centre on 0300 0200 393, which should be able to help locate your Nest account, if you have one.If you do, you can view it by logging into your online account – you will need to provide your national insurance number when you do so for the first time.Explore more on these topicsPensionsAuto-enrolment pensionsPensions industrySavingsInvestmentsInvestingIsasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without the points, the flights cost £1,300.But after the points had been transferred and he booked the tickets, it emerged that they did not belong to the seller. Turner was told by BA that the points had been “fraudulently obtained”.He was left with a non-refundable hotel booking and airport transfers worth £700.“Both of us are self-employed so this has hit us hard, financially and emotionally,” he said. “It’s heartbreaking to tell someone you love that the holiday you both looked forward to for months is gone.”He added: “We would have never flown business class, to be honest, without seeing this. It was just a cool thing which we thought we could do and it would cost the same amount as a normal flight.”Turner paid of the points using a bank transfer, and they were transferred to his Avios account.But then BA contacted him and said the points had been fraudulently obtained and removed them from him. The airline said it knew Turner had nothing to do with the fraud, and refunded the additional legitimate Avios he used towards the flight.“Scams like this can still happen even when you think you’ve protected yourself. I had the points in my account before paying – and I still got scammed,” he said. “If it’s happening in one Facebook group with 75,000 members, you can bet it’s happening in others too.”Up to 60,000 Avios points can be transferred legitimately between people on the airline’s website for an admin fee of £50.BAsaid in a statement that the sale of the points had violated its terms and conditions as selling or buying “via outside sources” was forbidden.It added that the stolen Avios points had been restored to the person who they belonged to. Turner said the person who sold him the fraudulent points had deleted his Facebook account.New rules requiring banks and other payment companies to reimburse fraud victims who have been tricked into sending money to scammers took effect last October.

The ones composed of contrasting, caricatured environments spaced neatly within the concise contours of a fictional island, say, bearing labels like Wild Wood, Barren Bog and Misty Hills. Enticing though these untamed landscapes are, I’m in search of a different kind of bounty.Beyond its green, green hills, castles, beaches and historic market towns (not leastDylan Thomas’s Laugharne), Carmarthenshire is also considered the Garden of Wales – which was news to me, despite family ties to the area. I’ve visited some of these botanical highlights over the years, such asAberglasney Gardensfor their tonal variety and theNational Botanic Gardenwith its astounding glasshouse.View image in fullscreenBut with ever more tempting places to eat, sleep and ramble within this corner of Wales, I’ve often thought of composing a gardener’s dream itinerary: a handful of the county’s best gardens, a forest walk, an inviting pub or two, and somewhere lovely to stay the night. This spring I finally got around to road testing it.The first thing to figure out was the all-important base from which to explore the county. Equidistant between the towns of Carmarthen and Llandeilo, forming the apex of a Carmarthenshire triangle, is the pretty village ofBrechfa: a clutch of stone cottages, a community shop, pub and chapel below a forested hillside and beside the frothing River Cothi. It’s also the home ofTŷ Mawr, a Grade II-listed country hotel and restaurant that prides itself on its dining, spacious rooms (Tŷ Mawr means big house), dog-friendliness and a location at once “in the middle of nowhere yet close to everywhere”– which was certainly true for the purposes of my visit, with all waypoints little more than 20 minutes’ drive away. Welcoming my wife and I at the end of our M4 slog from Hampshire was hotelier David, who with his partner, Gill, took the reins of Tŷ Mawr in 2022.View image in fullscreenTŷ Mawr hotelAfter breakfast, there was a temptation to savour the hotel’s own apple-blossomed garden and terrace, but our first location beckoned: Abergwili’sBishop’s Park and Gardens. Now managed by the Tywi Gateway Trust, charitable investment has helped to rejuvenate this relic site on the outskirts of Carmarthen (also the home of theCarmarthenshire Museum), while the restored grounds encompass a planted woodland walk, a water meadow and lake, and specimen trees once the pride of the resident bishops, including monkey puzzles and dawn redwoods. At its heart is the Jenkinson Garden: a series of intensively gardened 19th century-themed beds, which head gardener Blue Barnes-Thomas infuses with vibrant plug-ins – tulips and crocuses for spring, umbels and sweet peas for summer. Walking me around the site, he explained the next steps in the renewal project, including renovating its 18th-century walled garden with new pathways, accessible greenhouses and heritage gooseberries.The Kew-trained head gardener has continued Aberglasney’s development into one of the finest formal gardens in the UKLunch was atWright’sin Llanarthney. Owned and run by food writerSimon Wright, together with his wife, Maryann, it offers a chic, pared-down menu of elaborate flavours, and a lovely asparagus salad.If you sampled a glass too many of the robust house wine, the good news is that AberglasneyGardensis only a stone’s throw across the Tywi valley, its floral exuberance and plant diversity a kind of intoxication in itself.Much like Bishop’s Park, Aberglasney is a story of successful regeneration: a crumbling mansion and a four-hectare (10-acre) garden painstakingly and beautifully resuscitated, opening to the public in 1999. Featuring alpine, kitchen and Elizabethan cloister gardens, meadows crammed withfritillariaandcamassia,an indoor ninfariumand a walled garden reimagined by garden designer Penelope Hobhouse, the place is a genuine wonder. In 2011, Kew-trained head gardener Joseph Atkin was appointed to continue the garden’s evolution, which saw Aberglasney develop into one of the finest formal gardens in the UK.View image in fullscreenThe walled garden and mansion at Aberglasney Gardens.Photograph: Nigel McCall/AlamyA few years ago, Atkin hung up the trowel and opened a pub –The Plough– up the road in Felingwm, where you can find relaxed, wood-fired dining, Welsh ales and – if you’re cheeky enough to ask – a little gardening advice on the side.On into the afternoon sun, which only intensified the lush profusion, and “up country” to Llandysul, as no garden itinerary is complete without an independent plant nursery – and here lies one of the greats.Spanning 1.2 hectares of polytunnels, open stock yards and shopfront,Farmyard Nurseriesis known for its eclectic, hardy plants, including an expansive collection of exquisite hellebores.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is where nursery owner Richard Bramley and his team have let fancies run feral. Japanese maples and bright rhododendrons spill over narrow woodchip pathways, while drifts of spring ephemerals and shade-loving perennials (such as yellow comfrey and, indeed, many of the nursery’s hellebores) spread out below the deciduous canopy. Buried within are further surprises: a wildlife pond and a Tolkienesque lath and plaster hut – a whimsical, after-hours project Richard told me was contrived as they went along. We left Farmyard Nurseries with a crate of the liquorice-scentedagastache‘Blackadder’ and a scarletaquilegiaI’ve long sought.If floral yearnings aren’t satiated at this point in the day, on the way back to Brechfa, you could drop intoNorwood Gardens and Tea Rooms, which offers a range of Mediterranean, woodland and bog plantings. But we were keen to get back in time for the three-course dinner at Tŷ Mawr, featuring butter bean cassoulet and braised hake.An abundance of pale pink cuckoo flowers led down a misty, gorse-lit track into shafts of morning sunlightOur meal plans were almost scuppered, however, when our car broke down on the Llandysul to Brechfa road, high on the lofty peat moor above Tŷ Mawr. The dramatic remoteness of the location was actually quite comical – we couldn’t have picked a more isolated spot for an alternator failure (here’s a tip: if it sounds like something just fell out of your engine, reconsider crossing barren moorland). Owing to the kindness of a local mechanic, we were back at the hotel within an hour or so, leaning into a mushroom paté starter.A slower pace on day two allowed for a wander along one of Brechfa’s many surrounding forestry trails, managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). We opted for theKeepers Riverside Trail, its abundance of pale pink cuckoo flowers leading down a misty, gorse-lit track into shafts of morning sunlight. There are numerous mountain bike and riding trails here also, though NRW are still working to reopen theBrechfa Forest Garden– an experimental forestry plot established in the late 1950s that now makes for an impressive coniferous arboretum – after storm damage.View image in fullscreenThe National Botanic Garden of Wales in Llanarthney.Photograph: Tim JonesYou can then take the road south, crossing the River Tywi once more, for theNational Botanic Garden of Wales. Resist making straight for the Great Glasshouse perched at the top of the hill – the largest single-span glasshouse in the world. Instead, let that be the encore and take your time meandering up – via the daylily-lined lake and the deep herbaceous beds; the Japanese, walled, kitchen and boulder gardens; and the orchid-filled tropical house. And once in the vast glasshouse, enjoy the snaking pathways that lead through geographically themed zones displaying the likes of Australianbanksia, South Africanproteaand magnificent Macaronesianechium.The garden’s progressive aspirations include reversing the decline of Welsh-native flora and getting every school child in Wales engaged with nature.Anew cycle path, already partially opened, is due to be completed this autumn, connecting most of the locations mentioned here. Beginning at Bishop’s Park and tracing a former railway track through the scenic Tywi valley, you can jump off for the botanic gardens, Wright’s and Aberglasney, and do away with the car altogether.The trip was provided byDiscover CarmarthenshireandTŷ Mawr Hotel and Restaurant(doubles from £140 B&B).Lunch was hosted atWright’sExplore more on these topicsWales holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysRoad tripsGardensShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His initial focus was on the buildings themselves: the government-built blocks, dating from 1984, are characterised by their ski slope-style roofs.“We only get two kinds of weather in Singapore – rainy and overcast, or sunny and warm,” Soh says. “This day was in the latter category. The puddle wasn’t made from rainwater, but a jet-wash machine. A community basketball court was being cleaned.

Network state proponents envision a network of extra-national communities that exist beyond the control of nation-states.The Guardian contacted the Wagon Box founder and owner Paul McNiel for comment. He did not respond directly but insteadposted a screenshotof the request to X appended with commentary.There, McNiel said he was driven by “good-faith curiosity” that events there had been “largely focused on a suspicion of ‘the machine’” and boasted of the “breadth of the politics represented”, citing appearances by the likes of Patrick Deneen and Seneca Scott.Deneen is a Notre Dame professor and conservative political theorist whose 2023 book Regime Change “offered a previewof the Trump administration’s intention to breathe fire on America’s cultural institutions” whose fans include JD Vance, the vice-president.Scott, who McNiel described as a “90s Democrat who wants a safe community for his family and goats”, is a former union organizer based in Oakland, California, whose activism, political campaigning and social media outputhave targetedtransgender people, homeless encampments, local media organizations, progressive politicians and city employees.‘Liberalism is crumbling’Sheridan county property records indicate that Paul McNiel bought the property that includes the Wagon Box – formerly a holiday destination and RV park – in August 2022.Property records, satellite imagery, and media posted on social media platforms and on the Wagon Box website indicate a semi-rural location on the western fringes of Story.Since McNiel took control of the property, it has played host to a string of events, many of them featuring figures associated with overlapping rightwing movements.The project has drawn concerns in local media, but garnered a laudatorywrite-upin the Bari Weiss-founded Free Press. Free Press investors include rightwing tech figures likeMarc Andreessen and Trump administration “crytpo czar” David Sacks.McNiel – billed as a millionaire in an appearance on a real estate investment podcast in 2021 – is the principal of a legion of LLCs, according to company records in Alaska,Wyoming, Montana and North Carolina.View image in fullscreenAnother view of the Wagon Box Inn.Photograph: Google MapsProperty records and data brokers indicate that McNiel or LLCs controlled by him have bought and sold dozens of properties – many of them trailer parks or similar sites for low-cost housing – in at least three states.According tofounding documentson its website, Wagon Box is run as adecentralized autonomous organization(DAO), a term for organizations managed in part via decentralized technologies like blockchains and smart contracts.A 2021 Wyominglawallows DAOs to incorporate in the state, despite their often anonymous ownership structure. The sparsely populated state is notorious for a“cowboy cocktail”of loose financial regulations and opaque company ownership.“We’re not northern Idaho or even Montana. We’ve so far managed to not attract the crazy far right to our state,” said Elizabeth Storer, a Democratic state representative from Jackson who has spoken critically of Wyoming’s libertarian financial laws and opacity.“We’ve allowed just about anyone to come into Wyoming because of our low tax environment, our limited liability corporation laws and the use of registered agents all over the state – it allows people to offshore funds in Wyoming with a great deal of secrecy,” she added.Thecurrent versionof a document explaining the DAO aligns the project with the network state movement, claiming that “the grand project of liberalism is crumbling, and that in its wake people are looking for new avenues of allegiance and interdependence”.The document continues “Balaji Srinivasan, among others, has identified this shift and suggested a process for uniting modern technologies with ancient human trends of association to createnetwork states”, providing a link to Srinivasan’s self-published 2022 book of the same name.Reverse diasporasSrinavisan is an entrepreneur and investor formerly associated with companies including Andreessen-Horowitz and Coinbase. (That company’s current CEO, Brian Armstrong, is anotheroutspoken booster of network states).For more than a decade, Srinivasan has advocated a radical anarcho-capitalist vision in which like-minded people can “exit” and place themselves beyond the legal and economic reach of nation-states in parallel, networked special economic zones.His ideas are often couched in vituperative attacks on his perceived enemies, including academics, government employees and the media.As early as 2013, Srinavisan wasadvocatinga “reverse diaspora” in which people enabled by technology could assemble in “cloud cities … outside the United States”. These “could be floating cities in international waters as put forth by Peter Thiel, or one of the more ambitious 80,000 person colonies on Mars desired by Elon Musk”.Soon after, in response toreportinglinking Silicon Valley figures to the anti-democratic neo-reactionary movement and its leading light, Curtis Yarvin, Srinavasanreportedlyemailed Yarvin with the suggestion that “it may be interesting to sic the Dark Enlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them and turn them inside out”.He later cited Yarvin in The Network State, writing: “As Yarvin in particular has documented at length, the most important left-authoritarians are not formally part of the elected state at all. They are the professors, activists, bureaucrats, and journalists.”He describes people in these fields as constituting “the control circuitry for the US government”.Last September, he opened a residential network school for would-be builders of network nations,reportedlylocated in Malaysia’s Forest City, whose “requirements include an admiration of ‘western values’, seeing Bitcoin as the successor to the US Federal Reserve, and trusting AI over human courts and judges”.View image in fullscreenBalaji Srinivasan in this 2022 picture.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe network state vision has already inspired an attempt to build a city,California Forever, in rural Solano county, with investors including Andreessen and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Network state advocates also reportedly want to construct a similar “charter city” inGreenlandif it is annexed by the United States.Donald Trump has floated the idea ofcreating 10 such “freedom cities” on federal land, including San Francisco’s Presidio.The movement alsooverlapswith efforts to mount a rightwing takeover of city governments in San Francisco and Oakland, with the likes of the Y Combinator CEO, Garry Tan,backingbothprojects.Srinivasan has offeredlurid fantasiesof what a tech-controlled San Francisco might look like. In an October 2023 podcast interview, he envisioned a city controlled by tech-aligned “grays” enjoying privileged access to large parts of the city, bribing a pliant police department, and with “blues” – San Francisco’s liberals – subject to exclusion and hostile propaganda.Devin Burghart, the executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Righs and a longtime observer of far-right organizing in the mountain west, told the Guardian in an interview that the Wagon Box was significant for being one of the first real-world attempts at constructing a “network state” hub beyond California.“They’ve tipped their hand a bit with the constant references to [accelerationist theorist] Nick Land and Italian futurism. This is a different veneer of the apocalyptic, post-democratic world view that is also quite common with militia and prepper types.”The Wagon Boxreportedlyattracted immediate scepticism from residents of tiny unincorporated Story in the months following its establishment.Attenders at a 2023 public meeting reportedly expressed concerns both about the draft DAO document’s vision of “‘capital seed for a nascent network state’ and … a place for either gatherings or apocalyptic retreat”, and McNiel’s association with the notorious anti-government activist Ryan Payne.In 2018, Payne was sentenced to federal prison on conspiracy charges after playing the role of, according to a federal judge, “an architect” of the 2016 Malheur national wildlife refuge occupation, in whichhe participatedalongside the likes of the currentfugitiveAmmon Bundy.‘A criminal regime’Wagon Box has hosted a series of events since McNiel’s acquisition, many with guests and themes associated with the far right.The 27 April event,Dawn in the West: A Futurist Serata(DitW) was subtitled “An UncleTed Talk”, a reference both to Ted talks and a nickname for the so-called Unabomber,Theodore Kaczynski.Advertising materials highlighted themes including the work of Land, who, alongside Yarvin, is one of the progenitors of the neo-reactionary movement, whose anti-democratic ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the Trump administration’s gutting of the federal government.Another advertised speaker at that event was Jonathan Keeperman. The GuardianidentifiedKeeperman in 2024 as the man behind the L0m3z X account and rightwing publisher Passage Press.Keeperman-founded Passage Press is also listed as a participant in Wagon Box’s 31 May roundtableCoalition for Cultural Renewal(CCR).The schedule for a Wagon Boxeventlast August promised a conversation between Keeperman and the journalist James Pogue on “the failure of liberalism and globalization”.Pogue has written extensively about the new right for media outlets including the New York Times and Vanity Fair.In a post at the Wagon Box’s Substack newsletter, Pogue and McNiel are pictured together in a photograph purportedly taken inside the Passage-Press-sponsoredCoronation Ballin Washington this January, and described in a caption as “Wagon Box brothers”.Keeperman is one of the overlaps between Wagon Box and a broader far-right milieu.Keeperman, for example, spoke last month at a pro-natalist conference in Austin, Texas, whose speaker roster included self-described eugenicists and promoters of race science.At the event, in response to a small protest on site, Keeperman took to X,posting: “NATALISM IS NAZISM Say it loud say it proud.”Balaji Srinivasan spoke at the same conference in 2023.The Natalism conference founder, Kevin Dolan, is listed in Texas company records as the principal of a natalism.org non-profit; a newly incorporated Eternal Capital Texas Inc; and Exit, a men-only organization which he characterized in a Substack newsletter as a rightwing business network which is “not just about making life in the regime more tolerable … setting ourselves up to succeed as it declines”.He founded that organization following Guardianreportingin 2021 that identified him as the man behind an influential “DezNat” account, “@extradeadjcb”.Exit is billed as a participant in Wagon Box’s CCR event, which will include other far-right publishers , along with Murphy’s Other Life and hard-right online magazine IM-1776.The Guardian previouslyreportedon IM-1776’s support of authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele; its enthusiasm for extremist political figures such as Gabriele D’Annunzio and Kaczynski; and its close links with contemporary hard-right activists like the culture warrior Christopher Rufo,Erik Princeandwould-be “warlord”Charles Haywood.IM-1776’s literary editor, Daniel Miller, is a speaker at DitW, and in YouTube videos posted to Wagon Box’s channel he is characterized as a writer-in-residence.In a January article for IM-1776, Miller called for Donald Trump tooverthrowthe government of the UK led by Keir Starmer and “liberate” the country, saying it was run by “a criminal regime” dominated by “a mafia-like organization of pathological personalities”, a necessity “as clear as the imperative of the Vietnamese to invade Cambodia and remove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979”.Miller did not respond to a request for comment.The Oakland connectionEvents this spring also bill speakers associated with a tech-backed hard-right political movement in California’s Bay Area.Scott – who has run both for city council and mayor in Oakland – is set to appear at the Doomer Optimism Campout in June.Scott’s political activities in Oakland – including the candidacies and his advocacy for the recall of former mayor Sheng Thao last year – have been punctuated by scandals.During his 2022 campaign media reports revealed a 2021 arrest oncharges of brandishing a firearm, in an incident that took place not far from the community garden he founded in West Oakland. Those charges were laterdismissed.Last December, the city of Oakland applied for a restraining order against Scott over his alleged harassment of a city worker during the recall campaign. Among other things, Scottreportedlyclaimed that the employee was a pedophile on social media and posted their address publicly. In aFebruary settlement, Scott agreed to stop posting personal information about the employee online.View image in fullscreenSeneca Scott, left, at a rally in Oakland last year.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst/Getty ImagesScott has received backing from rightwing tech figures includingTan, who, like Scott, has agitated against progressive approaches to homelessness and law and order, and employed bareknuckle social-media posting to promote his views.“If you want Oakland to be great then you will follow and support Seneca,” Tan wrote on X last year.In Oakland, Scott has drawn scrutiny for anti-transgender commentary and attacks on progressive voices in politics and media.Scott appeared at anotherWagon Box eventin summer 2024 in conversation about “Cities: urban agriculture, crime, and criminal justice reform”.Pogue also appeared alongside Scott at his community garden in a 2023 event hosted by a Scott-run non-profit, Neighbors Together Oakland, that was last yearshuttered by California’s attorney generallast year forconducting fundraisingwithout a non-profit license.In an interview withFree Pressin 2023, Scott had said he planned to use that non-profit as a platform to support “100 nontraditional candidates” for city councils, school boards, and potentially higher offices across the US.Another Doomer Optimism Campout speaker is Andrew Hock, a Tennessee political consultant who was reportedly involved with an alleged attempt to facilitate anonymous donations in support of the recall of Mayor Thao.Questions about Foundational Oakland Unite’s fundraising came amid aflood of campaign moneyinto pro-recall groups, much of it from big-money donors. Aspreviously reported in the Guardian, deep-pocketed tech figures have been involved in attempts to drag politics to the right inOaklandandSan Francisco.In April, 2024 the Thao recall campaign sent an email to prospective donors offering “options for donors to remain private if you prefer”. Oakland city law forbids anonymous donations to political candidates. The message included an email address for Andrew Hock at Foundational Oakland Unites, a political action committeefounded by Scott, as the main point of contact for donations.According to2024 reporting by the Oaklandside, Scott previously employed Hock as a paid campaign consultant during his 2022 mayoral campaign.Scottclaimsto be a part-owner of Hock’s campaign consultant group, Laschian Consulting. In an April 17 post to X, Scott claimed that Laschian Consulting “has planted its flag and is already in talks to help other major US cities fight back against the soggies and their anti-human agenda”, using a self-coined derogatory term to refer to social democrats.“If your city is spiraling due to failed progressive policies and a coordinated NGO + public sector union takeover, give us a call. Maybe we can help you save your city too.”In January, Thao, the recalled mayor,was herself federally indictedover allegations including that she solicited political donations in violation of campaign finance laws.The alleged straw donor campaign for Thao was uncovered by Oakland’s Public Ethics Commission in an investigation thatbegan half a decade ago. Though the PEC did not make a criminal referral, FBI white-collar crime investigators in Oakland picked up the thread andbuilt their own criminal case independently.The PEC’s budget wasslashedearlier this year amid a citywide fiscal crisis, severely impacting its ability to complete ongoing investigations.Hock did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsWyomingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re doing this or that wrong, we could do a better job’. These characters are everywhere,” Cremona adds.The termumarellwas created by the Italian writer Danilo Masotti in 2005 and originates fromumarèl,a dialect word from his native city of Bologna meaning “little guy”.As scenes of the busybody pensioners, who are especially passionate about roadworks, became more noticeable across Italy, the word took on a life of its own, evenfeaturing in a Burger King advertin 2016 in response to incessant questions from Milan’sumarellabout when construction of the company’s new premises would be complete.

Cremona, along with seven of his peers, including one woman, Gabriella Garatti, readily applied for the volunteer role, and got the job, which he says requires the ability to resolve issues and is not about offering unwanted advice.Cremona, 69, said he felt “a calling” to help maintain the resources-strapped town.Each recruit has their own patch of the town to keep watch over, working in shifts of two to three hours to identify problems that need fixing, whether it be a pothole or a faulty street lamp, and to inspect progress in roadworks or make sure the cutting of grass is up to scratch.They are, in essence, professionalumarell.

KCNA said the rehabilitation plan was pushing ahead.South Korea’s military said US and Seoul intelligence authorities assessed that North Korea’s “side-launch attempt” of the ship failed, and the vessel was left listing in the water.View image in fullscreenNorth Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called the launch accident a ‘criminal act caused by absolute carelessness’.Photograph: KCNA/ReutersKCNA, however, reported that an “underwater and internal inspection of the warship confirmed that, unlike the initial announcement, there were no holes made at the warship’s bottom”, calling the extent of the damage “not serious”.Satellite imagery shows the warship, covered in blue tarpaulins, lying on its side, with the stern swung out into the harbour, but the bow remaining on the side slipway, according to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.Based on its size and scale, the South Korean military said the newly built warship is believed to be similarly equipped to the 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea launched last month.Pyongyang has said the Choe Hyon is equipped with the “most powerful weapons”, and that it would “enter into operation early next year”.Seoul’s military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to help Moscow fight Ukraine.Analysts say the warship involved in Wednesday’s accident may have also been constructed with Russian assistance.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaAsia PacificKim Jong-unnewsShareReuse this content"

That includes any information about historical or current events that goes against the Chinese Communist party’s official narrative.The researchers began looking into the topic after internet users in Henan reported that websites accessible in other parts of China were inaccessible in their province. They found that millions of domains that were not blocked by China’s centralised firewall were at some point inaccessible in Henan.By buying servers from internet cloud providers, the authors tested the flow of internet traffic from locations within Henan. They tested the internet’s top 1m domains daily between November 2023 and March 2025, with a gap of several months in 2024. The results showed that the Henan firewall blocked nearly 4.2 million domains at some point during the research period, over five times more than the roughly 741,500 domains blocked by China’s national firewall.The domains that were specifically blocked in Henan were mainly from business-related websites. There have been several finance-related protestsin Henan in recent years, which the researchers speculated could be the reason for the additional controls on access to information about the economy being controlled.In 2022, thousands of people in Henantook part in several demonstrationsafter they were blocked from withdrawing cash from their bank accounts. The crisis escalated when protesters reported that their mobile health codes, part of the pandemic control measures in place at the time, had turned red, preventing them from travelling or entering buildings. Five officials were later punished for abusing the health code system to quell the protests.Other parts of China have also been subjected to enhanced internet controls. In July 2009, following deadly ethnic riots, the Chinese government imposed aninternet blackoutin Xinjiang, a region in western China home to the Uyghur minority, that lasted 10 months. Since then, the use of the internet in Xinjiang has been much more tightly monitored than in the rest of the country. Online activities in Tibet are also strictly controlled.The emergence of a regional censorship regime in Henan is unusual because it is not a region of China that is normally considered especially restive by the Chinese authorities.The researchers could not determine if the enhanced controls were imposed by the local authorities in Henan or the central government in Beijing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) recentlyunveiled new surveillance toolsthat can monitor people who use virtual private networks, software that allows people to circumvent the internet firewall. The MPS’s research institute also showcased a tool that it claimed could monitor accounts on Telegram, a messaging app. The tool has already collected more than 30bn messages, the institute claimed.Mingshi Wu, the lead author of the Henan study, who uses a pseudonym to protect their identity, said: “On the one hand, AI could be leveraged to create more sophisticated, adaptive, and efficient censorship and surveillance tools. On the other hand, AI also enables new opportunities for those seeking to understand and circumvent censorship. For example, AI can assist in developing more agile testing tools for detecting censorship.”The Henan Cyberspace Affairs Commission could not be reached for comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaCensorshipAsia PacificInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Back then the LNP had lost 11 of 12 state elections. One senior party figure said at the time: “One more loss and the party will surely have to break up. There would be no other option.”Of course, the LNP won the OctoberQueenslandelection convincingly. And political parties don’t tend to be as self-critical after a success.First Nations writer speaks out after being stripped of $15,000 State Library of Queensland award over Gaza tweetRead moreOn news of the federal Coalition’s marital difficulties, Lawrence Springborg, who has been a unifying figure as the new LNP president, gave a ringing endorsement of the merged entity that brings Liberals and Nationals under the one umbrella.“The Queensland LNP … has recently won the Brisbane city council election, state election and was the only state or territory to secure the majority of seats and the majority of votes in the recent federal election,” Springborg said.David Crisafulli’s government has been in power for seven months, after running a small target election campaign designed to neutralise almost every potentially divisive issue – especially those thatmight divide the LNP’s membership.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAlready there are signs that has created problems for how the LNP governs in Queensland. On one hand, the party came to power with a mandate to seemingly do so little, it has already recycled its first priority – the “adult time” youth crime laws that breach fundamental human rights – andcome back for a second roundthis week.It also appears to have shown an inability to put aside the sorts of culture wars issues that are increasingly damaging moderate Liberals contesting city seats.Analysis of the federal election has shown that conservative parties cannot expect to appeal to urban voters while also leaning into rightwing social issue talking points.And yet the government this week waded deep into the ideological mire when the premier, Crisafulli, and the arts minister, John-Paul Langbroek, reportedly wrote to the State Library voicing concerns about social media comments made by Indigenous author Karen Wyld.The library thenstripped Wyld of her $15,000 black&write! fellowship, less than five hours before it was to have been awarded to her, over comments about the conflict in Gaza.Wyld told Guardian Australia she learned about the decision to rescind her award when she was called by a News Corp journalist.This, it seems, is becoming government process in Queensland, particularly in relation to First Nations people. Crisafulli’s edict to shut down the state’s truth telling and healing inquiry was delivered at a press conference. The head of the inquiry, Joshua Creamer, and First Nations communities learned about it second hand.The government has gone to war with renewables developments:cracking down on windfarmsin a way that means some small coalmines have simpler approval processes.It hasbanned critical gender-affirming caretreatments, including puberty blockers, using a justification thatappears remarkably thin.This week Labor claimed the state government was also cutting “respectful relationship” health education for young people in primary schools after a leaked email from a public servant said the $3m program was for the scrap heap. The government has since denied this, claiming the email public servant had gone “rogue”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Each of those places, at recent elections, has tended more conservative. Revelations about the Flynn MP, Colin Boyce, calling blackoutsa “big political opportunity”might have hurt the Coalition’s city moderates, but clearly didn’t damage Boyce, who increased his margin.At the same time, Liberals must now be viewing one-time strongholds like Brisbane and Ryan as progressive Labor-Greens contests, and seats they cannot win back in the foreseeable future.It was only a few years ago the LNP was stuck in an identity crisis and members were beginning to talk in hushed tones about a demerger.What is clear about the LNP’s 2024 election win is that MPs and candidates put aside those ideological differences and found a new raison d’etre – beating Labor.But it is also increasingly clear that is not likely to hold in the long term. The structural problems appear to be still there. And the tendency towards culture wars and Campbell Newman-style hubris – characteristics that have turned voters off the conservatives in the past – is beginning to show through.Ben Smee is Guardian Australia’s Queensland correspondentExplore more on these topicsLiberal National partyQueensland politicsDavid CrisafulliAustralian politicsQueenslandanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s been a bit embarrassing, frankly.“The unrealised gains, that’s controversial and problematic. But if you didn’t do it that way, you probably wouldn’t raise very much tax.”Critical front-page newspaper articles have warned that taxing unrealised gains could mean cash-poor but asset-rich farmers would have to sell their farms to raise money to pay the extra tax.Cooper, however, said that operating businesses and owning farmland through super looked to be “entirely about tax minimisation”, rather than saving for retirement.The introduction of the transfer balance cap, which began at $1.6m in 2017-18, went some way to remove the excesses of the system by restricting the amount of money that could be taken into the retirement phase where earnings are tax-free.“That was a Coalition government that did that, and that didn’t get anywhere near the shrill complaints this is getting. And it was a much lower threshold than $3m,” Cooper said.Bob Breunig, the director of the ANU’sTaxand Transfer Policy Institute, said that residential property and super wealth were “undertaxed”, and agreed that the super concessions were “really heavily tilted towards the wealthy”.“Our tax and transfer system hasn’t adjusted for the fact that old people are wealthy and it needs to adapt to that,” Breunig said.He gave short shrift to complaints in the media about farmers being forced to sell farms to pay for the extra tax: “Running businesses and property portfolios inside super, they shouldn’t be doing that, that’s not what it’s for.”But Breunig, one of the country’s leading thinkers on tax policy, said he would prefer Labor’s bill not pass into law, in the hope of a better future reform to address the issues in the system.“As a purist, I don’t like taxing unrealised gains. If it somehow generated a lot of revenue or made things simpler, I would be in favour of it. But there’s not much revenue, and it makes things more complicated,” he said.Breunig said he favoured a simple limit on how much could be saved within the super system, for example $3m or $4m, and that savers with more than that should be forced to withdraw the excess amount, without penalty, into assets outside super.The former AMP chief executive Andrew Mohl has argued in favour of such a cap.Chris Richardson, an independent economist, has also said that “in a better world we’d have had a 15 percentage-point discount to marginal rates on tax on the way into super, as well as a higher rate of tax on earnings”.“Given we’re not in that world, I think having the $3m super tax is better than not having it, even allowing for the two problems [of] no indexation and taxing unrealised gains,” Richardson said.Explore more on these topicsSuperannuationTaxAustralian economynewsShareReuse this content"

The new rates would come into effect from 1 June.The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, posted on X after a call with the US trade representative Jamieson Greer and the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick: “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both.“The European Commission remains ready to work in good faith. EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump had posted on Truth Social, the social media website he owns: “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on trade, has been very difficult to deal with.”He went on to claim there was a $250m annual trade deficit with the EU. “Our discussions with [the EU] are going nowhere,” he said, before adding there would be no tariffs for products built or manufactured in the US.Trump later told reporters: “I’m not looking for a deal – we’ve set the deal,” before immediately adding that a big investment in the US by a European company might make him open to a delay.The EU is one of the US’s largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (€528bn; £443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.The US imposed a 20% “reciprocal” rate on most EU goods from 2 April, but halved them a week later to allow for trade talks. It has kept 25% import taxes on steel, aluminium and vehicle parts in place and has threatened similar moves on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other goods.In the same press conference, Trump said hemight add a 25% levy on all Apple and Samsungphonesbought by US customers. That would be in place at the end of June, he said.

The French trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, said Trump’s new threats did nothing to help negotiations.“We are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but we are ready to respond,” he wrote on X.The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told the Ansa news agency that the aim remained “zero-for-zero tariffs”.Speaking to reporters in The Hague, the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, backed the EU’s strategy in trade talks and said the EU was likely to see this latest announcement as part of the negotiations. “We have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US,” he said.Micheál Martin, the Irish taoiseach, said Trump’s suggestion was “extremely disappointing”. He continued: “I have always been clear in my view that tariffs are damaging to all sides.”In a statement posted on X, he said: “Tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up, they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships, as well as disrupting wider global trade.“We do not need to go down this road. Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward.”The head of the EU’s trade committee, the German MEP Bernd Lange, has threatened to apply counter-tariffs against the US. “We will not allow ourselves to be pressured and will objectively attempt to begin negotiations next week,” he said in comments reported by the GermanDie Weltnewspaper. “If the negotiations are unsuccessful, the European Union is strong enough to implement countermeasures, such as counter-tariffs, to offset the economic damage.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionDonald TrumpEuropeUS foreign policyStock marketsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The agreement was viewed as a first step towards a permanent ceasefire between the two countries.The prisoner swap, in which 1,000 prisoners will be released from each side, was meant to bring Russia andUkrainecloser to achieving a lasting ceasefire deal. Friday’s swap brought 390 Ukrainians back home, and on Saturday the Russian defence ministry said 307 prisoners from each country were exchanged.“We expect more to come tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said, with the Russian defence ministry also saying it expected the swaps to continue.The overnight attack prompted people to shelter in Kyiv’s subway stations. Missile debris and unintercepted bombs caused damage in six districts of the city, with plumes of smoke rising from where they landed. Two children were among those injured in the attacks.The Obolon district was hit particularly hard, with at least five people being wounded and a residential building heavily damaged, Ukrainian officials said.View image in fullscreenA Kyiv resident observes the damage to her flat in a five-storey residential block hit by a drone.Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPAThe air raid alert in Kyiv lasted more than seven hours. The strikes followed several days of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia, including Moscow, which prompted the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to vow retaliation.Olha Chyrukha, a 64-year-old from Kyiv, standing outside an apartment building damaged in the bombings, said: “I wish they’d agree to a ceasefire. To bomb people like this …”Other people said their homes had been made uninhabitable by the attacks.Prospects for progress towards a ceasefire seemed dim, with the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying on Friday that the place for the next round of talks had yet to be chosen.Lavrov said Moscow would hand Ukraine a draft text stating its conditions for a truce once the prisoner swap had been completed.

Donald Trump has made ending the conflict a key foreign policy aim of his administration.

Accounts vary of whether Trump told the European leaders that Putin did not want peace, or simply that Putin thought he was winning. Either way, no sanctions were imposed.Yet, only 24 hours before, Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president and sometime Trump golf partner, had spoken optimistically of Trump losing patience with Putin’s prevarications and of the possibility that the US Senate would start the process this week of imposing sanctions drawn up by the president’s close ally Lindsey Graham that would penalise countries that buy Russian oil. The seven hours Stubb had spent in March on Trump’s golf team nursing a tournament victory seemed to have been to no avail.Trump blamed big egos and said the conditions for a deal could only be agreed by the warring parties, “because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of”. He said he still thought “something might happen, and if it doesn’t happen I’ll simply step aside and they’ll have to move on”. He continued: “Once again, this was a European matter and it should have remained a European matter.” The vice-president, JD Vance, simply said: “This is not our war.”But days before, Kellogg had referred to a 20-point US peace plan starting with a ceasefire that had been shared with the Europeans, completely contradicting Trump’s claim that only the warring parties could have a view on Ukraine’s future.The episode raises what is now the holy grail of modern diplomacy: how best to influence the US president’s thinking, whether it is over Ukraine, Gaza, Iran or China.A former US diplomat close to the Ukraine talks urged Europeans to be patient with Trump. “He has gut instincts, those instincts are OK, they are not always wrong, he zigzags, and in the case of Ukraine he is most governed by the tactics he needs to get a ceasefire,” the former diplomat said.“He is quite aware and not naive in this. He knows the only reason there is not a ceasefire is because Vladimir Putin wants to wage war. So he knows his target is to pull Putin in tactically. He is dangling rewards – the G8, resource deals, lifting sanctions, summit meetings.“Putin does not want to do this. He has no interest in a ceasefire. He has an interest in eliminating Ukrainian national identity and taking it over. He is playing this out deliberately. He is playing games. He is moving the goalposts almost every day and trying to get everyone to follow him … Trump has continuously made excuses for him, but in the hope he can pull him in.”The former diplomat said Trump had four basic objectives in Ukraine. “Trump genuinely wants a ceasefire and the killing to stop. He wants reciprocity so he will be able to tell the US taxpayer ‘you are not throwing your money away on Ukraine’. He wants to deter Putin from doing it again, but he wants Europe to take the lead in preventing him attacking again. I find that acceptable.“The US and Ukraine are more in alignment on the ceasefire than they have been at any point since Trump took office. Trump has said on several occasions he will not throw Ukraine under the bus as an independent state.”That judgment was confirmed by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who told a Senate hearing this week: “Russia wants what they do not currently have and are not entitled to, and Ukraine wants what they cannot regain militarily. And that’s been the crux of the challenge.”As to the possibility of Trump fulfilling his threat first made in March to hit Russia with punishing sanctions, the Europeans have few options but to wait. They have invested heavily in Graham, a South Carolina Republican senator and someone to whom Stubb talks most days. Graham spoke this week to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.The former US diplomat said: “Congress cannot force Trump to do anything, but they can be in a position to say we can pass legislation on sanctions to strengthen Trump’s position. The Republicans on the Hill are not portraying this as an alternative to Trump but saying ‘this is how we support his strategy’.”As such, the 80 senators who support Graham’s bill imposing tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil must also wait for Trump’s green light. Of course, that light may never turn green. Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee: “If you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking.”Moreover, Russian accounts of the two-hour call between Putin and Trump dwell on its warm personal nature and Trump’s praise for Russian sacrifice in the second world war. In return, Putin offered to pen a memorandum on a possible peace accord. No deadlines were agreed.As a result, Europe’s nightmare – Trump walking away from Ukraine – draws nearer. But there are many ways to walk away. Would he turn off the intelligence, unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia and block even lend-lease agreements that would allow Ukraine to buy US weaponry? In the slow transition to Europe taking the lead in supporting Ukraine, Trump can cooperate or be disruptive. “It can be a managed process or chaotic and fractious,” said Jack Watling, of the defence thinktank Rusi.The new US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, told the Lennart Meri conference in Tallinn – an annual gathering of diplomats and security experts – that after the Nato summit in June the US would lay out plans for troop withdrawal from Europe. Although Whitaker told his audience the withdrawals would be done in an orderly way, not everyone was reassured. Bruno Tertrais, an associate expert at the Institut Montaigne, said: “The words ‘Trump’ and ‘orderly’ in the same sentence do not inspire confidence.”Some reduction in the 100,000 US troops in Europe is manageable for the continent, given the Biden administration surged roughly 20,000 troops after the Ukraine invasion, but the scale and method of the withdrawal matters.And it is hard for the Nato summit to agree a new set of capability targets if the scale of US withdrawals will not be known until the autumn. “Nato decisions on capabilities will be made without knowing the future US force posture in Europe,” said Torrey Taussig, of the Atlantic Council. “These decisions about capability targets for meeting Europe’s own defences and a ceasefire force in Ukraine are near-term decisions, yet we do not know what America’s contribution to Europe will look like.”The sense of frustration is deepened because the European Nato members feel they have agreed a fiscally demanding package on defence spending in time for the Nato summit that addresses all Trump’s complaints about freeloading. Nato states will adopt a new target over the next five to seven years of reaching 3.5% of GDP spent on hard defence and 1.5% on cybersecurity and defence-related infrastructure investment such as roads and bridges to improve troop mobility. (The aim is for the hard defence component to rise annually by 0.2%.)That might be enough to get Europe over the hump of the Nato summit without Trump exploding but it does not deal with the more fundamental problem of Trump’s benign view of Russia. Stubb argues Europe has to understand Trump’s take on great-power politics and find a way to disabuse him. “What we fail to see in Europe is that the US and its foreign policy doctrine is based on global competition, not Ukraine and Russia. We have to get out of the mindset that the US is only focused on Ukraine. It is not.”Stubb added: “Trump’s worldview is not far from what we saw in the 19th-century concert of powers – a big power era sometimes of competition and sometimes cooperation. We have to convince the US administration that free trade and common rules are better than transactional deals, and we show we are serious about defence in Europe and that we are security providers and not security consumers.”If Trump’s vision is broadly one of 19th-century great-power spheres of influence, Stubb argues, then it is necessary to convince Trump that Russia is not a great power and is not worth jettisoning Ukraine and its allies for. “We need to explain that Russia is not any more a big power, economically. It is smaller than Italy, slightly larger than Spain [in terms of its economy],” he said. “Militarily it wanted to deny the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three years ago. It has advanced less than one percentage point this year, and its interest rate is over 20% and its reserves are out. These are the kind of messages that you have to convey. It is not an easy game, but you just have to keep on engaging the American administration.”The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski offers a variation: that the great power of the future is Europe, not Russia. He argues Putin has “woken a giant” in the continent. “He has yet no idea how costly this is going to be. Since President Trump came to power we have already doubled our defence spending,” he said.Sikorski predicts that by the end of the decade, when Nato countries meet the new spending targets, Europe will dwarf Russia. “We are a $19tn economy. Russia will be a trillion-dollar economy. As Europe, without the US, we are spending two and half times more than Russia on a peace footing than Russia is spending on a war footing. All it takes is to spend the money better, on the basis of learning the lessons from Ukraine and then having the will to gel this into a fighting force. We should be grateful to the US for telling it like it is.”But that is five years hence, and the immediate issue is whether Europe and Ukraine, with the US on the sidelines, have the means to make Putin reassess the price of victory.Watling, the defence analyst, argued that Ukraine risks leaving gaps on an extended frontline this summer, but if it can survive then Russia will have exhausted its stocks and be reliant on new production, making its war machine more vulnerable to international supply chains. He said Ukraine’s problem was not manpower but training and ammunition.Either way, iron has entered the soul of European leaders. They fear Trump is unpersuadable and set on a different course, leaving Europe as the protector of Ukraine.Kaja Kallas, Europe’s foreign policy chief, said she had been through the five stages of grief over the transatlantic relationship and reached acceptance, but even so she cannot hide the loss.“The issue of trust is like a vase,” she said. “You broke the vase, you can glue it back together, but it is not the same vase.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The eldest of the children was 12.Nasser hospital reported that one of Najjar’s children and her husband were injured but survived.Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital, told the BBC he had operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy.Groom said he had been told the father, who is also a doctor, had “no political and no military connections and doesn’t seem to be prominent on social media”.Footage shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry – and verified by the BBC – shows bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of the building near a petrol station in Khan Younis.The news was confirmed by the hospital in Khan Younis where Najjar works, according to the BBC. Her husband had just returned home after accompanying her to work when the building was struck by Israeli airstrikes.“Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us,’’ Youssef al-Najjar, a relative, told Agence France-Presse. “We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!”View image in fullscreenAlaa al-Najjar visits her injured husband in the intensive care unit.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMohammed Saqer, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told the Guardian: “Dr Alaa al-Najjar watched with her own eyes as the charred bodies of her seven children were pulled from beneath the rubble – while two remain missing – all while she was on duty at Nasser medical complex.“Harrowing details recounted by Ali al-Najjar paint one of the most heartbreaking tragedies to befall a paediatrician who dedicated her life to saving children, only to have her own motherhood stolen in a moment of fire and deafening silence.”It was later reported that nine children had died.Groom, who is volunteering at Nasser hospital, attended to al-Najjar’s surviving child, Adam.“The last patient on my list today was an 11-year-old boy who seemed much younger as we lifted him on to the operating table,” Groom told the Guardian.“His injuries were bad enough but the background, I think, was worse. His father was very badly injured but nine of his brothers and sisters were killed.”“It is unimaginable,” said Groom. “The father [al-Najjar’s husband] is a physician here at Nasser hospital. We’ve asked about him and he has no political or military connections … it is a particularly sad day.”Dr Victoria Rose, who is volunteering alongside Groom, received a video of the aftermath of the attack.“The video shows all of the children being pulled out of the fire and they are absolutely charcoaled to a crisp. It is so horrific,” she said.On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the Guardian: “Yesterday, an IDF aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis.“The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety. The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”Thee IDF said it had targeted more than 100 sites across the Gaza Strip over the course of the day, as it intensifies its military offensive despite aid agencies warning that the Palestinian population is plunging deeper intomalnutrition and famine.At least 79 people have been killed in Israeli strikes acrossGazain a 24-hour period, leading up to Saturday evening, the territory’s health minister said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise due to ongoing attacks.On Friday, 30 people and members of the Dardouna family were killed in airstrikes, including very young children. One of the photos – shared by newly awarded Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Mosab Abu Toha – shows the body of a girl less than a year old being pulled from the rubble, still wearing her pyjamas.Hamas described the airstrike on the home of Najjar as “a horrific massacre”, adding: “This heinous crime clearly expresses the sadistic nature of the occupation, and the level of the deep-rooted spirit of revenge that drives Netanyahu and his gang of murderers and human monsters.”Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupiedPalestinian territories, said the attack represented a “distinguishable sadistic pattern of the new phase of the genocide”.Israel may start allowing aid groups operating in Gaza to take charge of non-food assistance as pressure mounts to get more aid into the battered territory, according to a letter obtained by the Associated Press.The letter says food distribution would be left up to a newly established group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by the US and Israel but is not yet up and running. Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid but the United Nations and aid groups deny there is significant diversion.Israel had blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for nearly three months, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians. Experts have warned of a high risk of famine, and international criticism and outrage over Israel’s offensive has escalated.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They told the AP that the practice has become ubiquitous over 19 months of war.The AP spoke with seven Palestinians who described being used as shields inGazaand theoccupied West Bankand with two members of Israel’s military who said they engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law.In response to these allegations, Israel’s military says it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields – a practice it has long accused Hamas of using in Gaza. Israeli officials blame the militants for the civilian death toll in its offensive that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.In a statement to the AP, the military said it also bans otherwise coercing civilians to participate in operations, and “all such orders are routinely emphasised to the forces.”The military said it is investigating several cases alleging that Palestinians were involved in missions, but would not provide the AP with details. The news agency said that the Israeli military did not answer questions about the reach of the practice or any orders from commanding officers.Rights groups say Israel has used Palestinians as shields in Gaza and the West Bank for decades. Thesupreme courtoutlawed the practice in 2005, but the groups continued to document violations, reports the AP.Experts say this war is the first time in decades the practice – and the debate around it – has been so widespread.More on this story in a moment, but first, here are some other key updates:The Israeli army reported that 83 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom Crossing on Friday, after security inspections. The aid included food, medical equipment and medicines.The UN has called for more aid in Gaza to meet the territory’s “massive needs”.In its latest humanitarian update, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said it “stressed once again that the small amounts of supplies being allowed into the Gaza Strip are nowhere near enough to roll back the extreme deprivation that Gaza’s population is facing”.UN secretary general António Guterres said on Friday that Palestinians were enduring “the cruellest phase” of the war in Gaza, where more than a dozen food trucks were looted after the partial easing of a lengthy Israeli blockade.Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least six people on Saturday across the Palestinian territory, where Israel has ramped up its military offensive in recent days. “Our teams have recovered at least six dead,” civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP).More than 40 leading Jewish organisations issued a joint set of urgent requests from the US governmentafter Wednesday’s deadly shooting outside Washington’s Capital Jewish Museum, Haaertz reported.Share"

In several cases, investigations by MPCID [Israeli military police criminal division] were opened following suspicions of involving Palestinians in military missions.”Earlier on Saturday, the Associated Press reported that several Palestinians and Israeli soldiers had said troops were systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields inGaza. They said the practice had “become ubiquitous during 19 months of war”, AP reported.Seven Palestinians described being used as shields in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and two members of Israel‘s military said they had engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law.Rights groups expressed alarm, saying it had become standard procedure and used increasingly in the war.“These are not isolated accounts; they point to a systemic failure and a horrifying moral collapse,” said Nadav Weiman, the executive director of Breaking the Silence, a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers who have collected testimonies about the practice from within the military. “Israel rightly condemns Hamas for using civilians as human shields, but our own soldiers describe doing the very same,” Weiman told AP.One alleged victim, Abu Hamadan, said he was detained in August after being separated from his family, and soldiers told him he had help with a “special mission”. For 17 days he was forced to help search houses and inspect every hole in the ground for tunnels, he said.Soldiers stood behind him and, once it was clear, entered the buildings to damage or destroy them, he said.The two Israeli soldiers who spoke to the AP – and a third who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence – said commanders were aware of the use of human shields and tolerated it, with some giving orders to do so. Some said it was referred to as the “mosquito protocol” and that Palestinians were also referred to as “wasps” and other dehumanising terms.The soldiers, who said they were no longer serving in Gaza, claimed the practice sped up operations, saved ammunition and spared combat dogs from injury or death.In October,the Guardian collected testimoniesfrom former Palestinian detainees which were largely consistent with the reporting by AP. The IDF said the investigations were ongoing but provided no more details.The forcible use of Palestinian detainees to enter houses and tunnels in Gaza first became public in footage broadcast byAl Jazeera televisionin June and July 2024. An investigation bythe Israeli newspaper Haaretzin August gathered testimony from Israeli soldiers who said the Palestinians used as shields were known as “shawish”, a word of Turkish origin meaning “sergeant”. The soldiers suggested it was an institutionalised tactic approved by senior officers.In 2002, Israel’s high court issued an injunction prohibiting the IDF from using what was known as the “neighbour procedure”, detaining a Palestinian in an area of unrest and ordering the detainee to knock on the doors of their neighbours and oversee the clearance of their houses.The use of human shields continued, however. In 2010, two IDF staff sergeants were demoted for forcing a nine-year-old Palestinian boy to open a number of bags suspected of containing explosives.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Lord Hain argued that formal recognition should be “a catalyst, not a consequence” of peace talks.At the first preparatory meeting in New York before a UN conference on a two state solution due to be held between 17 and 20 June, Saudi Arabia urged countries to recognise Palestine as a state, saying that “recognition should be seen as a precondition for peace, and not its product”.The conference is seen as a potential moment when states such as France and the UK that have yet to recognise Palestine take what would be a momentous diplomatic step.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, indicated last month that Paris may recognise Palestine, joining 147 other countries, but said he wanted to do so at a UN conference in New York in June as part of a wider process.The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy,has confirmed to parliamenthe has been in discussions with the French about recognition, but also said he would not simply support a gesture with no practical impact.The Guardianreported last weekthat the British view is that France was very likely to decide the time was not right to make the announcement. The UK’s official position is that it will recognise a Palestinian state, but only at the point of maximum impact.The pressure has been building within Labour’s parliamentary ranks as 69 MPs and six peers earlier this month signed a joint letter urging the prime minister to seize what they described as a “unique window of opportunity” to recognise Palestinian statehood.The Guardian understands that the letter – which was coordinated by the chairs of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East, Sarah Owen and Andrew Pakes – was also signed by several serving ministers.In a concept note for June’s UN conference, France and Saudi Arabia, the two co-chairs of the conference say the ambitious aim of the international conference in June “would not be to ‘revive’ or to ‘relaunch’ another endless process, but to implement, once and for all, the two-state solution”.The call to implement the two-state solution has become even more urgent in the context of illegal settlements and other illegal unilateral measures, violence, hate speech and the ongoing plans and actions undertaken for the forcible displacement and dispossession of Palestinians.It’s time Labour recognised a Palestinian state – it’s been stalling for 50 years | LetterRead moreWith eight working parties covering all the issues surrounding a two-state solution, each nation has been asked “to highlight the actions they are willing to undertake, individually or collectively, in fulfilment of their obligations and in support of the international consensus on the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the two-state solution”.Alex Ballinger, a Labour backbencher and member of the foreign affairs select committee, said it was time for the UK to “show principled leadership,” adding: “We can no longer speak in platitudes about two states while blocking the very steps that could help make one of them real.”Afzal Khan, a former shadow minister and longtime campaigner on Palestinian rights, said Labour must act on its internationalist values. “Recognition would now be a positive first step towards securing a peaceful two-state solution, end unlawful settlement expansions and blockades, and unlock the diplomatic and humanitarian pathways to lasting justice,” he said, warning that the UK risks “dragging its feet” while 147 other countries have already recognised a Palestinian state.Explore more on these topicsUK newsLabourPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Millions of dollars worth of drugs have been seized in both states, and also on the Gujarat coast on the Arabian Sea.Pakistani officials privy to the information said India did not reveal the real identity of the individual and described the statement as “vague”. A Pakistani official questioned how the man managed to get so far from the border in Banaskantha district, and said they were “investigating the killing and identity of the person”.The recent conflict began after India blamed Pakistan for amilitant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in April that killed 26 people. Islamabad denied New Delhi’s claims it backed the militant group.India launched missile strikes, claiming to have targeted terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan, which responded by firing missiles at Indian military targets. Soon after the the ceasefire, New Delhi said any future terrorist attacks on its territory would be considered an act of war.Pakistan has denied any involvement in the militant attack inKashmir. It has become more vocal in blaming India for a rising wave of militant attacks that have struck Pakistan, particularly in the regions of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of using proxy militant groups to carry out terrorist attacks in order to destabilise the country, which India has denied.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanKashmirSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The convictions were overturned by parliament last year.Many are still awaiting damages despite the previous government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts.Bates has also accused the Department for Business and Trade, which administers the compensation schemes, of reneging on assurances given when they were set up and told the Sunday Times a promise they would be “non-legalistic” had turned out to be “worthless”.He said he was given a final “take it or leave it” offer, which amounted to 49.2% of his original claim after appealing and being referred to the scheme’s independent reviewer, Sir Ross Cranston.The campaigner is now calling for the creation of an independent body that would administer compensation schemes for public sector scandals but cautioned: “I can already hear the sharpening of goose quills across Whitehall as the civil service prepares to snow politicians under with reasons it would not work.”He added: “The sub-postmaster compensation schemes have been turned into quasi-kangaroo courts in which the Department for Business and Trade sits in judgment of the claims and alters the goalposts as and when it chooses.“Claims are, and have been, knocked back on the basis that legally you would not be able to make them, or that the parameters of the scheme do not extend to certain items.”The group litigation order (GLO) scheme was set up to achieve redress for the 555 claimants who took thePost Officeto the high court between 2017 and 2019.Under the GLO, claimants can take a fixed sum of £75,000 or seek their own settlement.If there are disputes in individual cases, they are referred to an independent panel for review.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anyone unhappy with their offer can have their case reviewed by a panel of experts, which is independent of the government.”Earlier this week, it emerged that hundreds of former post office operators will be compensated by the Post Office afterit accidentally leaked their names and addressesin June 2024.The Post Office said individual payouts will be capped at £5,000, although higher claims may still be pursued.Explore more on these topicsPost Office Horizon scandalPost OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Those who repeatedly fail to build or sit on land could be fined with a “delayed homes penalty” or blocked from future planning permission by councils.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, said the government had taken “radical steps to overhaul the planning system to get Britain building again after years of inaction.“In the name of delivering security for working people, we are backing the builders not the blockers. Now it’s time for developers to roll up their sleeves and play their part.“We’re going even further to get the homes we need. No more sites with planning permission gathering dust for decades while a generation struggle to get on the housing ladder.”The plans, which form part of a government working paper onspeeding up housebuilding, would apply to developments of 50 or more homes.The prospective fines would be based on lost council tax revenue and could be imposed by councils on developers who fall at least 10% behind schedule without good reason. As a result, a developer who is failing to build 50 homes that would each raise £1,500 in annual council tax could face a £75,000 fine. This change would require new legislation and would only apply to future planning permissions.Ministers will also test a new requirement for developments with more than 2,000 homes to include a mix of affordable and commercially sold housing by default, on the basis that this could lead to faster construction.The government hasintroduced legislation to speed up planning decisionsand boost housebuilding by removing avenues for legal challenges and reforming the compulsory purchase order process.View image in fullscreenThe OBR recently estimated that housebuilding in the UK would rise to its highest level in 40 years.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PALabour committed in its manifesto to deliver 1.5m homes during this parliament, which ministers have admitted is a challenging target. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated this spring that housebuilding would rise to its highest level in 40 years and contribute to the UK’s economic growth.The government has committed£2bn for 18,000 new social and affordable homes, £1.29bn for the warm homes social housing fund, £800m in top-ups to the current affordable homes programme, and £2bn for regeneration projects that the government says will add to the total number of available homes. A further £600m will deliver training for new construction jobs.The Telegraph reported on Friday that Rayner is pushing for further investment in social housing as part ofnext month’s spending review, which will set departmental budgets for several years.Rayner has spoken about her belief in the need for more social housing. She told a conference in November that she wanted to remove the “shackles of stigma” that is too often associated with social housing.“This is personal for me,” Rayner said. “Because I know that a secure, affordable home is not a luxury or simply nice to have. It’s the foundation on which everything else is built. When I was growing up, we didn’t have a lot, but we had a safe and secure council home. And later, when I needed a home to raise my son, I was given my own council home. I haven’t got to where I am today in spite of coming from a council house, but because of it.”Explore more on these topicsPlanning policyHousingAngela RaynerHousing marketCommunitiesLabourReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

Facial ID quietly becoming part of police’s arsenalDaniel BoffeyandMark WildingSat 24 May 2025 12.41 EDTFirst published on Sat 24 May 2025 12.00 EDTSharePolice believe live facial recognition cameras may become “commonplace” inEnglandand Wales, according to internal documents, with the number of faces scanned having doubled to nearly 5m in the last year.A joint investigation by the Guardian andLiberty Investigateshighlights the speed at which the technology is becoming a staple of British policing.Major funding is being allocated and hardware bought, while the British state is also looking to enable police forces to more easily access the full spread of its image stores, including passport and immigration databases, for retrospective facial recognition searches.Live facial recognition involves the matching of faces caught on surveillance camera footage against a police watchlist in real time, in what campaigners liken to the continual finger printing of members of the public as they go about their daily lives.Retrospective facial recognition software is used by the police to match images on databases with those caught on CCTV and other systems.According to one funding document drawn up by SouthWalespolice as part of a proposal to put the West End of London or Cardiff rail station under live facial recognition cameras and released by the Metropolitan police under the Freedom of Information Act, it is believed “the use of this technology could become commonplace in our city centres and transport hubs around England and Wales”.The first fixed live facial recognition cameras will be fitted for a trial in Croydon, south London, later this summer.The expansion comes despite facial recognition failing to be referenced in any act of parliament.Campaigners claim the police have been allowed to “self regulate” their use of the technology. Officers have in the past used a setting that was subsequently shown to disproportionately misidentify black people.After a court of appeal judgment in 2020, which found that South Wales police’suse of live facial recognition camerashad been unlawful, the College of Policing provided guidance that “the threshold needs to be set with care to maximise the probability of returning true alerts while keeping the false alert rate to an acceptable level”.There remains nothing in law to direct forces on the threshold or technology used.The policing minister, Diane Johnson, told parliament earlier this month that she recognised “a need to consider whether a bespoke legislative framework governing the use of live facial recognition technology for law enforcement purposes is needed” but the Home Office is yet to provide details.Facial recognition cameras were firsttrialled in Londonand south Wales from 2016 but the speed at which police forces are rolling out the technology has accelerated over the last 12 months.The investigation by the Guardian and Liberty found:Police forces scanned nearly 4.7m faces with live facial recognition cameras last year – more than twice as many as in 2023. Live facial recognition vans were deployed at least 256 times in 2024, according to official deployment records, up from 63 the year before.A roving unit of 10 live facial recognition vans that can be sent anywhere in the country will be made available within days – increasing national capacity. Eight police forces have deployed the technology. The Met has four vans.Police forces have considered fixed infrastructure creating a “zone of safety” by covering the West End of London with a network of live facial recognition cameras. Met officials said this remained a possibility.Forces almost doubled the number of retrospective facial recognition searches made last year using the police national database (PND) from 138,720 in 2023 to 252,798. The PND contains custody mug shots, millions of which have beenfound to be stored unlawfullyof people who have never been charged with or convicted of an offence.More than 1,000 facial recognition searches using the UK passport database were carried out in the last two years, and officers are increasingly searching for matches on the Home Office immigration database, with requests up last year, to 110. Officials have concluded that using the passport database for facial recognition is “not high risk” and “is not controversial”, according to internal documents.The Home Office is now working with the police to establish a new national facial recognition system, known as strategic facial matcher. The platform will be capable of searching a range of databases including custody images and immigration records.Lindsey Chiswick, the director of intelligence at the Met and the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council lead on facial recognition, said surveys showed that four in five Londoners were in support of the police using innovative technology, including facial recognition cameras.This week, a registered sex offender, David Cheneler, 73, from Lewisham, wasjailed for two yearsafter he was caught alone with a six-year-old girl by a live facial recognition camera. He had previously served nine years for 21 offences against children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So policing needs to start operating a little bit differently. People talk about harnessing AI like it’s some crazy horse we want to saddle but we do need to harness the opportunities that technology and data can bring us.”Chiswick said the Met’s policy was to take “really quite small steps and review them at every stage” but that there would be a “benefit in potentially some sort of framework or statutory guidance”.The Met is deploying its facial recognition cameras at a setting that testing suggests avoids any statistical significance in terms of gender or ethnicity bias when it comes to cases of misidentification.Chiswick said: “I don’t want to use a biased algorithm in London. There’s no point on all counts. I think for government, there’s a question, isn’t there around artificial intelligence? And I think clearly the public sector is going to use, and want to use AI more and more.“I think the questions around who then decides where algorithms are purchased from, what training data is used, what countries might this technology come from and then, when you use it, are you obliged to test it and if you’re obliged to test it, are you then obliged to operate at a certain setting?

He predicted that, through a policy of “peace through strength”, the US’s adversaries would back down. “I just want to look at them and have them fold,” he said.The president also said US soldiers had been sent “on nation-building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us, led by leaders that didn’t have a clue about distant lands while abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments here and at home”.“All of that’s ended, strongly ended. They’re not even allowed to think about it anymore,” Trump added.Making apparent reference to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that defense secretaryPete Hegsethhas cancelled, Trump weaved together criticism of his predecessors with a new focus on curbing illegal immigration.“They subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes, while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries’ wars. We fought for other countries’ borders but we didn’t fight for our own borders, but now we do like we have never fought before,” he said.He later said that “the job of the US armed forces is not to host drag shows or transform foreign cultures”, a reference to drag shows on military bases that his predecessor Joe Bidenhaltedin 2023 after Republican criticism.Wearing a red “Make America great again” campaign hat throughout, the president told the 1,002 graduating cadets that the US is the “hottest country in the world”, and boasted of his administration’s achievements.The president also returned, once again, to a cautionary tale he often tells young people about the danger of losing momentum in life, illustrated by an anecdote about what he called the unhappy retirement of the post-war housing developer William Levitt, the creator of Levittowns, planned communities on Long Island, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.Repeating a story he toldat a Boy Scout jamboree in 2017, andat the University of Alabama three weeks ago, the president said that Levitt was unsatisfied by life without work, even though he married “a trophy wife” and bought a yacht. “It didn’t work out too well, and that doesn’t work out too well, I must tell you, a lot of trophy wives, it doesn’t work out,” the presidenttoldthe young women and men. “But it made him happy for a little while at least.”Trump also used the occasion to repeat an unfounded accusation he first made in 2020: the claim that Russia had stolen US hypersonic missile technology during Barack Obama’s presidency. “The Russians stole it, something bad happened. But we’re now building them, lots of them,” Trump said, praising eight cadets who had built their own. “We are building them right now. We had ours stolen. We are the designers of it.

The date is also the president’s birthday.Alongside the military parade featuring more than 6,700 soldiers, it will include concerts, fireworks, NFL players, fitness competitions and displays all over the National Mall for daylong festivities. The army expects that as many as 200,000 people could attend and that putting on the celebration will cost an estimated $25m to $45m.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS militaryTrump administrationUS politicsUS educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Garcia Venegas – who was born in Florida to Mexican parents – began filming the arrests with his mobile phone before officials reportedly knocked the device out of his hand and tried to arrest him as well.Video of the arrest shows three officials wrestling him to the ground, while he yells: “I’m a citizen!”Trump administration trying to dismiss MS-13 leader’s charges to deport himRead moreAccording to an interview with the Spanish-language US news outletTelemundo, officials took out his wallet, removed his ID – which complies with higher federal security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses as well as identification – and told him that it was fake.“They cuffed me,” he said. “They put the cuffs on quite hard.”Four people at the job site were arrested, including Garcia Venegas’s brother, who is undocumented.Officials removed the cuffs from Garcia Venegas hours later – after he gave them his social security number, verifying his US citizenship.“I feel really sad, honestly, and I feel a bit nervous for everything that’s happening,” said Garcia Venegas, referring to the Trump administration’s ongoingimmigration-related crackdown.His cousin, also a US citizen, told Telemundo they both went through the process of acquiring the Real ID, undergoing “the protocols the administration is asking for”.“I feel sad because, even though we were born here, that doesn’t matter any more,” the cousin said. She added: “To have our skin color has, apparently, become a crime. And it has become a crime deserving of this type of treatment – as if we were real criminals.”In a statement to NBC News, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused Garcia Venegas of having “interfered” with the arrest during the operation.“Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including US citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest,” the DHS’s statement to NBC said.It is unclear whether the officials who cuffed Garcia Venegas were local officials, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents or other members of federal law enforcement.Since Trump came into office, various federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and others, have been tasked with carrying out immigration enforcement operations. Some local police and sheriff’s departments have also been deputized to carry out federal immigration arrests.As the White House attempts to carry out a promise of “mass deportations” that vaulted Donald Trump to victory in November’s presidential election, a number of US citizens have been caught up in its dragnet.Some, such as Garcia Venegas, have been detained by officials, then released. But others,including children, have been deported.Although rare, the deportation of US citizens has also happened during prior administrations.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationAlabamaTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Network state proponents envision a network of extra-national communities that exist beyond the control of nation-states.The Guardian contacted the Wagon Box founder and owner Paul McNiel for comment. He did not respond directly but insteadposted a screenshotof the request to X appended with commentary.There, McNiel said he was driven by “good-faith curiosity” that events there had been “largely focused on a suspicion of ‘the machine’” and boasted of the “breadth of the politics represented”, citing appearances by the likes of Patrick Deneen and Seneca Scott.Deneen is a Notre Dame professor and conservative political theorist whose 2023 book Regime Change “offered a previewof the Trump administration’s intention to breathe fire on America’s cultural institutions” whose fans include JD Vance, the vice-president.Scott, who McNiel described as a “90s Democrat who wants a safe community for his family and goats”, is a former union organizer based in Oakland, California, whose activism, political campaigning and social media outputhave targetedtransgender people, homeless encampments, local media organizations, progressive politicians and city employees.‘Liberalism is crumbling’Sheridan county property records indicate that Paul McNiel bought the property that includes the Wagon Box – formerly a holiday destination and RV park – in August 2022.Property records, satellite imagery, and media posted on social media platforms and on the Wagon Box website indicate a semi-rural location on the western fringes of Story.Since McNiel took control of the property, it has played host to a string of events, many of them featuring figures associated with overlapping rightwing movements.The project has drawn concerns in local media, but garnered a laudatorywrite-upin the Bari Weiss-founded Free Press. Free Press investors include rightwing tech figures likeMarc Andreessen and Trump administration “crytpo czar” David Sacks.McNiel – billed as a millionaire in an appearance on a real estate investment podcast in 2021 – is the principal of a legion of LLCs, according to company records in Alaska,Wyoming, Montana and North Carolina.View image in fullscreenAnother view of the Wagon Box Inn.Photograph: Google MapsProperty records and data brokers indicate that McNiel or LLCs controlled by him have bought and sold dozens of properties – many of them trailer parks or similar sites for low-cost housing – in at least three states.According tofounding documentson its website, Wagon Box is run as adecentralized autonomous organization(DAO), a term for organizations managed in part via decentralized technologies like blockchains and smart contracts.A 2021 Wyominglawallows DAOs to incorporate in the state, despite their often anonymous ownership structure. The sparsely populated state is notorious for a“cowboy cocktail”of loose financial regulations and opaque company ownership.“We’re not northern Idaho or even Montana. We’ve so far managed to not attract the crazy far right to our state,” said Elizabeth Storer, a Democratic state representative from Jackson who has spoken critically of Wyoming’s libertarian financial laws and opacity.“We’ve allowed just about anyone to come into Wyoming because of our low tax environment, our limited liability corporation laws and the use of registered agents all over the state – it allows people to offshore funds in Wyoming with a great deal of secrecy,” she added.Thecurrent versionof a document explaining the DAO aligns the project with the network state movement, claiming that “the grand project of liberalism is crumbling, and that in its wake people are looking for new avenues of allegiance and interdependence”.The document continues “Balaji Srinivasan, among others, has identified this shift and suggested a process for uniting modern technologies with ancient human trends of association to createnetwork states”, providing a link to Srinivasan’s self-published 2022 book of the same name.Reverse diasporasSrinavisan is an entrepreneur and investor formerly associated with companies including Andreessen-Horowitz and Coinbase. (That company’s current CEO, Brian Armstrong, is anotheroutspoken booster of network states).For more than a decade, Srinivasan has advocated a radical anarcho-capitalist vision in which like-minded people can “exit” and place themselves beyond the legal and economic reach of nation-states in parallel, networked special economic zones.His ideas are often couched in vituperative attacks on his perceived enemies, including academics, government employees and the media.As early as 2013, Srinavisan wasadvocatinga “reverse diaspora” in which people enabled by technology could assemble in “cloud cities … outside the United States”. These “could be floating cities in international waters as put forth by Peter Thiel, or one of the more ambitious 80,000 person colonies on Mars desired by Elon Musk”.Soon after, in response toreportinglinking Silicon Valley figures to the anti-democratic neo-reactionary movement and its leading light, Curtis Yarvin, Srinavasanreportedlyemailed Yarvin with the suggestion that “it may be interesting to sic the Dark Enlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them and turn them inside out”.He later cited Yarvin in The Network State, writing: “As Yarvin in particular has documented at length, the most important left-authoritarians are not formally part of the elected state at all. They are the professors, activists, bureaucrats, and journalists.”He describes people in these fields as constituting “the control circuitry for the US government”.Last September, he opened a residential network school for would-be builders of network nations,reportedlylocated in Malaysia’s Forest City, whose “requirements include an admiration of ‘western values’, seeing Bitcoin as the successor to the US Federal Reserve, and trusting AI over human courts and judges”.View image in fullscreenBalaji Srinivasan in this 2022 picture.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe network state vision has already inspired an attempt to build a city,California Forever, in rural Solano county, with investors including Andreessen and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Network state advocates also reportedly want to construct a similar “charter city” inGreenlandif it is annexed by the United States.Donald Trump has floated the idea ofcreating 10 such “freedom cities” on federal land, including San Francisco’s Presidio.The movement alsooverlapswith efforts to mount a rightwing takeover of city governments in San Francisco and Oakland, with the likes of the Y Combinator CEO, Garry Tan,backingbothprojects.Srinivasan has offeredlurid fantasiesof what a tech-controlled San Francisco might look like. In an October 2023 podcast interview, he envisioned a city controlled by tech-aligned “grays” enjoying privileged access to large parts of the city, bribing a pliant police department, and with “blues” – San Francisco’s liberals – subject to exclusion and hostile propaganda.Devin Burghart, the executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Righs and a longtime observer of far-right organizing in the mountain west, told the Guardian in an interview that the Wagon Box was significant for being one of the first real-world attempts at constructing a “network state” hub beyond California.“They’ve tipped their hand a bit with the constant references to [accelerationist theorist] Nick Land and Italian futurism. This is a different veneer of the apocalyptic, post-democratic world view that is also quite common with militia and prepper types.”The Wagon Boxreportedlyattracted immediate scepticism from residents of tiny unincorporated Story in the months following its establishment.Attenders at a 2023 public meeting reportedly expressed concerns both about the draft DAO document’s vision of “‘capital seed for a nascent network state’ and … a place for either gatherings or apocalyptic retreat”, and McNiel’s association with the notorious anti-government activist Ryan Payne.In 2018, Payne was sentenced to federal prison on conspiracy charges after playing the role of, according to a federal judge, “an architect” of the 2016 Malheur national wildlife refuge occupation, in whichhe participatedalongside the likes of the currentfugitiveAmmon Bundy.‘A criminal regime’Wagon Box has hosted a series of events since McNiel’s acquisition, many with guests and themes associated with the far right.The 27 April event,Dawn in the West: A Futurist Serata(DitW) was subtitled “An UncleTed Talk”, a reference both to Ted talks and a nickname for the so-called Unabomber,Theodore Kaczynski.Advertising materials highlighted themes including the work of Land, who, alongside Yarvin, is one of the progenitors of the neo-reactionary movement, whose anti-democratic ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the Trump administration’s gutting of the federal government.Another advertised speaker at that event was Jonathan Keeperman. The GuardianidentifiedKeeperman in 2024 as the man behind the L0m3z X account and rightwing publisher Passage Press.Keeperman-founded Passage Press is also listed as a participant in Wagon Box’s 31 May roundtableCoalition for Cultural Renewal(CCR).The schedule for a Wagon Boxeventlast August promised a conversation between Keeperman and the journalist James Pogue on “the failure of liberalism and globalization”.Pogue has written extensively about the new right for media outlets including the New York Times and Vanity Fair.In a post at the Wagon Box’s Substack newsletter, Pogue and McNiel are pictured together in a photograph purportedly taken inside the Passage-Press-sponsoredCoronation Ballin Washington this January, and described in a caption as “Wagon Box brothers”.Keeperman is one of the overlaps between Wagon Box and a broader far-right milieu.Keeperman, for example, spoke last month at a pro-natalist conference in Austin, Texas, whose speaker roster included self-described eugenicists and promoters of race science.At the event, in response to a small protest on site, Keeperman took to X,posting: “NATALISM IS NAZISM Say it loud say it proud.”Balaji Srinivasan spoke at the same conference in 2023.The Natalism conference founder, Kevin Dolan, is listed in Texas company records as the principal of a natalism.org non-profit; a newly incorporated Eternal Capital Texas Inc; and Exit, a men-only organization which he characterized in a Substack newsletter as a rightwing business network which is “not just about making life in the regime more tolerable … setting ourselves up to succeed as it declines”.He founded that organization following Guardianreportingin 2021 that identified him as the man behind an influential “DezNat” account, “@extradeadjcb”.Exit is billed as a participant in Wagon Box’s CCR event, which will include other far-right publishers , along with Murphy’s Other Life and hard-right online magazine IM-1776.The Guardian previouslyreportedon IM-1776’s support of authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele; its enthusiasm for extremist political figures such as Gabriele D’Annunzio and Kaczynski; and its close links with contemporary hard-right activists like the culture warrior Christopher Rufo,Erik Princeandwould-be “warlord”Charles Haywood.IM-1776’s literary editor, Daniel Miller, is a speaker at DitW, and in YouTube videos posted to Wagon Box’s channel he is characterized as a writer-in-residence.In a January article for IM-1776, Miller called for Donald Trump tooverthrowthe government of the UK led by Keir Starmer and “liberate” the country, saying it was run by “a criminal regime” dominated by “a mafia-like organization of pathological personalities”, a necessity “as clear as the imperative of the Vietnamese to invade Cambodia and remove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979”.Miller did not respond to a request for comment.The Oakland connectionEvents this spring also bill speakers associated with a tech-backed hard-right political movement in California’s Bay Area.Scott – who has run both for city council and mayor in Oakland – is set to appear at the Doomer Optimism Campout in June.Scott’s political activities in Oakland – including the candidacies and his advocacy for the recall of former mayor Sheng Thao last year – have been punctuated by scandals.During his 2022 campaign media reports revealed a 2021 arrest oncharges of brandishing a firearm, in an incident that took place not far from the community garden he founded in West Oakland. Those charges were laterdismissed.Last December, the city of Oakland applied for a restraining order against Scott over his alleged harassment of a city worker during the recall campaign. Among other things, Scottreportedlyclaimed that the employee was a pedophile on social media and posted their address publicly. In aFebruary settlement, Scott agreed to stop posting personal information about the employee online.View image in fullscreenSeneca Scott, left, at a rally in Oakland last year.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst/Getty ImagesScott has received backing from rightwing tech figures includingTan, who, like Scott, has agitated against progressive approaches to homelessness and law and order, and employed bareknuckle social-media posting to promote his views.“If you want Oakland to be great then you will follow and support Seneca,” Tan wrote on X last year.In Oakland, Scott has drawn scrutiny for anti-transgender commentary and attacks on progressive voices in politics and media.Scott appeared at anotherWagon Box eventin summer 2024 in conversation about “Cities: urban agriculture, crime, and criminal justice reform”.Pogue also appeared alongside Scott at his community garden in a 2023 event hosted by a Scott-run non-profit, Neighbors Together Oakland, that was last yearshuttered by California’s attorney generallast year forconducting fundraisingwithout a non-profit license.In an interview withFree Pressin 2023, Scott had said he planned to use that non-profit as a platform to support “100 nontraditional candidates” for city councils, school boards, and potentially higher offices across the US.Another Doomer Optimism Campout speaker is Andrew Hock, a Tennessee political consultant who was reportedly involved with an alleged attempt to facilitate anonymous donations in support of the recall of Mayor Thao.Questions about Foundational Oakland Unite’s fundraising came amid aflood of campaign moneyinto pro-recall groups, much of it from big-money donors. Aspreviously reported in the Guardian, deep-pocketed tech figures have been involved in attempts to drag politics to the right inOaklandandSan Francisco.In April, 2024 the Thao recall campaign sent an email to prospective donors offering “options for donors to remain private if you prefer”. Oakland city law forbids anonymous donations to political candidates. The message included an email address for Andrew Hock at Foundational Oakland Unites, a political action committeefounded by Scott, as the main point of contact for donations.According to2024 reporting by the Oaklandside, Scott previously employed Hock as a paid campaign consultant during his 2022 mayoral campaign.Scottclaimsto be a part-owner of Hock’s campaign consultant group, Laschian Consulting. In an April 17 post to X, Scott claimed that Laschian Consulting “has planted its flag and is already in talks to help other major US cities fight back against the soggies and their anti-human agenda”, using a self-coined derogatory term to refer to social democrats.“If your city is spiraling due to failed progressive policies and a coordinated NGO + public sector union takeover, give us a call. Maybe we can help you save your city too.”In January, Thao, the recalled mayor,was herself federally indictedover allegations including that she solicited political donations in violation of campaign finance laws.The alleged straw donor campaign for Thao was uncovered by Oakland’s Public Ethics Commission in an investigation thatbegan half a decade ago. Though the PEC did not make a criminal referral, FBI white-collar crime investigators in Oakland picked up the thread andbuilt their own criminal case independently.The PEC’s budget wasslashedearlier this year amid a citywide fiscal crisis, severely impacting its ability to complete ongoing investigations.Hock did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsWyomingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One way to do that is to expedite negotiations.”Aymond declined to answer additional questions or to comment on camera outside the courthouse.He didn’t say anything in court on Friday either – but sat and listened quietly from the gallery as attorneys representing about 200 of the 600 abuse claimants blasted the settlement plan proposed days earlier, including one who called the deal “dead on arrival”. Since the basic outline of the proposed settlement was announced on Wednesday, proponents and opponents have been jockeying for position and laying the groundwork for a vote by all claimants to confirm or reject it, which is expected this fall.Two-thirds of everyone making a claim in the church’s bankruptcy must agree to the settlement terms for it to be finalized.The full details of the deal proposed on Wednesday haven’t been presented yet. But it would provide $130m in cash and up to $110m more from insurance carriers and potential church property sales. That’s about $100m short of a similar church bankruptcy case in Long Island, New York, cited by both sides as a good precedent for theNew Orleanscase, which was recently settled and finalized for $323m.The Long Island settlement, between the archdiocese of Rockville Centre and about 600 abuse survivors, netted the claimants there an average of about $540,000. Under the terms disclosed this week, survivors in New Orleans would get between $300,000 and $383,000 per claim, on average. The amount paid to each claimant depends on a formula based on the severity and evidence of abuse, among other factors.Even after five years, both the church and negotiating survivors say they still need more time to hammer out details before bringing the proposed agreement to an official vote of all 600 survivors and other creditors.The attorneys who spoke against the proposal in court on Friday – Soren Gisleson and Taylor Townsend – said they and associated attorneys represent more than 180 survivors, and they believe there are others who are as dedicated to voting to stop the deal. They hope to return their clients’ cases to individual lawsuits for damages against the church in state court, which were stopped five years ago when the church sought bankruptcy protection.“This deal is never going to get passed,” Gisleson said in front of Judge Meredith Grabill. “They don’t have the votes. And they’re never going to get the votes.”Jim Stang, the lead attorney for the survivors’ committee that negotiated the proposed deal, bristled at those assertions, saying he’s handled many other complex bankruptcies, including the Rockville Centre archdiocese on Long Island – and the proposal this week was something the two sides could build on.“This is far from over. This is a starting point,” Stang said.In an interview with WWL, Adams said: “The starting point, if my math is correct, was five years ago.”Rick Kuebel, another attorney for the survivors’ negotiating committee, estimated it could be late August before a final plan could be presented for a vote.It would then take two months to properly notify survivors and hold a vote, attorneys said Friday. Judge Grabill suggested an accelerated timeframe might be possible, and Kuebel said that could bring a final settlement to a vote by September at the earliest.Douglas Draper, attorney for the church’s parishes, schools and other affiliates, suggested checks could go out to survivors in the first quarter of 2026 if a plan were approved.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseBankruptcy and IVAsCatholicismNew OrleansLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

Wells and Maresso warned against letting up on momentum against the deadly disease outbreak.“We’re still seeing measles cases in El Paso. We’re seeing measles cases in some of the other states in the central United States. It really just takes one person in a car who’s infectious to introduce it into another community,” Wells said.Texasannouncedsix new cases on Friday for a total of 728 this year. A total of 94 people have been hospitalized in the Texas outbreak and two school-agedchildrendied.The west Texas outbreak has also spread to a handful of other states. Officials in New Mexicoannouncedon Thursday the tallyhad risento 76 cases, and they confirmed that thedeathof an adult in March was indeed caused by measles.There have been58 casesin Kansas and17 casesin Oklahoma, in addition to other states seeing separate outbreaks.The US now has a total of 1,024 confirmed measles cases, which makes 2025 thesecond-worst yearalready for measles since the virus was declared eliminated from the US in 2000.The outbreak may be losing steam in west Texas because ofsuccessfulvaccination campaigns and because many people who were not vaccinated have now been infected.Although children have suffered the bulk of cases, abouttwo-thirdsof the cases in El Paso are among adults. Officials recommend that anyone in the outbreak areas unsure of their vaccination status should get a measles booster shot.YetRobert F Kennedy Jr, the head of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has repeatedly spreadmisinformationabout the measles vaccine.“You have consistentlybeenunderminingthe measles vaccine,” Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, told Kennedy at a 14 May hearing on the HHS budget.Key takeaways: RFK Jr’s ‘Maha’ report on chronic disease in childrenRead more“You told the public that the vaccine wanes very quickly. You went on the Dr Phil show and said that the measles vaccine was never fully tested for safety. You said there’s fetal debris in the measles vaccine,” Murphy said.“All true. All true,” Kennedy said.“None of that is true,” Murphy responded.“Of course it’s true,” Kennedy said.Statements like these undermine the public’s confidence in vaccines at a critical time, experts said.Communities that have fallen below the 95% threshold for community immunity (also known as herd immunity) should run vaccination campaigns now, before new outbreaks begin, both Wells and Maresso said.“The easiest thing you can do, in this case, is just put out an educational campaign around closing the vaccine gap,” said Maresso. “If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks. It’s that effective.”Wells added that “what we’ve learned here is that there’s a lot of communities across the US that have these lower vaccination rates.”Summer tends to be a high season for travel, and travelers may import measles from a state or country experiencing an outbreak into at-risk communities like these, Wells said.If we had vaccine coverage above 95%, we would not see these outbreaks. It’s that effectiveAnthony Maresso, Baylor College of Medicine“We see lots of movement in the summer,” Wells continued. “So you see lots of people traveling internationally to places that might have endemic measles, that can reintroduce it into any vulnerable community across the United States.”Monitoring wastewater can serve as anearly warning signof a budding outbreak, especially in places with low vaccination rates.The Texas wastewater monitoring was funded by the state legislature through the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute (TEPHI), created during the Covid pandemic “as kind of a Texas version of the CDC”, Maresso said.“We saw a signal for measles in the wastewater before any of this outbreak discussion in Texas or really before it started to become a headline worldwide,” Maresso said.“If we are seeing the earliest stages of an outbreak, it gives us a lead time to warn public health folks: ‘There are cases. You’re probably not seeing them on the clinical radar, but there are cases in your community, and you should expect that you’re going to start to see cases – and if they’re not vaccinated, it’s going to get worse.’”Local leaders should prepare for measles outbreaks now, Wells said.Measles outbreak: how contagious is it and what are the symptoms?Read more“Some of it’s education to your physicians, your schools, your daycares, about measles, what the rash looks like, just so that people are paying attention to that,” she said.Public health officials should also understand their testing capabilities and the logistics of, for instance, transporting specimens to laboratories.That way, “you’re prepared and it’s at the front of your mind – not sitting back in some dusty textbook,” Wells said.But all of that work requires funding. While public health departments have frequently worked on shoestring budgets, the Trump administration has made funding even more precarious.“There was a clawback of the Covid funding that was available to local health departments,” Wells said. And with other federal funds for public health, “it’s even harder to follow exactly what’s going on,” Wells noted.“I’m concerned. It’s so important for us to have local public health departments that can respond to things like measles or whatever the next outbreak is.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsMMRUS healthcareHealthTexasVaccines and immunisationKansasnewsShareReuse this content"

The bond market disagrees.In his latest showdown with Wall Street, after the turmoil unleashed by his “liberation day” tariff announcement last month, global financial markets are rattled again, this time by the US president’sOne Big Beautiful Bill Act. Plans to hit the EU with 50% tariffs on all imports are adding to the investor headache.Reflecting growing unease, the yield – in effect the interest rate – on 30-year US government bonds has risen above 5%, and is threatening to reach the highest level in 18 years. Meanwhile Moody’s, a leading credit ratings’ agency, relied on by big investors, last weekstripped the US of its top-notch triple-A score.Graph showing sharp rise in 30-year US Treasury bond yieldsCentral to the concern is the US’s so-called “twin deficit” position – running a simultaneous budget deficit (when public spending exceeds revenues) and trade deficit (when imports outstrip exports) – and the worry that Trump’s policies will stoke inflation and sink the US economy into recession.Mark Dowding, the chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, a hedge fund, said the president seemed content to “keep calm and carry on” despite growing investor unease – which could test markets further.“Laffer curve economics inspired thinking in the US is being met with increased scepticism by bond market investors, who are concerned at an alarming rise in the debt trajectory,” he said. “Essentially, Washington has thrown down the gauntlet to the bond market.”Under theOne Big Beautiful Bill Act, trillions of dollars in tax cuts which Trump first introduced in 2017 – but had been due to expire at the end of 2025 – will be extended, offset by controversial cuts to some areas of spending, including Medicaid, the healthcare scheme for those on low incomes.The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the measures will increase the US’s annual deficits to $2.9tn (£2.1tn) (6.9% of US GDP) by 2034, or to $3.3tn (7.8% of GDP) if some time-limited policies are made permanent.Running these large annual deficits will add to America’s outstanding debt pile held by the public, which stood at $28.2tn in 2024 (97.8% of GDP) and was already on track to reach almost $50tn by 2034 (117% of GDP).However, Trump’s measures could add a further $3.3tn on top by 2034, taking the debt-to-GDP ratio to 125%, or $5.2tn if made permanent (129%).Graph showing how US national debt is projected to reach 125% of GDP by 2034Economists argue over the dangers of high debt levels. Several countries have debt ratios above 100%, including Japan, at more than 260%, and there is no precise, agreed-upon danger zone. Unlike households, governments have the power to print currencies, change tax and spending plans, and set laws. Comparisons to a family credit card being maxed-out are meaningless. Borrowing can help governments, if the proceeds lay the groundwork for stronger economic growth in future.However, persistent deficits and ever-rising debt levels can erode investors’ confidence in a country’s ability to make good on its IOUs. This can further push up borrowing costs, as investors demand higher premiums. Higher interest rates drive up debt-servicing bills, while high volumes of debt can “crowd out” more productive private investment in favour of parking cash in government bonds.For decades, the US has enjoyed cheaper borrowing costs relative to many other countries, particularly given the scale of its annual deficits and vast outstanding debt pile, in what has become known asWashington’s “exorbitant privilege”.However, investors are warning patience is running out, as Trump’s increasingly erratic policymaking trashes the postwar consensus that buying US assets is the safest possible place to put your money.Trump could argue his tariff policies will bring in revenues to offset the cost of tax cuts, and that his vast giveaways could stimulate spending in the economy by putting more money in the pockets of businesses and consumers.However, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation thinktank believes US tariffs in effect today, if left in place permanently, could raise $2.1tn between 2025 and 2034, but would reduce long-run GDP over the same period by 0.6% before retaliatory measures are taken into account.“Concerns about US borrowing aren’t going away. And for all the angst about the tax and spending bill, the irony is that it will make little tangible difference to economic growth rates over the next couple of years,” analysts at ING Bank wrote in a note to clients.On the flip side, the thinktank also says Trump’s tax cuts could increase long-run GDP by 0.6%, but would cost $4.1tn in forgone revenue over the same period.While there are gyrations in the bond market, there are also consequences for the world at large. This is because the US bond market acts as a critical reference point for other securities around the globe, meaning rising US borrowing costs will drag other government interest rates higher.In the UK, 30-year bond yields have hit their highest since the late 1990s this year, adding to complications for the British chancellor, Rachel Reeves, by pushing up debt servicing costs.Borrowing costs are rising in Japan, amid inflation concerns and as the country’s central bank unwinds years of loose monetary policy. As the largest foreign holder of US Treasuries, investors may start pulling money from the US market in favour of rising yields on domestic bonds.After rapid growth in government debt levels worldwide – driven higher after the economic shocks of the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic, and now Trump’s trade wars – the challenges are only mounting.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The new rates would come into effect from 1 June.The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, posted on X after a call with the US trade representative Jamieson Greer and the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick: “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both.“The European Commission remains ready to work in good faith. EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump had posted on Truth Social, the social media website he owns: “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on trade, has been very difficult to deal with.”He went on to claim there was a $250m annual trade deficit with the EU. “Our discussions with [the EU] are going nowhere,” he said, before adding there would be no tariffs for products built or manufactured in the US.Trump later told reporters: “I’m not looking for a deal – we’ve set the deal,” before immediately adding that a big investment in the US by a European company might make him open to a delay.The EU is one of the US’s largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (€528bn; £443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.The US imposed a 20% “reciprocal” rate on most EU goods from 2 April, but halved them a week later to allow for trade talks. It has kept 25% import taxes on steel, aluminium and vehicle parts in place and has threatened similar moves on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other goods.In the same press conference, Trump said hemight add a 25% levy on all Apple and Samsungphonesbought by US customers. That would be in place at the end of June, he said.

The French trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, said Trump’s new threats did nothing to help negotiations.“We are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but we are ready to respond,” he wrote on X.The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told the Ansa news agency that the aim remained “zero-for-zero tariffs”.Speaking to reporters in The Hague, the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, backed the EU’s strategy in trade talks and said the EU was likely to see this latest announcement as part of the negotiations. “We have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US,” he said.Micheál Martin, the Irish taoiseach, said Trump’s suggestion was “extremely disappointing”. He continued: “I have always been clear in my view that tariffs are damaging to all sides.”In a statement posted on X, he said: “Tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up, they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships, as well as disrupting wider global trade.“We do not need to go down this road. Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward.”The head of the EU’s trade committee, the German MEP Bernd Lange, has threatened to apply counter-tariffs against the US. “We will not allow ourselves to be pressured and will objectively attempt to begin negotiations next week,” he said in comments reported by the GermanDie Weltnewspaper. “If the negotiations are unsuccessful, the European Union is strong enough to implement countermeasures, such as counter-tariffs, to offset the economic damage.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionDonald TrumpEuropeUS foreign policyStock marketsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The bill also increased the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 per child.The bill was a major boon for wealthy Americans, who saw big savings after the tax cuts. The bill established a 20% deduction for income through certain business entities, known as pass-through entities, including LLCs and partnerships. It also doubled the estate and gift tax exemption from $5.5m to $11.2m per person, largely an aid to wealthy families.Because the bill cut taxes for even the wealthiest Americans in the highest part of the top income bracket, this has meant that Americans in the top 0.1% percentile of earners are saving much more than lower- or even middle-class Americans.A graph showing average tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act across different income bracketsControversial cuts to the corporate tax rate, which dropped from 35% to 21% after the tax cuts were passed, will also be made permanent in the new bill.A cut to the corporate tax rate has cost the federal government billions of dollars in lost revenue. From 2018 to 2021, the top corporations in the USsaveda combined $240bn in taxes after the cuts, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.Trumpdefendedthe corporate tax cut in 2017, saying that it will be “fantastic for the middle-income people and for jobs”, implying that corporations will use their tax savings to invest in more workers and higher wages.But some economists say the tax cuts did little to help the middle class. Wage growthslowedin 2019, two years after the cuts were passed, and only modestly grew because of inflation and high demand for workers immediately after the pandemic.Meanwhile, companies spent more of their savings on stock buybacks – when a company buys shares of its own stock, a move that primarily benefits shareholders – than ever before.Last year, Goldman Sachsestimatedthat stock buybacks will reach $1tn this year for the first time ever as share repurchases grow. Ananalysisfrom the progressive thinktank Groundwork Collaborative found that 11 top consumer goods corporations, including Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and General Mills, spent a collective $463bn in stock buybacks since 2017.As for the overall economy, economists say much of the growth in government revenue can beattributedto inflation and recovery from the pandemic recession that’s been seen in the US stock market – not the 2017 tax cuts.“In general, the economy has not shown dramatic changes as a result of the tax cuts that were passed in 2017,” said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. “Most of the good quality evidence we have suggests that any effects on the economy were relatively modest.”Estimatessay the tax cuts will cost the federal government $4.6tn in lost revenue over the next 10 years.To offset the expense of tax cuts,Republicansare pairing the tax reductions with cuts to key government assistance programs, which Republicans say will save the federal government $1tn. Stricter work requirements for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) program will see fewer people accessing government healthcare coverage and food assistance.The bill is also set to end clean energy tax credits that were passed under the Biden administration that encourage companies to utilize carbon-free energy sources and bolster clean energy technology production.Trump has also said his tariffs will bring in “trillions of trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt”. Estimates say if all of Trump’s announced tariffs are set in place, including retaliatory tariffs that have beenpaused, they would only bring in an estimated $3.1tn over the next 10 years. The 10% universal tariffs would generate $2.17tn in revenue.Graph comparing cost of tax cuts with amount of revenue that tariffs are expected to bring inBut tariffs are also a form of tax on the vast majority of American businesses that import goods from abroad. Over the last few months, companies including Walmart and the toymaker Mattel have said that they will ultimately have topass onsome of the cost of tariffs to consumers.Analysis from the Yale Budget Labestimatesthat higher prices will cause an average American consumer to spend $2,800 more because of tariffs. Those at the bottom of the income distribution could lose $1,300.Democrats have universally criticized the bill, with the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, denouncing it as a “cruel and dangerous scheme” that will particularly harm working-class families who will also be affected by Trump’s tariffs.“It’s really striking that this bill is both as fiscally irresponsible as it is and regressive,” said Daniel Hornung, Biden’s former deputy director of the National Economic Council and a senior fellow at MIT. “People making less than $50,000 a year will actually see their incomes go down, and it’s really to finance tax cuts for largely high-income people.”Explore more on these topicsUS taxationTrump administrationUS economyMedicaidUS healthcareTrump tariffsTariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

You’d have two sides going for the title – perhaps three or even four, all playing teams of similar standard and motivation. You’d have maybe six teams contesting the three relegation slots, possibly playing each other, and also a skirmish for European qualification.Ideally all 10 games would mean something and there should be times over the course of the afternoon when each side have the set of results they need to achieve their aims. And there should definitely be a moment when it becomes apparent that a harassed television presenter has forgotten or overlooked a goal so viewers can mutter furiously at the screen: “For heavens’ sake, that putsBrentfordin ninth.”In reality 10 live games is probably too much to ask – and the disorientating experience ofthe final night of the Champions League group stagesuggests it may be too much to comprehend anyway – but six of Sunday afternoon’s games potentially have something riding on them and one is a bona fide head-to-head, winner-takes-it-all clash.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest fans have had plenty to celebrate this season, proof positive that it is possible for a side promoted via the playoffs not only to survive but to prosper.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoThere has been a lot of talk about this being a poor or an anticlimactic season. While the latter term may be fair with regard to the title race and the relegation battle, the former certainly is not. The title race was in effect over from 18 January, the Saturday when Liverpool wonwith two late goals at Brentfordand Arsenal threw away a two-goal leadat home to Aston Villa. The relegation battle was done once Wolves hadbrought in Vítor PereirawhileLeicester went for Ruud van NistelrooyandSouthampton for Ivan Juric. The most crucial issues were decided early.‘Football is not complicated’: Andoni Iraola on Bournemouth, birdsong and playing betterRead moreBut as to the allegation this was somehow a season lacking in quality, it is always worth remembering that multiple themes can be true simultaneously. Arsenal and especially Manchester City have had disappointing seasons by their standards and that meant Liverpool were not challenged as they might have been. Arsenal, having drawn too many games, will finish second for the third season running but having offered less of a challenge than in the previous two years, while City could yet miss out on the Champions League if they lose at Fulham and Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa all win. Equally, none of the three promoted sides ever looked remotely good enough to survive.It is worth, though, asking why they struggled so much and why City and Arsenal were punished for wobbles. The major reason is probably the general strength of the middle ranks of the Premier League – which is why Liverpool’s consistency deserves more praise than many seemed prepared to give them. Every team from Newcastle in fourth down to Crystal Palace in 12th have had games they will remember fondly and would be more than worthy English representatives in European competition next season.Bournemouth, for instance, played some exceptional football at times, beating Arsenal (twice), Manchester City and Newcastle. They have a centre-backthey have already sold to Real Madrid for £50mand a full-back they look like selling to Liverpool for £40m, yet they go into the final day of the season with no chance of European qualification. There have been times recently whenAndoni Iraola, one of those coaches named by Pep Guardiola as shaping the football of the future, has been frustrated by his side’s occasional inability to manage games as he would like, but this has been the greatest season in Bournemouth’s history.View image in fullscreenWhat Brentford have achieved with the second-lowest wage bill in the Premier League is remarkable.Photograph: Katie Chan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockOf the 30 richest by revenue in the world, 14 are Premier League clubs. On the one hand, that suggests the strength of the league and the power of its marketing. But that brings its own problems and highlights perhaps the biggest issue football has, which is that almost no one in authority thinks holistically.Money for one or two clubs as, say, the Club World Cup will provide, can unbalance a domestic league. One country prospers and others are left behind. The Champions League now – as a competition to be won rather than a generator of cash – essentially exists for four countries plus Paris Saint-Germain, while others scrabble for crumbs that will make them wealthy enough to ensure domination of their domestic leagues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What Brentford have achieved with the second-lowest wage bill in the Premier League is remarkable, but they are almost uniquely well run. To have even a chance of survival, promoted sides need either a world-leading algorithmic approach to transfers, as Brentford andBournemouthdo, or a manager of rare gifts, such as Marcelo Bielsa (and, perhaps, although he seems rarely thought of in this light, Thomas Frank).And then there are Nottingham Forest, who have shown that it is possible for a side promoted via the playoffs not only to survive but to prosper, even if it has taken 57 signings with a net spend of £125m over the past three years – and afour-point deductionfor breaches of profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) – to do so. Against that, the transfer activity of the side they face on Sunday in what is in effect a straight shootout for Champions League qualification looks almost restrained. Chelsea in the same period have made 42 signings at a net cost of £660m: 99 signings battling it out for Champions League cash feels a perfect symbol of the modern world.This is where the positive impact of PSR can be seen. Manchester United cannot spend their way out of trouble. If Chelsea lose, they will find ambitions restricted. Forest, meanwhile, could suddenly be elevated, probably not to be regular Champions League qualifiers, but at least to be fairly secure in mid-table, adding further heft to the Premier League’s middle class.Which is good for the Premier League, and maintains its traditional strength – recently challenged – as a competition of consistent quality that can be won by more than just a couple of super-clubs. But at the same time, there are consequences for the rest of the pyramid and for the rest of Europe and the world.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueInside footballBournemouthBrentfordNottingham ForestcommentShareReuse this content"

Complete and utter euphoria. Stina Blackstenius’s second-half goal stunned the three-time European champions Barcelona to deliver Arsenal’s second European title. On the final whistle it was red and white pandemonium as stunned Gunners seemed to not know what to do with themselves – hugs, tears, disbelief.They started so brightly, playing with the freedom and joy that they had not afforded themselves until they had reached this final. There is nothing to lose once you pass that semi-final hurdle and everything to play for in a one-off game and a free-scoring Barcelona, who scored 128 goals in 30 league games this season, looked slightly shocked by the resistance they faced.‘Super proud’: Slegers hails Arsenal after Women’s Champions League successRead moreAt the Estádio José Alvalade, expectations of a result were low, a glimmer of hope delivered by the gutsy second-leg comebacksagainst Real MadridandLyon, in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively, and the sublime way they have played at times this season.The sense of fun was born from the wider mood around the fixture and that spirit was evident on the pitch too. There was a fearlessness about Arsenal: instead of resorting to a double pivot against the holders, Renée Slegers, who was given the job full-time in January after taking interim charge following Jonas Eidevall’s exit in October, stuck with a formula that had worked for them in the second leg of their semi-final against Lyon andagainst Manchester Unitedon the final day of the Women’s Super League season. Arsenal were not in Lisbon to sit back, they were there to take the game to the Catalan giants and their pressing play and organisation in the opening half were superb.Their battling approach and the freedom with which they played clearly frustrated the champions and Slegers’ side had the better chances of the half: Caitlin Foord’s header wide of the far post, Chloe Kelly’s volley over the bar, a disallowed own goal with Kelly offside in the buildup and Cata Coll’s save from Frida Maanum, all close but not close enough.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly holds off Caroline Graham Hansen and Ona BatllePhotograph: Jose Breton/APReaching the break with the game goalless was an achievement against a Barcelona side playing their 100th Champions League game, their first coincidentally against Arsenal in the 2012-13 last 32.The serious attitude Arsenal as a whole have taken towards the women’s team was evident in the stands – the co-chairman Josh Kroenke had come from Denver to join assorted members of the hierarchy and David Dein, the former vice-chairman and former president of the women’s team. That stood in sharp contrast to the indifference shown to Manchester United Women by their minority owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, whose absence at the past two FA Cup finals was widely derided.TheBlaugrana, seeking a hat-trick of wins, stepped up a gear in the second half but Arsenal’s defence, which shipped 12 goals in their final three games of the WSL season, stood firm.They needed one chance, one escape into the Barça half, and it came in the 74th minute. A rare Arsenal corner was cleared but worked back in to the former Barcelona player Mariona Caldentey, who paused before finding Beth Mead hovering on the edge of the box. The England forward played in her fellow substitute Blackstenius and the Swede fired low past Coll.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’m just grateful to clinch the 100th here.”Djokovic becomes the third man in the open era to reach the landmark achieved by Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103). He isthe first to win titles in 20 seasons.It marks Djokovic’s first title since his triumphat the Paris Olympicslast year.

Afterhis defeat to Matteo Arnaldi in Spain, his third in a row, the 38-year-old pulled out of the Italian Open andended his partnership with Andy Murray.Although he found some form and rhythm in Geneva, Djokovic was second-best for much of the final, narrowly losing the first set before trailing by a break from early the deciding set against Hurkacz. At 4-2 to Hurkacz in set three, the big-serving Pole had not lost a point on serve in the set. As the pressure mounted, and Hurkacz’s forehand crumbled, Djokovic turned the match around before closing out an emphatic final-set tiebreak.Instead of celebrating another stellar achievement, Djokovic will have to immediately shift his focus to the French Open, which begins on Sunday. He will face Mackenzie McDonald of the United States in the first round, a match that is unlikely to take place until Tuesday. He must recover well physically after a hard week.Meanwhile, Emma Raducanu says she is working hard to regain full fitness in time for her first-round match in Paris after struggling with back spasms at theStrasbourg Open against Danielle Collins. “It’s not feeling 100%,” she said. “I had a spasm in Strasbourg and just been trying to manage it as best I can doing treatment. I’ve been on the practice court last night and this morning. It felt OK, but it’s different playing a match.

So his pole position for Sunday’s Monaco Grand Prix is a moment to savour, a performance he has been attempting to nail since claiming the No 1 spot at the season-opener in Australia.On a curcuit that rewards confidence and commitment like no other, Norris had both in spades for a mighty lap in the final seconds of qualifying, threading the needle on the streets of Monte Carlo to beat the Ferrari ofCharles Leclercinto second place by 0.109 seconds and his teammate Oscar Piastri into third. Lewis Hamilton suffered a crash in FP3 and Ferrari were able to repair the damage from which he recovered to a strong fourth place. However after the session was concluded the British driver was given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Verstappen in Q1.Adrian Newey out to build car that will tempt Max Verstappen to Aston MartinRead moreThe pole is Norris’s first in Monaco and McLaren’s first here since Fernando Alonso took top spot in 2007. It was the perfect comeback after he felt frustrated with his early season form in qualifying. The British driver has struggled to adapt to this year’sMcLaren, particularly over the single lap and has fallen behind Piastri in the title fight.“I’ve been working to improve, to do a better job,” he said. “Today was probably the first time since Australia that I’ve really put it all together. It’s not like I’m driving quicker. I’m driving in a better way, in a smarter way but there’s been a lot of work that’s gone on.“Even if it was pole in any other track, it probably would have been the pole that’s meant the most to me. It probably means even more that it’s in Monaco but more because of what’s happened over the last couple of months. It may not seem like a lot, but for me it’s quite a big thing.”Norris has been insistent he remains confident and the team have been tuning the car to accommodate him better and now might hope he has shrugged off his qualifying hoodoo. Starting at the front of the grid is a chance for him to stage a comeback in a closely fought title race. Piastri leads the British driver by 13 points with Verstappen 22 points back in third.However, the serious business of the weekend remains ahead and therein lies the rub for Norris, asFormula Oneis hoping that his fine lap will not presage another routine procession to victory. Certainly this year Monaco is something of a wild card. With the introduction of the mandatory use of three sets of tyres during the race, all drivers will have to take at least two pit stops in both wet or dry conditions.The rule was introduced in an effort to improve the “sporting spectacle” with overtaking on the narrow track rendered all but impossible by the wide and heavy cars. It was instigated after an early red flag last season allowed a free tyre change, the drivers managing their rubber in a procession to the flag.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton recovered from an early crash to come fourth but then got a three-place penalty.Photograph: Andrej Isaković/APAs is so often the case at Monaco, however, qualifying was an absorbing session that swung between the leading protagonists. In Q3, Norris and Piastri had claimed the top spots and Leclerc could not match them. For the final laps the McLarens once more went out early and Norris was again immense, taking the provisional pole by one hundredth of a second. The pair then stayed out for a cool down lap before going again.Leclerc, however, was far from out of it, and seemed to have done enough only for Norris to snatch pole at the last gasp by a tenth of a second, in 1min 9.959sec.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A red number 7 blinks across the pitch from the fourth official’s board. Seven minutes of injury time: it’s a lot. Against Barcelona, it’s an age. Against this Barcelona, in this heat, in this game, it may as well be all of eternity.But you push through. You pace yourself. Beth Mead goes down under a challenge; there’s 30 seconds right there. Kim Little rolls the ball up the left touchline to no one: eight seconds. Daphne van Domselaar hesitates over a free-kick, squeezing out those seconds like drops from a towel. You push through because whatever happens in these seven minutes, however those minutes make you suffer, seven minutes is still less than 18 years.Arsenal 1-0 Barcelona: Women’s Champions League final player ratingsRead moreThere is a whistle, and then there is a scream, and then there is pure confusion. Arsenalhave planned this gameto the very last detail, rehearsed every last contingency, mapped out every possible scenario. But not this one. Some run; some stagger. But in these earliest moments of triumph, wherever they are on the pitch, somehow it feels telling that the first instinct of these Arsenal players is to find each other.Meanwhile Barcelona collapse, not just in distress but in a kind of violent shock: a shock that seems to consume them physically, to shake every fibre of their being. As if they cannot truly believe anyone woulddareto do this to them. Next to the centre circle a podium is hastily being erected, a confetti cannon winched into place, and they still can’t believe it’s not for them.People often say, with a vaguely fatalistic subtext, that you have to play the perfect game against Barcelona. Which is all very well, but then what happens when you make a mistake? Arsenal did not play the perfect game, even if several individuals got pretty close. But they won anyway, because they understood that finals are not simply a form of expression but a form of combat, not simply a vehicle for skills and stratagems but a vehicle for courage.And we should be clear at this point what kind of courage we mean. This is not simply the courage of crunching tackles and lunging blocks, of putting your head where it hurts. It is the courage of playing the forward pass when the backward pass is on, of keeping the ball on the ground when every impulse tells you to get rid, of taking your time on the ball, because there is always a little more time than you think.It is the courage of starting well, having a goal disallowed, missing chances, but not succumbing to fatalism. Of Leah Williamson stepping in to win the ball, even though she risks getting turned. Of flooding the area with bodies even though you know how well Barcelona can transition. Of showing the greatest team in the history of women’s club football all the respect they deserve, but not an ounce more.View image in fullscreenLeah Williamson gets clear of Barcelona’s Aitana Bonmatí during an imperious display by the Arsenal captain.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersArsenal’s goal, a masterclass of grace under pressure, was perhaps the best example of this. Mariona Caldentey receives the ball on the right wing, and immediately the options flutter in front of her. The first-time cross is on. The sliding pass to Katie McCabe in the channel is on. Instead she waits, waits for the picture to unblur in front of her. And eventually Mead presents herself, and the pass is perfect, and the shot from Stina Blackstenius is perfect, and in the most perfect twist of all, she’s actually onside this time.For Arsenal, this changes everything. There will be a parade on Monday, and a mural on the side of the Emirates, there will be award ceremonies and tie-in merchandise, there will be functions and reunions. Over time Lisbon 2025 will take its place in the club’s mythology, as surely as Meadow Park 2007, White Hart Lane 2004, Anfield 1989.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For those fans today who were not fans 18 years ago, Arsenal have slowly become the sort of club that dares but does not do, that fails elegantly and succeeds rarely, that wants to win but ultimately does not need to: a trendy leisurewear brand with a football team attached. These are traits that hard-wire themselves over time, and yet can be magically undone in the course of one sweltering afternoon.Arsenal are European champions. Those four small words now define how this club sees itself, how these players step on to the pitch, how opponents treat them, how prospective signings view the project. For Little, for Williamson, for Blackstenius, for Renée Slegers and for Clare Wheatley, the director of women’s football, and the Arsenal board, it is a form of vindication that will sustain them in their toughest moments. Each of them will walk a little taller on Sunday morning.Most days, nothing changes. The games and the sessions and the seasons all blur into one eventually. But then there are the days that will be remembered in perfect clarity, forever: days when a plan comes together, days when the wheel of history is stopped in its tracks. Together, Little and Williamson clasp the trophy, raise it aloft. The music plays. The confetti flies. When it lands, nothing will be the same again.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

They earned the right thanks to a season of hard toil and nerveless endeavour. They sealed the deal by staring down more experienced opponents in this playoff final, expressing an appetite for victory that would not be quenched. Two goals of top-flight quality got them over the line, and delirious communion with their supporters at the final whistle sealed a small moment in history.They don’t talk much about the romance of the playoffs, they’re just too brutal for that. A year’s work can be overturned in an instant. A collective loss of form, an individual lack of concentration, and years of planning and ambition can be set on fire. The playoffs break hearts more than they make dreams come true and, often, celebrations at Wembley are followed by tears just a year later.Sunderland snatch promotion to Premier League by beating Sheffield United in playoff finalRead moreSunderland may well return to the second tier next summer, but in the way they embraced their task at Wembley on Saturday was a reminder that the things wise men say are always there to be challenged.Régis Le Bris’s team had upended all expectations this season by holding on to the coattails of the Championship’s parachute clubs with a squad of unheralded and youthful talent. For the first 70 minutes, it looked as if they might be edged out by a team that were a little cannier and with the kind of bench that only Premier League revenues can buy. But they stuck to their aims, rode the shifts in momentum, Le Bris made his changes and Eliezer Mayenda and Tommy Watson did not think twice before seizing their moments in front of goal.It was Patrick Roberts who made the equaliser, his pass with the outside of the right boot cutting through the Blades’ midfield and beyond the outstretched Jack Robinson to find Mayenda, who rifled the ball in the top corner. Roberts was one of four players in the squad who had featured against Wycombe in the League One playoff final three years ago. A second, Luke O’Nien, was the first to congratulate Mayenda, bursting from the bench despite having exited the play himself after dislocating a shoulder just two minutes in.In added time, Watson decided the match by latching on to a horrible mistake by Kieffer Moore to hit a shot just as unerring as Mayenda’s, but this time low and from range, into the corner. The 19-year-old tore his shirt off and burst towards the stands, his eyes sharp, his fist clenched. Another Sunderland academy graduate, Watson has played just 900 minutes of league football in his career. He has also already agreed a £10m deal to move to Brighton this summer.In that one detail you are reminded of the limits of any misty-eyed thinking when it comes to English football in the 21st century. Watson is unlikely to be the only young talent to move on from the Stadium of Light this summer. Jobe Bellingham, imperious at the base of the Sunderland midfield, has already been linked with following in his brother’s footsteps and a move to Borussia Dortmund. There will be suitors for the creative midfielder Chris Rigg and full-back Trai Hume, whose crossing was a constant danger.View image in fullscreenTommy Watson fires home Sunderland’s late winning goal past Michael Cooper.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersBut Sunderland did not allow themselves to be overtaken by cynicism. Instead they chose to dream: of glory, of success through conviction, of completing a turnaround for a club that was floundering just a few years ago. They were backed in equal part by their supporters, who made the noise before the game, during and, of course, afterwards.Sunderland had the highest average attendance in the Championship this past season at 40,000, a figure that would make them ninth biggest in the top flight too. They are a big club in most of the ways that matter. But in this match, in this moment, they drew on the motivation and the enthusiasm of the underdog. Their opponents, meanwhile, gave off the air of a side that have reached the heights and been chastened by what they found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They look determined to embrace it.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedSunderlandanalysisShareReuse this content"

The wind tousling his hair, the ball at his feet, the way it was always meant to be. In front of him a wall of Bournemouth defenders jumpily stands guard, eyes wide like stags ready to bolt. Grealish shuffles inside, body feinting, hips dancing. You want to know what happens next. What happens next is that the referee blows for full time.It’s the 97th minute; Grealish came on in the 91st. In that time Bournemouthsomehow managed to score a goal. It wasn’t Grealish’s fault, but it did eat up most of the time in which he was hoping to make an impression. No matter. As the game ends, the cameras hunt down a treble-winning City legend making what might well be his final appearance at the Etihad Stadium. Kevin De Bruyne takes his handshakes and his tributes. Grealish slips quietly down the tunnel.Farewell Kevin De Bruyne: Manchester City’s genius and a law unto himself | Simon HattenstoneRead moreStill, even this brief uncredited cameo represents progress of sorts. In City’s previous three games Grealish did not even make it off the bench. Inlast weekend’s FA Cup final, with City chasing an equaliser, he watched as Pep Guardiola brought on a 19-year-old debutant in Claudio Echeverri instead of him. Opponents against whom Grealish has played 90 minutes in 2025: Salford, Leyton Orient, Plymouth, Leicester. Over the league season as a whole Grealish has played just 22% of City’s minutes.After the Bournemouth game on Tuesday night Grealish will have heard that Guardiola would rather quit City than be forced to carry on leaving players “in the freezer”, frozen out of the matchday squad. On Grealish he declared: “He has to come back to play minutes to start to play again.” Want to play minutes, Jack? It’s simple! Just play more minutes!View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola’s message to Jack Grealish has been ‘play more minutes’ without giving the City winger game time.Photograph: Roger Evans/Action Plus/ShutterstockOf course it is just possible Grealish may be able to read between the lines here. And in a way, the separation process has been taking place over years rather than weeks. Signedin the summer of 2021for a British record £100m – and still the seventh most expensive footballer of all time – Grealish feels in retrospect increasingly like a short-term solution to a short-term need, a player signed for a team and perhaps even a game that no longer really exists.And of course the first thing that needs to be said at this point is, you know, fair enough. £100m should be buying you a generation-defining player: instead, apart from one superb season in the 2022-23 treble-winning side, Grealish never really came close to justifying the faith invested in him. A record of 12 goals and 12 assists in four Premier League seasons speaks for itself. As Guardiola put it earlier this season: “In the end, it is about performance, delivering assists and goals.”Even so, it’s instructive to go back to Grealish’s first season at City, a season in which Grealish openly fretted about his lack of hard numbers and was slapped down in public by his manager for doing so. “Always we talk about statistics,” Guardiola scolded. “Players today play for the statistics but this is the biggest mistake they can do. We didn’t buy him to score 45 goals. He has other qualities.”But of course the City team of 2021-22 was flush with goals from all areas: from Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and De Bruyne, and Gabriel Jesus and Bernardo Silva. The following season a 52-goal striker would be signed in Erling Haaland. What Guardiola demanded from Grealish was control. Control of the ball, control of tempo, progression up the pitch, acceleration, deceleration.The Grealish of Villa from 2019-21 would probably be perfect for City now, yet the Grealish of City now is very much notThese days, with Haaland ailing and City scrapping to reach next season’s Champions League, the demands are different. Even compared with two years ago the Premier League is more dynamic, more vertical, this City less able to dominate territory than their predecessors. Whatever happens against Fulham on Sunday, City will end this season with their lowest average possession since the Manuel Pellegrini era. In this shifting landscape the capacity for a struggling side to carry a winger with no straight-line pace and no goal threat is gently receding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSo if Guardiola subtly moved the goalposts on Grealish, perhaps it is because the goalposts also subtly moved on Guardiola. The ability to retain possession in dangerous areas has become less important than the ability to use it quickly, which is why players such as Jérémy Doku and Savinho have found themselves preferred this season. Thesigning of Omar Marmoushin January, a forward who operates in very similar spaces to Grealish, is another reminder of the rapidly changing nature of the job: one defined by speed, directness, thrumming momentum and getting shots off.Naturally there will be the usual mutterings about Grealish’s lifestyle, but while this is a player who could probably do with getting photographed in the pub a little less, there is little evidence on the pitch to suggest that he has neglected himself, or let his physical standards drop. Rather, the tale of Grealish is a parable of how extreme wealth inequality allows the biggest clubs not just to accumulate talent but to mould it: to change its nature, to render it more immediately useful but also a little more boring, to narrow its horizons.View image in fullscreenJack Grealish scores against West Ham in 2022, a rare feat given his record of 12 goals and 12 assists in four Premier League seasons.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianOn joining City, Grealish was forced to adjust his game radically: to focus more on recycling possession, winning fouls, eking out yards rather than unleashing the tricks and flourishes that made him so beloved at Aston Villa. These were the compromises necessary to take Grealish from the Championship to the top step of the Champions League, and he was handsomely rewarded for it too. But there is a certain irony in the fact that the Grealish of Villa between 2019 and 2021 would probably be the perfect player for City now, and yet the Grealish of City now is very much not.So despite signing Grealish for £100m there is no real pressure on City to make this signing work. Take the hit, sell him to Newcastle or Tottenham, move on without regrets. Grealish is 29 now. He has given City his peak years. And he will be bleakly aware, in more ways than one, that he never had quite as much time as he thought he did.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

History repeated itself in such wonderful fashion for Aberdeen, denying Celtic the domestic treble widely thought inevitable. As The Northern Lights of Old Aberdeen blared out at Hampden Park, the backdrop to moving and euphoric scenes, a 35-year wait for theScottish Cuphad ended.In 1990, as in 2025,Aberdeensaw off Celtic on penalty kicks. In 1970, as in 2025, they halted Celtic’s clean sweep quest. Celtic’s campaign has been one of highs, especially in Europe, but this will sting for a summer.Not all heroes wear capes. Dimitar Mitov, who saved two penalties in the shootout, was at Cambridge United as recently as 2023. Via St Johnstone, the Bulgarian has made himself an Aberdeen legend. So, too, has Jimmy Thelin. Ending Aberdeen’s Scottish Cup drought means the Swede will be playing with house money for the foreseeable future.Scottish football must tackle minority of fans dragging game into gutter | Ewan MurrayRead moreAberdeen’s suffocation of proceedings played a part in this as a dismal final but Thelin will claim with perfect legitimacy that he got his tactical approach spot on. He was helped by a horrendously sloppyCelticperformance. “We spent all week trying to visualise winning this game,” he said. “The players were tired, they were cramping but they kept believing.”In 14 previous visits to Hampden, Brendan Rodgers had never lost. He applauded Aberdeen as they took delivery of the cup, while unquestionably puzzled by the nature of his team’s output, but was still magnanimous when dust settled.“We didn’t play anywhere near the standard we needed to,” he said. “We can have no complaints, we didn’t do enough in the game. We cannot blame anyone else.”It did not help that Paulo Bernardo, Arne Engels and Adam Idah had left the scene when Rodgers was searching for salvation. That represents a combined £25m in last summer’s transfer market. Luke McCowan and Johnny Kenny, essentially Celtic backup players, were left on penalty duties. They at least scored, with the captain, Callum McGregor, and right-back, Alistair Johnston, denied by Mitov. McGregor was inconsolable at the end.Aberdeen had determined going toe-to-toe with Celtic would lead to bloodshed. Celtic lacked pace and invention. The upshot was such a grim spectacle, if one livened by a Kasper Schmeichel howler that afforded Aberdeen late parity. How significant that was to prove. Dreadful but belatedly dramatic.Even if Aberdeen had lost, Thelin could point to 19 goals scored by Celtic against his team in five previous outings as justification of his approach. Celtic were sloppy, meaning Aberdeen were never out of the contest despite their lack of ambition. Mitov was barely worked.The goal that handed Celtic a first-half advantage rather summed things up. Engels’s corner from the left found the head of Cameron Carter-Vickers. The centre-back’s attempt at goal was barely dangerous but flicked off the shoulder of Alfie Dorrington before bouncing in via a post. A shabby goal to typify a shabby final.Leighton Clarkson’s free-kick for Aberdeen, five minutes after the restart, epitomised the lack of conviction from those in red. Clarkson shot tamely at Schmeichel from 20 yards. That rarest of things came next, an Aberdeen chance from open play, with Kevin Nisbet heading over the bar. Engels hit a post as Celtic looked to press home their superiority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A replacement, Shayden Morris, triggered the moment that handed Aberdeen such unlikely hope. For anyone not of a Celtic persuasion, it was a quite hilarious moment of smash and grab. Morris’s low cross should not have presented much of a problem for Schmeichel, the veteran goalkeeper instead deflecting the ball into his own net with his hand. Cue bedlam in the Aberdeen end.Daizen Maeda, Scotland’s player of the year, was clean through on goal with two minutes of stoppage time played. Surely he could rise above Celtic’s bluntness? Maeda allowed Mitov to save. Rodgers, normally so calm on the touchline, was incandescent.Aberdeen were now playing for penalties. Arguably, they had been playing for penalties since kick-off. Dante Polvara’s volley, two minutes into the second period of extra-time, came closing to sending Aberdeen in front. Celtic looked unusually devoid of ideas until Jeffrey Schlupp cracked the upright from distance. Aberdeen scored every one of their penalties. As McGregor and Johnston erred, the upset had been confirmed.There was a bruising subplot for Hibernian. Aberdeen’s glory means it is they, rather than Hibs, are guaranteed European football until Christmas. That carries a boost of around £5m. Hibs and Dundee United have shuffled down in the qualifying spots.Explore more on these topicsScottish CupAberdeenCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

United would finish the season one place above the relegation zone if Tottenham fare better on Sunday.“Things can change fast,” he said. “But to reach the kind of level that we need to be as Manchester United is going to take time.

I’ve heard how he does this, what he does in his daily life, talking about habits, how disciplined he is to achieve this.

He took three or four drinks of what I assume was water.”Slot has admitted to wanting more from Trent Alexander-Arnold during pre-season and hopes his players follow the example ofMohamed Salahin the summer, who was born to run and finished top of the fitness charts on day one under the head coach.“One of the reasons why you play at a club like Liverpool is because you have elite mentality, and you have the mentality of a serial winner,” Slot said. “But sometimes as a manager you have to help them a little bit to inspire them, or to be hard on them, or to compliment them.“I’ve seen this already with Mo Salah, I always give him as an example, because last season he was number one when we had this [fitness] test in the league and that told me a lot. That’s why he’s for seven years already at elite level. And if you look at all the elite players in all different sports, they all say the same.

The fourth official had just told himthe game was up, the final whistle imminent. Jones got to his feet, looked to the skies and covered his face. Then, at full time, he crumpled into a shell, face down in the turf of his technical area. The footage went viral.“People close to me said it was a bit over the top,” he says. “I was just in the moment. It wasn’t fabricated, it wasn’t because the TV cameras were there, because I didn’t realise they were. I wouldn’t say it was an out-of-body experience, but it was an outpouring of emotion, a deflation of all the pressures.”Father figure Martin Ling presiding over Leyton Orient’s ‘minor miracle’Read moreThose stresses are long gone at Sparrows Lane where, 48 hours before leading his team on the Wembley sidelines, Jones devotes a chunk of his afternoon discussing his faith, how his love for wine snowballed while playing in Spain and country music. “Myself and Phil Chapple [the head of recruitment] watched 24 Hour Party People last night. Great film,” he says.“That was the music I was brought up on. My dad loved Eric Clapton, Queen, Michael Jackson, so I was educated from there. I grew up in the 80s, probably the best era for bands and I caught the tail end of the Haçienda and indie era, which led into the 90s. I used to do a bit of DJing when I was a kid, when I was [a player] at Brighton, house music. I wasn’t any good but I had my decks and I love my music.”Conversation slowly returns to those celebrations, via Spain. The co-owner Gabriel Brener, part of the Global Football Partners consortium that acquired Charlton almost two years ago, recently gave Jones a “wonderfully expensive” bottle of Ribera del Duero, one of his favourite reds. He does not profess to be a connoisseur, but his time at Badajoz and Numancia, in his early 20s, help.View image in fullscreenNathan Jones is not afraid to show his passion and emotions on the touchline.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock“Growing up in a Welsh mining community and going to Cardiff and Luton you’re not exposed to too many vineyards, just your standard lagers. But there [in Spain] it was a more social thing, but not as we know it: dinners,cenas, good food. I like it – you can’t drink too much because it’s a bitch on the head, but it’s a way of relaxing and something I enjoy. I’ll drink it at the right time.”Sunday evening, perhaps? “God willing, the best team wins – as long as it’s Charlton,” he says, smiling. He elaborates on his emotions last week. “I’m not a highly educated, suited-and-booted, calm individual. I’ve had to find ways of competing with top-end people and that’s how I’ve lived my life. I’ve had to work hard, I’ve had to fight for everything. At times it consumes me and everyone in my life. So when these big moments happen, I go with the natural reaction, not necessarily the one that is the most politically correct or the most suitable for everyone.”In many ways it was in keeping with his heart-on-sleeve persona. In March, after his team scored twice in stoppage time to earn a comeback victory at Leyton Orient – Charlton’s opponents at Wembley on Sunday – he jumped the advertising hoardings, fist-pumped on repeat and roared with delight. In his second spell at Luton, after a win at Swansea, he charged into the away end beating his chest to celebrate a win with the travelling support. This is Jones, a fiery and fiercely driven Welshman from Blaenrhondda, a village in the valleys. “As a kid, you could walk the streets at 10pm. We played hide and seek, football until it was pitch black.”These days, Jones says, people prefer conservative and composed, but the 51-year-old has never been an anodyne character. He acknowledges his honesty has cost him in the past. He was burnt by the Premier League spotlight at Southampton,where he was sacked94 days into a three-and-a-half-year contract after eight defeats in nine top-flight games.“I’m not a big fan of society now,” he says. “Because of social media and people’s attitudes, you only have to say something in error or even in ignorance and suddenly your career can be over. That’s the gravity of things. You have to adapt. There are a billion keyboard warriors that are just looking for something to complain about and someone they can sabotage. It’s not a forgiving world, it’s not an understanding world, it’s a world where people want their pound of flesh.”He is back on familiar ground. His first full-time coaching role was with Charlton’s Under-21s, when his team, including Nick Pope, triumphed in the professional development league in 2013. The buildings at Charlton’s training base are adorned with images of their heroes of yesteryear including Chris Powell and Jason Pearce, now an academy coach. Walls are decorated with posters of academy alumni such as Ezri Konsa, Ademola Lookman and Joe Gomez.View image in fullscreenNathan Jones’s heart-on-sleeve persona has attracted plenty of attention.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/ShutterstockThen there are the pictures from the last time Charlton were in this position, when they clinchedpromotion via Wembley in 2019. A turbulent past means the shadow of Alan Curbishley, who left in 2006, still lingers, but this is a new era. Will Jones dress up for the occasion? “I used to be a suit manager but I never felt comfortable: I’m a tracksuit, casual manager. I like to feel free, I like to feel that I can get about the place and I’m not sure I can do that in a pair of shoes and a tie.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Birmingham are the only team in the top four tiers to have won more points than Charlton this calendar year. His side have kept 25 clean sheets in all competitions, five times as many as last season. The squad feeds off of Jones’s jack-in-a-box energy, but he is fastidious and forthright when required. The captain, Greg Docherty, tells of the “top-of-the-class homework” Jones had done when he met him as a free agent last summer. “I ended up selling myself to him,” Docherty says. “How did that happen?”I’ve had meteoric highs and I’ve had some very public lows, but it’s about how you come through and handle thoseFor Jones, whose father was a bricklayer and mother worked in a school, there is one constant. “You go through tough times, 30,000 fans not wanting you at their club,” he says, alluding to that testing period at Southampton. “In those occasions I always have an equilibrium in my life which is the Lord. Whenever I have good times, I go to God. Whenever I have bad times, I go to God. That enables me to function on a daily basis. I’ve had meteoric highs and I’ve had some very public lows, but it’s about how you come through and handle those.”He has religious tattoos, including Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam, across his back. Jones has a strong relationship with Matt Baker, Charlton’s longstanding chaplain. “We have a prayer group and there’s a big south-east London contingent in that before the game. I pray in my room, I have a quiet word myself. I don’t start a single day without prayer and reading.”By 7am, Jones tends to have prayed, read the Bible and been for a run. “That way I get my spiritual and physical ‘food’ that I need early on. Then I try to be the best version of myself at work.” He makes the most of Greenwich Park on his doorstep. Other times he plots a path along the Thames. “I enjoyed running when I was a player, I loved it,” Jones says. “I don’t love it as much now. I do it now so I can burn calories and stay alive, because when you have a glass of wine and a packet of crisps, then that sits heavy.”Which route will he choose on Sunday, when Charlton will be backed by almost 40,000 supporters at Wembley, some of whom are flying in from as far as Australia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Uruguay. “The day of the game is the only day I don’t run,” he says. “I like to keep my energy because I need it.”Explore more on these topicsCharlton AthleticLeague OneinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Before the match, giant banners were unveiled with images of Ancelotti and Modric, while the stadium announcer’s confirmation of the Croat’s place in the starting lineup was met with thunderous applause.The crowd also rose to their feet in the 10th minute to chant “Modric, Modric” and both teams came together to give the midfielder a guard of honour when he was substituted in the 87th minute.Lucas Vázquez, who is reportedly leaving the club at the end of the season, also received a standing ovation when he was substituted.There were different kinds of goodbyes elsewhere, withLeganésjoining Las Palmas and Valladolid in relegation.

It was above all expectations. We were spot on in the crucial moments.”The 36-year-old Dutchwoman has been in permanent charge of Arsenal for only 127 days since her appointment in January, after initially stepping up as their interim head coach in October after Jonas Eidevall’s resignation, but she has overseen a rapid resurgence in the club’s fortunes to deliver one of the greatest days in their history in the heat of the Portuguese capital.Slegers also believes there are more improvements to come from her team, adding: “There’s been so much engagement and investment and belief and intensity in the way we trained. I’m so happy for everyone that they got the rewards today. They are so worth it. They worked extremely hard. There is still more in this team and that is the scary part.”Arsenal’s victory was particularly special for their former Scotland midfielder Kim Little, who first joined the club in 2008 and rejoined the north London side in 2017. After captaining them to glory, she said: “We knew coming into this game that we had to be basically perfect to beat this Barcelona team. The team showed incredible discipline. Across the board it was just incredible.“It’s very special for me. I’ve been at the club a very long time and we have had incredible periods where we have been successful. The club won it in 2007 and I signed the year after that. To still be at the club now and see how much it has done to progress the women’s game and invest in us as players and as a club, it is truly special. To be sitting here now today off the back of winning the ultimate trophy for club football, it is definitely the best moment of my career.”Arsenal are the only British women’s club to have ever lifted a European title but this was their first time in the final since winning a quadruple of major honours in the 2007 campaign. Since then they have had to endure their neighbours Chelsea dominating the domestic silverware but they remain by far the English women’s game’s most decorated club, with a record 14 Women’s FA Cups to their name as well as 15 top-flight titles and 16 League Cups across two different iterations of that cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The French head coach masterminded Sunderland’s return to the top flight after eight years in his first season at the club.Watson, a 73rd-minute substitute, scored in the fifth minute of added time to complete adream comeback victoryafter Eliezer Mayenda cancelled out Tyrese Campbell’s well-taken opener. Watson, who joined Sunderland aged eight, will move to Brighton next month after the clubs agreed a £10m deal in April, but the forward gave his boyhood club the perfect parting gift. “We’ll see each other in the Premier League next year, in the big time,” Watson said.Sunderland draw on enthusiasm of the underdog to secure playoff success | Paul MacInnesRead moreThe finale brought more joyous scenes for Sunderland, who had reached Wembley thanks to Dan Ballard’s header in the final minute of extra time in their semi-final second-legvictory over Coventry, but playoff agony for Sheffield United. “At the end this game is a good example of the season,” Le Bris said. “Emotionally, it’s impressive … The end of the second leg was absolutely crazy. It was the case again, to create this connection, this emotion, these memories for the fans and for us. We need to live these tough moments and it will be really important in my life.”Sunderland finished 16th in the division last season and a young side – on average they fielded the youngest team in theChampionshipthis campaign – triumphed despite falling behind to Campbell’s strike at Wembley. “We showed a strong character even when we are not dominant, even when we struggle as a squad,” said the former Lorient manager. “We stayed connected, we stuck to our plan and maybe later in the game we found an opportunity to change the momentum.”One of Sunderland’s stars, the 19-year-old Jobe Bellingham, is the subject of strong interest from Borussia Dortmund, while the 17-year-old Chris Rigg also has outside admirers, but Le Bris stressed it is a team game. “We need to remember that the connection between players is often more important than the talent of one player,” he said. “For me as a manager and in football in general sometimes we forget that it is a collective sport and effort. We tend to focus on one talent but it’s not the main point, it’s about the way we work together.”A deflated Chris Wilder, a boyhood Blades fan who was in the crowd when United were beaten in the playoffs by Wolves and Burnley in 2003 and 2009 respectively, conceded defeat was a bitter blow. “We had an opportunity to change the narrative around the playoffs and we’ve not taken it,” the United manager said.View image in fullscreenChris Wilder and Sheffield United suffered yet more playoff heartache.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersWilder also questioned the use of the video assistant referee system, which was influential in disallowing Harrison Burrows’ volley at 1-0, when the offside Vinícius Souza was deemed to have interfered with the view of Anthony Patterson in Sunderland’s goal. “We play 46 games, two playoff games and all of a sudden it’s a subjective decision by the referee,” he said. “I don’t think the goalkeeper saves it, I don’t think he gets anywhere near it. I thought it gave them a lifeline with some real energy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the Roberts family at this difficult time.”In 2014,three spectators were killed and six more were injuredat the event when two cars lost control and veered into viewing areas.The rally returned five years later in 2019 after “rigorous steps” were taken to ensure safety.First held in 1970, the closed-road event is a round of the Probite British rally championship, Asset Alliance Group Scottish rally championship and Protyre national asphalt championship.Explore more on these topicsRallyingMotor sportScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood Saints will make a citing complaint if the incident does not lead to an official disciplinary probe.Phil Dowson, Saints’ director of rugby, said the 20-year-old had been the victim of “foul play” by a Bordeaux player. The meleé was initially sparked by an altercation between theNorthamptoncaptain, Fraser Dingwall, and the French international fly-half Matthieu Jalibert, before several other Bordeaux players became involved.Northampton heartbreak as Penaud inspires Bordeaux to Champions Cup gloryRead moreDowson was swift to congratulate Bordeaux on their victory but was clearly unimpressed by what unfolded after the final whistle. “There was a fracas at the end, there was foul play involved and I have been assured the touch judge has seen it and will deal with it appropriately,” said the former England back-row forward. “Henry Pollock was particularly upset by it because it was uncalled for and out of order and so he reacted. The officials have told me they will deal with it.”Saints’ England fly-half Fin Smith also suggested the French players had previously been riled by Pollock during the game. “They were after him. I don’t think they liked him. He’ll be all right. I remember they all sort of charged at him and tried to get hold of him. If you have just won a European Cup I’m surprised if the first thing you want to do is start a fight with a 20-year-old. I felt that was interesting.”Dingwall said he did not think there was bad blood during the game but felt the increasing number of players appealing for decisions was against the “values” of the game. “There were a couple of moments when boys potentially didn’t adhere to those things and that’s going to spark a reaction,” he said.Dowson stressed he was extremely proud of his players for the way they battled on despite a number of injuries. He said George Furbank, driven away on a medical cart after an early collision, was fine but acknowledged the permanent removal of two-thirds of Northampton’s back three inside the first four minutes had had “a huge impact” on the contest.View image in fullscreenNorthampton’s Fraser Dingwall said: ‘We just gave them too many opportunities and didn’t win the critical moments.’Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PADingwall said his team were extremely frustrated to have fallen just short: “There was loads of fight and that sums us up this year – unfortunately we just gave them too many opportunities and didn’t win the critical moments.“It is frustrating when it is such small margins but that is the way this game is. We stayed in there but unfortunately when you play against top teams you can’t give them opportunities. We didn’t fire as many shots as we could have done. It is going to be frustrating to look back on.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They now have a stranglehold on the Eastern Conference finals.Pascal Siakam erupted for a playoff career-high 39 points and helped close out a 114-109 victory over the Knicks on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, giving the Pacers a 2-0 lead as the best-of-seven-games series shifts to Indianapolis for Game 3. It was another ruthless closing performance by an Indiana team that has now taken back-to-back games from the Knicks on their home floor.Siakam’s brilliance was complemented by 16 points from Myles Turner and a near triple-double from Tyrese Haliburton, who stuffed the box score with 14 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. Indiana, now halfway to just their second trip to theNBAfinals, depart New York in firm control.Game 3 is Sunday in Indiana, though the Pacers might prefer to keep playing in Manhattan. They’ve now won six straight playoff road games dating back to a first-round loss in Milwaukee, the longest streak in team history.“I just came out aggressive at the end of the day, we’re a team, you know, it doesn’t matter who scores, that’s what I love so much about this team,” said Siakam, the ninth-year power forward from Cameroon who’d scored 17 points in Game 1. “I got to go in early, the guys did a good job finding me, and again, another night is going to be somebody else, you know, that’s what makes us special.”A back-and-forth contest with 17 lead changes through the first three quarters was tied 81-81 heading into the fourth when the Pacers opened the final frame on a 13-4 run with Knicks star Jalen Brunson on the bench. They seized momentum for good after Siakam’s three-pointer with 9:17 remaining made it 94-85 and never trailed again.By the time Haliburton found Siakam in acres of space for an easy layup that made it 110-100 with 2:45 left, the result seemed all but a handshake away. New York rattled off nine unanswered points during a furious rally and cut the deficit to 112-109 in the final seconds, but Brunson’s contested 29-footer to tie caromed off the back of the rim. Indiana’s Myles Turner secured the rebound and iced the game at the line, bringing the rollicking sellout crowd of 19,812 to heel.It marked the second straight fourth-quarter fade by the Knicks, who alsoblew a 14-point lead with under three minutes leftin Game 1. While Friday’s loss wasn’t quite as historic, it was every bit as devastating. “We had a chance to tie the ballgame,” New York coach Tom Thibodeau said. “It was a hard-fought game. Both games came down to the last play.”View image in fullscreenNew York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, right, is defended by the Indiana Pacers’ Andrew Nembhard, center, Myles Turner, left, during the second half of Friday night’s Game 2 of the East finals.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPABrunson led the Knicks with 36 points and 11 assists, a heroic effort that wasn’t quite enough. Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points and 10 rebounds while Josh Hart chipped in 15 points and 11 boards. But the Knicks shot just 11-of-32 from deep and once again struggled with turnovers and defensive communication at key moments, allwoing the Pacers far too many wide-open looks.Haliburton followed up his Game 1 heroics with a more subdued but effective night. Turner added 16 points, including 13 on 4-of-6 shooting in the fourth, and held his own defensively against Towns.For Indiana, it was another showcase of their poise and versatility. Their bench outscored New York’s 24-11, and they outshot the Knicks 52% to 45% from the field.No team has lost the first two games on their home floor in a conference finals and come back to win the series. Indiana are bidding for a second NBA finals appearance in their 58-year history and first since 2000, when they bowed to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.As for the Knicks, the questions are piling up. They’ve now dropped consecutive games at home for the first time all playoffs. Their late-game execution, so often a strength under Thibodeau, has deserted them. And their margin for error is all but spent as they now face the daunting task of flipping their first conference finals appearance in 25 years on the road against one of the NBA’s hottest teams.“There are a lot of traps here,” Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. “You cannot assume going home is going to be easier. It never is. Each game as you ascend in a playoff series becomes harder. And New York, they’ve got an amazing fighting spirit.”Explore more on these topicsNBANew York KnicksIndiana PacersBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Facial ID quietly becoming part of police’s arsenalDaniel BoffeyandMark WildingSat 24 May 2025 12.41 EDTFirst published on Sat 24 May 2025 12.00 EDTSharePolice believe live facial recognition cameras may become “commonplace” inEnglandand Wales, according to internal documents, with the number of faces scanned having doubled to nearly 5m in the last year.A joint investigation by the Guardian andLiberty Investigateshighlights the speed at which the technology is becoming a staple of British policing.Major funding is being allocated and hardware bought, while the British state is also looking to enable police forces to more easily access the full spread of its image stores, including passport and immigration databases, for retrospective facial recognition searches.Live facial recognition involves the matching of faces caught on surveillance camera footage against a police watchlist in real time, in what campaigners liken to the continual finger printing of members of the public as they go about their daily lives.Retrospective facial recognition software is used by the police to match images on databases with those caught on CCTV and other systems.According to one funding document drawn up by SouthWalespolice as part of a proposal to put the West End of London or Cardiff rail station under live facial recognition cameras and released by the Metropolitan police under the Freedom of Information Act, it is believed “the use of this technology could become commonplace in our city centres and transport hubs around England and Wales”.The first fixed live facial recognition cameras will be fitted for a trial in Croydon, south London, later this summer.The expansion comes despite facial recognition failing to be referenced in any act of parliament.Campaigners claim the police have been allowed to “self regulate” their use of the technology. Officers have in the past used a setting that was subsequently shown to disproportionately misidentify black people.After a court of appeal judgment in 2020, which found that South Wales police’suse of live facial recognition camerashad been unlawful, the College of Policing provided guidance that “the threshold needs to be set with care to maximise the probability of returning true alerts while keeping the false alert rate to an acceptable level”.There remains nothing in law to direct forces on the threshold or technology used.The policing minister, Diane Johnson, told parliament earlier this month that she recognised “a need to consider whether a bespoke legislative framework governing the use of live facial recognition technology for law enforcement purposes is needed” but the Home Office is yet to provide details.Facial recognition cameras were firsttrialled in Londonand south Wales from 2016 but the speed at which police forces are rolling out the technology has accelerated over the last 12 months.The investigation by the Guardian and Liberty found:Police forces scanned nearly 4.7m faces with live facial recognition cameras last year – more than twice as many as in 2023. Live facial recognition vans were deployed at least 256 times in 2024, according to official deployment records, up from 63 the year before.A roving unit of 10 live facial recognition vans that can be sent anywhere in the country will be made available within days – increasing national capacity. Eight police forces have deployed the technology. The Met has four vans.Police forces have considered fixed infrastructure creating a “zone of safety” by covering the West End of London with a network of live facial recognition cameras. Met officials said this remained a possibility.Forces almost doubled the number of retrospective facial recognition searches made last year using the police national database (PND) from 138,720 in 2023 to 252,798. The PND contains custody mug shots, millions of which have beenfound to be stored unlawfullyof people who have never been charged with or convicted of an offence.More than 1,000 facial recognition searches using the UK passport database were carried out in the last two years, and officers are increasingly searching for matches on the Home Office immigration database, with requests up last year, to 110. Officials have concluded that using the passport database for facial recognition is “not high risk” and “is not controversial”, according to internal documents.The Home Office is now working with the police to establish a new national facial recognition system, known as strategic facial matcher. The platform will be capable of searching a range of databases including custody images and immigration records.Lindsey Chiswick, the director of intelligence at the Met and the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council lead on facial recognition, said surveys showed that four in five Londoners were in support of the police using innovative technology, including facial recognition cameras.This week, a registered sex offender, David Cheneler, 73, from Lewisham, wasjailed for two yearsafter he was caught alone with a six-year-old girl by a live facial recognition camera. He had previously served nine years for 21 offences against children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So policing needs to start operating a little bit differently. People talk about harnessing AI like it’s some crazy horse we want to saddle but we do need to harness the opportunities that technology and data can bring us.”Chiswick said the Met’s policy was to take “really quite small steps and review them at every stage” but that there would be a “benefit in potentially some sort of framework or statutory guidance”.The Met is deploying its facial recognition cameras at a setting that testing suggests avoids any statistical significance in terms of gender or ethnicity bias when it comes to cases of misidentification.Chiswick said: “I don’t want to use a biased algorithm in London. There’s no point on all counts. I think for government, there’s a question, isn’t there around artificial intelligence? And I think clearly the public sector is going to use, and want to use AI more and more.“I think the questions around who then decides where algorithms are purchased from, what training data is used, what countries might this technology come from and then, when you use it, are you obliged to test it and if you’re obliged to test it, are you then obliged to operate at a certain setting? That’s not really questions for law enforcement.”The Home Office declined a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionSurveillancePoliceUK civil libertiesCrimeEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

What secrets would the data reveal?Jeremy EttinghausenSat 24 May 2025 06.45 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 11.57 EDTShareShe is always listening. She is unfailingly polite. She is often obtuse. She is sometimes helpful. She frequently frustrates. She isn’t great with bashment artists. Or grime. Or drum’n’bass. She needs to be spoken to slowly and clearly, as you’d talk to an aged relative with diminished faculties. She doesn’t like French accents.‘“Alexa, how long do wasps live for?”“Alexa, how long do wasps live if you hit them with a tea towel and then a saucepan?”In September 2016, a new presence appears in our house, squatting on the kitchen counter between the kettle and the coffee machine. It is blandly futuristic, a minimal cylinder with an LED ring that glows blue to alert us to the fact that it is ready, poised to answer our questions or carry out our instructions, as long as those instructions are clearly stated and fall within a narrow band of available “skills”.More often than I’d like, the solid blue glow is replaced by a rotating wash of green to tell us that anAmazonorder is on its way. Occasionally, the light is red: this happens when someone has turned off the microphone to seize control of the device and impose their music on all of us. Our Amazon Echo is primarily used as the family Bluetooth speaker, and a glance through the music played on it demonstrates that there is very little common ground between our differing tastes. In a household with three young people, the kitchen is a place of musical education and dispute, with the Echo the communal weapon of choice.Our Echo is one of the early ones: essentially a smart speaker connected to a server where the fairly rudimentary Alexa voice assistant attempts to turn our requests and questions into actions and answers. More recent incarnations have screens that allow you to make video calls or stream TV programmes, inevitably, through Amazon Prime. And, when Amazon releases its long-awaited, generative AI-enabled update in the next few weeks or months, my aged unit will be incompatible with Alexa+. It won’t remember my favourite movies or meals, and it won’t help me plan a night out or book an Uber or find a babysitter. But given what Alexa (and, by extension, Amazon) has heard and analysed and stored in the nine years they have been eavesdropping on us, I am happy to settle for our first-generation Echo’s more limited capabilities.Our requests ranged from prosaic to troubling and downright bizarre – there was very little we didn’t ask AlexaLast year, I realised that my relationship with Amazon predated my mortgage, my marriage, parenthood, two distinct careers and a host of other significant life moments. To see if I could distil anything of value – the contours of a 21st-century adulthood, perhaps – from all the information Amazon holds about me, I requested all the available data usingan almost impossible to find link. Would I be reassured or disturbed when I found out what Amazon and Alexa knew about my family?A couple of days later, I received an email containing links to gigabytes of information: particulars of every purchase I’ve ever made – from the noir novel I bought on the day that Amazon UK launched to the 28th pair of headphones acquired in as many years. Records of every page turn of every Kindle ebook I’ve opened, every moment of Prime content I’ve watched, measured by the second. And, of course, the details of every interaction we have ever had with our Echo; every question asked, every song requested, every timer set.They don’t make it easy to find gold among the fields of data available for download. Folder and file names are opaque and unhelpful. Competence with spreadsheets is useful and a subscription to a powerful AI assistant is advantageous. Time and patience are necessary. One folder contains nothing but thousands and thousands of sound files, all with the same date and each with a nonsensical string of characters instead of a name. It is definitely fun to click on these at random and hear the voices of various family members mispronouncing band names, asking for Pokémon jokes or demanding that Alexa “play a fart noise”. But without any semblance of order to the files, going through 15,000 of them (“Alexa, never mind”) would truly be a sisyphean task. Or a briefly entertaining family parlour game.Fortunately, along with the sound files, Amazon provides spreadsheets and spreadsheets of text-based data that reduces the amount of time needed to assess our Alexa usage from months to days. Using these spreadsheets and searching for the word “play”, I can see that nearly half of the 15,000 “utterances” registered by Alexa have been instructions to play a song, album or playlist, while 1,823 of them have been the setting of a timer. In our 15,000 utterances we have only said “please” to Alexa 41 times, though, in our defence, we only told her to fuck off twice.These commands allow me to trace the development of the musical tastes of my children: from being a Kanye-obsessed schoolboy, my oldest has diversified his listening, with Bowie and the Smiths appearing as data clusters during university holidays. My middle child’s musical awakening begins with Loyle Carner, though more recently she has apparently developed a liking for vocal jazz. And the youngest has thankfully exited herphonkphase and now fills the kitchen withriot grrrlas she empties the dishwasher. Looking through the list of music played, I see little evidence of my wife’s musical preferences in the data, aside from her oft-used “Alexa, volume down, VOLUME DOWN” instruction.Then, in one cryptically named folder, I find a rich seam of precious material: transcripts of more 1,500 questions that we have asked Alexa since 2018. Ranging from the prosaic (“Alexa, how many days until 28 October?”) to the troubling (“Alexa, what is hentai?”) to the downright bizarre (“Alexa, do jellyfish have bottoms?”), these questions indicate that there is very little we won’t ask our little speaker-dwelling friend. Once I’d read the transcripts of everything we’d asked, I saw that we use Alexa as a surrogate, filling in for all sorts of roles that might be missing due to physical absence, knowledge gaps, or lack of attention or patience.We are lazy. Alexa has given us the opportunity to let someone (or something) else do the reading and learning and thinking for usAt different points over the last six or so years, Alexa has been our on-call veterinarian, substitute teacher, big sister, parent, therapist, adjudicator and whipping boy, on top of her familiar roles as DJ and voice-activated timer. She has helped with maths homework, reassured us that, no, bananas are not poisonous to dogs, taught us how to say “so cool” in French (“tellement cool”) and settled the argument of whether Canada is bigger than Russia. My mistake – thanks, Alexa.But she has also advised us on things we can do to make ourselves happy; informed us what might be the appropriate age to start dating (“A good age for teenagers to start dating is 16,” says Dr Eagar of HealthyChildren.org. “A parent can add or subtract a year depending on the teen’s maturity level.”); offered techniques for getting to sleep (“Try lowering the thermostat and try blocking out any outside light”); and suggested how long a girl’s first period might last (“From two to seven days”). She has stoically borne the brunt of our frustration (“Alexa, you’re a bitch”); refused, I presume, to “Tell Jeff Bezos that Alexa sucks” (“I’m not quite sure how to help you with that”); and passively dealt with our pathetic attempts to flirt with her.“Alexa, are you single?”“I am happily single”“Alexa,kiss me”“OK – mmmwwwah”Without listening to every single sound file, it’s hard to be certain who is asking Alexa what. But we have two Echo devices in our household and the data shows whether a request came from the Echo Plus in the kitchen or the original Echo on our daughter Coco’s bedside table, where it has sat since around her ninth birthday. It has played her hundreds of hours of audiobooks, participated in playdates and sleepovers, collaborated in cheating on maths homework, and offers a rare glimpse into the secret inner world of a networked tween.So I now know that it was Coco who wanted to know what it is to be omnisexual and what omniscient means. And it’s Coco who wants to know what happens when you mix all the colours of the rainbow, what would be the best name to call a leopard, and wants Alexa to sing her a song about cats. Coco is simultaneously the most polite member of the family to Alexa, regularly wishing her a good morning or goodnight, and the rudest: both utterances of “Alexa, fuck off” are attributed to her device. The transcripts from Coco’s Echo reveal her waning interest in Pokémon, her inability to tell the time (“Alexa, how long until 8.45?”) and her problems getting to sleep. What they also clearly show is that, out of the five of us, Coco is the most comfortable talking to a voice assistant – half of the entries in the dataset come from her device – and that there are no boundaries to what she will ask Alexa, with the mix of repetitively mundane to profoundly existential sometimes generating its own abstract poetry.“Alexa, swear”“Alexa, swear”“Alexa, say a bad word”“Alexa, don’t say knickers”“Alexa, knickers”“Alexa, what does knickers mean?”Coco’s relationship with Alexa is, in our family at least, uniquely hers. For a start, she is of an age where she wants to know the answers to questions that may be too personal or embarrassing to ask a parent or sibling. And then she is the only one of us who has an Echo in their own private space. Coco tells me she speaks to Alexa less now than she did two or three years ago, partly because she knows that I’ve seen transcripts of everything she has asked, but mainly because she now has her own phone and WhatsApp and can chat with “like, actual friends”. I asked her why she didn’t come to talk to us about her problems getting to sleep, and she said that most of these questions to Alexa happened late at night when she didn’t want to disturb us or let us know she was still awake. She denies ever swearing at Alexa, but admits that there were occasions when she had friends in the room where things turned a little raucous and Alexamighthave been the victim of bullying.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Steven Gregor/The GuardianI’ve learned plenty through the Alexa-enabled glimpse into Coco’s psyche, and the rest of us have, to a lesser extent, revealed ourselves through our questions and demands. We are, for example, opinionated and argumentative, the Echo in our kitchen being regularly called on to adjudicate on disputed facts, most recently “Alexa, are ducks and geese the same thing?” We didn’t know how old Zendaya or Michael Bublé or Jeremy Corbyn or 67 other celebrities are, and this knowledge was at some point important to us. We are lazy and wasteful, and Alexa has given us the opportunity to let someone (or something) else do the reading and learning and thinking for us.Alexa, what shouldI do – eat the rest of my sandwich or throw it in the bin?Most years, Amazon UK’s PR team issues a press release containing listicles of the most-asked Alexa questions from the past 12 months, from which I’ve learned that we are not outliers in our usage and behaviour. We are as interested in celebrities as everyone else, though less interested in how tall they are or how much they earn. We differ in that we don’t use Alexa for recipes, and no one in our house has ever said “Alexa, you’re the best!”, which in 2022 was the eighth most recorded utterance about Alexa’s personality. And if our Echo usage is replicated nationwide, my back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest that Alexa will have set more than 3bn timers in the UK last year, and responded to tens of millions of polite or not so polite commands every day..In2023, 60% of UK households had a smart speaker, up from 22% before the pandemic. Of these,72% are Amazon Echo devices. More rough calculations on my part produce the truly astonishing figure that there are nearly 12m Echo devices in the UK. Of course, many of these may well be unplugged and sitting on a shelf, deaf, dumb and dormant. But, clearly, millions and millions of us are comfortable with having an eavesdropper in our homes, listening out for our shopping orders, queries about our favourite sports teams, compliments and insults, score settling, music requests, and revealing, personal, inquiries. And they’re not just listening and responding, but sending the sound files and data to Amazon’s servers, where they are stored, processed and analysed, giving the most sophisticated retailer in history access to a treasure trove of information on who we are, what we want, what we need and what we desire.Isn’t it all a bit creepy?Amazon makes it clearthat while Alexa is always listening, she is not always sending audio to Amazon’s servers, only streaming audio to the cloud when a “wake” word has been detected and verified. Amazon says “Alexa is a continuously improving service”, and the requests it collects and stores from our usage helps it to train its speech-recognition services and provide better recommendations of music to listen to and “skills” to enable. It is possible to delete all the data Amazon keeps on file and also choose not to have any voice recordings saved, though text transcripts will be retained for 30 days. I’ve been fairly blase (naive, perhaps) about allowing an Echo to eavesdrop on our lives – but given that Amazon says that humans review some, albeit “an extremely small sample”, of data gathered from Alexa, it is probably worth followingmathematician Hannah Fry’s adviceto keep Echos and similar devices out of bedrooms, bathrooms and other intimate spaces. It’s something that I might have considered if I’d known before now that Coco was using Alexa for life advice.But what I’ve gleaned from looking through everything we’ve asked Alexa is the melancholy realisation of what is missing in our home and in our lives. We don’t know nearly as much as we think we do, and we need Alexa (and Siri and Google) to fill in the gaps. We often don’t trust each other, and rely on a neutral third party to mediate. And, as parents, we are not always in the room, physically or metaphorically, when we’re needed. We can’t or won’t always be there to help with homework or offer life advice or simply just provide reassurance. But for many of us, and especially for Coco, Alexa is always willing and always available, if not always capable. Above all, Alexa is always present. I can’t say the same for myself.Explore more on these topicsAmazon AlexaAmazonSmart speakersInternetSmart homesFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.”Galloway also rattled off figures maintaining that Tesla’s sales were down 59% in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 66% in Denmark, 50% in Switzerland and 33% in Portugal.Musk in recent months hadsoughtto intervene in various European political affairs,including Germany’s federal electionand theUK’s row over grooming gangs– particularly on X, the social media platform he owns.After his meddling put off many in Europe, a lucrative EV market, Tesla’s Chinese competitor BYD outsold the Austin-based company on the continent for the first time ever in April, according to a report from Jato Dynamics, which supplies automotive industry intelligence.“This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway said to his co-host, veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher. “Tesla was a great brand.“He’s alienated his core demographic.”The federal job and spending cuts attributed to Musk stem from his involvement leading the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) during Trump’s second US presidency, which began in January. Musk landed the role after his super political action committeedonated$200m to Trump’s successful run in November to return to the White House after he lost the 2020 election as the incumbent.Opinion polling since hassuggestedstrong disapproval of the work Musk has done for Trump, including some research showing a majority of voters dislike the way the businessman and Doge have dealt with federal government employees in particular as the so-called “department” slashed jobs.Toward the end of April, Tesla was reporting a 71% dip in profits – and, on an earnings call with Tesla investors, Musk said he would start pulling back from his role at Doge beginning in May.Musk said his work getting the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done” and therefore his “time allocation to Doge will drop significantly”.One nonpartisan research group, the Partnership for Public Service,estimatedin late April that about $160bn in cuts touted by Doge were on track to cost roughly $135bn.Explore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskMarketing & PRTeslaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The fight kicked off when the governmentlaunched a consultationinto regulating artificial intelligence with itsown “preferred” outcome: letting AI companies steal copyrighted work by default unless the owners of that work “opt out”. But opting out is impossible to do without AI transparency. The planis a charter for theft, since creatives would have no idea who is taking what, when and from whom.When the government stoops to a preferred outcome that undermines the moral right to your work and income, you might reasonably be angered. As Elton Johnsaid last weekend: “The government have no right to do this to my songs. They have no right to do it to anybody’s songs, or anybody’s prose.” His is just one voice among the thousands of British creators who are crying foul.My colleagues and I from all sides in the House of Lords have acted where the government has refused, adding emergency transparency measures to the legislation – thedata (use and access) bill– that is passing through parliament. Our amendment would allow existing copyright law to be enforced: copyright owners would understand when, where and by whom their work was being stolen to train AI. The logic being that if an AI firm has to disclose evidence of theft, it will not steal in the first place. These measures, voted for in ever-increasing numbers by lords from all parties – and notable grandees from the government’s own backbenches – werevoted downby a government wielding its significant, if reluctant, majority.But the Lords’ resistance did finally bring the secretary of state for technology, Peter Kyle, to the dispatch box on Thursday. Here, hebewilderingly admittedthat “much content has already been used and subsumed by AI models, usually from other territories and under the current law” – meanwhile taking out the Lords’ provisions that would prevent that very theft. He mentioned his love for Kate Bush, one of more than 400 people, along with Paul McCartney and Ian McKellen, whosigned a letterto the prime minister asking for a change of policy. But his policy resolutely remained unchanged. No transparency, no timeline and no help for creatives.Again, this week, the government missed its chance to get this right. To support one of our greatest industrial sectors, which provides2.4m jobsandcontributes £126bnand a whole lot of joy to the UK’s four nations. Not one MP from any side came to the government’s rescue. On the contrary, Kyle was subjected to a barrage of interventions that expressed an emergency he was failing to deal with. As one MP told me afterwards: “One of our greatest industrial sectors is on fire and ministers are having a picnic on the lawn with the arsonists.”With its enormous majority, the government will be able to bully its way to victory on any given bill. But a win for the government is a catastrophe for the creative industries and Britain’s indigenous AI economy (which, incidentally, has been critical of the government’s approach for the way it favours the larger US players).Britain’s creative industries embody our history, they hold our shared truth and they tell our national story. A nation that gives away its capacity to tell its own story is a fragile place indeed. But the fight isn’t over yet – the data (use and access) bill returns to the Lords on 2 June.Beeban Kidron is a film director and crossbench peer in the House of LordsExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionLabourMusic industryKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

That includes any information about historical or current events that goes against the Chinese Communist party’s official narrative.The researchers began looking into the topic after internet users in Henan reported that websites accessible in other parts of China were inaccessible in their province. They found that millions of domains that were not blocked by China’s centralised firewall were at some point inaccessible in Henan.By buying servers from internet cloud providers, the authors tested the flow of internet traffic from locations within Henan. They tested the internet’s top 1m domains daily between November 2023 and March 2025, with a gap of several months in 2024. The results showed that the Henan firewall blocked nearly 4.2 million domains at some point during the research period, over five times more than the roughly 741,500 domains blocked by China’s national firewall.The domains that were specifically blocked in Henan were mainly from business-related websites. There have been several finance-related protestsin Henan in recent years, which the researchers speculated could be the reason for the additional controls on access to information about the economy being controlled.In 2022, thousands of people in Henantook part in several demonstrationsafter they were blocked from withdrawing cash from their bank accounts. The crisis escalated when protesters reported that their mobile health codes, part of the pandemic control measures in place at the time, had turned red, preventing them from travelling or entering buildings. Five officials were later punished for abusing the health code system to quell the protests.Other parts of China have also been subjected to enhanced internet controls. In July 2009, following deadly ethnic riots, the Chinese government imposed aninternet blackoutin Xinjiang, a region in western China home to the Uyghur minority, that lasted 10 months. Since then, the use of the internet in Xinjiang has been much more tightly monitored than in the rest of the country. Online activities in Tibet are also strictly controlled.The emergence of a regional censorship regime in Henan is unusual because it is not a region of China that is normally considered especially restive by the Chinese authorities.The researchers could not determine if the enhanced controls were imposed by the local authorities in Henan or the central government in Beijing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) recentlyunveiled new surveillance toolsthat can monitor people who use virtual private networks, software that allows people to circumvent the internet firewall. The MPS’s research institute also showcased a tool that it claimed could monitor accounts on Telegram, a messaging app. The tool has already collected more than 30bn messages, the institute claimed.Mingshi Wu, the lead author of the Henan study, who uses a pseudonym to protect their identity, said: “On the one hand, AI could be leveraged to create more sophisticated, adaptive, and efficient censorship and surveillance tools. On the other hand, AI also enables new opportunities for those seeking to understand and circumvent censorship. For example, AI can assist in developing more agile testing tools for detecting censorship.”The Henan Cyberspace Affairs Commission could not be reached for comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaCensorshipAsia PacificInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Halton knew she couldn’t let it end up in landfill.View image in fullscreenJacquard looms use punchcards – an early form of code – to guide the lifting and lowering of threads.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The Guardian“It was my day off and I got up, jumped out of bed and just went down there,” Halton says.The loom was the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere, and one of only a handful in the world, bought for the university’s Brunswick campus in the early 2000s, soon after Halton started teaching there. It “elevated what you could do as an artist”, she says. Students enrolled just to have access to it. International artists visited especially to weave on it. It became integral to Halton’s creative practice.Art school in Australia: amid the cuts and closures, what could the future look like?Read moreWhen she arrived at campus that October morning, ready to “chain myself to that tree”, the only other person there was the man coming to decommission it.“He disconnected it in front of me,” Halton says. “It felt like taking a family member off life support.”Others felt the same. Word spread that the loom was headed for the skip and a ramshackle collective of weavers, teachers, students and alumni hashed out a plan to save it. They paid a sympathetic technician a case of beer to disassemble it safely, hired a trailer from a service station to transport it and squeezed the whole thing into a former student’s lounge room while they tried to find it a more permanent home.One member of that collective, a textile artist, Daisy Watt, says the episode felt like “a perfect snapshot of the state of everything” aboutthe way higher education treats fine arts and crafts: where valuable tools and increasingly rare skills are condemned by, as Halton says, “a decision at the end of a spreadsheet”, while community groups and guilds with scant resources do their best to salvage the remnants.The warp and the weftThe loom’s clunky name belies its significance. Traditional Jacquard looms used punch cards – slips of cardboard with rows of holes, an early form of code – to guide the lifting and lowering of vertical (warp) threads, as fabric is assembled, thread by thread, across the horizontal (weft). This ARM AG CH-3507 loom could be operated by computer or by hand, enabling complete control of every thread, making the design possibilities endless.View image in fullscreenWatt and technician Tony de Groot work together to restore the loom.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianWatt has “a very special affinity” with the loom. It isn’t just the time she spent working on it at RMIT, or that it sat in her home for months after it was rescued. She’s also been using her coding skills – self-taught – to update its electronics. It’s as though technology is lapping back on itself, given that Jacquard punch cards inspiredthe basis of modern computing.“We normally think of craft in isolation from technology but it’s just this gorgeous, messy thing,” Watt says. “A piece of effective craft technology based on making something beautiful.”Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsAt the time the loom was bought, textile design at RMIT was taught as a stream within a diploma of arts – a course that “people would relocate their whole lives for”, according to a teacher, Lucy Adam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

This dispensed with a traditional curriculum and focused instead on job-oriented “units of competency” determined by industry and subject to strict oversight.Federal and state governments claimed the reforms were necessary to streamline qualifications and weed out subpar training providers. Teachers and trade unionists argued they would diminish education and result in systematic de-skilling, whittling down what the labour theorist Harry Braverman called “conscious and masterful labour” to the performance of “simple and ignorant tasks”.The testimonies of textile design teachers at RMIT suggest that, despite their best efforts otherwise, this is exactly what occurred.View image in fullscreenDe Groot looks through instructional literature that was salvaged with the device.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianThe course became “extremely dry and lowest common denominator”, Adam says. Resources were throttled and student contact hours cut by more than half. Despite the drawcard of the loom, there was no longer time to properly teach students to use it. Halton incorporated it into students’ work where she could, doing the setup, pack-up and maintenance herself.Adam, whosemasters thesisinterrogated the impact of the changes to vocational education, says that for trades that are simultaneously technical crafts and creative arts – textile design, ceramics, cookery, metalsmithing, woodworking and others – a checklist of competencies is “not really the point”.“It’s a really old-school rote way of teaching, unless you’re an incredibly skilled teacher and can work around the blandness of it,” she says.An artist and teacher, John Brooks, also rues the narrowness of the course structures. For example, one unit’s assessment requirements include describing the process of turning a computer on and off. “So much energy is spent on compliance that the actual core skills we’re teaching are collateral damage,” he says.Adam once had a student who described the training package as akin to “filling out a visa application over and over again”. “That just made me really sad,” she says. “Where is the mastery? Where is that deep skill?”View image in fullscreenThe loom’s new home in Ballarat.Photograph: Stuart Walmsley/The GuardianIt’s a decline not restricted to Tafe. Ella*, a third-year fine arts student at the University of Tasmania, tells Guardian Australia that there are no classes there beyond first year in 3D mediums including ceramics, which is her focus, or furniture, sculpture or time-based media. There are no art history classes either.“It’s really affecting how developed students’ knowledge is of the contemporary arts scene,” Ella says. Her lecturers try to adapt the courses as much as they can to “freshen it up”, she says – but students desperately need a better technical and theoretical foundation.Prof Lisa Fletcher, from the University of Tasmania’s arts faculty, says the university understands the importance of the arts, strives to provide “a strong and sustainable offering” for students, and is keen to to hear feedback as the department prepares for a regular review of its fine arts degree.Crafting the futureThe loom is now in a loading dock in Ballarat, an incubator space for which the rescue collective pays peppercorn rent. The city has pledged to maintain and nurture rare and endangered crafts. Some have nearly been lost: leadlighting, for example, wasan almost-extinct tradein Australia until a small group of artists revived it, lobbying hard for years to bring it back into the Tafe system and establishing a course at Melbourne Polytechnic. But it is an exception to the rule.Looms with a view: weavers give ancient craft a modern twistRead moreWatt and the other weavers hope the loom will eventually be accessible for people to work, teach and create on again. As Brooks says, the less these skills are practised, the fewer places there are to learn them, “the more chance we have of losing them”.A spokesperson for RMIT says the university decommissioned the loom because it needed upgrading, and that it was obliged to give students access to “reliable, modern equipment” that would prepare them for their entrance to the workforce. Meanwhile, the space the loom inhabited is now occupied by a military-funded textiles project. The rooms require a security clearance to enter. At the end of last year, RMIT closed enrolments for its certificate four in textile design, after the state government ended subsidies for the course.But there is a glimmer of hope. Adam didn’t give up. She proposed a new diploma, which has just been approved. And she’s not the only person at the university trying to maintain space for her craft, even as that space keeps shrinking. At the time of writing, the university was about to take delivery of a new piece of equipment: smaller, less sophisticated but still a $100,000 computer-controlled Jacquard loom.* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsAustralian educationCraftAustralian universitiesTextile artVictoriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It might not look like Britain’s cutting edge but North End, a pedestrianised high street lined with the usual mix of pawn shops, fast-food outlets and branded clothing stores, is expected to be one of two roads to host the UK’s first fixedfacial recognitioncameras.Digital photographs of passersby will be silently taken and processed to extract the measurements of facial features, known as biometric data. They will be immediately compared by artificial intelligence to images on a watchlist. Matches will trigger alerts. Alerts can lead to arrests.According to the southLondonborough’s most recent violence reduction strategy, North End and nearby streets are its “primary crime hotspot”. But these are not, by any measure, among the capital’s most dangerous roads.Its crime rate only ranks as 20th worst out of the 32 London boroughs, excluding the City of London. The plan to install the fixed cameras later this summer for a trial period is not an emergency initiative. North End and nearby London Road could be anywhere.Asked about the surveillance, most shopkeepers and shoppers approached on North End said they had not heard of the police plans, let alone the technology behind it.To some, the cameras will be just another bit of street furniture to go alongside the signs announcing 24-hour CCTV and urging safe cycling. That, some say, should be cause for alarm. Others point to surveys that suggest the public, fed up with a rise in crime, is broadly on side.Police forces started to trial facial recognition cameras in England and Wales from 2016. But documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) and police data analysed byLiberty Investigatesand shared with the Guardian, provide evidence of a major escalation in their use in the last 12 months. No longer a specialist tool, it is quietly becoming an everyday part of the police arsenal.Police forces scanned nearly 4.7m faces with live facial recognition cameras last year – more than twice as many as in 2023. Live facial recognition vans were deployed at least 256 times in 2024, up from 63 the year before.Forces are imminently expected to launch a roving unit of 10 live facial recognition vans that can be sent anywhere in the country.Meanwhile civil servants are working with the police to establish a new national facial recognition system, known as strategic facial matcher. The platform will be capable of searching a range of databases including custody images and immigration records.“The use of this technology could become commonplace in our city centres and transport hubs aroundEnglandand Wales,” according to one funding document drafted by South Wales police submitted to the Home Office and released by the Metropolitan police under FoI.Campaigners liken the technology to randomly stopping members of the public going about their daily lives to check their fingerprints.They envision a dystopian future in which the country’s vast CCTV network is updated with live facial recognition cameras. Advocates of the technology say they recognise the dangers but point to the outcomes.This week David Cheneler, a 73-year-old registered sex offender from Lewisham, in south London, who had previously served nine years for 21 offences, was sentenced to two years in prison for breaching his probation conditions.A live facial recognition camera on a police van had alerted officers to the fact that he was walking alone with a six-year-old child.“He was on [the watchlist] because he had conditions to abide by”, said Lindsey Chiswick, the director of intelligence at the Met and the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead on facial recognition. “One of the conditions was don’t hang out with under 14-year-olds.“He had formed a relationship with the mother over the course of a year, began picking the daughter up at school and goodness knows what would have happened if he hadn’t been stopped that day, he also had a knife in his belt. That’s an example of the police really [being] unlikely to remember the face and pick the guy up otherwise.”It will be powerful testimony for many – but critics worry about the unintended consequences as forces seize the technology at a time when parliament is yet to legislate about the rules of its use.Madeleine Stone from the NGO Big Brother Watch, which attends the deployment of the mobile cameras, said they had witnessed the Met misidentify children in school uniforms who were subjected to “lengthy, humiliating and aggressive police stops” in which they were required to evidence their identity and provide fingerprints.In two such cases, the children were young black boys and both children were scared and distressed, she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“And the way it works is that the higher the threshold the less effective it is at catching people.” Stone added. “Police will not always necessarily want to use it at those settings. There’s nothing in law that requires them to use it at those settings. The idea that the police are being able to write their own rules about how they use it is really concerning.”A judicial review has been launched by Shaun Thompson from London, with the support of Big Brother Watch, into the Met’s use of the cameras after he was wrongly identified by the technology as a person of interest and held for 30 minutes as he was returning home from a volunteering shift with Street Fathers, an anti-knife group.There is also the risk of a “chilling” effect on society, said Dr Daragh Murray, who was commissioned by the Met in 2019 tocarry out an independent studyinto their trials. There had been insufficient thinking about how the use of these cameras will change behaviour, he said.“The equivalent is having a police officer follow you around, document your movements, who you meet, where you go, how often, for how long,” he said.“Most people, I think, would be uncomfortable if this was a physical reality. The other point, of course, is that democracy depends on dissent and contestation to evolve. If surveillance restricts that, it risks entrenching the status quo and limiting our future possibilities.”Live facial recognition cameras have been used to arrest people for traffic offences, cultivation of cannabis and failure to comply with a community order. Is this proportionate?Fraser Sampson, who was the biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner for England andWales, until the position was abolished in October 2023, is now a non-executive director at Facewatch, the UK’s leading facial recognition retail security company which provides systems to companies to keep shoplifters out of their shops.He can see the value in the technology. But he is concerned that regulation and methods of independent oversight have not caught up with the pace at which it is advancing and being used by the state.Sampson said: “There is quite a lot of information and places you can go to get some kind of clarity on the technology, but actually, when, where, how it can be used by whom, for what purpose over what period of time, how you challenge it, how you complain about it, what will happen in the event that it didn’t perform as expected? All those kind of things still aren’t addressed.”Chiswick said she understood the concerns and could see the benefit of statutory guidance. The Met was taking “really quite small steps” which were being reviewed at every stage, she said.With limited resources, police had to adapt and “harness” the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence. They were well aware of the potential “chilling effect” on society and its ability to change behaviour, and cameras were not deployed at protests, she added.“Is it going to become commonplace? I don’t know”, Chiswick said. “I think we just need to be a bit careful about when we say [that]. I can think of lots of potential. Like the West End? Yeah, I can see that being, you know, instead of doing this static trial we’re doing in Croydon, we could have done it in the West End. And I can see a different use case for that. It doesn’t mean we’re going to do it.”She added: “I think we’re going to see an increase in the use of technology, data and AI increasing over the coming years, and on a personal level, I think it should, because that’s how we’re going to become better at our jobs. But we just need to do it carefully.”Explore more on these topicsFacial recognitionPoliceSurveillanceArtificial intelligence (AI)CrimeUK civil libertiesEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It used AI and turned in fake citationsButler Snow faces sanctions after lawyer cites false case law defending against inmate who says he was stabbed 20 timesNicholas Chrastil in Birmingham, AlabamaSat 24 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 15.31 EDTShareIn less than a year and a half, Frankie Johnson, a man incarcerated at the William E Donaldson prison outside Birmingham,Alabama, says he was stabbed around 20 times.In December of 2019, Johnson says, he was stabbed “at least nine times” in his housing unit. In March of 2020, an officer handcuffed him to a desk following a group therapy meeting, and left the unit, after which another prisoner came in and stabbed him five times.In November of the same year, Johnson says, he was handcuffed by an officer and brought to the prison yard, where another prisoner attacked him with an ice pick, stabbing him “five to six times” as two correctional officers looked on. According to Johnson, one of the officers had actually encouraged his attacker to carry out the assault in retaliation for a previous argument between Johnson and the officer.In 2021, Johnson filed a lawsuit against Alabama prison officials for failing to keep him safe, rampant violence, understaffing, overcrowding and pervasive corruption in Alabama prisons. To defend the case, the Alabama attorney general’s office turned to a law firm that for years has been paid millions of dollars by the state to defend its troubled prison system: Butler Snow.State officials have praised Butler Snow for its experience in defending prison cases – and specifically William Lunsford, head of the constitutional and civil rights litigation practice group at the firm. But now the firm is facing sanctions by the federal judge overseeing Johnson’s case after an attorney at the firm, working with Lunsford, cited cases generated by artificial intelligence – which turned out not to exist.Revealed: Oregon spent funds meant for addiction services on prosecutors and police gadgetsRead moreIt is one of a growing number of instances in which attorneys around the country have faced consequences for including false, AI-generated information in official legal filings. A database attempting to track the prevalence of the cases hasidentified 106 instancesaround the globe in which courts have found “AI hallucinations” in court documents.Last year, an attorney was suspended for one year from practicing law in the federal middle district of Florida, after acommittee foundhe had cited fabricated AI-generated cases. In California earlier this month, a federal judgeordered a firm to pay more than $30,000 in legal feesafter it included false AI-generated research in a brief.At a hearing in Birmingham on Wednesday in Johnson’s case, the US district judge Anna Manasco said that she was considering a wide range of sanctions – including fines, mandated continuing legal education, referrals to licensing organizations and temporary suspensions – against Butler Snow, after the attorney, Matthew Reeves, used ChatGPT to add false citations to filings related to ongoing deposition and discovery disputes in the case.She suggested that, so far, the disciplinary actions that have been meted out around the country have not gone far enough. The current case is “proof positive that those sanctions were insufficient”, she told the lawyers. “If they were, we wouldn’t be here.”During the hearing, attorneys with Butler Snow were effusively apologetic, and said they would accept whatever sanctions Manasco determined were appropriate. They also pointed to a firm policy that requires attorneys to seek approval when using AI for legal research.Reeves attempted to take full responsibility.“I was aware of the limitations on use [of AI], and in these two instances I did not comply with policy,” Reeves said. “I would hope your honor would not punish my colleagues.”Attorneys with Butler Snow were appointed by the Alabama attorney general’s office and are being paid by the state to defend Jefferson Dunn, the former commissioner of the Alabama department of corrections, in the case.Lunsford, who holds the contract with the state for the case, said that he had begun conducting a review of prior filings to make sure that there weren’t more instances of false citations.“This is very fresh and raw,” Lunsford told Manasco. “The firm’s response to this is not complete yet.”Manasco said that she would allow Butler Snow to file a motion within 10 days to explain what their process will be for addressing the problem before making a decision regarding sanctions.The use of the fake AI citations in the case came to light in relation to a scheduling dispute in the case.Attorneys with Butler Snow had contacted Johnson’s attorneys to set up a deposition of Johnson, who is still in prison. Johnson’s attorneys objected to the proposed dates, pointing to outstanding documents that they felt they were entitled to prior to Johnson being deposed.But in a court filing on 7 May, Butler Snow countered that case law mandated Johnson be deposed expeditiously. “The Eleventh Circuit and district courts routinely authorize incarcerated depositions when proper notice is given and the deposition is relevant to claims or defenses, notwithstanding other discovery disputes,” they wrote.The attorneys listed four cases ostensibly backing up their assertion. It turns out they were all made up.While some of the cited cases resembled citations for real cases, none of them were relevant to the issue before the court. For instance, one was for a 2021 case entitled Kelley v City of Birmingham, but according to lawyers for Johnson, “the sole existing case styled as Kelley v. City of Birmingham that Plaintiff’s counsel could identify was decided by the Alabama Court of Appeals in 1939 regarding the resolution of a speeding ticket”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionEarlier this week, lawyers for Johnson filed a motion pointing out the fabrications, and suggested they were the product of “generative artificial intelligence”. They also found another apparently fabricated citation in a prior filing related to a dispute over discovery.The very next day, Manasco scheduled a hearing to determine whether the Butler Snow attorneys should be sanctioned. “In the light of the seriousness of the accusation, the court has conducted independent searches for each allegedly fabricated citation, to no avail,” she wrote.In a declaration to the court, Reeves said that he had been reviewing the filings that were drafted by a more junior colleague, and wanted to include citations for what he “believed to be well-established points of law”.“I knew generally about ChatGPT,” Reeves wrote, continuing that he put in a search for supporting case law he needed for the motions, which “immediately identified purportedly applicable citations for those points of law”. But in his “haste to finalize the motions and get them filed”, he “failed to verify the case citations returned by ChatGPT through independent review in Westlaw or Pacer before including them”.“I sincerely regret this lapse in diligence and judgment,” Reeves wrote. “I take full responsibility.”Cases in which false AI content is making its way into legal filings appear to be increasing in frequency, said Damien Charlotin, a Paris-based legal researcher and academic who is attempting totrack the cases.“I’m seeing an acceleration,” he said. “There are so many cases from the past few weeks and months compared to before.”So far, though, the response by courts to the problem has been remarkably lenient, Charlotin said. The more serious sanctions – including large fines and suspensions – tend to come when lawyers fail to take responsibility for their mistakes.“I don’t expect it to last,” Charlotin said. “I think at some point everyone will be on notice.”In addition to the Johnson case, Lunsford and Butler Snow have contracts to work on several expansive civil rights cases against the Alabama department of corrections – including one brought by the United States Department of Justice under Donald Trump in 2020 that identifies many of the same wide-ranging systemic issues that Johnson pointed to in his suit, and alleges that the conditions violate the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.The contract for that case alone was worth nearly$15m over two yearsat one point.Some Alabama lawmakers have questioned the amount that the state is spending on the firm to defend the cases. But it doesn’t appear that the mistake this week has shaken the attorney general’s confidence in Lunsford or Butler Snow to continue with their work, so far.On Wednesday, Manasco asked a lawyer with the attorney general’s office, who was present at the hearing, whether or not they would stick with Butler Snow.“Mr Lunsford remains the attorney general’s counsel of choice,” he responded.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Law (US)US prisonsAlabamafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, should be alive, and justice must be meted out to their assailant. This brazen act of political violence in the heart of the nation’s capital only underscores the obvious: all this violence – whether it’s in Washington DC, Gaza, Jenin or Israel, and whether it’s by bullet, bomb or forced starvation – all of it must end, and it must end immediately.What weknowso far is that shortly after 9pm on Wednesday evening, a gunman approached a group of four people who were departing an event at the Capital Jewish Museum that had been hosted by the American Jewish Committee. (It’s beenreportedthat the event “focused on bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza through Israeli-Palestinian and regional collaboration”.) The suspected gunman, identified in media accounts as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, had been seen pacing outside the museum when hespottedthe group of four leaving the building. He opened fire on the group, fatally wounding two at close range. He then entered the building, where he was detained by event security. He can be seen onvideoin handcuffs and chanting “free, free Palestine”.A biblical hatred is engulfing both sides in the Gaza conflict – and blinding them to reason | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreNeedless to say, criminal actions such as this reprehensible murder do not advance the cause of Palestinian liberation or anyone’s freedom. This stupid and horrific act must be opposed not only for its immorality but also because the world needs to focus on pressuring Israel to end its blockade of Gaza and allow the flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory before tens of thousands of Palestinians – including14,000 babies, according to the United Nations – die from forced starvation in the coming days.Already, the Israeli government is using the murder to wag its finger at Israel’s critics and deflect from its own actions. In a press conference in Jerusalem, Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister,blamed“leaders and officials of many countries and international organizations, especially from Europe” for inciting violence against Israel, incitement which he said led “in a direct line … to this murder”.Millions are stating their loud opposition to Israeli actions without resorting to murderous political violence. In fact, that’s exactly what we must doThe idea that European leaders are directly responsible for this heinous murder is nothing short of ridiculous, of course. But it does show how nervous the Israeli government is about a new wave of criticism being directed against its assault on Gaza. Earlier, on 21 May, the UK development minister, Jenny Chapman,toldthe BBC that Israel is “using hunger as a weapon of war” in Gaza. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, alsocalledIsrael’s planned military escalation in Gaza “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive”, and Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, recently stated that Britain “cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve” and that levels of suffering in Gaza were “utterly intolerable”.In addition, the UK has suspended free trade talks with Israel, and EU foreign ministers are reviewing the European Union’s trade agreement with Israel over its blockading of food, water, medicine and other needed supplies for Gazans’ survival. While these actions are welcome, they’re also a case of too little, too late. And despite a partial UK arms embargo on Israel, the UK government stillapproved licensesfor £127.6m of military equipment to Israel, more than the combined total for 2020-23,accordingto the group Campaign Against the Arms Trade.In other words, the violence is intensifying, enabled in part because those who arm Israel continue to do so. It’s also expanding, and not just on to the streets of Washington DC. Consider what happened on the same day as the tragic killing of the Israeli embassy staffers. A delegation of diplomats representing 31 countries were on an official mission to observe the humanitarian situation in the West Bank city of Jenin, which has also been undersustained assaultby Israel for the last 120 days. The Israeli military shot towards the delegation of diplomats, and later claimed the group had “deviated from the approved route”.Once upon a time, to be a diplomat meant you were afforded a certain amount of security, but those were times when we, perhaps naively, believed there were rules governing warfare. What do we have now? Shots fired as diplomats carry out their jobs. Food used as a weapon of war. Young embassy staffers assassinated in public.This killing must end. We all know it, just as we know that it must start with an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the return of all captives taken on 7 October and after, and the full resumption of aid into Gaza. The details of what happens in the medium and long term, for both Israelis and Palestinians, can and must be forged through honest dialogue and not by the mass displacement and extermination of the Palestinian people.But rather than heeding this lesson, we will likely witness in the days ahead an all-out push to discredit those who oppose Israel’s military campaign, which has been labeled a genocide by multipleinternationalhuman rights organizations, among many others. Israel’s foreign minister has already started. In his press conference, Sa’arclaimedthat it was the talk that Israel is committing “genocide, crimes against humanity and murdering babies” that “pave[s] the way exactly for such murders” as happened in Washington DC.But genocide, crimes against humanity and babies being killed are all happening, and millions are stating their loud opposition to Israeli actions without resorting to murderous political violence. In fact, that’s exactly what we must do, and we must do that now, louder and stronger than ever, before this violence grows and spreads further, consuming even more innocent lives in its monstrous path.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionWashington DCGun crimeUS crimePalestinian territoriesWest BankIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

No sir. Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, the Tennessee lawmaker explained that he is a red-blooded American male who does not “drink out of a straw” because “that’s what the women in my house do”. And no self-respecting man wants to be like the women in their house, do they? Yuck.Why did Burchett feel the need to tell us all what he likes to put in his mouth? Because the Fox News hostJesse Wattershas some very strange ideas about masculinity and, back in March, came up with “rules for men”. These include: don’t drink soup in public, don’t cross your legs, don’t drink from a straw (it makes your lips purse in an “effeminate” manner), don’t drink milkshakes and “don’t wave simultaneously with two hands”.The Fox News host is so proud of these rules that he now has his producer running around Washington DC asking lawmakers their thoughts on Watters’ guide to masculinity. Burchett, as we’ve seen, is fully on board. So is the Missouri senator Josh Hawley, who has written abook called Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs.Meanwhile, in a stunning example of ClickHole’s “The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Great Point”meme, Ted Cruz seemed a little more dubious. “Jesse Watters has rules for men,” Watters’ producer told Cruz. “He said men should not have male best friends. What do you think?” Cruz replied: “Jesse needs a friend.” I think he needs a lot more than that.The livestreamed killing of an influencer could be femicide – a misunderstood crisis | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWatters has said his rules for men are just a bit of fun. But it all starts to become a little less funny when you look at the massive impact Fox has on the US, and how influential Watters himself is.More than 4 million peopletune into Watters’ primetime show and the man is constantly reinforcing toxic ideas about gender. Watters, for example, has suggested that he doesn’t really think fathers are responsible forraising their daughters. “When you raise a son, you are responsible for that son,” Watters said last year. “It’s not like raising a daughter, it’s different.” He’s also denigrated fathers wholeave work earlyto spend time with their children.Watters, who is on his second marriage, to a much younger woman who was anassociate producer on his showat Fox News, also has some very disturbing ideas about how to approach women. Want to know how he courted his second wife? He’sboasted on TVthat he let the air out of her car tires. “She couldn’t go anywhere. She needed a lift. I said: ‘Hey, you need a lift?’ She hopped right in the car,”Watters laughed. (He laterclaimed it was a joke.) By the way, Watters was still married at the time. Fox News likes to style itself as a paragon of family values, but these are the values it promotes.Again: Watters isn’t just some kook with a niche show. A large body ofresearchshows that Fox NewsshapesAmerican politics. There is a direct line between the misogyny and rigid gender roles amplified on Fox News and laws that treat women as nothing more than incubators and walking wombs. There’s a direct line between the sort of attitude towards women that Watters espouses and the fact that abrain dead womanin Georgia is being kept alive to carry out her pregnancy because of the state’s abortion ban. Watters may say his rules for men are just a bit of fun, but his viewers are gulping it all down. Obviously without a straw.Pregnant news anchor stays on air during laborIt’s funny how Watters seems to think “effeminate” is a slur when you’ve got women like the local news co-anchor Olivia Jaquithcalmly delivering her newscasteven after her labor contractions began. “I’m happy to be here and I’ll stay on the desk for as long as I possibly can,” Jaquith said. “But if I disappear, that’s what’s going on.”Number of US white nationalist groups falls as their views go mainstreamA newreportby the Southern Poverty Law Center found a 5% drop in hate and extremist groups in 2024.The Guardian reportsthat this “can be attributed to the fact that many feel a lesser sense of urgency to organize, because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education and society in general”.‘World-first’ gonorrhoea vaccine to be rolled out in England and WalesIt’s been described as a “landmark moment for sexual health”.Famous men’s toxic fandoms have become a tool for punishing womenSocial media has given Darvo (the “deny, attack, reverse victim and offender” manipulation tactic used by abusers) a whole new dimension,writes the Guardian’s Tayo Bero. “[P]owerful people now have an army of rabid fans ready to do that work for them.”New clinical guidance calls for pain relief during IUD insertionTikTok may haveplayed a rolein this:over the last few years, women have been recording the experience of getting an intrauterine device, sharing it online and discussing how their pain is taken seriously by doctors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an Instagram post shared earlier this year, O’Connor said her pain and concerns about her healthhad been dismissed. “Not one doctor took me seriously. Not one doctor did the scans or blood tests I begged for whilst crying on the floor in agony,” O’Connor wrote. “Instead, they dismissed me. They gaslit me, told me it was nothing, made me feel like I was overreacting … They REFUSED to listen. One even told me that it’s ‘all in my head.’ And now? Now the cancer has spread.” Studies have shown thatwomen’s pain is often underestimatedby doctors.Indigenous Amazon tribe says New York Times smeared them as porn addictsThe Marubo tribe of the Javari valley is seekingmillions of dollars in damages.Leading genocide experts are unequivocal that what is happening in Gaza is genocideEarlier this week Ipublished a pieceasking: “What did you do during the genocide in Gaza?” I received some heartwarming responses from readers (thank you!) but also snarky comments denying that a genocide is taking place. I want to stress that I’m not just throwing a serious word around for the fun of it; multiple leading experts on genocide have said that this is the majority opinion. “Can I name someone whose work I respect who doesn’t consider it genocide?” said Raz Segal,an Israeli genocide researcher based in the US. “No.”Protesters in Georgia targeted with gender-based reprisalsPolice in Georgia (the country, not the US state) are increasinglyusing gender-based violence“including sexist insults, threats of sexual violence and unlawful and degrading strip searches” against peaceful protesters, Amnesty International said in a newbriefing.Read my investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Susan WalshIn July 1996, Susan Walsh, a 36-year-old freelance writer and sex worker, left her house in New Jersey to make a phone call. She never came back. Walsh is presumed dead but neither her body nor her killer have been found – in part because of institutional misogyny. I’ve been looking into Walsh’s disappearance for five years and, on behalf of her half-brother, successfully sued the Nutley, New Jersey, police to get the records released.

The Guardian notes that a “roo-peat offender” called Irwin recently escaped for the second time in Durango, Colorado. Eventually the police came up with a “kanga-ruse” to catch him and he jumped into the arms of a “big farm boy” officer. Since Irwin has been sent back to somewhere he seems to want to leave, I’m not sure if this is a hoppy ending.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFox NewsThe Week in PatriarchyGenderFar right (US)HealthUS healthcareIsrael-Gaza warWomencommentShareReuse this content"

Where was the concern for her life while she was here?Sat 24 May 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 14.13 EDTShareABlack pregnant woman who was declared brain dead back in February isstill being kept alive on a ventilator, because of a Georgia law that prohibits abortions beyond six weeks. If this sounds like the stuff of speculative fiction, it’s because there’s literally a Handmaid’s Taleepisodeabout this. And while the TV show based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 book may have gotten many things right about the soul of authoritarianism and a violently patriarchal society, living that reality is even more sickening.Fetus of brain-dead Georgia woman kept alive due to abortion ban is growing, says familyRead moreAnyone who thinks this is about the life of Adriana Smith’s child is fooling themselves. This is the state, boundary testing to see how far they can take their efforts to have full reproductive control over American women, and gauging how much the American public is willing to tolerate.It isunclearwhether Smith’s baby will survive, and according to the family, Emory University Hospital is keeping her on life support because the hospital is afraid of contravening Georgia law. Meanwhile, state lawmakers and abortion rights opponents have put their hands up and don’t want to be associated with the optics of this tragic mess. In a mid-May press release, the Georgia attorney general’s officeclarifiedthat the state’s anti-abortion law does not require Smith be kept alive.“There is nothing in the Life Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” the statement reads. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”So who is responsible for this? And are we to believe thatGeorgialawmakers are powerless to stop this hospital’s apparent misreading of the state’s own rules? Even if the latter were the case, the damage from conservatives’ anti-abortion crusades and the ensuing legislative crackdown has already been done. Hospitals such as Emory have no incentive to weigh the ethical implications of their actions because they have the spirit of the law to consider, regardless of how lawmakers try to play semantic tricks to get around their own culpability.When it comes to public opinion,some have arguedin favor of this nightmare based on the fact that Smith is brain dead, and so keeping her alive doesn’t actually “harm” her. What’s next? Women in comas being impregnated because … why not? Vulnerable women being lobotomized and used as incubators? Should the state be able to forcefully impregnate every woman whose body is capable of carrying a baby? Where does it stop?Meanwhile, all the conservative posturing over the sanctity of human life is easily dismantled when you consider the fact that banning abortions effectively issues a death sentence to any pregnant person who is at risk. And what about the issues that took Smith to the hospital to begin with? Her family says she went to see doctors at around eight weeks pregnant with intense headaches, and received medication the same day. The next day, she woke up gasping for air, and was rushed back to the hospital where doctors discovered blood clots in her brain. Smith was declared brain dead shortly after.Black women are themost likelyto die during childbirth, are most likely to experience pregnancy-related complications and regularly see their issues dismissed and minimized when they seek help. Was Smith’s life not valuable when she was here? Why is the body of a brain dead woman receiving more care than she did when she was alive?Stories like Smith’s are also a grim reminder of how desperate society is right now to reduce women to their reproductive capacity. From draconian laws that force women to endure life-threatening pregnancies, to the trad-wife and pronatalism renaissance, it’s clear that women’s ability or willingness to carry babies is the political and ethical lightning rod of our time, and the “life” of a foetus has become a convenient tool to wield in the efforts to control women’s bodies.But Black women have always known this. And Smith’s story is deeply triggering for a demographic that has not only seen the worst of what childbearing in the US medical system is like, but also has a history of being used as test dummies for gynaecological experimentation.“We didn’t have a choice or a say about it,” Smith’s mother, April Newkirk,said. “We want the baby. That’s a part of my daughter. But the decision should have been left to us – not the state.”It should go without saying that a person’s agency should be respected whether they’re conscious or not, but we’ve gotten so used to seeing women’s bodies as a means to a political or economic end that ideas like this no longer register as what they are – utterly unconscionable.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionGeorgiaReproductive rightsAbortionGenderHealthUS healthcarecommentShareReuse this content"

They are uneven and craggy, the kind I’d admire at the base or walls of a very old building. Other women are simultaneously working. We aren’t quite doing it together, but we are building something, these friends and I, alongside one another, and we are each working towards the same sort of object.It is a chimney out of stones. And as we build more, lifting, hefting and scraping these stones into place, the thing becomes more obvious: we are each building a hearth. It is the centre of the house. The heart of the home.We are each building a hearth and a chimney.I am about to sign a contract and set up a dwelling that is 6 metres long and 2.5 metres wide: a “tiny house” to some folks. To others, a shack, a shed, a cabin. The contract and set-up of this tiny dwelling will cost me every penny I have from a divorce which saw a house divided. Yet I feel more powerful and sovereign than ever. My daughter is thriving. I’m clawing my way out of a dark night of the soul, but I’m also empathetically aware of the precarity and vulnerability of the larger portion of the population. I am now part of that, too: people trying to creatively, inexpensively create homes for themselves and their children.Tracy is about to begin chemo and she’s also getting evicted. Welcome to Australia’s housing crisisRead moreWomen and children disproportionately bear the burden of the housing crisis in Tasmania (where I live) and in Australia. Women are experiencing homelessness at rapidly increasing rates, and according to the census from June 2024, there are 1.2 million one-parent families in Australia, 78% of which are single-mother families. While I do hold particular empathy for mothers of young children who are trying to make themselves a home, I advocate for solutions to all types of housing crises. Rent is one of the main reasons I am choosing to move and “live tiny”; to minimise my overheads and be more available for my daughter.I’ve come to the conclusion that the concept of security is a fantasy we sell ourselves. Adaptability is a much wiser approach. I thought I had a family home for me, my husband and my child, and that got blown out of the water with head-spinning rapidity. The concept of living in a dwelling which I own, which sits lightly on the land and can be moved if necessary: land that is owned by a woman, with whom I have good communication, and with whom I have a contract, is my next experiment.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThere is a network of tiny house dwellers in this part of the world, all of whom are figuring out ways to live with creativity, sovereignty and affordability. It is a cultural underground; a resistance, a community-led solution to the housing crisis. These folks are interested in living lightly on the earth, gardening, serving their community and generally making the world a better place. They are also able to think of these things because they aren’t drowning in debt. Some of them are creatively working tobuild their own tiny homes, so that they can have a safe sanctuary in which to rest, sleep, cook and live, sometimes with children, sometimes with partners and sometimes solo.If I hadn’t seen women in my community creating these homes, I don’t know if I would have taken the leap. When you’ve become a single mum the way I have, with the small amount of money I have; when you know you won’t be leaving anytime soon, due to the complexities of co-parenting, you decide that tiny house dwelling is not wrong by any means. In fact, it is perhaps the most moral of choices.It is the system, which can frequently and confusedly treat these abodes as “against council regulations”, that desperately needs to change. In news that surprises no one, those who already have wealth and resources benefit, while those without will not. And it’s clear to anyone willing to look outside of individualist systems of capitalism, which funnel money towards the top: the banks are talking about loans and mortgages in order to continue making money for the banks. They aren’t interested in helping people havehomes. This system wants people in debt, which is directly antagonistic to autonomy and wellbeing. A “lack of housing supply” is a lie, because “housing” can come in many forms, if only it would be allowed to do so.Tiny houses are a huge movement in the US and New Zealand; they fly under the radar in Australia because, legally, they must. And if tiny houses are somehow seen as a threat to wealth-holding landlords, that too, is ridiculous: people like me aren’t going to buy a house anyway. Living in a tiny house isn’t stopping me from getting a mortgage and becoming a wage-slave for the rest of my life. Living in a tiny house is preventing me and my toddler from becoming homeless, while some portions of the population hoard holiday rentals and penthouse apartments (and should be taxed accordingly).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Between the hours of dawn and midnight, with a few lactic minutes in between, I am a feeding machine for a new person.And it is this, perhaps, that has led to my somewhat strange new eating habits. Pregnancy may traditionally be the time associated withcravings and aversions– the old cliches of sardines and jam, coal and creosote, bread and crackers. But here, in my postnatal feeding frenzy, I’m eating nettles by the handful. I am chomping on sticky weed. I have beenbiting the heads off dandelions(bitter – like really serious dark chocolate) and sucking the nectar from inside honeysuckle. This recent chlorophyll gala has, of course, coincided with England’s greatest month: May. Some of us love the look of May, some of us enjoy the smells. But for me, this year, the greatest heady, verdant, leaf-rich pleasure of my life is to eat May by the bushel.The sheer amount of dilute dog pee I’m ingesting must be through the roof, I suppose, but I don’t really care. The number of edible plants and flowers in Britain right now is dazzling. My latest love is a plant called hedge garlic. Or, if you’re in the Midlands like me, Jack by the hedge (he sounds like the villain from a Grimms’ fairytale, or the kind of singer-songwriter we all regrettably slept with in our twenties).Alliaria petiolata, to give it its Latin name, is a wild member of the brassica family and has a thin, whitish taproot scented like horseradish, triangular-to-heart-shaped leaves and small white flowers. Friends, once you see it, it’s everywhere. You can eat it from towpaths and bike lanes and public parks if, like me, you’re not embarrassed to be seen bending down beside a lamp-post and pulling up your lunch.View image in fullscreenHedge garlic growing in Suffolk.Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianIf you don’t live in the sort of lush, woodland world where wild garlic covers the ground like concrete then hedge garlic is a fantastic alternative; the taste is oniony, garlicky and even a little mustardy. Of course, like absolutely everything that grows wild, it has a toxic lookalike in the form of lily of the valley. In fact, once you start Googling, pretty much everything edible seems to have a potentially dangerous twin, from mushrooms to flowers to roots. Buttercups are extremely poisonous, as are daffodils.So please make sure you are referring either to an expert or a very well illustrated book before you start to chow down on your local undergrowth, and it’s a good idea to wash anything you pick in salt water to get rid of insects, as well as dog wee. But to be extra safe you could stick to these few, extremely identifiable friends: nettles (both the leaves and the seeds), dandelions, clover, sticky weed (that plant that people squished against your school jumper when you were little and is sometimes known as cleavers) and daisies. A friend of mine serves up slices of bread and butter topped with daisies to her small children as a mind-bending treat. She is yet to be burned as a witch.Of course, I am in the incredibly privileged position of living somewhere in which food is, to a greater or lesser degree, widely available. I am able to boil rice and buy eggs and stock up on strawberries because I am a relatively wealthy woman living in a country that has not quite, as yet, cut itself off entirely from global food markets. I am not eating undergrowth out of necessity, and for this I am grateful every day.Am I worried about the sewage in our rivers and the microplastics in our soil and the pesticides leaking into our ponds? Of course I am. But it is also true that Britain right now is a lush and emerald salad bar that I cannot hold back from. Pesto, bhajis, soups, salads, pizzas, pakoras, fritters, sauces – I’m putting these plants in everything. I’m literally mowing down the greenery around my house, munching through the stalks and leaves like a small, pink horse in a pair of plimsolls and I don’t care who sees. Because my iron levels are up, my skin is good and it’s all gloriously free.Just imagine what I’ll be like when the apples and blackberries arrive.Nell Frizzell is a journalist and authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What is it doing to us as a society?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettI thought we all believed in a collective responsibility towards children. This terrible conflict has made me question thatSat 24 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 10.27 EDTShareIhave seen images on my phone screen these past months that will haunt me as long as I live. Dead, injured, starving children and babies.Childrencrying in pain and in fear for their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers. A small boy shaking in terror from the trauma of an airstrike. Scenes of unspeakable horror and violence that have left me feeling sick. Sometimes I skip over these photos and videos, afraid perhaps of what I will see next. But more often than not, I feel compelled to bear witness.I know I am not alone. So many of us, privileged in our comfort and safety, have watched the suffering of the children ofGazathrough social media, images mixed in jarringly with ads and memes and pictures of other people’s children, smiling and safe. It renders the horror even more immediate: these could be your kids, or mine, or any kid you know, but for the lottery of birth.Many thousands of people have used their voice to speak up for these children and their families, whether in writing to politicians, making donations to charities and aid organisations, or taking to the streets. Yet this war on children continues, and there is an overwhelming sense of powerlessness to help them. It is hard to imagine how it can get any worse, but worse it gets with news this week that14,000 babiesare suffering from severe acute malnutrition, according to the UN. The reason is deliberate starvation: famine as a weapon of war or, as Human Rights Watch puts it, a “tool of extermination”.This overarching sense of impotence when confronted with unimaginable horror is creating a mass sense of moral injury – a form of profound psychological distress that can happen to people when they are forced to act, or indeed not act, in ways that are in direct opposition to their values or moral code. I first came across the term when speaking to medical professionals who were developing PTSD during the pandemic. Doctors, nurses and care workers were in anguish at not always being able to provide treatment to patients who so desperately needed it, owing to a lack of equipment, resources and leadership, and the sheer volume of seriously ill people.Nowhere will this kind of distress be more keenly felt than in Gaza itself. For the medical professionals and aid workers there, sadness, guilt, betrayal, even, that you can’t help everyone must be a daily reality. When it is your job to help, to feed, to treat, being unable to do so is a profound trauma.And for Gaza’s parents it must be torture of the most excruciating degree to see your child crying in hunger and be unable to feed them. I often think of the babies who were in the neonatal intensive care unit under bombardment – that photograph of the newborns in al-Shifa hospital laid seven to a bed to keep them warm and alive. I wonder about their mothers, many of whom will have been forced to give birth without proper pain relief and equipment. Where are they now? How many of them survived? And what did that do to the medics who tried so hard to save them?But I have also started to wonder about the impact of moral injury by proxy and at scale. I am in no way putting it on a par with what people on the ground are experiencing. But that feeling of powerlessness and, as an extension, complicity: what does it do to those around the world who feel what is happening is wrong? What is the impact of witnessing so much profound suffering – even through a screen – and feeling unable to act or to force others to act?I now understand why my mother stopped watching the news after I was born. It was because she couldn’t bear it. I too have felt a temptation to look inwards since having my son, to cocoon us in the warmth and safety of our privileged lives. But the internet means it’s more difficult to detach – the news runs in continuous parallel to our lives, eroding borders. There have been many nights when I have put my son to bed, his belly full, his pyjamas clean and soft, and I have cried silently for these other children who are not being tucked up in warm beds. In the early hours when he would wake for milk, all I had to do was go to the fridge and pour him some, and we would sit, listening not to the sounds of bombs but to the birdsong that seemed to fill the skies.The contrast between his safety and their peril feels to me obscene. Could that be a kind of moral injury? There is something about being in the daily company of a little person – their innocence, their vulnerability, their silliness, their loving nature – that makes the pain of any other child feel like a profound affront. But I know you don’t have to be a parent to feel horror at what is being inflicted on Gaza’s children in the most visceral way. I believe – or at least I used to – that it is ingrained in us, as humans, to feel a collective responsibility towards children, and that this collective responsibility can extend beyond borders.What did you do during the genocide in Gaza? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreFeeling powerless in the face of such egregious injustice can result in a loss of trust or faith, not just in governments and institutions but also in the moral order of the world, and its ability to protect children. I wonder what the impact of this will be: will it, as certain politicians no doubt hope, result in a numbness that presents as indifference? Traumatic events can result in a lack of affect – millions more people should be marching and raising their voice – but they can also be channelled into righteous anger.I certainly feel a profound loss of faith. Something I felt to be true about humanity – that people are fundamentally good, that we owe it to children to protect them – has shifted because of this conflict. I walk around with a feeling of heaviness that I cannot seem to shake. Thousands of miles from Gaza, I am changed by the past 18 months. I have learned that, for some people, compassion for children has political limits. What does one do with that terrible knowledge once it sits inside you like a leaden stone? I don’t seem be able to find an answer.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The fight kicked off when the governmentlaunched a consultationinto regulating artificial intelligence with itsown “preferred” outcome: letting AI companies steal copyrighted work by default unless the owners of that work “opt out”. But opting out is impossible to do without AI transparency. The planis a charter for theft, since creatives would have no idea who is taking what, when and from whom.When the government stoops to a preferred outcome that undermines the moral right to your work and income, you might reasonably be angered. As Elton Johnsaid last weekend: “The government have no right to do this to my songs. They have no right to do it to anybody’s songs, or anybody’s prose.” His is just one voice among the thousands of British creators who are crying foul.My colleagues and I from all sides in the House of Lords have acted where the government has refused, adding emergency transparency measures to the legislation – thedata (use and access) bill– that is passing through parliament. Our amendment would allow existing copyright law to be enforced: copyright owners would understand when, where and by whom their work was being stolen to train AI. The logic being that if an AI firm has to disclose evidence of theft, it will not steal in the first place. These measures, voted for in ever-increasing numbers by lords from all parties – and notable grandees from the government’s own backbenches – werevoted downby a government wielding its significant, if reluctant, majority.But the Lords’ resistance did finally bring the secretary of state for technology, Peter Kyle, to the dispatch box on Thursday. Here, hebewilderingly admittedthat “much content has already been used and subsumed by AI models, usually from other territories and under the current law” – meanwhile taking out the Lords’ provisions that would prevent that very theft. He mentioned his love for Kate Bush, one of more than 400 people, along with Paul McCartney and Ian McKellen, whosigned a letterto the prime minister asking for a change of policy. But his policy resolutely remained unchanged. No transparency, no timeline and no help for creatives.Again, this week, the government missed its chance to get this right. To support one of our greatest industrial sectors, which provides2.4m jobsandcontributes £126bnand a whole lot of joy to the UK’s four nations. Not one MP from any side came to the government’s rescue. On the contrary, Kyle was subjected to a barrage of interventions that expressed an emergency he was failing to deal with. As one MP told me afterwards: “One of our greatest industrial sectors is on fire and ministers are having a picnic on the lawn with the arsonists.”With its enormous majority, the government will be able to bully its way to victory on any given bill. But a win for the government is a catastrophe for the creative industries and Britain’s indigenous AI economy (which, incidentally, has been critical of the government’s approach for the way it favours the larger US players).Britain’s creative industries embody our history, they hold our shared truth and they tell our national story. A nation that gives away its capacity to tell its own story is a fragile place indeed. But the fight isn’t over yet – the data (use and access) bill returns to the Lords on 2 June.Beeban Kidron is a film director and crossbench peer in the House of LordsExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionLabourMusic industryKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

But this time, I’m on their sideMoya Lothian-McLeanA high court dispute over a south London park shows the limits of private interests encroaching on public spaceSat 24 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 11.24 EDTShareAgrassy south London oasis erupted into a turf war this week. From Monday, visitors to Brockwell Park would have seen calling cards left by both sides. The provocation? A sturdy 3-metre-high boundary fence, encircling large swathes of the 50-hectare (125-acre) stretch that has been designated for music festivals this summer. Daubed on the structure were signs of discord:graffitied messagesin stark white lettering. “You fucked our park,” read one. “We fucked your wall.”Brockwell is now the hottest front in a conflict that has started to rear its head in the capital every summer. A week ago, it made the front pages in the form of a bombshellhigh court rulingagainst Lambeth council. The authority responsible for the park lost a case brought by Protect Brockwell Park (PBP), a group oflocal residents and park userswho argued that the council hadnot obtained the proper planning permissionsfor the back-to-back run of events scheduled to take place behind the boundary fence.It had used permitted development rules to rubber-stamp the events quickly, on the basis that they would only block off a substantial section of the park for 28 days. In reality, this wasn’t true, the residents argued. Factoring in erecting and dismantling festival infrastructure, it was actually more like 37 days where public park access would be restricted. The council should have been subjecting these events to a full planning application process – including public consultation – before granting approval. The judge found in PBP’s favour.Yet the festivals remained on the park’s summer schedule. As the date of the first event – Wide Awake, an alternative music shindig headlined by the rappers Kneecap – approached, Lambeth rushed through a certificate of lawfulness, allowing for public comment, and on Friday the festival opened its gates.The clash has captured public imagination, igniting a now well-worn narrative of nimbys versus nightlife. The PBP campaigners are being cast by some as meddling, out-of-touch “gentrifiers”, akin to affluent folk moving into a buzzy area and immediately lobbying for a beloved local pub or scrappy independent music venue to shut down because they want to retire to bed by 10pm. As a left-leaning millennial, I’d normally be inclined to side with the festivals. After all, we must protect our endangered cultural sphere from further attacks.Except what is happening here isn’t so clear-cut. Over the past few years, the city’s parks have become increasingly available for hire. TheLondonsummer day festival, as in other cities, is now an institution and there has been a proliferation of commercial events concentrated in certain large parks: Victoria, Finsbury and Brockwell are top of the list.Behind every “summer series” of festivals is an unhappy residents’ group.People who live near to and rely on these green spaces feel they are being shut out of public land that should be for all of us to benefit from, in favour of what they perceive to be commercial interests.Many of the large events being objected to are not even remotely close to resembling the accessible, community space of a local pub.Two of the park’s festivals, Field Day and Mighty Hoopla, are run by the promoters Superstruct, owned by parent company KKR, an investment firm. Artists have pulled out of Field Day citing KKR’salleged links to Israel. (KKR has declined to comment on these allegations, referring the Guardian to Superstruct’s statement that after its acquisition it remains “independently run”. Field Day has put out a statement saying it “stands with the people of Gaza”.)The heart of this issue seems to be how cash-strapped councils are becoming increasingly beholden to commercial interests to the detriment of the public. A weekend festival that welcomes 50,000 people can expect to raise about £500,000 for local authorities. Councils argue that this money goes back in the public purse, allowing them to continue funding free community events such as Lambeth’s beloved Country Show, though there doesn’t seem to be much transparency over exactly how much cash is raised or where it is allocated.But when you strip away the jargon, what is essentially happening is the privatisation of local parks. As well as concerns about the long-term impact on ecology, campaigners point out this often takes place in boroughs where many don’t have access to private green space. In Lambeth, with its many flats, this counts for60% of households. Adding salt to the wound for residents is the lack of opportunity for public interjection. In the neighbouring borough of Southwark, the council conducts consultations for events proposed for local parks. Residents have their say, andrecently indicated their approvalfor a music festival in Southwark Park. No high court battles there.As for arguments about gentrifiers shutting down fun, they seem rather misplaced. The objectors are local people; the festivals are the interlopers, attracting tens of thousands of mostly young revellers who swoop in for the day (with daily ticket prices for the events starting from about £80), have their fun, then leave again. Complaints about such events may have once been the preserve of the nimby contingent, but the movement has grown in line with the increasing length and impact of the park takeovers.That’s not to say the festivals have no benefit. They provide secure summer work in an increasingly unstable industry. Small businesses – such as food trucks serving attenders – obviously do well out of them. And they are undoubtedly popular – there’s a reason big companies have snaffled up events such as Field Day and Mighty Hoopla. But the involvement of such corporations has kicked an existential threat into high gear.The ultimate issue is the way that private interests have managed to successfully position themselves as the gatekeepers of possibility. That cultural events can only happen if we sell off public space. That we can’t maintain local services without money from private equity. That we should just accept the routine privatisation of taxpayer-funded assets as the price of having a good time. Is this a model we want to entrench?London may be ground zero, but what is happening here is likely to be the bellwether for cities across the UK in the coming years. Very few want to see the festivals scrapped altogether. But a worrying precedent is being set. One long-term Brixton resident, himself a dedicated organiser of parties, reluctantly conceded to me recently: “I’d welcome smaller, better-managed events that don’t disrupt access or damage the park and that benefit the borough. But this current situation has become unbearable.”Moya Lothian-McLean is associate editor at Mill MediaExplore more on these topicsParks and green spacesOpinionMusic festivalsFestivalsLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

But in the British city where slaver Edward Colston’s statue was pulled down, I found cause for optimismSat 24 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 03.20 EDTShareIt has been five years since George Floyd, a Black man who lived in Minneapolis, wasmurderedby Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. The killing, captured in a distressing 10-minute video that quickly flooded social media timelines, sparked something that felt like an international revolution: protests took place across the world, forcing countries and cities to reckon with their present and historical treatment of Black people.In Britain, protests reached fever pitch when activists in Bristoltoppled a statueof Edward Colston, the slave trader and deputy governor of the Royal African Company, and hurled it into the harbour. Bristol, once a major slave-trading port, had maintained a veneration of Colston that was increasingly divisive. The statue in particular had been a key focus of tensions: attempts to add a second plaque acknowledging Colston’s role in the slave trade werefrustrated in 2018. For many Bristolians, the direct action provided a moment of long-overdue relief.Colston now resides, supine, inside the city’s M Shed museum. Visiting earlier this month, I felt that this had been a worthy outcome: he no longer towers over Bristolians in a kind of psychological domination, yet nor has he simply been made invisible. The statue has been historicised within that specific moment in 2020 andcontextualised against a timelineof Bristol’s connections with transatlantic slavery. It is one of the key successes of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.But five years on, the bigger questions still remain. What are the real, felt consequences of that moment? Speaking to people visiting Colston, I asked a 70-year-old white man called David, who has lived in Bristol since 2011, if he felt that the toppling and theBlack Lives Matter movementhad made a real difference to the city. He told me that there is “a lot more to be done to change the way people think”, and then informed me that, about half a mile away, outside Colston’s former plinth, was a hard-right demonstration organised by the UK Independence party. They were calling for mass deportations and lamenting the supposed “destruction” of the city by “far-left thugs”. I went to check it out.Though they were outnumbered by counter-protesters, the hard-right protesters were there – making grimly visible that there is clearly still a battle under way for the heart, soul and mind of this country. Yemi, a 22-year-old counter-protester carrying a Jamaican flag, told me: “I actually think the BLM protests fuelled even more hate on their side – because they saw how many people were against racism and Colston, it caused more hate in them and they felt more entitled to protest. So I don’t think much has changed.” She also thought that the statue should have been left in the water. “The harbour is where they brought us in from. I thought it was very fitting for it to stay there.”It is easy to look back at 2020 and feel fascinated, aggrieved, even fooled. I find it quite strange to reflect on. The murder of an African American man led to a kind of “gold rush” in Britain and in the US, where, particularly in the cultural sector, money and opportunities were handed to Black people as an apology for decades of neglect and underinvestment.Many of these gains and commitments have petered out. In the US, the Black portraiture “boom” of 2020 has come to ascreeching halt, with Black art now going unsold. In the UK, the number of Black writers publishing books hasplummeted since 2020. While dispiriting, this could have been foreseen, considering how opportunistic and cynical the industry can be. A Black man named Patrick Hutchinson landed a book deal simply for having carried a far-right protesterover his shoulder. There were only 152 days between the event and the book’s publication. I have not heard much from Patrick since then. You can buy the book for £2.15 on Amazon.View image in fullscreenPlacards from a BLM demonstration in Manchester are left next to a mural of George Floyd, 6 June 2020.Photograph: AlamyMuch of the response also became unfocused to the point of parody and distraction. Politicians “taking the knee” became an internet meme. Theremoval of episodesfrom shows such as The Mighty Boosh and The Dukes of Hazzard from streaming platforms was an overreaction that mostactivists did not ask for, and seemed to take oxygen out of the movement.Disputes over pop culture began to obscure the target of the protests: police violence, and how it disproportionately affects Black people in the US, the UK and all over the world. Five years on, this problem is still very much with us.In March, Julian Cole, who had been in a minimal conscious state after being violently arrested by Bedfordshire police officers in May 2013,died in hospitalat the age of 31. To date, the Crown Prosecution Service has not brought charges against the officers responsible,citing a lack of evidence. In 2022, it was revealed that, two years previously, a 15-year-old Black school girl in Hackney,Child Q, had been strip-searched by police and that racism was likely a contributing factor. The disciplinary hearing for a gross misconduct case has beendelayed until this year. Last year,there was indignationafter Metropolitan police officer Martyn Blake was acquitted of the murder of an unarmed Black man, Chris Kaba, who he shot dead in 2022. (Blake is set to face agross misconduct hearing.)Meanwhile, any progress made since 2020 to address the institutional racism of police forces in Britain has come under significant political pressure.Campaigners have been frustratedat the stalling of police reform, with Black-led organisations at a Stephen Lawrence Day conference calling on the government to complete a follow-up to the 2023Casey report, to set about a real transformation of the force. There has also been a sinister inversion of reality after last summer’s “race riots”: the swift justice response led to themyth of “two-tier policing”, suggesting that police are more heavy-handed with white, far-right protesters, despiteactual evidence of biasagainst young Black people.It’s easy to forget but the Colston Four, who toppled the statue, were subject to a gruellingtwo-year legal battle(they were acquitted by a jury of criminal damage).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The dynamic of an uprising quickly reaching its peak before petering out and even triggering a backlash can feel disappointing. But it is typical for the course of history that great moments of social upheaval are eventually cannibalised or absorbed into a status quo, with participants left feeling thwarted, or even sheepish about their optimism. As my Guardian colleague Nesrine Malik wrote of theperceived failure of the Arab spring: “What the Arab spring came up against was a universal conundrum – how to convert the forces that demand equality into those that deliver it.”The muscle memory of those protests was certainly built on to the benefit of mobilising pro-Palestinian marches across the country in the wake of the onslaught against Gaza. And longer-term projects are unfolding – BLM UK’sinvestment of £350,000into funding Black-led organisations is a real success, while several organisations that had historically profited from enslavement pledged reparatory action in the wake of Colston’s toppling, including the Guardian, with itsLegacies of Enslavementprogramme.At M Shed inBristoltoo, I was reminded of the importance of planting those small seeds of change. A small white child walking out of the museum asked his mother what “I can’t breathe” meant, as he read it on one of the placards surrounding Colston. His mother began to calmly explain everything that happened in 2020. We might lament the lack of true progress in racial justice, but we can be confident that a blueprint for education, resistance and mobilisation has been established by that moment. Next time, and there will be a next time, we will be better primed to go. With the challenge of a surging global right, it will be more urgent than ever to retain focus and not repeat mistakes.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the Guardian.

Better than our grandparents’ generation, who swept their complicity under a thick rug of silence. Better even than our parents,whose revoltsin the late 1960s rarely led to any serious reckoning with the legacy of the Holocaust.Born in the late 1980s, my generation learned about Auschwitz early on. We visited former concentration camps and studied the Nazi regime not as an alien aberration, but as a warning: this is how democracies die. Today, with the far-right AfD and ethno-chauvinismon the rise, that warning has never felt more urgent.In the run-up to the Germangeneral election in February, tens of thousands marched against the AfD. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency hasclassified the partyas rightwing extremist, and the new government has pledged to keep cooperation with it toa bare minimum.And yet much of the resistance feels hollow. Germany’s vigilance against revisionism is selective at best. This week, the winners of Germany’s most highly endowed journalism award – the Herbert Quandt Media prize –were announced. The awardexplicitly celebratesthe legacy ofHerbert Quandt, an early SS supporter who played a central role in the Naziwar economy. Quandt oversaw battery plants where thousands were abused, exploited – and killed.With his father, Günther Quandt, Herbert Quandtsubjected up to 57,500 peopleto slave labour in battery factories. The Quandt family fortune was built on these crimes. Günther Quandt acquired Jewish-owned companies after Nazi expropriations (so-called Aryanisations). Herbert Quandt personally helped secure some of those deals and oversaw the planning of a satellite concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. After the war, he continued to work with hardline former Nazis from Joseph Goebbels’ propaganda ministry.The Quandts were “denazified” through a superficial process that in effect shielded them from any serious accountability. In 1960, Herbert Quandt became BMW’s largest shareholder. Today, his heirs, Germany’s richest family, control BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and hold major stakes in the country’s chemical and tech sectors.In 2007, aTV documentaryexposed the extent of the family’s Nazi-era crimes. The Quandts responded by commissioningan independent studythat revealed even deeper entanglements with the Nazi regime. Gabriele Quandt, Günther Quandt’s granddaughter, later said herfamily had been “wrong”to avoid confronting the truth about its Nazi past for so long.But journalists from Die Zeit, Der Spiegel and Germany’s public broadcasterscontinue to line up for the prize – in effecthelping to whitewash the legacyof a figure who, even after the war, aligned himself with former Nazi propagandists once tasked with silencing the free press. What does that say about German media organisations? About the stories Germany tells about itself – and the ones it refuses to tell?The annual award, founded in 1986, comes with a €50,000 prize fund. This year, it went to Die Zeit and three public broadcasters, selected from 230 submissions. That’s 230 journalists applying for an award named after a man who – in any just world – would have stood trial for war crimes. If the contenders had misgivings, they were apparently insufficient to keep them from applying.Nor does accepting the Quandt prize appear to carry any reputational risk in Germany, with even progressive outlets seeing the prize money as welcome support for quality journalism. This is not AfD-style revisionism, but it is a form of amnesia, cloaked in liberal respectability. The jury includes some of Germany’s leading media figures from titles as prominent as Handelsblatt and Axel Springer’s Bild and Welt.But this isn’t just a story about the Quandts. It points to a broader German refusal to confront the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide. Some of Germany’s wealthiest families – includingFlick,Porsche,BahlsenandStoschek– built their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labour. As the Dutch journalist David de Jonghas documentedin his book, Nazi Billionaires, most of them were seamlessly absorbed into West Germany’sso-called economic miracle. Many defend their legacies to this day – or, like the Quandts, use prizes toburnish their modern philanthropic standing.This kind of amnesia isn’t limited to boardrooms. Streets across Germanystill bear the namesof colonial administrators. In several cities, you can walk down Lüderitzstraße or Wissmannstraße – street names honouring men who helped orchestrate Germany’s genocide in today’s Namibia and brutal colonial campaigns across other parts of Africa. The German government stillrefuses to pay reparationsto the descendants of the Herero and Nama people, the primary victims of its genocide in Namibia – offering instead “development” aid packages negotiated not with the descendants of victims, but with the Namibian state.After the war, Germany rebuilt its international reputation on its policy of officially acknowledging its past crimes. But that reckoning is carefully curated – embraced when it flatters Germany’s self-image, ignored when it threatens personal gain or broader strategic interests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A few hours later, Wadephul stood at a press conference in Jerusalem andexpressed “understanding”of Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza.Friedländer, who had died days earlier aged 103, spent her final years warning against dehumanisation. The contrast could hardly have been starker.It’s easy to condemn the past when it costs nothing. Speaking out about enduring injustice or the atrocities of your allies takes more courage.Germany’s current approach to remembrance culture is selective and contradictory. The government relies on “historical responsibility” to refrain from challenging the Israeli government for its abuses in Gaza. Yet at home, the political and media class seems in denial about cultural patronage enabled by fortunes made possible by Nazi-era crimes.My argument is not about rebranding an individual media award. It is about the continued collective lack of accountability and transparency when it comes to the Nazi era. In the current political climate it is also about asking if postwar Germany’s “never again” promise retains its meaning, or is being reduced to a slogan, observed only when convenient.Hanno Hauenstein is a Berlin-based journalist and author.

We’re fortunate in that our local council, North Sydney, is very supportive of sustainability options,” he says, noting in particular council rebates for solar panels and batteries.“We realised we were eligible for a battery rebate from the state government [as well as] the North Sydney council rebates.”After researching the options he found out about technology that enables the allocation of power between multiple units behind the meter. The next step was to use a solar comparison website to assess the building’s solar and battery needs, as well as EV infrastructure requirements in the building’s basement.“Armed with that information, we ran a tender for solar and battery suppliers, chose a preferred supplier and installed a system that went live in December” he says.Plan your menu, get kids involved and be realistic: how to pack better school lunchesRead moreBuild up some capitalMcKay says that, in retrospect, the delays from lockdowns were a blessing as they allowed the apartment block time to build up its capital works fund (thereby avoiding the need for a special levy) and to understand the options better. “Since flicking the switch, we’ve generated 82% of our overall power consumption, although we share that in both directions with the grid.“As a result, we’ve had material decreases in our individual power bills and happy residents, whether owner occupiers or tenants.”Get the neighbours onboardOnce you’ve figured out which rebates you are eligible for, you’ll still need to navigate a careful path between your owners’ corporation, fellow apartment owners or occupiers and strata managers.Be prepared to come up against some resistance, as some owners may not be keen to front up the extra costs involved, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. But highlighting the longterm economic savings of the investment is a good strategy.Jeff Sykes from Solar Choice says the benefits can be enormous for apartment dwellers as they are often the people most in need of assistance with growing energy costs.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“Shared solar projects targeting the whole building also benefit renters who traditionally have been left out of solar projects,” he says.“The feedback once solar is installed is almost always overwhelmingly positive and these projects will improve the property values of all owners and deliver benefits to residents for 25 years.”Install a smart meterMcKay says the best way to bring neighbours along for the journey is to install a smart meter so that everyone can see how the power is being distributed. This also helps to keep up regular communication throughout the installation process.“It has made residents more aware of their power consumption, opening up more electricity retailer options for them,” he says.Ultimately, if you can help get everyone’s power bill down while reducing your carbon footprint, that’s a win for everyone.Share your tipsTell us hereYour responses, which can be anonymous, are secure as the form is encrypted and only the Guardian has access to your contributions.

It was an important stand by them. Australia could have proudly joined them. We didn’t.The powerful stand of the UK, Canada and France blazingly overshadowed a more subsidiarystatementsigned by 23 other countries – including our own – calling for a more fulsome reinstatement of humanitarian aid.The UK has spoken out against the ‘monstrous’ human catastrophe in Gaza. Why won’t Australia do more? | Donald RothwellRead moreBoth statements rightly condemned the utterly heinous attack by Hamas against innocent Israelis on 7 October and continued the calls we have all made since then for Hamas to release all remaining hostages. Ultimately, Hamas must and will be held to account.Notably, only one statement last week threatened to take “further concrete actions in response”, and it wasn’t the one we signed up to. On Wednesday, Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, described recent UN reports as “horrifying”.We often hear critics, or those lacking courage in the face of this humanitarian catastrophe, ask: what can a country such as Australia realistically do? They apply great energy to talk us all out of speaking up – doing so in a way that defies a proud legacy of energetic, critical global advocacy by our country.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLike many on my side of politics, I’m especially proud of the fact that Labor governments have a history of stubbornly defying the feeble-minded; willing to flex our middle-power muscle, even in the face of occasional rebuff.The former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke persistently campaigned against apartheid in South Africa. He marshalled others in the Commonwealth – including Margaret Thatcher – to keep pressuring South Africa. This included a determination by the 1985 Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) to ratchet up the use of sanctions to advance the cause.This was followed by a Labor foreign minister in Gareth Evans helping forge an agreement that brought a close to brutality in Cambodia and ushered in a peace that was celebrated the world over.Current circumstance demands conviction not reticenceAnd it’s worth remembering Paul Keating used his formidable personal advocacy to convince major powers to build up the role of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum: “I not only put Australia in an important place at the table, I wanted to be able to create the table itself,” he said. His other landmark achievement was reaching a security agreement with Indonesia, radically turning on its head a prevailing orthodoxy by stating we would obtain our security from within Asia, not outside it.Today, South Africa, a nation we supported to free itself from oppression, has now stood up to do likewise for others in their time of need, taking a case to the international court of justice alleging genocide in Gaza. While a final determination still hasn’t been made, the court’s interim ruling is suggestive of how we will reflect on this chapter in the future.Current circumstances demands conviction not reticence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UN has warned14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition are at risk of dying, on top of the tens of thousands of women and children already murdered during this conflict. One can not begin to fathom the fate of the thousands of young Palestinians orphaned as a result of the Netanyahu government’s conduct of its operations in Gaza.Two million Palestinians teeter on the brink of famine. Humanitarian workers trying to help them – such asour own Zomi Frankcom, killed by the Israel Defense Forces – have been wiped out in record numbers. Journalists trying to inform the rest of the world about this and other depravations have suffered the same tragic end.Right now, Australia can and should be doing more: for starters, we should be calling in the Israeli ambassador to Australia to express the unequivocal demand we share with other nations that the Israeli government must provide for the immediate freer, rapid flow of humanitarian aid, not the “basic” level currently permitted to trickle in.We should also prepare to significantly ramp up our contribution to the international humanitarian effort. Just as we have rightly seen fit to provide $1bn supporting Ukraine, we can lift our contribution to Gaza well above the $100m provided to date. This could include support for development for a children’s hospital in Gaza as called for byDr Mohammed Mustafa.And from now on we should signal we will unashamedly stand with friends and allies like the UK, France and Canada, not just condemning the Netanyahu government’s attacks on the innocent of Gaza – but preparing right now to extend targeted sanctions against those individuals directing a brutal campaign against Palestinians in Gaza, one that has staggeringly and repeatedly defied international humanitarian law.Australia has a proud tradition of refusing to be silent on the world stage when it comes to defending vulnerable and oppressed people. We can be emboldened by our legacy of doing so. Two million starving people in Gaza need all the help we can muster alongside others.Ed Husic is the federal Labor MP for Chifley in western SydneyExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsrael-Gaza warAustralian foreign policyLabor partyAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It was a very satisfying grownup decision, favouring a remarkable and utterly individual film-maker: the director and democracy campaigner Jafar Panahi, an artist who unlike any other director in the Cannes competition really has suffered, taken real risks for cinema and spoken truth to power – and endured arrest and imprisonment for his pains.Iranian director Jafar Panahi wins Palme d’Or at Cannes for It Was Just an AccidentRead moreHe has created a rich canon of work which has told the world about Iranian society and the Iranian mind with a subtlety and depth that we are never going to get from the TV news.Thirty years ago, his directing debut, The White Balloon, won Cannes’s Camera d’Or for best debut and now he has triumphantly carried off the biggest prize at Cannes, having won the main awards at many other European festivals.It Was Just an Accidentis another of his humane, sharp, witty, seductively oblique and deeply engaged dramas which reveal how political oppression and political resistance is embedded into the everyday fabric of Iranian life.In fact, it’s his most emotionally explicit movie yet, with an almost Hollywoodised premise: a garage mechanic has to repair a car belonging to someone who has just suffered an accident on the road and thinks he recognises him, a suspicion which causes him to reunite with a whole cohort of traumatised contemporaries. It’s the kind of political film which you might expect to see as a period piece, about a time and a place safely in the past. But no. It Was Just an Accident is happening right now.‘I think of those I left behind in prison’: Iran’s Jafar Panahi on life as a banned film-makerRead morePanahi has had the finger of theocratic disapproval wagged in his face for decades. In 2010 he was subjected to a six-year prison sentence and a 20-year film-making ban. In theory, his entire extraordinary career should have been mostly impossible.But through a complex combination of protracted appeals, samizdat secret film-making in his apartment and sneaking films out of the country on flash drives, he has given us marvellous and much acclaimed work.His Cannes prominence has made him, if not untouchable, then someone to be approached with caution, and the Iranian authorities are surely aware that Panahi and dissident Iranian cinema in general have (paradoxically) created international prestige for their country in a way nothing else could. At all events, we are always talking about film-makers showing “courage”. But for Panahi it really is true and this Palme is a wonderful victory for him.As for the other prizes, I was just a little conflicted. I was sorry that Juliette Binoche’s jury couldn’t find a way to recognise the remarkable film-making of Sergei Loznitsa, with hisfierce vision of the Stalinist 1930s in Two Prosecutors, or the wonderful style of the Spanish directorCarla Simón in Romería– though her day in Cannes will surely come.Joachim Trier’s big, heart-on-sleeve dramedy Sentimental Value, which won the Grand Prix (effectively the festival’s silver medal), was a crowd-pleaser, a critic-pleaser and a jury-pleaser. It is the story of an accomplished stage actor (played by Renate Reinsve) who is astonished to find on her mother’s death that the family home is still legally the property of her unmanageable old dad (Stellan Skarsgård), a failing movie auteur who abandoned his family but now wants to use it as the location for his new film and even cast his daughter in the lead role. I thought some of its effects were a little broad and self-indulgent but it really hit the spot with so many people at the festival.For the bronze medal, the jury prize, I have very mixed feelings.Mascha Schilinski’s rigorously composed generational German drama Sound of Fallingis an outstanding film which deserves its joint win.It shares this with Oliver Laxe’s Sirât, a strange, freaky, trippy tale of tragedy in the desert, about a father searching for his daughter; I didn’t go along with the saucer-eyed reverence for this film, which involved almost Pythonesque landmine explosions.My own preference for the top prize had beenthe Brazilian film The Secret Agent by Kleber Mendonça Filho; this is an amazing epic about a man challenging the system and trying to get out of the country with his son during the 1970s dictatorship before he can be killed.As it transpired, it got best director for Filho and best actor for the formidable Wagner Moura, who also plays the grownup son in the present – a stylish extra dimension to his performance that might well have clinched it for Binoche’s jury.The best actress prize (which so many thought would go to Jennifer Lawrence for her fascinating, almost Cassavetes-esque turn as the woman suffering postnatal depression inLynne Ramsay’s Die, My Love) in fact went to some of the most unshowy, almost self-effacing acting in the festival: Nadia Melliti, forthe queer Muslim coming-of-age drama The Little Sister.This was a film which perhaps did not hit it out of the park, but it was good to see the Cannes jury rewarding something other than obvious acting pyrotechnics. (My choice, for what it’s worth, was Yui Suzuki for the Japanese film Renoir, an excellent piece of work unfairly overlooked in Cannes.)But 2025 was Panahi’s Cannes. It’s been a long time coming.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalJafar PanahiIranFestivalscommentShareReuse this content"

Inside the debate sparked by London festival rowDiffering interpretations of public access rights are at heart of Brockwell case pitting campaign group against festival fansLanre BakareArts and culture correspondentSat 24 May 2025 08.03 EDTFirst published on Sat 24 May 2025 07.25 EDTSharePublic parks have been a cherished part of British life since the 19th century; for the Victorians they represented a “commitment to cultivate public good within the public realm”.But differing interpretations of this vision for municipal green space are at the heart of a debate over a very 21st-century issue: music festivals.This week, the row over mass music gatherings in Brockwell Park, southLondon, injected fresh impetus into some age-old questions: what are public parks for, who should have access to them, and for how long?On one side stand the thousands of festivalgoers who attend the events in south London. On the other is Protect Brockwell Park (PBP), the campaign group that counts celebrities such as Mark Rylance among their number. The latter won a high court victory a week ago against Lambeth council whose decision to grant festival organisers use of the park was deemed “irrational”.PBP’s argument is one of proportion.Festivalsare fine in principle, as long as there are not too many. But their critics have questioned whether a small but powerful group should be able to limit the enjoyment of so many.View image in fullscreenPeople walk past a high metal fence surrounding a temporary festival area in Brockwell Park, south London.Photograph: Carl Court/GettyThe author Emma Warren, who is attending the City Splash festival at the park on bank holiday Monday, noted that the high court verdict came in the same week that the supreme court ruled people hadthe legal right to wild camp on Dartmoor.“This is being billed as the need for collective space versus protection of nature,” Warren said. “But actually, I see it as part of a long-established pattern. This is about a small number of people trying to limit a larger number of people’s access to space.”For Jen Hawkins, of PBP, however, the ruling represents the laying down of a much-needed marker. “A few years ago they reached a kind of a happy medium whereby, yes, it annoyed a few people, but it was tolerable, and it wasn’t fencing off people from their precious green space,” she said. “I think this last year was a tipping point when the ground was completely trashed for the whole of spring and summer.”This weekend, thousands will attend the Mighty Hoopla festival in Brockwell Park, when Daniel Bedingfield will belt out his garage classicGotta Get Thru This. On Saturday, the chorus might just carry a bit more weight than usual for organisers whose resolve is being tested.The Brockwell Park row is taking place against a backdrop of rising costs for staging festivals, which has led to a record 72 events being postponed, canceled or having folded in 2024 as ticket prices soared.View image in fullscreenBrockwell Park on 21 May.Photograph: Carl Court/GettyDespite the challenges, the festivals persist. Wide Awake and the Mighty Hoopla are two of seven events taking place in Brockwell Park. Victoria Park, in Tower Hamlets, hosts All Points East and Lido; Gunnersbury Park welcomes several gigs, including the Smashing Pumpkins, the independent dance music festival Waterworks and Fearne Cotton’s Happy Place festival. While a series of concerts are taking place at Crystal Palace, including a sold-out show by Deftones and Weezer.Hawkins said PBP was not “anti-festival”. The group would like to have the Brockwell Park dates moved to later in the year so the park was accessible in summer, an ecological assessment of the impact the events, and the introduction of “fallow” years.John Rostron, the chief executive of theAssociation of Independent Festivals, said organisers already had to meet a long list of requirements to get licences. “You have to go through the local authority, which is a representation of the local community, to get a licence and meet all of the relevant health, safety, crime and disorder targets,” he said.View image in fullscreenJohn Rostron: ‘Not everyone is going to be satisfied.’Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“You can do all of that work but it doesn’t mean that every single person is going to be satisfied. We’re giving a lot of air time to the handful that are dissatisfied,” he said.Warren asked: “Is it a nuisance to gather and listen to music together, or is it a nuisance to complain about that behaviour? It strikes me that the idea that a small number of very opinionated and unelected people can stop collective and communal activity is very culturally specific. Globally, this is not normal.”The issue of who uses public spaces and for how long is not limited to the capital: in Liverpool there is a debate about Radio 1’s Big Weekend taking over Sefton Park in the city this summer.PBP said its campaign was about holding Lambeth council to account and claiming back space from the big companies that owned some festivals. The Mighty Hoopla was bought in 2023 by Superstruct, whose parent company was in turn bought last summer by the US private equity firmsKKRandCVC.Those who object to music events shutting off parks are branded nimbys. But this time, I’m on their side | Moya Lothian-McLeanRead moreSome acts have pulled out of Field Day, citing KKR’s holdings in Israel, while campaigners called for the event to “publicly distance itself” from the investment firm. Mighty Hoopla put out its own statement, which said it wished “to state our clear opposition to KKR’s unethical investments”.Hawkins argued that only “a tiny amount of money” was going back into the park, with much of it going to the companies. “They’re the real winners out of this.At present all the scheduled events will take place in Brockwell Park, after the council submitted a new application, but more legal challenges could emerge as the summer progresses.“I honestly do not know what’s going to happen next,” Hawkins said. “I’d like to think it really has set a precedent for future years, both for Brockwell Park and hopefully other public parks across the country, that councils can’t misuse their planning powers and get away with it.”Donatus Anyanwu, a Lambeth councillor and cabinet member for stronger communities, said: “Overall, we believe our events create an important cultural offer for our young and creative borough, while also enabling us to keep London’s biggest free community festival, the Lambeth Country Show, as a free and safe event.”Explore more on these topicsFestivalsAccess to green spaceMark RylanceLondonLocal politicsLocal governmentMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

But their joint adventures end in a friendship breakup, essentially because Craig is too weird. (Warning: mild spoilers ahead.)After losing his only pal, Craig becomes obsessed with him, and the film becomes a sort of Fatal Attraction for male friendship. Craig will stop at nothing, including violent crime, to restore the connection he briefly felt with Austin, or at least get revenge on him.Friendship review – Tim Robinson spirals in a darkly hilarious comedyRead moreIt’s all very funny – and, at least for this man, delightfully hard to watch. Craig worships Austin, who’s on TV, plays in a very loud band and knows secret passageways through the local sewer. But, as is Robinson’s trademark, Craig can barely function socially himself. He panics when the two hang out, constantly says the wrong thing, embarrasses himself on a guys’ night, and accidentally injures Austin and damages his home.As the comedianEddy Burback put it, the movie is “a true horror about how devastating it is to be a dude who can’t hang”.This, of course, applies whatever your gender. But here, the masculine rituals felt brutally resonant, dredging up buried feelings stretching from summer camp to bachelor parties: the moment when Craig can’t quite scramble up a ledge and needs Austin’s help; his total ineptitude at boxing; his belief that buying a drum set or showing the guys a tiny dagger he owns will somehow win their respect.Friendship comes amid what’s been described as a “friendship recession” among men. In 1990, 55% of men said they had at least six close friends; in 2021,the figure was 27%, and one in seven mensaid they had none. Researchers such as Richard Reeves havepointed to a huge gapbetween men and women when it comes to emotionally supportive friendships and the ability to share feelings. The film’s tagline plays on this much-discussed phenomenon: “Men shouldn’t have friends.”I feel like the message of the movie is: don’t try and make friends as an older manDevin Glass, moviegoerSo what do real-life men think of all this? I recently consulted a few after a screening of Friendship at the Vista Theater inLos Angeles, owned by noted man Quentin Tarantino. Perhaps unsurprisingly in a city that loves movies and feelings, the screening was packed on a Sunday afternoon. The crowd was fairly homogeneous in terms of age – mostly thirtysomethings – but mixed in terms of gender. The film, directed by Andrew DeYoung, generated plenty of conversation, as evidenced by the lingering crowd under the marquee afterwards.Jesse Amorratanasuchad, 38, said Friendship matched his experience of male friendship “to the Nth degree”. His male friend, Travis Francis, 30, felt similarly.View image in fullscreenOutside the Vista Theater in Los Angeles on 18 May 2025.Photograph: Matthew Cantor/Guardian“I think everybody wants to have other men in their lives,” Amorratanasuchad said, adding that it can be difficult. He and his wife, Emily Pando, 35, have been reflecting on the issue recently, particularly as they watch their nephews grow up. “It’s so difficult for men because they don’t have positive friendships and friend groups,” Pando said. “We were just talking about how amazing it is if somebody from gen Z or gen alpha makes it to a certain age without becoming an incel.”In one of the film’s most memorable moments, Austin’s friends gather for a beer, sharing their troubles and offering one another support before spontaneously breaking into a rendition ofGhost Town DJ’s My Boo(“at night, I think of you/I want to be your lady, maybe”). It’s a fantasy of what friendship can be. “I took that moment of them singing as what it is like being in female friendships, or even like a girls’ bathroom, which guys never get to experience – gassing each other up,” Pando said.Amorratanasuchad agreed: “You have to really muster up your courage to be like: ‘Yo, I like your outfit’ or ‘How are you actually feeling?’”Menspeak a different language, Francis said: “You give them shit, and they give it back.”It was particularly difficult to “break that barrier” with childhood friends, Amorratanasuchad said, but in a hopeful sign, friends he had met more recently were more able to “show up emotionally”. He and Francis had been friends for five years, apparently without resorting to felonies.Devin Glass thought the film had a more specific type of friendship in mind. “I think it was about men trying to spark up friendships later in life, which is really awful,” he said. “I feel like the message of the movie is: don’t try and make friends as an older man.”Glass is only 33 and appeared very socially competent, but still, said: “I related a lot.”His friend Chris Jobson, 32, said the movie was a little too extreme to fully relate to; he said a different Paul Rudd movie, I Love You, Man, felt like a “more real” depiction of male friendship.But their friend Spencer, 31, who preferred not to give his last name, didn’t buy the idea that the film had anything to do with its title. “That’s where it started, but I felt like it just evolved into a case study on psychosis,” he said. “I felt depressed half the time, and then just overwhelmed … I was so incredibly uncomfortable.”I heard similar stories of discomfort from other men, and I felt the same – but for the opposite reason. We’ve seen plenty of cringe comedy in recent years, but this was particularly difficult to take, even as I laughed along. My theory: it’s because, as absurd as Tim Robinson’s character was, he remained almost believable. There was a sense that I have spent my life trying not to be this very man, that sometimes I’ve come too close, that someday my so-called friends will find out that I really am just a Craig, a fake, secretly confused by the ways of my species and my gender in particular.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsMenLos AngelesWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Get stuck in!Rhik SamadderSat 24 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 24 May 2025 05.25 EDTShareSchopenhauer defined genius as someone who aims at a target the rest of us can’t see. Which raises a philosophical paradox – how do we know they’ve hit it? I was moved to such musings while watching this week’s pick, a singular piece of art that functions unlike anything else on TV, and calls the medium itself into question. No, it’s not Police Interceptors.In The Rehearsal (Monday, 10pm, Sky Comedy), comedianNathan Fielderblends documentary, social experiment, performance art and absurdist satire in a devised method all his own. He has ordinary people tackle emotionally fraught situations from their lives, by role-playing them with hired actors in meticulously recreated sets that mirror significant personal locations. It’s arch, but the stakes are real. Thefirst seriesopened with a man who wanted to apologise to his pub quiz teammates for cheating, before pivoting to a woman who wasn’t sure whether she wanted to become a mother. Mamma mia!Here we go again – and this new series ups the ante. With undertones of Malcolm Gladwell, Fielder identifies that aviation disasters are mostly a result of communication awkwardness in the cockpit. Can he help first officers speak up when they notice pilot errors, and thereby stop people dying in plane crashes? Is comedy the right vehicle for this? Is that funny? Fielder sets out his stall, while stepping over a blood-covered actor who whispers “Help” from a wreckage of twisted fuselage. Do you remember your first olive – the sensation of not being sure what you were eating? This is like that.The furrow the show ploughs is fantastically winding, and bone dry. Fielder’s monotone narration is matched by his clownish, Beckettian imagination (and limitless HBO budget). In one experiment, a triplet of cloned dogs are trained to become more like their deceased donor. A compressor transports air across the country to recreate the atmosphere of a specific city. An airport is reconstructed, with 70 actors playing the public, flight crew and shop assistants. Fielder uses cranes and gargantuan puppets to experience the babyhood of heroic pilot Chesley Sullenberger in a Freudian scene of horrifying proportions. I won’t spoil it here – but it may spoil you for ever.The visuals are part of what makes this appointment TV. In another strand, Fielder intervenes in the dating life of a shy first officer – enlisting a group of actors to surround and mimic him, to illustrate the theory that working in packs builds confidence. Fielder encourages one of these actors to pursue a romantic relationship with the subject. He then sets up a warehouse of rooms of actors recreatingthatrelationship. When those simulated relationships turn sexual, he brings in the actors’ real-life partners to observe from behind a monitor. He piles ethical grey areas on top of each other like problematic pancakes.View image in fullscreenNo one’s doing it like Fielder … The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.Since Nathan for You in 2013, Fielder has warped the tracks of reality TV, pushing its artifice into surreal places. Controversy, too. He has been accused by participants of emotional manipulation. Which is the point. I don’t know if the real subjects here are also actors, or if Fielder cares about aviation safety. The show could be a lampoon of gestalt therapy or the moral hypocrisy of television, or a fever dream arising from its creator’s own anxieties. “I’ve always thought sincerity was overrated,” reflects Fielder casually, the sort of thing you’d read in a Sartre novel. “It just ends up punishing those who can’t perform it as well as others.”I knew one genius in my life, many years ago. A man who, after a short while in anyone’s company, saw through them like an X-ray. Without judgment, he was able to lay bare people’s deepest insecurities and dreams, unpick their social persona and even predict their fantasies. Everyone hated him. They thought he was a witch.Likewise, The Rehearsal won’t be to everyone’s taste. I’m not even sure it’s to mine. A self-cannibalising satire of television ethics might be too smart to be beloved. But you should watch it. Inscrutable, wilfully awkward, wayward, serious of purpose and a shaggy dog story, no one’s doing it like Fielder.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherNathan FielderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Though it powered through a mild opening to become a solid summer hit, on the 1995 charts it sits below Father of the Bride Part II and Congo (though congratulations are in order; it did edge out both Grumpier Old Men and Mortal Kombat). Even among otherMel Gibsonvehicles from the 90s, you might be surprised to learn that Maverick, Conspiracy Theory and Payback all posted stronger numbers.Crash at 20: is it the worst best picture winner of all time?Read moreBut Braveheart stuck around, both in theaters and in the public consciousness. It wasn’t necessarily tipped as an awards contender at the time of release – Gibson had only directed one other movie, a small-scale drama called The Man Without a Face – but wound up nominated for 10 Oscars and winning half of them, including a best director prize for Gibson. He wasn’t nominated for his performance, but it became a career signature, his rousing speech and blue facepaint instantly absorbed into his iconography. He plays William Wallace, a Scottish warrior who leads a rebellion against King Edward I in the 13th century, when Scotland’s dead king left no heir and England swooped in to conquer. The details of the story, which positions Robert the Bruce (Angus McFadyen) as a politicking compromiser, are inspired more from an epic poem than the historical record, which presumably aided its easy-to-follow epic pull.The movie itself is sort of a print-the-legend affair, too, rather than a parade of perfect scenes. Its three hours are full of hacky touches: plummy introductory narration getting the audience up to speed on the historical context; dialogue that underlines motivations at every turn; the occasional embarrassing tribute to its star’s virility; Gibson’s trademark zany broadness peeking through at odd times. Worst of that material is the running subplot about the king’s gay son, where Gibson sees fit to stage the scene where the king throws his son’s lover out a window to his death like a grim slapstick punchline – because to Gibson, that’s precisely what it is. (King Edward may be a cruel tyrant, Gibson seems to be saying, but he sure isn’t weak like his mincing son!) At times the movie resembles nothing more than an R-rated version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves – and some accounts of its historical accuracy or lack thereof would bear out that comparison.What most people are thinking of when they think about Braveheart is a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film, where Gibson’s Wallace, face striped in that memorable blue, gives his stirring speech about living a long life of regretting a lack of freedom, then leads the Scotsmen into a long and impressively gory battle, ending in triumph. Half an hour later, there’s another, less victorious for the Scots, also memorably gory. And of course, the capture, torture and defiant death of William Wallace at the end of the film is a notable culmination (though by no means end) of Gibson’s fixation on chronicling extensive bodily punishment, a grimmer Catholic-guilt precursor to what Tom Cruise puts himself in the name of stunts.This may have been the precise point where Gibson became better known for taking that punishment than as a romantic lead; presumably less remembered or cherished among Braveheart’s fans is Wallace’s unconvincing dalliance with Princess Isabella of France, played by the decade-younger Sophie Marceau. The ease of reducing Braveheart to its highlights-reel essentials makes it a throwback to the have-you-actually-watched-this-lately epics of decades earlier – not the durably brilliant likes of Lawrence of Arabia or Spartacus, but rather more akin to the biblical epics that don’t get quite as much play as The Ten Commandments.View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes of Braveheart in 1995.Photograph: Moviestore collection Ltd/AlamyOf course, that’s where Gibson would go next as a director, and as surprisingly modest a grosser as Braveheart was in its day, The Passion of the Christ was shockingly huge nine years later. Yet despite that massive hit and his Braveheart Oscar in tow, Gibson’s directorial career never really reached its full potential. Some of that was his own doing, as drunken, hate-filled antics came to dominate his public image right around the time he unleashed his, ah, Passion. But his peers were clearly ready to forgive (how else to explain the Oscar attention afforded to the similarly martyr-focused and gory Hacksaw Ridge?) and directing offered a clear opportunity to stay a little further from the spotlight while remaining in control of his films. His most recent project, the terribly generic (though recognizably Gibson-y) Flight Risk landed with a thud this past January.Maybe Braveheart, successful as it was in the long term, made it harder to accept Gibson as a matinee idol with flashes of intriguing darkness, and easier to see him as a passionate madman who could really draw some blood. Or maybe it was just a hard one to top in the affections of so many bros. Regardless, the movie itself re-established a beachhead at the Oscars for mega-sized epics. After the Dances with Wolves victory at the top of the decade, the anointed best pictures got a little more eclectic for a few years: horror thriller The Silence of the Lambs, elegiac revisionist western Unforgiven, Spielberg’s masterly Schindler’s List, the picaresque comedy-drama Forrest Gump. Braveheart came along and waved the flag for subsequent winners like The English Patient, The Lord of the Rings and especially Gladiator. Thirty years on, that style of film-making feels more distant than it did back in 1995, its resources more likely to be poured into expensive fantasy. Of course, Braveheart is its own form of expensive fantasy, too, selling the power of its own brawny dumbness. For a few hours, it summons enough powerful sweep to convince the audience that Gibson, weird hang-ups and all, might be a star for the ages.Explore more on these topicsMel GibsonDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It kicks off the Brockwell Live series of one-day festivals, but last week a residents group, Protect Brockwell Park,won a legal caseagainst Lambeth council over the planning of the events. Protect Brockwell Park had argued the live events would damage the south London park’s ecology and put the public space out of use for local people; Brockwell Live stated that they “take our stewardship of Brockwell Park seriously”.Yet the legal travails pale into insignificance next to those faced by today’s headliners, Kneecap. The Northern Irish punk-rap trio last month facedoutrageafter a Coachella set in which they condemned Israeli “genocide” in Gaza and projected slogans on stage including “Fuck Israel. Free Palestine”.After the furore Rapper MoChara waschargedthis week with expressing support for a proscribed terrorist organisation. Kneecap said in a statement: “We deny this ‘offence’ and will vehemently defend ourselves.”View image in fullscreenFestivalgoers wait to hear Kneecap perform on stage at Wide Awake in Brockwell Park, south London.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/GettyIndeed, these setbacks don’t appear to have deflated the trio. Following English Teacher’s vexed, yearning indie and CMAT’s personality-plus, punky take on country and western, Kneecap emerge in front of a collage of recent TV coverage. “Anybody been watching the news?” inquires Chara.Flanked by fellow rapper Móglai Bap and DJ Próvai, the latter clad in his usual Irish-flag balaclava, Chara reports that tonight’s show only just went ahead. “They tried to stop this gig,” he claims. “We’re being made an example of. The Israeli lobbyists are trying to prove to other artists: ‘If you speak out, we’re going to hit you where it hurts most.’”The trio started out eight years ago as Goldie Lookin Chain-style comedy rappers performatively lauding Irish republicanism and their own dissolute lifestyles – a style still evident in numbers such as Fenian Cunts and the Garda-baiting Your Sniffer Dogs Are Shite. Chara now jokingly suggests that the 20,000-strong crowd might like to reconvene outside his hearing at Westminster magistrates court on 18 June, “and bring a nice big bag of ketamine”. Yet the comedy would not work were Kneecap not a great live band: Rhino Ket is a pulsating electro-throb over which they celebrate being “K-holed off my head”.They indulge their nihilistic whimsy and quest for narcotic oblivion further in Get Your Brits Out, a flight of surrealist fantasy in which they imagine a debauched night out with Arlene Foster and other former leaders of the DUP. “Guess who’s back on the news, it’s your favourite republican hoods,” gurns Bap, which certainly has the virtue of accuracy.Their activism is patently heartfelt rather than posturing radical chic. Protesting again that Gaza is being “bombed and starved”, Kneecap lead one final crowd chant of “free, free Palestine” before declaring on the closing H.O.O.D: “Lowlife scum, that’s what they say about me”. Próvai and his balaclava vanish into the moshpit. What a craic.Explore more on these topicsMusicEnglandreviewsShareReuse this content"

Navalny’s autobiography,Patriot, is a burning testament to what it looks like, in our fast-darkening world, to stand up to malignant corruption, to global bullies, to murderous domination. His writing is fantastically witty, egotistical, warm, swaggering, furious and relentlessly, insistently optimistic. It is his optimism that blasts through the book like a heat furnace. In prison, he tells his wife, Yulia, that he is likely to die there – “even if everything starts falling apart, they will bump me off at the first sign the regime is collapsing. They will poison me.” He says it is better not to pretend. When she agrees, they embrace in joy. “That was great! No tears.” This book reminds us that real resistance is powered by heat and light, by the stubborn belief that things might be otherwise.Impossible Creaturesby Katherine Rundell is published by Bloomsbury.Brave New Worldby Aldous HuxleyChosen by Chris Packham, nature writerView image in fullscreenI read this at 14, in the 70s, and it gave me nightmares. It was published in 1932, in the shadow of rising fascism, by a man who feared the rise of the machines. Now, 50 years after I first turned its pages, I have nightmares about the new world: a world living in the shadow of rising fascism and evasive truth, and fearful of AI. A world in the grip of a new dystopia: climate breakdown. But still Aldous Huxley’s novel fuels bravery. I found myself in that book, only as a child I didn’t recognise it. It is the book that made me the imperfect, flawed, brand new savage that I am.Fingers in the Sparkle Jarby Chris Packham is published by Ebury.Word for Word by Lilianna LunginaChosen by Yulia Navalnaya, campaigner and widow of Alexei NavalnyView image in fullscreenI love books in which a personal story becomes inseparable from the story of a nation. In Word for Word, Lilianna Lungina recounts her life as a translator in the Soviet Union – and through it, the entire 20th century flows. She seemed to witness everything: the fear, the hope, the silence, the change. She met so many of the people who shaped Russian culture, and lived through every turning point. As I read, I kept learning about my own country – and, unexpectedly, about myself. It made me think deeply about what changed in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union – and what, heartbreakingly, stayed exactly the same.One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against Thisby Omar El AkkadChosen by Madeleine Thien, authorView image in fullscreenThis book, a reckoning with the carnage we are witnessingin Gaza, does a thousand vital things. It writes into wordlessness and grief; it confronts our complicity. Most of all, it refuses to give up what we hold dear – each other. This is a work whose impetus is love, so fragile a thing in this world.The Book of Records by Madeleine Thienis published by Granta.We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our FamiliesbyPhilip GourevitchChosen byChloe Dalton, author and foreign policy adviserView image in fullscreenI was 20 years old and studying English literature at university. There was no way this book was on the syllabus, so I must have stumbled across it. It’s an account of the Rwandan genocide, which left me believing that war crimes can be prevented – we just often choose not to act. Fourteen years later, as adviser to the foreign secretary, I helped create a campaign to require governments to prevent mass rape and sexual violence from being used as weapons of war, as happened in Rwanda and continues in so many countries today. I can trace a line between reading that book and my work.Raising Hareby Chloe Dalton is published by Canongate.The Golden Notebookby Doris LessingChosen by Elif Shafak, authorView image in fullscreenI read this when I was young, and it inspired and empowered me in so many ways. It tells the story of a writer who keeps notebooks in different colours (black, red, yellow, blue), each reflecting her search for meaning across various aspects of life – personal, political, literary and psychological. Regarded as one of the key texts in the women’s movement, its intellectual and emotional depth is captivating. The tension and harmony between different components of our lives was an important subject in the 1960s, but perhaps even more so in today’s deeply fractured world.There Are Rivers in the Skyby Elif Shafak is published by Viking.Stokely Speaks: From Black Power to Pan‑Africanismby Stokely CarmichaelChosen by Kehinde Andrews, academic and authorView image in fullscreenI was lucky enough to grow up in the legacy of British Black Power, so my house was filled with revolutionary material. But I only picked up Stokely Speaks because of its hilarious cover, with Stokely Carmichael with a mini-afro, brandishing a gun. At the time, I was struggling with my identity, attending a school that made it clear that to be Black was to be labelled as unruly and placed in a lower set. Stokely Speaks opened my eyes, and made me unafraid to challenge the system that had tried to break me. His book set me on the path I am on today.Nobody Can Give You Freedomby Kehinde Andrews is published by Allen Lane.The Order of the Dayby Éric VuillardChosen by Philippe Sands, author and lawyerView image in fullscreen“Twenty-four calculating machines at the gates of Hell.” Thus does Éric Vuillard characterise the industrialists who gathered in February 1933 to pay homage to Germany’s new regime.The Order of the Day, which won France’s Prix Goncourt in 2017, came to mind with images of tech titans standing to attention at the recent US inauguration, and accounts of thecapitulationby American law firms to presidential threat that followed. History may not repeat itself exactly, but its insights – and those of the literary imagination – will offer clues if we want to see them.38 Londres Streetby Philippe Sands is published by W&N.Who Cooked Adam Smith’s Dinner?by Katrine MarçalChosen by Laura Bates, author and feminist activistView image in fullscreenThis powerful book upends centuries of economic theory by pointing out a fundamental flaw: that throughout history, most economists have failed to acknowledge the hidden, neglected, unpaid labour of women. If they fail to include the myriad ways in which women’s work underpins our societies and our economies, doesn’t that make their calculations useless? Katrine Marçal’s willingness to ask bold questions, and to question ideas that have long been considered the bedrock of our economic and societal systems, is as refreshing as it is inspiring. Best of all, it empowers readers to start asking difficult questions of their own.The New Age of Sexismby Laura Bates is published by Simon & Schuster.No Destination: Autobiography of a Pilgrimby Satish KumarChosen by Mike Berners-Lee, author and climate professorView image in fullscreenThis life story of Indian-British activist Satish Kumar tells of his inner and outer journeys as a peace campaigner and environmentalist. He walked around the world without money, delivering packs of tea to world leaders with the message: “If you are thinking of pressing the nuclear button, stop and have a cup of tea first.” He founded Resurgence & Ecologist magazine and Schumacher College for ecological studies in Devon, where he now lives. What is inspirational is his universal respect, his clarity of purpose, his colossal sense of adventure and his appreciation of the moment.A Climate of Truthby Mike Berners-Lee is published by Cambridge.The Death of the Heartby Elizabeth BowenChosen by Tessa Hadley, authorView image in fullscreenWhen I was trying and failing to write fiction as a young woman, a lot of the 20th-century male writers I most admired seemed to have finished with realism and the novel, as if its illusionism and its aim at lifelikeness were childishly naive, belonging to an unsophisticated earlier time. When I first read Elizabeth Bowen’s The Death of the Heart, what joy and confirmation to find her sweating, in the 1930s, over every sentence, in her magnificent effort to capture the effects of the real, so solid and so fleeting – swans on frozen water in the park, a drunken fumbling in a seaside cinema, an airless London bourgeois home. This truth to life was what I always wanted as a reader; she gave me heart that it was worth striving for as a writer.The Partyby Tessa Hadley is published by Jonathan Cape.The People of the Abyssby Jack LondonChosen by Ferdia Lennon, authorView image in fullscreenI first picked up this book on the recommendation of George Orwell, which is pretty solid as book recommendations go. At the turn of the century, Jack London, best known for Call of the Wild and White Fang, travelled to London to explore its East End. What he encountered there disturbed him. In the largest city of the richest and most powerful nation in the world, he found poverty on an unimaginable scale. Through the personal stories of factory workers, vagabonds, workhouse inmates and discharged soldiers, the other side of the empire is achingly and compellingly revealed. As an Irish person, you take it as given that the British empire is not something to be celebrated, but until I’d read this book, I think I held quite a binary view of who the winners and losers were. What I hadn’t quite grasped, until London brought it home to me in such a vivid and humane way, was the terrible cost of keeping the vast machine of an industrialised empire running, not just for those who were colonised, but also for the great masses at the heart of the empire who had supposedly won.Glorious Exploitsby Ferdia Lennon is published by Fig Tree.The Bluest Eyeby Toni MorrisonChosen by Kate Mosse, authorView image in fullscreenGrowing up in rural Sussex in the 1960s and 70s, living very much the same kind of narrow provincial life my parents and grandparents had lived before me, it was only through the BBC’s Six O’Clock News that I got glimpses of worlds very different from my own. The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison’s beautiful and uncompromising debut novel, changed all that. Not only did it make me look beyond my own experience to the realities of a more complicated, more varied world, but it showed the power of fiction. Set in 1941 in rural Ohio in the years following the Great Depression, the narrative is centred around Pecola and the hardships, abuses and misunderstandings she suffers. It’s heart-breaking – a story of powerlessness, race, dislocation, survival and poverty, and what it means to be female. Essential reading and a novel that changes each time you return to it.The Map of Bonesby Kate Mosse is published by Mantle.I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud …and Other Poems You Half-Remember from School, edited byAnaSampsonChosen by Len Pennie, poetView image in fullscreenI never used to think that I might fit into poetry, or that poetry might fit into me. It was to be studied, not enjoyed; analysed, but never truly understood. Poetry in the school context provided me with a list of concepts and techniques, allowing me to successfully pick at the bones of someone else’s imagination, readily regurgitating what I’d gleaned in the exam hall. Anything I didn’t really get was due to a lack of intellect, and anything I didn’t really like, a lack of taste. I’ve read and reread this anthology many times since my parents gave it to me; every time I find something new to chew on.poyumsby Len Pennie is published by Canongate.Predictably Irrationalby Dan ArielyChosen by Joanne Harris, authorView image in fullscreenI first met Dan Ariely on a tour of the US, and read his book out of curiosity. Nearly 20 years later, I still have my copy and revisit it regularly: it made me completely reassess the decision-making process I used to take for granted, and which I (wrongly, like most people) assumed was based on rational thinking. In fact, as Ariely says in the book, humans often make impulsive, irrational decisions, and once we understand how this works, we can sometimes avoid the pitfalls into which such thinking can lead us. It’s an upbeat, accessible book, with a genuinely revolutionary message: and once I’d learned to identify some of the behaviours described, I started to see them everywhere.Vianneby Joanne Harris is published by Orion.TheHay festivalruns until 1 June.

They take you through the place at night and tell you all the horrific things that happened. I learned that if you were a woman, it took one signature to get you committed (your husband could do it) and three to get you out. So once women were in, they usually stayed long-term.A self-guided tour ofBeechworth Public Cemeterywill bring you to a Chinese section with the graves of about 2,000 gold seekers and settlers.

The ones composed of contrasting, caricatured environments spaced neatly within the concise contours of a fictional island, say, bearing labels like Wild Wood, Barren Bog and Misty Hills. Enticing though these untamed landscapes are, I’m in search of a different kind of bounty.Beyond its green, green hills, castles, beaches and historic market towns (not leastDylan Thomas’s Laugharne), Carmarthenshire is also considered the Garden of Wales – which was news to me, despite family ties to the area. I’ve visited some of these botanical highlights over the years, such asAberglasney Gardensfor their tonal variety and theNational Botanic Gardenwith its astounding glasshouse.View image in fullscreenBut with ever more tempting places to eat, sleep and ramble within this corner of Wales, I’ve often thought of composing a gardener’s dream itinerary: a handful of the county’s best gardens, a forest walk, an inviting pub or two, and somewhere lovely to stay the night. This spring I finally got around to road testing it.The first thing to figure out was the all-important base from which to explore the county. Equidistant between the towns of Carmarthen and Llandeilo, forming the apex of a Carmarthenshire triangle, is the pretty village ofBrechfa: a clutch of stone cottages, a community shop, pub and chapel below a forested hillside and beside the frothing River Cothi. It’s also the home ofTŷ Mawr, a Grade II-listed country hotel and restaurant that prides itself on its dining, spacious rooms (Tŷ Mawr means big house), dog-friendliness and a location at once “in the middle of nowhere yet close to everywhere”– which was certainly true for the purposes of my visit, with all waypoints little more than 20 minutes’ drive away. Welcoming my wife and I at the end of our M4 slog from Hampshire was hotelier David, who with his partner, Gill, took the reins of Tŷ Mawr in 2022.View image in fullscreenTŷ Mawr hotelAfter breakfast, there was a temptation to savour the hotel’s own apple-blossomed garden and terrace, but our first location beckoned: Abergwili’sBishop’s Park and Gardens. Now managed by the Tywi Gateway Trust, charitable investment has helped to rejuvenate this relic site on the outskirts of Carmarthen (also the home of theCarmarthenshire Museum), while the restored grounds encompass a planted woodland walk, a water meadow and lake, and specimen trees once the pride of the resident bishops, including monkey puzzles and dawn redwoods. At its heart is the Jenkinson Garden: a series of intensively gardened 19th century-themed beds, which head gardener Blue Barnes-Thomas infuses with vibrant plug-ins – tulips and crocuses for spring, umbels and sweet peas for summer. Walking me around the site, he explained the next steps in the renewal project, including renovating its 18th-century walled garden with new pathways, accessible greenhouses and heritage gooseberries.The Kew-trained head gardener has continued Aberglasney’s development into one of the finest formal gardens in the UKLunch was atWright’sin Llanarthney. Owned and run by food writerSimon Wright, together with his wife, Maryann, it offers a chic, pared-down menu of elaborate flavours, and a lovely asparagus salad.If you sampled a glass too many of the robust house wine, the good news is that AberglasneyGardensis only a stone’s throw across the Tywi valley, its floral exuberance and plant diversity a kind of intoxication in itself.Much like Bishop’s Park, Aberglasney is a story of successful regeneration: a crumbling mansion and a four-hectare (10-acre) garden painstakingly and beautifully resuscitated, opening to the public in 1999. Featuring alpine, kitchen and Elizabethan cloister gardens, meadows crammed withfritillariaandcamassia,an indoor ninfariumand a walled garden reimagined by garden designer Penelope Hobhouse, the place is a genuine wonder. In 2011, Kew-trained head gardener Joseph Atkin was appointed to continue the garden’s evolution, which saw Aberglasney develop into one of the finest formal gardens in the UK.View image in fullscreenThe walled garden and mansion at Aberglasney Gardens.Photograph: Nigel McCall/AlamyA few years ago, Atkin hung up the trowel and opened a pub –The Plough– up the road in Felingwm, where you can find relaxed, wood-fired dining, Welsh ales and – if you’re cheeky enough to ask – a little gardening advice on the side.On into the afternoon sun, which only intensified the lush profusion, and “up country” to Llandysul, as no garden itinerary is complete without an independent plant nursery – and here lies one of the greats.Spanning 1.2 hectares of polytunnels, open stock yards and shopfront,Farmyard Nurseriesis known for its eclectic, hardy plants, including an expansive collection of exquisite hellebores.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is where nursery owner Richard Bramley and his team have let fancies run feral. Japanese maples and bright rhododendrons spill over narrow woodchip pathways, while drifts of spring ephemerals and shade-loving perennials (such as yellow comfrey and, indeed, many of the nursery’s hellebores) spread out below the deciduous canopy. Buried within are further surprises: a wildlife pond and a Tolkienesque lath and plaster hut – a whimsical, after-hours project Richard told me was contrived as they went along. We left Farmyard Nurseries with a crate of the liquorice-scentedagastache‘Blackadder’ and a scarletaquilegiaI’ve long sought.If floral yearnings aren’t satiated at this point in the day, on the way back to Brechfa, you could drop intoNorwood Gardens and Tea Rooms, which offers a range of Mediterranean, woodland and bog plantings. But we were keen to get back in time for the three-course dinner at Tŷ Mawr, featuring butter bean cassoulet and braised hake.An abundance of pale pink cuckoo flowers led down a misty, gorse-lit track into shafts of morning sunlightOur meal plans were almost scuppered, however, when our car broke down on the Llandysul to Brechfa road, high on the lofty peat moor above Tŷ Mawr. The dramatic remoteness of the location was actually quite comical – we couldn’t have picked a more isolated spot for an alternator failure (here’s a tip: if it sounds like something just fell out of your engine, reconsider crossing barren moorland). Owing to the kindness of a local mechanic, we were back at the hotel within an hour or so, leaning into a mushroom paté starter.A slower pace on day two allowed for a wander along one of Brechfa’s many surrounding forestry trails, managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). We opted for theKeepers Riverside Trail, its abundance of pale pink cuckoo flowers leading down a misty, gorse-lit track into shafts of morning sunlight. There are numerous mountain bike and riding trails here also, though NRW are still working to reopen theBrechfa Forest Garden– an experimental forestry plot established in the late 1950s that now makes for an impressive coniferous arboretum – after storm damage.View image in fullscreenThe National Botanic Garden of Wales in Llanarthney.Photograph: Tim JonesYou can then take the road south, crossing the River Tywi once more, for theNational Botanic Garden of Wales. Resist making straight for the Great Glasshouse perched at the top of the hill – the largest single-span glasshouse in the world. Instead, let that be the encore and take your time meandering up – via the daylily-lined lake and the deep herbaceous beds; the Japanese, walled, kitchen and boulder gardens; and the orchid-filled tropical house. And once in the vast glasshouse, enjoy the snaking pathways that lead through geographically themed zones displaying the likes of Australianbanksia, South Africanproteaand magnificent Macaronesianechium.The garden’s progressive aspirations include reversing the decline of Welsh-native flora and getting every school child in Wales engaged with nature.Anew cycle path, already partially opened, is due to be completed this autumn, connecting most of the locations mentioned here. Beginning at Bishop’s Park and tracing a former railway track through the scenic Tywi valley, you can jump off for the botanic gardens, Wright’s and Aberglasney, and do away with the car altogether.The trip was provided byDiscover CarmarthenshireandTŷ Mawr Hotel and Restaurant(doubles from £140 B&B).Lunch was hosted atWright’sExplore more on these topicsWales holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysRoad tripsGardensShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The latter is important, because to get this mighty berry to reach its delicious potential, we need to dehydrate it (that is, remove as much water as possible and then hit it with lots of flavour). You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it. In this recipe, after roasting, I’ve used one of my favourite braising liquids – a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame – to bring the aubergine back to life.Soy sauce, sake and sesame oil-braised auberginesCooking sake can be bought in larger supermarkets and Chinese grocery stores (if you can’t find it, use a nice drinking sake that will go nicely with the meal instead). Cook the rice before starting on the aubergines and cover it with a lid – it will stay warm for an hour.Prep10 minCook35 minServes43 large or 4 medium aubergines(1.1kg)4 tbsp sunflower oil, or rapeseed oil5 tbsp light soy sauce¼ tsp fine sea salt6 tbsp cooking sake2 tsp light brown sugar2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar5 tbsp toasted sesame oil3cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 red bird’s eye chilli, slit lengthways100g spring onions, halved across the belly, then cut lengthways into long, thin strips (and rinsed, if need be)Toasted sesame seeds, to finishCooked plain rice, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two large trays with baking paper. Trim the tops off the aubergines, then cut each one into eight long wedges. Put these in a bowl with the sunflower oil, toss with your hands to coat, then lay the wedges side by side on the oven trays. Bake for 25 minutes, until soft.Meanwhile, make the braising liquid. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar and three tablespoons of toasted sesame oil.Put the remaining two tablespoons of sesame oil in a small frying pan on a medium to low heat and, once hot, add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for two minutes, until pale golden. Add the spring onions, stir for a minute, then add the soy and sake mixture, take off the heat and mix well.When the aubergines have had their 25 minutes, transfer them to a smaller, lipped baking tray, laying the wedges on top of each other. Stir the braising liquid again, then pour it all over the aubergines and shake the tin to make sure all the aubergines are covered. Roast for a further 10 minutes, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with rice alongside.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkMain courseJapanese food and drinkSpiritsVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Let’s start with a caveat: we have serious issues with the concept of readymade, long-shelf-life hummus. Some dips lend themselves to tub life, but for us, hummus is like bread: something that should be made fresh daily. Indeed, inour restaurants, we make a batch every day, and the tubs we sell in the deli are good for three.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We also want to challenge the idea that readymade hummus is a “healthy” snack. Freshly made with chickpeas and tahini, and seasoned with lemon, salt, garlic and maybe a little cumin, yes, hummus is wholesome. However, most of the ones we tested had added oil (olive oil in the better ones, vegetable oil in the rest), and some included preservatives and other additives, making them ultra-processed foodstuffs and decidedlynothealthy.For most of your hummus needs, we recommend buying from a specialist or, better yet, making your own using good-quality tinnedchickpeasand tahini. It comes together in seconds and tastes far better than anything you can buy. Still, even we aren’t above a readymade dip now and then, and hummus really is the perfect companion to an office spread, a long train ride or an impromptu picnic, so we may as well know the good from the bad.The best supermarket hummusBest all-rounder:Ramona’s Original Heavenly HoumousView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 500g at Tesco (70p/100g)£3.50 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (70p/100g)★★★★☆This really tastes of chickpeas, which is great and, not surprisingly, it contains more chickpeas (66%) than any of the others tested. Not too lemony, highly seasoned, but in a good way. Quite a few additives, though.Best splurge:Moorish Smoked HumousView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 150g at Morrisons (£1.30/100g)£1.95 for 150g at Sainsbury’s (£1.30/100g)★★★★☆A very leftfield hummus, but one we thoroughly enjoyed. The smoke comes through powerfully and pleasantly. It’s vinegary, too, which is unusual, but it works in this context. Pleasant texture and mostly natural ingredients. Great as a dip or sandwich filler.Best bargain:Sabra Houmous ClassicView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 250g at Ocado (£1/100g)★★★☆☆Smooth, easy to eat and with a resealable lid. The seasoning is balanced, but the texture is a bit greasy and fatty. It’s also loaded with oil, preservatives and additives, and has a suspiciously long shelf-life, which is not so good if you’re avoiding UPFs.‘Just one was enough to turn my middle-class worldview to dust’: tinned and jarred chickpeas, tasted and ratedRead moreAnd the rest …Waitrose No 1 Extra-Virgin Olive Oil HoumousView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 170g at Waitrose (£1.62/100g)★★★☆☆The packaging is good and easy to open. It’s not resealable, but the quantity is suited to a single sitting. The texture is grainy, the seasoning heavily citric, and the oil makes it claggy and almost too rich. Still, this is pretty decent stuff, with no preservatives or additives and all-natural ingredients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The chickpeas on top looked like a nice touch, but they were undercooked.Yarden Houmous ClassiqueView image in fullscreen£2.65 for 250g at Tesco (£1.06/100g)£2.65 for 250g at Ocado (£1.06/100g)★★★☆☆This tastes so much like the Sabra one that we thought it might be made by the same manufacturer. A close inspection of the packet confirmed our suspicions (see above for verdict), and we felt very proud of our palates.Natoora Hummus with Extra-Virgin Olive OilView image in fullscreen£2.95 for 185g at Waitrose (£1.59/100g)£3.95 for 185g at Ocado (£2.14/100g)★★★☆☆We really wanted to enjoy this one, but couldn’t. The glass jar is classy, but there was a weird, watery residue on top. The texture’s oddly bouncy (not unlike grout), and the flavour is what you’d imagine grout tastes like. That said, bar the citric acid, it’s all natural.Sainsbury’s Classic HoumousView image in fullscreen99p for 200g at Sainsbury’s (50p/100g)☆☆☆☆☆Appealing container in a paper sleeve, but that’s where the positives end. Vile on every level: looks like thin glue (it’s split and congealed), the chickpeas are chalky, gravelly and undercooked, and have an aftertaste that lingers in a way that makes you want to brush your teeth for ever. Avoid at all costs.Tesco HoumousView image in fullscreen99p for 200g at Tesco (50p/100g)☆☆☆☆☆Tastes exactly like the Sainsbury’s version, and we suspect it’s made using the same misguided recipe by the same manufacturer. If that’s the case, they should be tracked down and reported.Explore more on these topicsMiddle Eastern food and drinkThe FilterSnacksFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"
