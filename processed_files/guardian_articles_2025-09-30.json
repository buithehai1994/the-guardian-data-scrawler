He is a details-focused pragmatist who takes decisions based on their merits, rather than whether they fit into any particular political story.But what this speech lacked in policy detail, it made up for in narrative. At its heart was an era-defining choice betweenLabourand the populist right or, as he put it, “decency or division, renewal or decline”.The prime minister painted a picture of a country under Labour that could be both proud of its values and in control of its future. After a summer in which the flags had become the focus of a culture war, he sought to reclaim them, with delegates waving the flags of all parts of the UK.Showing a steeliness and determination that has been largely absent since the general election, he demonstrated to his party he was unafraid of taking the fight toNigel Farage, after months of leaving a vacuum.In creating a dividing line with Reform, which is soaring ahead of Labour in the polls, he effectively drew the battle lines for the next general election, and gave his party a common enemy to unite behind. That Farage was so angry about it, suggests the strategy is getting under his skin.Starmer suggested the contest would beReform UKversus everybody else. Senior Labour figures hope that come the next election, enough of those in the centre and left of British politics, might be tempted to back him to keep Farage out of Downing Street.The prime minister’s internal critics have relentlessly urged him to be more aggressive in challenging Reform and, at the same time, offer the public some hope that while the country faces huge challenges, they are surmountable. Up until now, they have been left disappointed.After a disastrous start to the parliamentary session, and Andy Burnham one of the few senior Labour figures openly criticising Starmer, it is unsurprising that this conference has been dominated by speculation over Starmer’s leadership.His allies say that Starmer is at his best when under intense pressure. “It clarifies things for him,” says one. “It helps him focus on what he really needs to fight for.” Faced with a threat to his leadership, his party and the country, they say he is stepping up.But while they can say “job done” for this conference, the real challenges still lie ahead. The budget – set against a dire economic backdrop and bringing likely tax rises – will be a pivotal moment. An even more perilous one for Starmer will be the May local elections.If this conference has been but the first step in his plan to get a grip on party and power, then Starmer, despite all the scepticism, could still turn things around. But if it just splutters to a halt then, as one senior party figure put it: “We’re sleep-walking towards a Reform government”.Starmer could be forgiven for looking back on his conference speech two years ago, which was interrupted by a heckler who showered him with glitter and to which he responded by removing his jacket and rolling up his sleeves to get on with the job, with pangs of nostalgia.Labour was soaring in the polls back then and his leadership elicited hope, rather than the despair with which it is now met. That anxiety over whether he can pull it off has not gone away, but his speech will give him – even if only briefly – some much needed breathing space.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabour conference 2025LabourLabour conferenceReform UKNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

Of course he does, he taught the apprentice everything he knowsTue 30 Sep 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.51 EDTShareAny dramatist seeking a character through whom to distil the sold-out madness of the present times could do a lot worse than President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Yesterday exposed Jared’s starring role in not one but two current deals. 1. History’sbiggest-ever leveraged buyout, of video game giant Electronic Arts (EA), which Kushner’s firm is taking private and effectively into Saudi ownership. And 2. “Eternal peace in the Middle East”, as per what has beenwidely referred toas “the Kushner-Blair plan” for Gaza. Busy week for Jared! He’s popping up at so many seismic moments – just call him Forrest Trump.Quick refresher on our boy: he is married to Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, and previously served as a senior adviser in his father-in-law’s first administration, taking the opportunity of Trump’s election loss/unfortunate insurrection-fostering to seemingly leave frontline politics and start his own investment firm. And contrary to popular conjecture that he would be a pariah after that period, Jared sails unstoppably on. These days his appearance is so coolly detached and rarefied that he looks more like a drawing ofJared Kushner, or maybe like the cyborg you’d build to covertly replace Jared Kushner after the real one was plagued by conscience glitches.And so: Jared’s manic Monday. It feels like we should address his now-activated plan for ending the horrendous war on Gaza first, before we do the gaming mega-deal. Unfortunately, the timeline of the Kushner calendar had things in a different order. It was video games/Saudi laundering first, then Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu coming over to the White House later to explain how incredibly keen he was to sign up to a plan to stop doing the things he’s very remorselessly doing.The morning saw the announcement that EA – who make huge franchises like EA FC (Fifa, to anyone who plays it) and Madden NFL – was being taken private in a $55bn deal brokered by Kushner, with the Saudi regime’s investment fund as the majority owner. Worried it might rub up against regulatory opposition? In the circumstances, please don’t be. As the FT put it: “People close to the discussions say Kushner’s involvement would also ease the deal’s path through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which adjudicates on deals involving foreign buyers.”Why am I reminded of the guy in Goodfellas who brings the Air France heist to the gang anddismisses their concernsabout security. “Security? You’re looking at it. It’s a joke. I’m the midnight-to-eight man.” Either way, it’s instructive to learn that some foreign ownership of firms with access to the data of US citizens is sometimes very good and very permitted.Sorry, TikTok! Maybe you guys should have found a way to make your existence worth the wider Trump family’s while. (And you know what? Maybe you still will …)Not that that was the tack Jared went with for his statement on the deal, preferring instead to eulogise EA. “I’ve admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences,” he explained, “and as someone who grew up playing their games – and now enjoys them with his kids – I couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead.”Onwards then to the afternoon, which saw the world and other interested parties finally have on-the-record confirmation that what’s being cooked up for Gaza is an international advisory council called the Board of Peace, which would bechaired by Donald Trump, and provide undefined oversight to a committee of apolitical Palestinian technocrats who would administer the territory. Also on this board: our own Mr Tony Blair, who has been working on Gaza plans for a while before pooling work with Jared, along with the proposal’s other architect, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Frustrating lovers of symmetry, Kushner didn’t actually issue a statement for this bit of his day, sparing us something on the lines of, “I grew up playing Risk and watching Tony Blair wage peace in the Middle East – now I get to do both with him. Honestly, the dream.” Then again, his silence on this putative deal reflects the fact that Jared no longer cares for the front-of-house role he held during Trump’s last administration.But it would be a mistake to think Kushner hasn’t simply graduated somewhere even more operational and even less accountable. If there is a backroom now, Jared is in the backroom to that backroom – not the backroom where it happens, but the backroom where itreallyhappens. He wasreportedly in the meetingswith Netanyahu on Sunday at the Washington hotel the Israeli prime minister was staying at, presumably ducking out from time to time to finalise the EA announcement.That deal came off in significant part because Kushner was able to work the deep ties he forged in Saudi during that first time stint as Trump’s envoy, while Gaza’s future has tellingly often been pitched as a development opportunity by his father-in-law’s administration. All in all, then, it also feels like a mistake to speak discretely of Kushner’s business and political manoeuvring. I want to say his activity is divided into political and business spheres … but it often doesn’t really seem to be divided at all. Perhaps we should think of it as a hybrid doctrine: dealpolitik. Money, power, carve-outs, carve-ups – as the classic EA Sports slogan used to say … it’s in the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then my dog dives – 24kg of fox red labrador launching into Gourock outdoor pool – to join the splashy tumult.Dogs of all shapes, sizes and swimming ability have come to the outdoor saltwater pool on Scotland’s west coast for what has become an annual fixture. On the last day of the season, the strictly humans-only policy is relaxed for the Doggy Dip so that canine companions can enjoy the mercifully heated waters with their owners.IfBrèagha, my four-year-old family pet, is less interested in the panoramic views of the Clyde estuary than in the squeaky tennis balls bobbing in the water, she can be excused. It’s fair to say most folk here, even those without tails, are just a wee bit over-excited.The pool, which featured on the cover of Blur’s 2023 album The Ballad of Darren, has been running the Doggy Dip since 2019 and this year had to lay on extra sessions to meet demand.Pan of people and dogs in the poolTuesday was a successful first visit for Neo, a four-year-old miniature poodle from nearby Greenock. Since he has twice fallen into the local canal, his owner Christina Bell was keen to try swimming with him in a more relaxed environment. “He loves splashing around but when his feet can’t touch the bottom then he panics,” she says. “We thought we’d come here because it’s warmer water and more buoyant because of the salt and it’s been a massive improvement.”A pair of Pekingese, 12-year-old Raphael and five-year-old Ludo, are return visitors, drifting serenely through the waggy throng in their flotation jackets. “It helps because they are quite top-heavy,” says their owner Angelique Peyranns, who has travelled across the estuary from Dunoon. “I’d highly recommend it, it’s a great idea to have them swimming in such a safe environment.”View image in fullscreenA dog jumps into the pool.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianView image in fullscreen‘It’s a great idea to have them swimming in such a safe environment,’ one owner said.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSafety and comfort for both dogs and their humans are paramount, says Marc McFarlane, a facility manager at the pool. Lifeguards patrol the area, dogs are hosed down after leaving the pool to rinse away chlorine, which can irritate sensitive snouts, and the occasional toileting indiscretion is dealt with swiftly. And if there is a top note of wet dog in the air, it is soon whipped away by the sea breeze.Gourock is one of a growing number of outdoor pools to offer dog swim events. The art deco elegance of Brighton’s Saltdean lido is transformed this month for “Dogtember”, with weekend swim sessions attracting visitors from across England and even France. Last year’s event raised half a million pounds for the Grade II-listed coastal pool.Dogs swimmingA dog with an orange toy in its mouth“We get through hundreds of tennis balls every weekend,” says the Saltdean organiser Jules Shepherd, who also runs breed meetups at the pool during the month. “When you see 150 labs or goldies in the pool at once, it’s quite a sight.”In mid-October, Cheltenham lido punctuates the shift from summer to winter season with a dog swim. Growing in popularity every year, it’s “a celebration of lido and community, and the bond between people and their pets”, says its marketing officer, Amy Bott. “It’s a fun way for people to discover us for the first time, then come back again for the other sessions.”Beyond the lido circuit, dog swimming has become big business, with a proliferation of companies offering bespoke pools for owners concerned about the safety of wilder forays in rivers and lakes or who do not live within easy reach of the coast.View image in fullscreenSwimmers dry off on the poolside in Gourock.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAndy Brownlie, who describes himself as “senior splashmaker” at Canine Dip and Dive in Suffolk, has recently written a code of conduct for similar businesses, with the aim of establishing industry standards around lifeguards and sanitation. “Fur is a nightmare,” he says.Brownlie, who runs four other pools across the south of England, lists a host of reasons why owners visit: to help their dogs overcome fear of water, or lose weight, or to provide joint-friendly exercise for older dogs.View image in fullscreenA dog gets some help.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“Every breed of dog can learn to swim, given the right guidance,” says the former dog trainer. “Some suffer through technique – for example, brachycephalic breeds such as pugs, French bulldogs and boxers tend to lift their heads high to keep them out the water, so they’re swimming upwards while their back legs droop.“You might think a really big dog like a Newfoundland would sink but their coat will trap air, so they glide effortlessly like wearing a big lifejacket. And dachshunds can swim brilliantly but because of their long bodies their hips roll when they turn, so they end up on their back. We call this the sausage roll.”Explore more on these topicsDogsPetsSwimmingScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

What could go wrong?Suzy ExpositoTue 30 Sep 2025 13.26 EDTFirst published on Tue 30 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTShareThe first – and only – time I’ve used dating apps was in the spring of 2021. I’d just moved to Los Angeles and wanted to see more of the city. But I soongrew tiredof the actors, musicians and DJs who hounded me to attend their events; not to mention I didn’t feel safe with total strangers and I’m particular about hygiene.But ever since my parents cut me off from AOL chatrooms in middle school, I’ve never had trouble meeting people IRL. I’m a social creature who likes to meet people in the wild: I’ve gotten dates from chatting people up at concerts, dance parties, soccer games – I even met one ex in a cemetery, which may have foreshadowed our love’s bitter end. So when my friend invited me to a “flirting party”, it seemed like just the ticket.View image in fullscreenAny available person received a designated number; asterisks denoted those in open relationships.Photograph: Credit: Suzy ExpositoEarlier this year, Rachel Connolly countered the sorry state of dating in New York with what she called a “Bring Back Flirting Party”. She and a friend curated a guest list of eligible friends (and their friends), and let them mingle in a controlled space.Connolly wrote about the partyfor the Cut, where Hayley Byrnes, who is single, read it. Byrnes, a TV writer’s assistant, decided she, too, wanted to bring back flirting. “I had this deep-seated desire to watch other people flirt,” said Byrnes, 31. “I texted a bunch of friends that I wanted to do something like this, and was encouraged by how excited everyone was.”Byrnes’ flirting party took place in the lush, spacious back yard of her home in north-east LA. She prompted guests to bring single friends they could vouch for. More than 150 people showed up, representing a broad spectrum of gender, race and sexuality – including me.At the entrance, a greeter handed out heart-shaped stickers. Any available person received a designated number; asterisks denoted those in open relationships. Guests could bring unavailable friends as wingpeople, or “Cupids”, to help break the ice with strangers.“I was trying to figure out the best balance between structure and freedom,” said Byrnes. “We’re all adults. I wanted to create as many opportunities for people to opt into a flirtatious mood without being forced.”Along the central winding path were candlelit tables draped in red gingham, each equipped with refreshments and a flirty activity; at one station, people could leave their name and number in a box labeled “Missed Connections”. At my favorite station, people were encouraged to write cheeky dares on slips of paper and toss them into the “dare bowl”. Semi Oloko, 25, told me her friends tested the dare bowl at her own flirting party months before, with great results – “body shots, people making out around every corner”, she said, “plenty of numbers exchanged and dates set”.Many guests wrote in dares, but I noticed how few were actually executing them. So I decided to stage my own personal reality TV show – à la Love Island – and passed the bowl around the party to see what would happen. Would I play the scheming producer that night? Or somebody’s bombshell?View image in fullscreen‘I’m a social creature who likes to meet people in the wild.’Photograph: Courtesy Suzy Exposito“I don’t want drama,” I explained to a friend waiting in line for the bathroom. “I wanttheater!”One by one, partygoers plucked dares from the bowl and escalated their flirt game. A tomboy reeled in a beautiful stranger to make out behind a potted plant; a bachelorette pulled her guy friend by his collar to kiss behind a tree, and another bachelor pocketed a dare for himself, only to discreetly present it to his crush while they were alone under the stars. Alex, who runs an independent record label, acted on a dare to feed me grapes. (We later enjoyed dinner and a movie.)“I almost bailed on the party because staying home and scrolling dating apps felt easier and a safer way to experience rejection,” said Alex, 35. “But then I asked myself: ‘Do I really want my Saturday night to be responding to Hinge prompts while rotting on my couch?’ Absolutelynot!”Not everyone was as enthused. One particularly wild-eyed man professed to me that he was nervous, and took magic mushrooms before the party to “help relax”. (It did not help.) Meanwhile, a svelte 30-something was miffed that another guest invited her brother, a 22-year-old barely out of college, and his brat pack of friends.Byrnes laughed when I asked if she’d considered filtering guests, particularly by age.“It was a flirting party, not a dating party,” said Byrnes. “It wasn’t goal-oriented, [which is] a dynamic that dating apps have fostered … the sense that to date is to take a class that you have to get an A in. But flirting isn’t math, it’s art!”Take good pictures and embrace the apps: how to start datingRead moreYou may have seen catastrophic charts about the “relationship recession” – or read thatgen Z has less sexthan previous generations,global birthratesare in decline, andpolitical divisions are escalatingbetween young men and women. Seeing our sexual culture through this data, one might think we are at war, andLysistrataa real person. Meanwhile dating apps, once a popular avenue for meeting potential partners,are hemorrhaging users.Are millennials and gen Z really all lonely, selfish dopamine fiends who seek attention more than connection? Telling by the party’s attendance, I think not – people seemed giddy, if a little anxious, at the socially sanctioned opportunity to work on their charm. In an age when singles of any sexuality are scared to come off as “cringe” or creepy, a flirting party seems to cut the pretense.View image in fullscreenThe party hosts made zines featuring vintage personal ads and missed connections.Photograph: Credit: Suzy Exposito“The pageant of human romance is a wonderful thing in its own right, whether or not it works out for me specifically,” said Jack, a 30-year-old reporter. (We got drinks after he left a missed connection note for me.) “Apps are all about results – ‘Pay us and we’ll help you find what you want’ – and that totally undermines the beauty of romance. If we give that away to corporations … what do we have left?”Oloko has slowed down her own app usage, especially since curating her own party, which was mostly attended by people of color. “I don’t think algorithmic dating platforms can be of much service to people whom algorithms have not historically served, [like] non-white [people],” she said,referring to a 2024 studythat confirmed the sexual racism embedded into dating app technology.Yet Cheyenne, a 32-year-old creative director, doesn’t plan on divesting from app dating. “It still had a tinge of awkward middle school dance [energy],” she said of the flirting party. “I appreciate that apps can connect you to people a bit further outside of your normal circle, or more on point with what you’re looking for. But there’s [more] depth and rhythm to an in-person conversation. You can’t just say ‘hey’ or leave someone on read for two weeks.”‘I was nervous to ask for your socials’: why missed connection posts are making a comebackRead morePerhaps technology is not all that’s to blame for ourstunted dating culture; stagnant job growth, plus the rising costs of housingandgoing out, have also strained social relations. Some people I spoke to at the party expressed doubts about planning anything long-term, when the future seems so materially tenuous for people in the US; others, myself included, see room for invention. I told both my dates that I long for a partner to build a life with – in a loving, art-filled home that’s safe for a child – and I still aim to find them in-person.Since throwing her party two weeks ago, Byrnes has happily received updates from people who’ve gone on first and even second dates after meeting in her back yard. She suggests that throwing more real-life house parties – flirting, or otherwise – can help single people feel less like statistics, and more like humans. In fact, she’s already thinking ofhosting another one.“I’m sure there are parts of those trend pieces that are true … that gen Z is having less sex and they’re drinking less, blah, blah, blah,” she said. “But at the end of the day, we [have] a fundamental desire to connect. It’s nice to feel rooted in reality and your community.”Suzy Exposito is an award-winning music and culture journalist whose work has been featured in theLos AngelesTimes, Elle and Rolling Stone"

I stumble out from the trees, hands stretched out like antennas. The sagebrush and rocks snag my feet, and I fall. My stomach drops. My heart skips a beat. My palms are scratched.I am trying to find my campsite, a mile from the Idaho backcountry hot spring where I have just been soaking. By the time I crawled out of the pool, night had fallen, and I could not find my headlamp or my lighter.I thought I could find my way back by going downstream, where the trees loomed dark like a narrow alley. Now I have to admit to myself that I am lost, no one knows I am here, and I am freezing. I can’t relax.The past week had been an emotional whirlwind. For a year, I had prepared to join the Peace Corps in Morocco – giving up my job, car and rental house, and packing my life for the next two years. But days before orientation, I got a call: my application was under review, then revoked. Suddenly, I was left to piece my life back together. I did what I do best: head for the wilderness.In March, the cold of the Rockies makes the wilderness feel as if it begins right outside your body, and the very real risks of hypothermia or frostbite raise the danger for anyone who strays off course. Starting a hike between 2pm and 3pm can be particularly risky in winter, since it can make hikers prone to disorientation as darkness falls quickly.I knew all of this: I had decades of experience in the backcountry, including working on trail crews for 13 years, serving two seasons as a fire lookout, assisting with wildlife studies, and staying at a remote ranger station in Glacier national park to prevent poaching. I had evenspent my honeymoonin the Brooks Range of Alaska, packrafting 80 miles (129km) in some of Earth’s most remote wilderness.In short: I never thought this would happen to me.Quick GuideSurvival tips for lost people in the wildernessShow• The most critical step is to stop moving, take a moment to breathe, and calmly assess the situation.• Identify immediate threats and prioritize the most critical needs first.• Maintaining a positive mindset is essential for survival.• Resilience and adaptability help sustain morale and encourage resourceful thinking.• Protect yourself from the elements. Use natural shelters such as caves or overhangs, or build a basic shelter like a lean-to.• Dehydration is a serious threat, so locate and purify water sources through methods such as boiling or using a filtration straw. Avoid drinking unknown or untreated water.• Fire provides warmth, enables water purification, aids in cooking, and can be an effective signaling tool.• Before any outdoor activity, inform someone of your planned route and your estimated return time.• A survival kit containing water, food, first aid supplies, a flashlight and signaling tools is essential.• To attract attention, use whistles, mirrors, bright clothing or fires. Remember that three short blasts or three signals in a row are the universal distress signal.• Often, staying in one location makes it easier for search teams to find you. If you must move, follow a stream or waterway downstream, as these can lead to civilization. When moving, try to stay in open areas to increase your visibility.• Be creative and adapt to your surroundings. For example, a shattered rock can be used as a knife, and evergreen branches can provide insulation.• Familiarity with wilderness survival techniques such as fire starting, navigation and shelter building is vital.• By combining these strategies and maintaining a strong will to survive, individuals can significantly increase their chances of overcoming the challenges of being lost in the wilderness.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nationwide, roughly 100,000 search and rescue (SAR) missions are conducted each year. While about 90% of people are eventually located – alive or dead – by SAR teams, the scale of the effort is huge. On average, an active search lasts about 10 hours. Survival rates drop steeply after the first 24 hours, with the chances of survival falling to just 5-10% after three days.Search and rescue operations cost US taxpayers approximately $5.1m annually and rely heavily on federal teams, such as the Forest Service and the Coast Guard. Recent budget cuts have reduced staffing, making rescues more challenging.That night, as I fumbled in the darkness, I promised myself that if I were to survive, it would never happen again. And the first thing I needed to do after going home was to learn everything about the art of survival.‘I became the problem’No matter how much time you spend in the wilderness, eventually, you will get turned around. It happens to everyone – even survival instructors and seasoned backcountry pros.In 1985, Susan Purvis was a survival instructor for the School of Urban and Wilderness Survival. The program aimed to help troubled inner-city kids connect with the outdoors.In the Utah desert, Purvis and another instructor split up with their groups of kids, agreeing to meet that evening.Purvis brought along a teenage girl who was not as physically fit as her and decided to take a shortcut by descending into a drainage area, believing they would reach the agreed-upon spot more quickly. They ended up in the wrong place, with the other group nowhere to be found. The sky looked ominous, as if it would rain, and night grew dark.Purvis became angry, blaming everyone but herself. She even criticized the girl for being out of shape.Susan Purvis with members of the School of Urban and Wilderness Survival.Photograph: Courtesy of Susan PurvisSearch and rescue expert andauthorRobert Koester often explains that hikers in the desert behave differently from those in the woods. The desert is more inhospitable and challenging to navigate without water. Mirages haunt and confound the mind in the day’s heat, causing logic to unravel. People often forget that desert nights can become bitterly frigid, while days become swelteringly hot.They carried little more than a poncho, some rice and lentils, and no reliable fire starter. Looking back, she said she felt foolish for breaking the rules and splitting up, but her ego had gotten involved. “I thought I could fix the problem,” she said. “Instead, I became the problem.”She pressed on instead of stopping to seek shelter. As they stumbled over sagebrush in the dark, Purvis yelled: “How could this be?”Experience can breed overconfidence, a phenomenon often referred to as the “expert halo”: the false belief that mishaps happen to others, not to you.The girl began to cry and sat down, prompting Purvis to scream in frustration: “There is no time for this. Get your ass up and move!”Meanwhile, the other group, sensing something was off, sent an SOS to the base.It started to rain, and Purvis and the girl stumbled upon a wikiup, a primitive shelter used by their school. This unexpected discovery shifted Purvis’s demeanor completely; she realized they would not freeze to death and that she would not kill the girl by pushing her too hard.That night, they huddled together for warmth.By dawn, the head instructor began tracking Purvis’s footsteps. At daybreak, a dehydrated Purvis and her student marched back up the plateau in search of identifiable landmarks. Around 2pm, they finally reached a road and began walking east. Within the hour, a familiar suburban pulled up: Purvis’s boss. He had been looking for them for 15 hours.“Where the hell have you been and how did you get lost?” he asked.In denial, she replied: “We’re not lost.”Navigation is a lost artSusan PurvisUpon reflecting on her experience 40 years later as she wrote her memoir,Go Find: My Journey to Find the Lost – and Myself, Purvis realized she had cycled through the classic stages of grief – denial, anger, bargaining and despair – the same stages rescuers often see in lost hikers.If they had not stumbled upon the wikiup, Purvis feared she would have slipped into depression – the fourth stage where all hope fades, and one feels like giving up. Ultimately, after surrendering, victims reach a state of acceptance.“Yes, I could have been kinder, gentler with my words,” she told me. “Words matter. I think I was in a punisher mood. That is how behavior changes, or so I thought. At the survival school, the death march and the suffering were part of the change of behavior.”I survived a wilderness camp: ‘It’s not necessary to break a person’s will’Read moreToday, Purvis tells everyone that if they are lost, they should stay put. For rescuers to find you, the best color to wear is blue, because it is not frequently found in nature. When panic sets in, stopping and breathing can be the most essential actions. People who panic are far more likely to injure themselves, compounding the situation beyond just being lost. In high-stress moments, a clear head can make the difference between a temporary setback and a full-blown crisis.Purvis believes tracking beacons and satellite phones are helpful, but if technology fails, “it will bite you in the butt. People need to know how to use a map and a compass, and have situational awareness,” she said. Batteries in your phone and GPS can run out of juice at anytime.“Navigation is a lost art,” she said.The trouble with groupthinkAccording to Joe Blattner, chief of Missoula county search and rescue, there are two main categories of outdoor emergencies: those that involve meeting a schedule and those that involve pleasing another person.Weekend adventurers often try to fit a specific adventure into a limited timeframe, regardless of the weather conditions. This can lead to exposure during storms, navigating in darkness, injuries, falls, and getting separated from the group.“Pleasing a person” is more insidious. Blattner explained: “One person isn’t going to say, ‘Hey, I’m getting a blister,’ or ‘Hey, I’m not comfortable in this terrain.’” Others may feel pressured to keep up with someone more fit. This reluctance to speak up is common and can become a problem if the person waits too long to signal their distress.Groups are especially vulnerable to “groupthink”, where decisions are made collectively and no one feels personally accountable for their actions. In these situations, looking out for one another becomes crucial, as tensions can escalate quickly. Chaos can ensue when people start yelling at one another, and fear mounts. This dynamic can devolve into a Lord of the Flies scenario frightfully fast. (Interestingly, having to take care of someone in distress can provide the group with a helpful focal point.)Survival in these situations hinges on a mix of skill, judgment and sheer luck. We can control how far we push ourselves and the risks we choose to take – but nature does not always play by our rules.The Swiss cheese effectMike Schaedel and Abrei Cloud, both in their early 20s, were in Yosemite in late September 2005, planning to climb theeast buttress of Middle Cathedral Rock, a 1,100-ft ascent (335 metres) comprising 11 pitches – considered one ofNorth America’s “classic” climbs. Schaedel had more than a decade of climbing experience, while Cloud was relatively new to the sport.They were newly dating and eager to please each other. But a late start and poor decision-making led to what some experts call the “Swiss cheese effect”: a disaster rarely comes from one big mistake, but from multiple small ones that align, like holes in a stack of cheese slices, allowing catastrophe to slip through.“My friends said it was a perfect route for Abrei and me,” Schaedel recalled. “They said: ‘It’s totally casual, no big deal. You’ll cruise it. There are plenty of people on it.’”With their friends’ relaxed assessment of the route, Cloud and Schaedel prepared their gear, including one water bottle each and food for the day. They set out around 11am, despite Cloud’s concerns about starting late. Schaedel, who had handled most of the planning, neglected to bring a topographic map of the climbing route. They also lacked photo descriptions, headlamps or cell phones.The Yosemite valley floor is approximately 4,000ft above sea level, and the weather was beautiful, with sunny skies and temperatures in the 70s. They wore long-sleeved shirts and shorts, and only one climbing group was ahead on the route.Schaedel led each pitch, and things went smoothly at first. He placed trad gear into the wall, attaching the rope for safety measures. Trad gear, used in traditional climbing, relies on putting protection into natural features such as cracks and constrictions in the rock face, rather than relying on pre-placed bolts. But midway through the first chimney section – a narrow vertical crack you climb by bracing your body against both walls – the rope slowed.View image in fullscreenMike Schaedel and Abrei Cloud.Photograph: Courtesy of Mike Schaedel and Abrei CloudThat is when Schaedel realized it was Cloud’s first chimney climb – not the best time to learn.Yelling down from 140ft up, he explained the technique: “Move your hands down, move your feet up, and push your back up the wall.”Once she finally made it up, he could tell she was “punch-drunk”– mentally and physically exhausted. By that point, they were 600ft above ground, and up seemed an easier way to go than down. The second chimney pitch spent Cloud’s energy even further – and dusk was under way.The typical profile of a lost hiker is a man between the ages of 20 and 25 (Schaedel was 24 years old). Men are more likely to push ahead without a plan, or perhaps assume they do not need one.Blattner, the SAR chief, believes that in a crisis, the best thing to do is to stop, slow down, breathe and think. “We often see people make swift decisions because they feel like they need to remedy getting lost immediately, and that’s often not needed. So, get oxygen to your brain and sugar into your body, stop, have a snack and stay hydrated.” This will enable more informed decision-making than letting panic take over.The initial response to being lost is typically intense, involving the release of adrenaline that triggers a fight-or-flight or freeze reaction. This leads to increased heart rate, rapid breathing, sweating, nausea and confusion. The amygdala reacts similarly to a panic attack, even in the absence of real danger.Fear disrupts metabolic processes, circulation and decision-making skills, while high emotional states and physiological responses contribute to poor judgment. Increased cortisol can impair memory formation and cognitive function, making it harder to recognize familiar cues and complicating the ability to formulate a plan.When small errors begin to accumulate, that’s when problems ariseMike SchaedelThat is precisely what happened to Schaedel. As dusk approached, panic set in and triggered his fight-or-flight response. He started making rushed decisions, climbing higher without placing enough protection, the gear meant to catch him in a fall. Without it, a single slip could have been fatal.He scrambled up a mossy, pine needle-covered corner and suddenly realized he was off-route. No classic climb with heavy summer traffic would be this overgrown.Unable to downclimb in the dark, he had Cloud lower him. By then, night had fallen. They were out of food and water, and the ledge was barely big enough for half their butts. They tied in and settled in as best they could, sitting upright, wrapping the rope around their legs for warmth. Temperatures dropped to below 40F (4.4C). The rock held a little residual heat. Cloud dozed fitfully between Schaedel’s legs. Their legs went numb, their backs ached, and they braced for a long, cold night.At sunrise, they had to wait for feeling to return to their limbs. Once thawed, they chose to finish the last two pitches and hike off – easier than downclimbing – but the descent still involved tricky talus slopes and a few rappels down steep rock.Looking back, Schaedel feels sheepish about underestimating the magnitude and seriousness of the climb. Today, they have been together for 21 years, married for 18, and have two children. Cloud must have forgiven him, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t double-check and triple-check the plans, the gear, and equipment numerous times before they head out on adventures – or at least that is what she told me.“When small errors begin to accumulate, that’s when problems arise,” said Schaedel. “It’s difficult to recognize when to stop because they seem insignificant on their own.”When the mind starts to fractureIn early May 2017, Madeline Connelly, 22, and her rescue dog, Mogi, made the drive from the Chicago suburb where she grew up to East Glacier park in Montana, to visit her uncle.She decided to go for a short hike and stopped to let Mogi out. Around noon, she crossed a bridge and walked up the trail to enjoy the beautiful 80F spring day. Snow was melting around tree wells, sap was rising, and the scent of pine hung in the air.At a fork, she headed downhill toward the river so her dog could drink. Along the way, she came across a pond and, on a whim, jumped in fully clothed, planning to dry off in the sun. Instead of returning the same way, she tried to take a shortcut back to her car to avoid the steep uphill climb.While retracing her steps, she slipped on a wet rock. She and Mogi fell into the rushing spring runoff, and the dog’s leash wrapped around her neck. She clawed herself free, but the panic that followed sent her into a tailspin. Her heart pounding, she veered off course and headed deeper into the Great Bear wilderness, south of Glacier national park.“Many lost hikers often take the wrong trail and continue because it resembles the correct one,” writes SAR expert Koester in his book Lost Person Behavior. “The person makes an error at a decision point and continues to go the wrong way because the terrain looks right or is gently guiding them in a new direction.” According to arecent study, the most common reasons people get lost are wandering off the trail (41%) and encountering bad weather (17%).Connelly had two strikes against her: she was lost, and the weather was still late spring in the Rockies. She wore orange bib overalls, a T-shirt, a flannel and hiking boots. She had no map, no compass, no bear spray, no water – only her car keys, the dog leash and a $20 bill in her pocket.View image in fullscreenMadeline Connelly and Mogi.Photograph: Courtesy of Madeline ConnellyThat night, she curled up in a tree well – the only snow-free space she could find – and clung to Mogi for warmth. Wolves howled nearby, their footsteps crunching on the hard-packed snow.The next morning, she hiked a ways and thought she spotted campers across a frozen lake. She carried Mogi through a freezing creek to reach them, but the orange sign she had seen turned out to be a broken tree. She collapsed in exhaustion and dozed off. When she woke, her period had started, and she had lost control of her bodily functions from stress. She stripped down, rinsed her clothes in the creek, and washed herself. Mogi instinctively buried the blood – an attempt to mask her scent in grizzly country.That night, she hung her boots to dry and tried to sleep again in the shelter of a treewell. Mice crawled over her as she shook with cold and panic. She woke in a daze, frightened but oddly calm.View image in fullscreenA missing poster for Madeline Connelly.Photograph: Courtesy of Madeline ConnellyBack in town, her uncle raised the alarm. He asked around and learned she had stopped for brunch at a local restaurant. Search and rescue launched a mission.Two Bear Air,a philanthropic helicopter rescue outfit based in Kalispell, Montana, joined the search.The next day, Connelly heard a chopper overhead but did not wave it down. She did not realize it was for her, and worried she would be billed for thousands of dollars. (In fact, Two Bear Air provides rescue services free of charge.)By the third day, she was cold, sick, coughing up blood and hiding in a hollowed-out tree while the weather shifted and sleeted. The chopper flew so close her hair lifted in the rotor wash – but it missed her again.On day four, she was growing weaker, but she kept walking. She found a moose bone – a bad sign, a possible marker of large predators nearby. On day five, the snow finally firmed up and travel got easier. Emotionally raw, she began to cry. She asked forgiveness for things she had said, for people she had hurt. She promised herself she would live differently if she got out.That is when Mogi started barking ferociously at her – she had no idea why the dog was acting strange. She sprinted toward Mogi and solid ground, just as the snow bridge gave way and collapsed. A hidden creek was running below her. She barely escaped with seconds to spare.Later, in a wide-open snowfield, she spotted a helicopter again. She shouted and waved, but it passed. She asked the universe what was wrong with her that they didn’t help her. Defeated, she sat on a rock, chewed a yellow flower, and began to pray.That is when she saw her deceased grandmother.Individuals who are facing extreme hardships while trying to reach safety often experience auditory or visual hallucinations. This phenomenon is referred to as the “third man factor”, likened to the concept of a guardian angel or imaginary friend. From a psychological perspective, this phenomenon is considered a coping mechanism.In that experience, my mind became my best friendMadeline ConnellyIn his 1919 bookSouth, Ernest Shackleton described an incorporeal companion who accompanied him and his crew during their 1914-1917 Antarctic expedition. “During that long and grueling march of 36 hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, it often seemed to me that we were four, not three,” he wrote.A study on adventurers revealed that climbers,solo sailors, shipwreck survivors and polar explorers experienced this phenomenon the most. In his bookTouching the Void, adventurer Joe Simpson recounts hearing a voice while he was trapped in a crevasse.Connelly, for her part, heard encouragement.“You’re going to make it,” her grandmother said. “Go back the way you came.”Terrified but focused, she knew what she had to do: retrace her steps and get out.On the seventh day, she noticed little pink tags with “SAR” written on them and dates marking the search. She spotted boot tracks, which ultimately led her to a group of SAR personnel, including seasonal National Park Service trail crew members, who were also volunteering to find her.Two Bear Air airlifted her to West Glacier, where medical personnel examined her. She struggled to walk for a month due to a fluid buildup in her legs. Hypothermia can cause blood vessels, especially in the legs, to dilate. She credited her dog for keeping her alive.Upon reflection, she realized the mind is one of the most potent forces in the world – capable of being your worst enemy or your greatest ally. “In that experience, my mind became my best friend,” she said. “Now I carry a deep love for myself and for others, because once you’ve seen how dark your own mind can get, you understand that you never truly know what someone else is battling.”‘Lord, have them find me here’While writing this story, I set out to find a man who had gone missing 80 miles north of the Arctic Circle – a case I had first read about in an Alaskan newspaper. Through several sources, I tracked down the man’s phone number and called him.When we first spoke, Lonnie Arnold, an Inuit man from Noatak, told me it was difficult to talk about what happened. “It was a traumatizing time for me,” he said. “I try not to go there in my mind.”He added: “It pretty much took my life away. I was essentially gone, but somehow I survived.”In the first week of February 2012, Arnold and his friend traveled on a snowmobile from Kivalina, Alaska, back toward the nearest village of Noatak, which was 60 miles away.The sun never breached the horizon but was in a state of twilight. The day began clear and cold, allowing them to see for miles, but the temperature remained a frigid -40F. Arnold was dressed in black ski pants, a thick “white man’s” down jacket, a beaver fur hat, thick gloves and black boots.I became a man in the Alaskan wilderness – just not in the way you might thinkRead moreArnold’s friend guided him to a snow-covered mining road that would have led him home to Noatak and then left to head back to his village of Kivalina. Arnold had to cross a small section of the Brooks Range to reach his destination. Soon, a winter blizzard struck, bringing 120mph winds and zero visibility. The fine-grain snow clogged his snowmobile’s carburetor and air intake, causing it to stall.Arnold repeatedly pulled the snowmobile’s starting cord, but the engine would not start. His anger grew with each failed attempt. On the final pull, the rope snapped, sending him flying back 15ft. The snowstorm was so thick that he could not see the snowmobile until it was 3ft away.He stayed with his snowmobile for eight hours – staying put, as experts advise – until the weather cleared. He thought he saw the snow-covered road in the distance. He left the machine and began trudging through waist-deep snow. As the hours passed, his energy waned and darkness fell. Near a depression in the road, he kicked and punched snow into a pile, carving out a small cave to cover his body, just as an arctic fox might. He dug deep enough to shelter and insulate himself from the cold.He woke early the next day. Exhausted, dehydrated and lacking food, he realized that rescuers would never find him in this low spot. Spotting a small hill in the distance, he walked toward it. Upon reaching it, he began climbing; for every step he took, he slipped backward twice as much. By the time he crested it, he was on the verge of surrender.“Lord, have them find me right here. I won’t move anywhere,” he prayed.Summoning what little energy he had left, he created another snow cave, which he later referred to as “his grave”. It was 5ft long, 3ft wide, and 1ft deep. He buried his lower body and chest in the snow and fell asleep. That second night, however, he could not rest. A pack of four wolves howled nearby. He lay still, trying to suppress his fear, hoping they would not sense it, even though, rationally, he knew wolf attacks on humans are rare.As the sky cleared, his mind grew groggy. He thought he heard snowmobiles but had no energy to stand or wave them down, and was frozen in. He stayed there for another night, and more wolves gathered and howled nearby; he thought he heard eight to 12 different ones. Their howls seemed to be growing closer.Somewhere between the third night and the fourth day, he believed he had died.Survivors tend to have purpose, positivity and driveJoe BlattnerIt was then that he saw his deceased grandparents. “My son,” they said, “it’s not your time. What are you doing here? I’m sending you home. You’ve more to do.”“The next thing I know, I was back on earth,” he said. “I heard Sno-Gos [snowmobiles] all around me.”A snowmobile came up to him. The rescuer thought he saw a black trash bag protruding from the snow; it was Arnold’s boot sticking out of the snowbank. His left foot was frozen solid. Snow had gathered 4ft on top of his body, except for his black boot sticking out.The SAR team used an axe, shovel and pick to release him from the jaws of winter.At the hospital, a doctor told him they would have to amputate his foot.“You guys aren’t taking off my foot,” said Arnold. “I’ll die with all my limbs attached.”“We’ll see what we can do about that, Mr Arnold,” said the doctor.They saved his foot – a near-impossible outcome, but sometimes, miracles happen. It’s mostly back to normal – except for the occasional sharp pain that shoots from the center of Arnold’s heel to his pinky toe. “It feels like someone’s cutting my foot with a knife,” he says, “or hammering a nail into it, over and over.”Whether Arnold actually died or he experienced the “third man factor”, is not for me to decide. Maybe he hallucinated his deceased grandparents. Or perhaps the veil between the living and the dead really did thin, just enough for that moment to happen.The will to liveAll of this leaves me with one question: why do some people survive, while others do not?Blattner, the chief of SAR for Missoula county, emphasized that the psychology of lost individuals who survive often share a specific profile. “Survivors tend to have purpose, positivity and drive. They have something to look forward to, celebrate small victories, and occupy their minds with tasks.”Maybe I am one of the lucky ones. As I got lost in Idaho, I took three deep breaths to help calm my racing heart. I took off my pack and put on my warm layers.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Polley.Photograph: Courtesy Benjamin PolleyThat night, I spent hours perched in a tree, worrying about bears waking up from hibernation, the delicious smell of Mexican food in my backpack, hypothermia and the risk of frostbite. It was bitterly cold; my head ached under my beanie, and my fingers and toes hurt. The cold air stung my cheeks.I wished on the occasional shooting star.Koester, the rescue expert, noted that most hikers fear the wrong things. They are terrified of bears, cougars, snakes, scorpions and wolves, yet the probability of encountering one, let alone being attacked, is minuscule. Dramatic, unexpected weather changes and water crossings pose a much greater risk.Finally, after more than eight hours, the marigold moon rose high enough to light my path. I walked to the creek – just a couple of rock hops across, as it turned out – picked up the trail, and followed it for a mile back to my tent. For the rest of the night, I lay awake, thinking about the psychology of getting lost and what allows some people to survive.The next day, I found my headlamp in the backseat of the car."

However, the Guardian has learned that ministers are planning tolift the two-child benefit limit, a key demand of Labour MPs and child poverty campaigners, with officials exploring a new tapered system.In an unusually impassioned speech, to a room of flag-waving delegates, Starmer said he was leading a “fight for the soul” of the country againstReform UK, telling those who had not voted for his party “this is your fight too”.Describing Farage as a“snake oil merchant”, the prime minister told delegates: “We can all see our country faces a choice. A defining choice. Britain stands at a fork in the road. We can choose decency or we can choose division, renewal or decline.“A country – proud of its values, in control of its future, or one that succumbs, against the grain of our history, to the politics of grievance. It is a test. A fight for the soul of our country every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war.”View image in fullscreenPoliticians and delegates wave flags from all parts of the UK as Keir Starmer sought to reclaim the national symbol.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAHowever, Starmer warned the road ahead would not be an easy one. “We need to be clear that our path, the path of renewal, it’s long, it’s difficult, it requires decisions that are not cost-free or easy. Decisions that will not always be comfortable for our party.”But at the end would be a transformed country, he said, as he sought to positionLabouras the agent of change. “We must never, ever find ourselves defending a status quo that manifestly failed working people,” he said.In contrast to Labour’s plan, the path taken by the populist right would lead “to ruin, to chaos, to Britain being poorer in every sense”. He said it was a “tempting path” as it suggested a “miracle cure” to the country’s problems that did not exist.In a direct challenge to Farage, he asked: “Do they love our country? Do they want to serve our country – all of it? Our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country. Or do they just want to stir the pot of division because that’s worked in their interests?”After a week in which migration has been one of the key issues of debate, Starmer said securing the borders was a “reasonable demand” but he hit out at those – including Farage – who he said crossed a “moral line” on the issue.“If you throw bricks and smash up private property that’s not legitimate – that’s thuggery,” he said, arguing that while free speech was a “British value” it did not allow people to “incite racist violence and hatred”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, was forced to backtrack after referring to Farage as “someone who once flirted with Hitler Youth”, in an apparent reference to allegations that emerged in 2013 that the Reform leader sang Nazi songs as a schoolboy. Farage denied the allegations at the time.Starmer said that Labour was the “patriotic party” and sought to reclaim the UK’s flags after a summer in which they had become the focus of a culture war. His vision of Britain combined “the grit of the Lionesses, the swagger of Oasis, the strength of the Red Roses”.In an echo ofGordon Brown’s 2009 conference speech, Starmer listed his government’s achievements so far, including nationalising British Steel, scrapping zero-hours contracts and extending free school meals.He announced that he would scrap the New Labour target of having 50% of young people go to university and replace it with an aim of two-thirds doing either a degree or a “gold standard apprenticeship”.Ministers now want to see at least 10% of young people pursuing higher technical education or apprenticeships that the economy needs by 2040, almost double today’s figure.Starmer also confirmedplans for an NHS online hospital servicefor England.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester who publicly criticised Starmer’s leadership and economic policy and suggested Labour MPs had been urging him to mount a challenge, left the conference venue before the speech.In a veiled criticism of Burnham, who said last week that ministers should stop being “in hock” to the bond markets, Starmer accused his critics of a “desire to avoid reality”. “A Labour party that cannot control spending is a Labour party that cannot govern in our times,” he said.Responding to Starmer with a live broadcast on Tuesday afternoon, Farage vowed to “teach Starmer a lesson next May that British political history will never forget”. He also accused Starmer of threatening the safety of his campaigners because his remarks would “incite and encourage the radical left”.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabour conference 2025Economic growth (GDP)Reform UKNigel FarageLabour conferenceLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is a known advocate, calling the cap introduced under the Conservatives a “spiteful policy”.The prime minister also dropped a strong hint in his address to the conference, saying the change his government hoped to deliver was the “basic, ordinary hope of a better future for our children”.‘I have £7 in my bank account’: how the two-child benefit cap changed BritainRead moreNo decision has been taken on what form the change will take. Officials are said to be wary of the escalating costs for extremely large families – those with more than six children may be entitled to thousands of pounds more in benefits if the cap is lifted completely.There is also a parallel pressure to bear down on economic inactivity, and caution about a policy change that could incentivise people to stay out of the workforce.The Treasury is exploring instead whether the additional benefits might be limited to three or four children, or whether there could be a tapered rate introduced so parents would get the most for their first child and less for subsequent children.Another option under consideration is to lift the cap only for working parents on universal credit, to encourage more people into the workforce.Government sources said they expected Reeves to take action in her November budget. “If we’re going to do it, we have to lift the cap, not just language,” one said.15:04Raising kids in poverty: The UK’s ‘inhumane’ two child limitAnything other than a full lifting of the limit is likely to draw criticism from child poverty campaigners because of the effect it might have on certain areas or communities. The End ChildPovertyCoalition said: “This policy must be scrapped in full for all. Otherwise some families will be forced to remain in poverty because of this government’s choices.”The Resolution Foundation said in March that a three-child limit or a tapered system would leave between 120,000 and 350,000 more children in poverty that if the cap were fully scrapped. It would save between £900m and £2.3bn a year if Reeves continued with a restricted system. About 59% of familiesaffected by the two-child limithave someone in work.Inhis speechat Labour party conference, Starmer gave a strong hint the government would take further action on child poverty. He said it had alreadyextended free school mealsto those on universal credit, calling it the “first step on our journey to end child poverty”.“We have walked that road before, and we will walk that road again, because a Britain where no child is hungry, when no child is held back by poverty, that’s a Britain built for all,” he said.Reeves told the Times this week that she expected to respond to the child poverty taskforce findings in November. “I’m a Labour chancellor and I want to reduce child poverty. I don’t want to see children growing up in poverty in Britain. Of course I don’t. We’ve got the child poverty taskforce report coming out shortly and we’ll respond to that at the budget.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Changes to the eligibility criteria might reduce that figure, with Reeves already facing a difficult budget on 26 November.The former prime minister Gordon Brown, who has called the two-child limit “cruel”,argued last monththat higher taxes on the gambling industry should be introduced this autumn and the revenue used to scrap it.Sources at the Treasury, however, have said those taxes are already baked into its calculations for filling an expected £30bn hole in the government’s finances caused by an expected productivity downgrade by the Office forBudgetResponsibility and U-turns on welfare and cuts to the winter fuel allowance.Save the Children’s director of UK impact, Dan Paskins, said: “We agree with the prime minister that action they have taken so far on child poverty is the ‘first step’. The only logical next move is to scrap the two-child limit to benefits in full at the autumn budget. Time is ticking for Britain’s children.”The Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesperson, Steve Darling, said: “Any serious child poverty strategy must start with scrapping this unfair policy.”Reform UK has already called on the government to scrap the cap. However, the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said the Conservatives would oppose the change. “Scrapping the two-child benefit isn’t just irresponsible. It’s unfair,” he said.“Rachel Reeves must come clean. Where’s the money coming from? Will it be more and more debt, or even higher taxes? The UK is in the grip of Labour’s cost-of-living crisis and the public deserve the truth.”A government spokesperson said: “We are investing £500m in children’s development through the rollout of best start family hubs, extending free school meals and ensuring the poorest don’t go hungry in the holidays through a new £1bn crisis support package.”Explore more on these topicsChild benefitsWelfarePovertyBenefitsBudgetRachel ReevesKeir StarmerShareReuse this content"

At least 31 Palestinians were killed across Gaza on Tuesday, local hospitals said.Asked how longHamashad to respond, Trump said on Tuesday: “We’re going to do about three or four days.” He later warned that Hamas would face severe consequences if they refused.“We have one signature that we need, and that signature will pay in hell if they don’t sign,” Trump told US generals and admirals gathered at a military base in Quantico, Virginia. The president has already made clear that he would supportIsraelcontinuing the war if Hamas rejects the proposal, or reneges on the deal at any stage.During Monday’s press conference in Washington, Netanyahu told Trump that “if Hamas rejects your plan … or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself”. Trump said Israel would have his “full backing” in such circumstances.In Israel, media and politicians broadly welcomed Netanyahu’s announcement that he supported the 20-point plan, which meets many of Israel’s principal demands.The plan calls for the disarmament of Hamas and bans it from any future political role inGaza, which would be run by a technocratic transitional authority headed by Trump himself. It requires the militant Islamist organisation to release the 48 Israeli hostages it still holds – of whom fewer than half are thought still to be alive – within 72 hours of a ceasefire coming into effect, but offers the gradual withdrawal of Israeli military forces to a buffer zone along the perimeter and a surge in humanitarian aid, desperately needed by the 2.3 million inhabitants of the devastated territory.Gaza would then be run by a postwar transitional authority staffed by apolitical technocrats but headed by Trump himself.In a video statement posted on his Telegram channel after his joint press conference with Trump, Netanyahu stressed that the Israeli military would stay in most of Gaza, and that he had not agreed to a Palestinian state during his talks with the US president. “We will recover all our hostages, alive and well, while the [Israeli military] will remain in most of the Gaza Strip,” he said.Hamas has not issued its response, with its officials only saying they are reviewing the proposal, which will be discussed internally and with allied Palestinian armed factions.A Hamas source told Agence France-Presse that the group had “begun a series of consultations within its political and military leaderships, both insidePalestineand abroad”, which would “take several days due to the complexities of communication among leadership members and movements”.The proposal requires Israel to release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences.Turkey, Egypt and Qatar have backed the plan and may be able to put pressure on Hamas, analysts said. A Qatari official said Qatar would be meeting Hamas and Turkey on Tuesday to discuss the plan.Trump’s peace proposal welcomed by world leaders but Palestinians remain scepticalRead moreThe Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but could eventually take on some kind of a role in a postwar Gaza government, welcomed Trump’s “sincere and determined efforts”.However, Palestinian factions allied with Hamas appeared to reject the plan initially, according to local media reports, and a source close to Hamas told Reuters it was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group.Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally, said the plan would encourage further aggression against Palestinians. “Through this, Israel is attempting – via the United States – to impose what it could not achieve through war,” the group said in a statement.In Israel, many commentators welcomed the proposal and those usually supportive of Netanyahu were careful to highlight last-minute concessions they said the Israeli prime minister had obtained.View image in fullscreenIsraelis marching earlier this month in Jerusalem in a demonstration organised by the families of the hostages in Gaza.Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty ImagesFar-right ministers, however, have vowed to quit the ruling coalition if Netanyahu halts Israel’s offensive in Gaza without achieving “total victory” or securing the territory for Israeli settlement. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s finance minister, said the plan was a “resounding diplomatic failure” that would “end in tears”.Dr Ofer Guterman, an analyst at the Institute of National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said Israel had changed its “paradigm” and now saw Arab states as potential partners. “Israel’s strategy had until now been based on a clash between Israel and Hamas to be handled basically through a military effort,” he said.Foreign leaders, painfully aware of the failure of multiple previous ceasefire efforts, rushed to offer support on Tuesday.Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Trump’s plan was the “best chance for ending the war” while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, welcomed the US president’s “commitment to ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of all hostages”. Moscow also backed the proposal.Pakistan, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt on Tuesday issued a joint statement supporting Trump’s plan, and saying they were ready to work constructively with the US and others to secure peace.The plan would in effect place Gaza under international control, deploy an international security force, likely composed of Arab or Muslim troops supplied by a regional power, to keep order and install a “board of peace”, headed by Trump and possibly including the former British prime minister Tony Blair, to oversee the administration and reconstruction.What’s in Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza?Read moreThe international security force would also train Palestinian police to take over law enforcement.In Gaza, Israeli tanks advanced further into Gaza City amid intensive bombardment of residential districts there, while al-Awda hospital said Israeli troops opened fire, killing 17 Palestinians and wounding 33 others while they were attempting to access humanitarian aid in Netzarim, the Israeli-controlled corridor that bisects northern and southern Gaza.An Israeli strike later in the day killed four people in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp, the hospital said. Israeli forces also hit two tents housing displaced Palestinian families in Muwasi, the crowded coastal area.One of the strikes killed seven people, including four women and a child, who had fled from Gaza City earlier this month to escape Israel’s intensifying offensive there, al-Aqsa hospital said.The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the shooting or strikes. It said in a statement that over the past 24 hours, its troops killed several armed militants and struck more than 160 targets, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts.Deaths caused by hunger and malnutrition in Gaza have increased to 453, including 150 children, health authorities say. Famine was declared in parts of the territory last month.The war began after Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,219 people, mostly civilians, and in which more than 250 hostages were taken.Israel’s offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed 66,055 Palestinians, also mostly civilians. More than 160,000 are thought to have been injured.Explore more on these topicsGazaHamasIsraelPalestineDonald TrumpUS foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Robinson is a former leader of the English Defence League and the monitoring group Hope Not Hate assesses him to be the “best-known far-right extremist in Britain”.Allegations also expected to be broadcast include claims of excessive force against suspects being held at the police station, including one youngster, as well as anti-Muslim comments and anti-female comments.An undercoverBBCreporter working as a member of civilian staff recorded the material that led to the allegations.The looming revelations were discussed on a conference call of police chiefs across England and Wales on Tuesday and Rowley has cancelled some scheduled engagements on Thursday to deal with the expected fallout.Charing Cross police station is the source of a scandal that contributed to the ousting of then commissioner Cressida Dick in 2022.An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women,the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place from 2016 to 2018.Rowley, who came to office vowing to clean up the Met, wants to show that his force will be ruthless in dealing with allegations of wrongdoing, which occurred on and off duty between August 2024 and January this year.The IOPC said the latest allegations about Charing Cross had led to 11 individuals being under investigation for potential gross misconduct.One of those is a police constable who is under criminal investigation on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.The watchdog said it had obtained CCTV from the custody area and was looking for detainees subjected to alleged wrongdoing, and in one case, an officer alleged to have been abused.Amanda Rowe, the IOPC’s director, said: “As a result of our appeal within the Met, we have already had a number of police staff who previously worked at Charing Cross station contact us with information and we are following up each report.”The Met has disbanded the custody team at Charing Cross, moving them elsewhere in the force and said it had reformed the leadership covering the police station. It said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.The position of Rowley, commissioner since 2022 and with two years of his term left to serve, is not thought to be in danger from the revelations. The key political support he depends on isLondonmayor Sadiq Khan, who is in effect the capital’s police and crime commissioner.The mayor’s aides said Khan believed that Rowley had acted robustly in dealing with the allegations.Neither the Met nor the IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations and both hope the BBC will provide them with it after the programme is broadcast.Explore more on these topicsPoliceLondonMetropolitan policeCrimeMark RowleyBBCTommy RobinsonnewsShareReuse this content"

They were outvoted by a majority of MPC members who said a slowdown in economic growth would support a fall in inflation over the next year to 2% from a likely peak of 4% in September.Reeves said at the Labour conference that the economic stability provided by the government meant ministers could take some credit for five cuts to interest rates over the last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said on Tuesday it was unlikely that the strength of inflation this year would persist into 2026.She said: “The good news is that this ‘hump’ reflects external shocks, and in the current environment it is unlikely, in my judgment, to lead to additional inflationary pressures.“Moreover, I have not seen any evidence yet to suggest that the underlying disinflationary process from past shocks is veering off track.

Often the cost is split into three monthly instalments, and if someone keeps to their repayment plan, they will not usually pay interest or charges.However, regulators and consumer bodies have long voiced concerns about the sector’s rapid growth, amid worries that some people could end up taking out loans they cannot afford to pay back on time, thereby incurring charges and tipping them into debt.This summer the Financial Conduct Authorityoutlined details of its plansto regulate the £13bn BNPL market, which could require lenders to carry out affordability checks on even the smallest loans.Younger people, particularly those in their 20s and 30s, remain the most frequent users – fuelled by BNPL providers targeting them via social media ads.However, the biggest growth in user numbers occurred among 55- to 64-year-olds.“In this age group, the proportion of BNPL users more than doubled from 10% in 2023 to 21% in 2024,” the report said.Other surveys have noted an increase in demand among older people, with some of this attributed tothose on tight budgets using BNPLto spread out payments for essentials. There has been speculation that for those familiar with old-style interest-free credit and hire purchase, this newer type of credit does not necessarily carry a stigma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, the “vast majority” of consumers reported using one (or more) of three brands – Klarna, Clearpay or PayPal – suggesting that those companies dominate the UK market.The report also found that, as digital options became more widespread, cash use “continued its long-term decline” in 2024. For the first time, cash accounted for less than 10% of all payments. Meanwhile, 30% of adults – 16.9 million people – used cash once a month or less.UK Finance also said there had been a “surge” in the use of mobile wallets for online and contactless payments, and more than half of UK adults (57%) used wallets last year – up from 42% the year before.Explore more on these topicsBuy now, pay laterFinancial sectorBorrowing & debtnewsShareReuse this content"

Some in Washington see Lukashenko as a potential interlocutor withVladimir Putinon ending the war in Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, has privately said he places a high value on Lukashenko’s insights into the Russian leader, according to a source familiar with the talks.View image in fullscreenAlexander Lukashenko meets John Coale, deputy special envoy to the Ukraine.Photograph: Belarusian presidential press service/AFP/Getty ImagesEuropean diplomatic sources have meanwhile said there are tentative discussions in Brussels over whether the EU’s policy of isolating Belarus remains effective, and if offering Lukashenko a way out of Moscow’s shadow should be considered. Belarus has also signalled openness to talks, the two sources said.“People who hadn’t dared say the word ‘president’ since 2020 now want to talk,” Lukashenko boasted to a domestic audience in early July. “They are discussing global issues with your president – that already counts for something. It shows they respect his opinion.”For much of his three decades in power, Lukashenko – often described as Europe’s last dictator – built his survival on the art of hedging between Moscow and the west.He relied on generous subsidised Russian oil and gas to keep Belarus’s state-run economy afloat, while leaving the door ajar to Brussels whenever Moscow pressed too hard, occasionally dangling promises of democratic reform that never materialised.“There is a persistent myth that Lukashenko is happy to be a vassal to Moscow. In reality, his room for manoeuvre has yo-yoed over the years, but he has never ceased looking for ways to broaden his options,” the European official said.It was theriggedpresidential election of 2020 and the brutal crackdown that followed that severed Minsk’s relations with Europe and the US – and left Lukashenko dependent on Moscow for his survival.View image in fullscreenPolice officers detain protesters during a rally in Minsk in September 2020.Photograph: AP“Lukashenko is an addict: his drug is power. Like any addict, he’ll do and sell anything for one last dose,” said Sergei Sparysh, a 39-year-old activist who was recently released from a Belarusian jail as part of Lukashenko’s attempt to curry favour with the west. “To stay in power, he sold Belarus to Russia.”Russia stepped in with loans, discounted energy and security guarantees to shore up his position at his most vulnerable moment, and when Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the embrace grew tighter still.Belarus served as a staging ground and logistical hub for Russian troops, its territory providing the launchpad for assaults on Ukraine from the north, only 90 miles from Kyiv. Since the full-scale invasion, Minsk and Moscow have signed a sweeping security pact, and Lukashenko – after years of resistance – agreed to host Russian nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil.Still, Lukashenko pushed against Putin’s pressure to commit his own troops to the war, knowing that such a move would be deeply unpopular not only among the public but also within his own armed forces.Belarus’s economic reliance on Moscow, however, only deepened as western sanctions turned the country into a vital conduit for Moscow, generating a temporary boom in exports and state revenues.Belarusian factories also ramped up production, supplying Russia with clothes and essential components for the war. But the yields did not last. As Russia’s economy slowed under the weight of sanctions and war spending, Belarus was dragged down alongside it.View image in fullscreenPeople walk next to a 1979 ‘Solidarity’ bas-relief in Minsk.Photograph: Pavel Bednyakov/APOn a Guardian trip to Minsk this month, with its squeaky-clean streets and a skyline of Soviet monuments dotted with casinos catering to Russian visitors, the city carried a heavy atmosphere. Few residents dared speak openly about the economic slowdown. “We have become too close to Russia; we don’t have any other alternative any more,” said Natalya, who asked for her last name to be omitted.Shortages of everyday staples, including potatoes, have become emblematic of the strain, prompting the government to reintroduce Soviet-style price caps. Mass emigration has deepened the labour shortage, leading Lukashenko to offer 150,000 Pakistani workers to fill the gap.The fragility of the economy was further highlighted this month when Poland temporarily closed its border, cutting off a profitable supply route to China.Lukashenko has been unusually candid about the extent of the problems. “We need to pull through,” he told officials in a televised meeting. “We have to move, we have to trade, we have to sort out industry.”In the face of mounting economic pressure, Lukashenko has returned to what one European official described as “the good old tightrope” of manoeuvring between Putin and the west.View image in fullscreenJoint Russia-Belarus ‘Zapad 2025’ military drills near Borisov, Belarus.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersIn an apparent showcase of his willingness to engage, he this month invited US military officers to observe the Zapad-2025 war exercises – the first such participation since Russia invaded Ukraine – and publiclyclaimedthat Belarusian forces had helped intercept Russian drones heading for Poland. During a Guardian visit to Zapad-2025 this month, which has raised western fears that the drills could provide cover for a new Russian military build-up, Belarusian officials stressed a simple message: they had nothing to hide.“It is hard to imagine the kind of openness that we are showing and ensuring at the exercise,” defence minister Viktor Khrenin said.Display of firepower in Russia-Belarus war games stirs unease across EuropeRead moreA central question is how much room Moscow will allow its closest ally to pursue a tentative opening to the west – and whether he can act independently from Russia at all.Yauheni Preiherman, founder of the Minsk Dialogue Council on International Relations, a thinktank that works with the Belarusian foreign ministry, said: “It’s not about how far the Russians will ‘allow’ us to go. It’s about how smart we can be in working with the reality and gradually expanding our room for manoeuvre.“Nobody here is crazy enough to try to be another Ukraine – everyone understands the risks. But there is a determination, sometimes unspoken, to seize any circumstances that would let us reopen that space and work more independently.”Central to Lukashenko’s bargaining has been thereleaseof dozens of political prisoners – a move critics describe as a cynical ploy, given that repression at home has shown no sign of easing.View image in fullscreenReleased prisoners from Belarus are welcomed in front of the US embassy in Vilnius.Photograph: Valdemar Doveiko/EPAFor the Belarusian strongman, analysts and insiders argue, the recent diplomatic outreach is a logical move given his obsession with preserving sovereignty alongside his need to retain Russian support.Artyom Shraibman, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said: “Dictators don’t like being dependent on friends. He has always had an instinct to distance himself from Moscow.”The recent push is also reinforced by a fear of missing out. While any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine still appears distant, there is concern in Minsk that Belarus would be left out of future sanctions relief demanded by Moscow, said Preiherman.Lukashenko’s outreach so far has yielded modest gains.After the release of the political prisoners earlier this month, the US announced partial relief on Belavia, Belarus’s national airline, marking the first easing of restrictions in years.“Sanctions were lifted, albeit only for one company, but an important one,” said Shraibman. “The symbolism matters more: it sets a precedent and opens a bargaining season. And Lukashenko has things to trade.”More than 1,000 political prisoners remain behind bars, according to human rights groups, and Lukashenko’s regime has jailed new ones in recent weeks.Washington, for its part, sees additional benefits in engagement. “Americans think it’s helpful as an additional channel with Putin,” said Preiherman, describing him as “the best Kremlinologist in the world”.“He is one of the only people who has dealt with Moscow for 30 years.”But Shraibman cautioned against viewing Lukashenko as an independent arbiter, saying it was “crystal clear that his loyalties remained with Moscow.”View image in fullscreenAlexander Lukashenko shakes hands with Vladimir Putin during a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/AFP/Getty ImagesLukashenko now appears to be placing his bets on the Trump administration, believing that rapprochement with Washington will push Europe into falling in line. “He dismisses Europe’s subjectivity and believes Trump can order them around,’ said Shraibman.Few think there is much appetite in Europe to offer Lukashenko sanctions relief unless far-reaching concessions are made.But in Brussels, there appears to be quiet soul-searching over whether the EU’s hawkish stance on Belarus – it has long ruled out contact with Lukashenko’s regime – has reached the limits of its usefulness, according to people familiar with the discussions.“Maximum pressure has not worked,” one EU diplomat said. “After five years of isolation, we have not achieved our stated goals. Belarus is closer to Russia, and repression has not stopped.”What should replace the current policy remains unclear, the diplomat added, given Lukashenko’s refusal to compromise or break with Moscow.“Rapprochement with Lukashenko has its limits – he knows how to play this game inside out.”Explore more on these topicsAlexander LukashenkoBelarusDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the 22-year-old, on a break from her studies in Europe, told friends she was saddened by what she saw.While she could hear conversations in Tibetan everywhere, all of the signage was in Mandarin Chinese. Every shop and restaurant she passed appeared to be Chinese owned, not Tibetan. Every lamp-post was decorated with Chinese flags; an endless river of red flowing above them against a cloudy summer sky.It felt to her like Tibetan culture and identity was being erased. The experience started her on a path that would end with her arrest and disappearance.She always spoke about the problems in China faced by Mongolians, Tibetans and UyghursKalsang YarphelHer story appears to be the latest example of Beijing targeting activism taking place overseas. Last year the Chinese authorities put abounty on a 19-year-old in Leeds for her activismin support of democracy in Hong Kong.Growing up a Buddhist, Zhang became increasingly interested in the Tibetan form of the religion at high school inChinaand began practising it soon afterwards. Her friends say she also became more aware of the plight of ethnic minorities.After arriving inFrancein 2022, she became outspoken about human rights abuses, and last year began writing for a pro-Tibetan newsletter run by the activist group Chinese Youth Stand For Tibet (CYST).“She always spoke about the problems inChinafaced by Mongolians, Tibetans and Uyghurs. She says she was really upset in school because she couldn’t really share what she felt,” says Kalsang Yarphel, Zhang’s Tibetan partner of two years.“But once she started writing [for the pro-Tibetan newsletter] and saw that people around her really appreciated her work and her heart, she was less depressed,” he says.View image in fullscreenChinese tourists dressed in Tibetan costume pose for a photo before the Dalai Lamas’ traditional winter residence, the Potala Palace, in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa.Photograph: CNS/GettyChinaintroduced a draft law this monththat bans actions that “damage ethnic unity” even if they take place overseas.

Neither her family nor friends have had any contact with her since then.She is believed to be being held in a detention centre in her home city of Changsha, in central China on suspicion of “inciting separatism”. The charge is being widely used to convict Tibetans and Uyghurs as part of Beijing’s escalating crackdown on separatist movements. If found guilty, Zhang faces a prison sentence of up to 15 years.Kalsang Yarphel says her arrest came as a big shock. “It’s really hard,” he says. “My head is burning.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She had travelled through Tibetan regions previously without any trouble.“I don’t think she expected this heavy charge, because we [at the newsletter and CYST] are not advocating for separatism. I don’t want her to be in jail for nothing,” says Duan, who added that although the group has been targeted by authorities in the past, no contributor had ever been detained.Zhang spoke about wanting Chinese people to better understand Tibetan culture and identity. “We [at CYST] would like to hold more discussions between Tibetans and Han Chinese people, so that the two sides can hear each other’s voices. I think this is so important,” she said, in a recording made in May and shared with the Guardian by friends shortly before she went to China.Yicheng Huang, who was teaching Zhang the Tibetan language online, says activists outside China should have done more to prioritise her safety. “She’s very young,” he says. “She always had passion and ideas, always was courageous.

She didn’t realise how dangerous it was.”View image in fullscreenThe Dalai Lama at a ceremony near the Indian town of Dharamsala, where the Tibetan government in exile has been based since 1960.Photograph: N Kulkarni/AFP/GettyNot long before Zhang’s arrest and disappearance, theDalai Lama, who as Tibetan Buddhism’s spiritual leader has long been a thorn in the side of Beijing’s attempts to suppress Tibetan identity, celebrated his 90th birthday.In an act of defiance against China, he announced to Tibetan monks and leaders that he planned to remain in the role until he died, after which hisinner circle would have the “sole authority” to locate his successor(the child in whom Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama’s spirit is reborn).

If she wasn’t around when you were young, this show will make you wish she wasChitra RamaswamyTue 30 Sep 2025 17.20 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 17.22 EDTShareFor the sake of the Swifties, let’s get straight down to business. What are the juicy reveals in Taylor, the two-part Channel 4 documentary strategically positioned to air in the overwrought run-up to the release of The Life of a Showgirl? Well, there’s the camp titbit about her first tour bus being decked out in leopard print and previously belonging to Cher; and at one point Robert Ellis Orrall, who co-produced her debut album, deftly fans out a bunch of CDs of unreleased songs like a croupier in a casino.For the minority who arenotSwifties, these takeaways are about as tantalising as a snake emoji (her snake era in 2017 marked the beginning of Swift’s iconic promo cycle for sixth album, Reputation). All I can say is: Taylor is not for you, babes. Because we are now in the era of putting aside our curmudgeonly Madonna-did-it-first cynicism to bask in the 100-watt joy generated by two ultra-earnest teen American Swifties (Niamh Adkins and Nina Haines, who deserve a Gogglebox show of their own) intensely dissecting their icon. “I just fell in love with how she celebrated girlhood,” sighs Haines. “She gave me permission to yearn.” This is Swift’s power in a nutshell. And, like yearning, it’s limitless.Coming five years after the slick, stage-managed Netflix documentaryMiss Americana, this one is more … popcorny. (Neither approach brings us any closer to therealTaylor, obviously.) The action toggles back and forth between years – sorry, eras – as a former manager, producer, bandmate, PR guru, music journalists and superfans reflect on Taylor Swift the global phenomenon, brand, proxy for girls’ feelings, bellwether for how society views women, and so on. I would have liked more on Swift herself, her childhood especially, to get a sense of the conditions that produced a girl with the gumption to “go to every major label in Nashville and say: ‘I’m Taylor, I’m 11, and I want a record deal!’” Beyond some archive karaoke footage and home video of her parents arriving home with baby Taylor, there isn’t much to go on.View image in fullscreenThey deserve a Gogglebox show of their own … Swifties Niamh Adkins and Nina Haines.Photograph: Channel 4 Sandpaper FilmsHolly Armstrong, AKA the first Swiftie, recalls stumbling upon her heroine singing on a makeshift stage on a New Jersey boardwalk in 2003, a seismic encounter that eventually led to their meeting. Early band member Emily Poe Stumler remembers how “incredibly driven and young” Swift was, and how it was “like having a little sister who is also your boss”. Not exactly the stuff of tabloid toplines. Things get slightly more spicy with Rick Barker, Swift’s manager from 2007 to 2008 (the poor man didn’t last long despite their relationship being, in his words, “more like two girlfriends”). He recalls the Kanye-Taylor feud – given a disproportionate amount of airtime, along with the predictable rundown of her boyfriends – which started when Kanye West stormed the stage of the 2009 MTV Video Music awards while Swift was accepting an award: “Someone give Kanye a hug! You cannot buy that kind of publicity.”As for Swift’s decision a decade later to mobilise her ferociously loyal army of fans against Scooter Braun, the investor who bought the masters to her first six albums and, worse still, used to manage Kanye West, Barker is Team Braun all the way. “No one stole her music,” he says. “Scooter Braun made a very good business decision. End of story.” Actually, the story ended when Swift re-recorded four of the albums and laterbought back the rights to the master recordingsof all six, eloquently making the point that artists should own their work. And women have had enough.On politics, Swift has been accused of pandering to the right, not being political enough and, as English professor Elizabeth Scala says, “being too late to the party, too privileged, too white”. Essentially, says journalist Zing Tsjeng, she can’t win. During the 2018 US midterm elections, by which point she was being claimed by white supremacists as their all-American Christian goddess, she finally broke her silence, damning the far-right politics of Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican candidate for Senate, and asking her fans to get out and vote. In 12 hours, 35,000 people registered to vote.Towering above it all is Swift’s extraordinary ability to turn any conflict to her advantage, usually by turning it into a multimillion selling platinum album. Or, in Swiftie-speak, to reclaim her narrative – as when critic Bob Lefsetz wrote Swift’s career was over after a flat performance with Stevie Nicks at the 2010 Grammys and she came back with the anti-bullying anthem Mean. “Every girl who was bullied knows every word to Mean,” says Haines. Then she and Adkins belt out lines from the song and I find myself wishing, not for the first time, thatTaylor Swifthad been around when I was a girl.Less attention is paid to Swift’s music and songwriting craft, which is what happens when a female pop star goes stratospheric. Analysis turns, as it inevitably does in Taylor, to her capacity for reinvention, steely backbone and ability to manipulate her own image. All of which are sexist ways to avoid sayingshe’s successful because she’s good. In a telling moment, music PR Alan Edwards, making the point that every brand reaches saturation point eventually, compares Swift to chocolate, coffee, “whatever it is we consume”. I prefer the Swiftie take: “She gives us built-in community,” says Haines. “Take me to church, mama … Taylor is Jesus!”Taylor is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTaylor SwiftPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

The art critic is impressed. “Imagine twisting yourself into that position,” he murmurs, as the camera takes in the skewwhiff limbs, oscillating breasts and, in the middle of it all, a scrotum stretched like so much ninth-century bubblegum. “You should get an Olympic medal for doing that.” As, indeed, should Januszczak, whose ability to survey said vision without a) fainting or b) bursting into tears is an achievement in itself.The veteran critic and broadcaster is in India – specifically, he is visiting the extraordinary “love temples” of Khajuraho – for the first episode of a three-part documentary in which he explores art’s most controversial topics (later episodes focus on horror and – zoinks – Satan).View image in fullscreenHis ability not to faint or weep is a true achievement … Waldemar Januszczak at the love temples of Khajuraho, India, for Art’s Most Erotic.Photograph: ZCZ Films/SkyThis, clearly, is no place for prudes or shrinking violets, or those who insist on covering up the legs of their piano lest a passing dowager spot them and immediately fall pregnant. Art’s Most Erotic is, unequivocally, filth. From the aforementioned Indian temples our host travels to Japan, where a look at the blisteringly explicit Shunga pornography of the 18th and 19th centuries ensures there’s no letup on the bum front. There is a visit to Pompeii, with its overendowed clay statuettes (ancient Romans apparently found large penises “funny”). And then we’re off to Vienna, Naples, France and, finally, Cookham in Berkshire, where an analysis of the “edgy, nervy eroticism” of Stanley Spencer provides this multi-buttocked package tour with a very British send-off.Art’s Most Erotic is not, mercifully, one of those celebrity “journeys” in which, after a succession of tiresome set-pieces, our guide finally emerges, blinking, from the steamy pink tumult and declares himself a better man. There are no personal anecdotes, cameos from famous friends, or bits where Januszczak shoehorns himself into the nipple-studded narrative. Nor is this a place for embarrassment or jokes of the phwoar variety. At no point does the critic puff out his cheeks like bagpipes while perusing, say, the bulbously breasted fertility figurines of Upper Palaeolithic France, and proceed to make the sort of noise Sid James made wheneverBarbara Windsor’s bra twanged off in a Carry On film.Instead, it’s an unapologetically serious affair, with Januszczak searching for deeper meanings, noble(r) intentions and, ultimately, the historical and cultural significance of all this bygone business.View image in fullscreenIn the mood? … A work by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in Art’s Most Erotic.Photograph: ZCZ Films/SkyNot that the results are dry or inaccessible. Far from it. They are frequently an absolute hoot, with our guide’s gift for conversational pizzazz ensuring even the scenes in which he horses around feel fresh and imaginative rather than laboured or gimmicky.And so we get Januszczak galumphing across a beach, trousers rolled up and ankles glinting pinkly as he tells us about history’s various depictions of Zeus (“the Harvey Weinstein of Olympus”). We get an impassioned analysis of the Kama Sutra while the critic plays poker with a couple of thoroughly tickled Indian volunteers (“these days it’s thought of as a sex manual, but that’s just our dirty minds. It’s about love!”). A brief ode to Toulouse-Lautrec’s depictions of the lives of Parisian brothel workers, meanwhile, is delivered from a fittingly rumpled bed, with Januszczak peering anxiously at us from the depths of the quilt like an elderly aunt too timid to inquire as to the whereabouts of le chamber pot.The 10 best works of erotic artRead moreReally, he says, the depiction of sex has always been more interesting and rewarding when its bum cheeks are garnished with a sprig of empathy. With Art’s Most Erotic, Januszczak has once again succeeded in crocheting the cerebral into something on which you could place a cupcake.“Yes,” you think, as you watch the septuagenarian bumble past a succession of enormously balled Shunga copulators. “This sort of faintly comforting erudition is just the ticket in these days of veneered celebrity yahoos, intellectually marooned Love Islanders and the like.” Ultimately, no amount of jackhammering antique buttocks can muffle your gasps of gratitude that there is still, in 2025, a place where Januszczak’s brand of factual entertainment – considered, accessible, unapologetically adult – is allowed to exist. Three cheers, then, forSky Arts, whose own enormous-balled MO must be protected at all costs.Art’s Most Erotic aired on Sky Arts and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewArtSky ArtsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she’s directed – and starred in – a powerful debut filmRyan GilbeyTue 30 Sep 2025 12.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareBorn in the US, raised in apartheid-eraSouth Africa, a reluctant star in her 20s following her big break in Schindler’s List, and now a first-time director at the age of 60, Embeth Davidtz knows what it means to be an outsider. “I’ve always had the feeling,” she says, “that I don’t quite belong.”Normally found in Los Angeles – where she lives in a house once owned by Julie Andrews, with her husband, the entertainment lawyer Jason Sloane – Davidtz is today in Cape Town for work and family commitments. Speaking by video call from a cream-and-beige bedroom, wearing a white top and glasses with peach-coloured frames, her brunette hair tied back, she looks the picture of serenity. The effect is completed by her voice, which soothed millions of children when she starred as the perfect teacher, Miss Honey, in the 1996 film of Roald Dahl’s Matilda.Through the Bobo’s credulous voiceover, we learn that 'any African might be a terrorist'Even Miss Trunchbull, though, would be intimidated by the bitter, sozzled, shotgun-toting character Davidtz plays in her directorial debut. She adapted Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight from Alexandra Fuller’s 2001 memoir about her childhood in Zimbabwe, then called Rhodesia. Narrowing the action of the book down to a few months in 1980, when the country was approaching the elections that would see it regain its independence, Davidtz’s film filters events through the eyes and ears of Bobo, played by Lexi Venter, an eight-year-old white girl living on a farm with her older sister and their fearful, racist parents. It is through Bobo’s credulous voiceover that we learn how “any African might be a terrorist”; through watching her at play with Black children, whom she refers to as “my boys”, that we appreciate how deeply she has been contaminated.View image in fullscreen‘Like a wild lion cub’ … Lexi Venter as Bobo in Don’t Lets Go To The Dogs Tonight.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyDavidtz awarded herself the part of the girl’s volatile mother, who is given to stumbling around in her negligee shooting at snakes, or getting on her high horse, literally, to try to drive Black locals off “her” land. The role was meant to be bigger. “I adapted the book partly because I wanted to play the mother,” she says, “and to have a chance to chew up the scenery.” But once she realised Bobo’s perspective would be the most revealing, she pared back her own screen time. Wise move: it would be foolhardy indeed to compete with this feral newcomer, who zooms around on a tiny motorcycle in leather boots and tumbleweed hair with a rifle strapped to her back like a mini-Mad Max.Directing her was adventure enough. “Lexi is curious and funny and free,” says Davidtz. “But if I ever asked her to ‘act’ or to learn dialogue, then it was bad and we couldn’t use it. I had to grab things, call lines out to her, improvise stuff. I flew by the seat of my pants. It’s like taking a lion cub in the wild and observing its behaviour, throwing something in there that might distract it or elicit a reaction.”Making the movie was never solely about Davidtz grabbing a plum part for herself. There was also the attraction of autobiography-by-proxy. “I’d been trying to write about my upbringing,” she says. “Then when I read Alexandra’s memoir, I realised I could never match the way she captured herself as a vivid, ill-informed child. It was also more dramatic than my life, but there were enough little arteries running between them that I felt deeply connected to it. I remember saying to Alexandra, ‘I think I know how to tell this story.’”People drove so fast. Violence was commonplaceLike Bobo, young Davidtz had to scramble to make sense of the madness and cruelty around her. Her parents, who are both South African, had been studying in the US when she was born, then moved back to Johannesburg when she was eight so that her father could take a job as a chemical engineer. How did they prepare her for the starkly unequal society they were about to re-join? “They didn’t prepare me at all!” she says. “They didn’t prepare me foranythingin life. I was raised by wolves in a way. I don’t remember them saying, ‘It’s going to be different here.’”Different would be an understatement. “There was this incredible aggression everywhere. People drove so fast. Violence was commonplace. I guess the fish rots from the head down. You’d see people being put in the back of police vans. I saw two drunk white blokes punching this Black guy who wasn’t even doing anything. There was a creeping idea, not as much as you see in Zimbabwe in the film, but still prevalent, that the masses were going to turn on you if you were white. That was the myth the whites spoke about.”View image in fullscreenBig break … with with Liam Neeson in Schindler’s List.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIt is one that Donald Trump is still doing his damnedest to spread. A period piece the film may be, but it also serves as a warning to the present. “It’s fascinating when someone holds that position of power,” says Davidtz. “They have to rev people up by convincing them it’s all going to be taken away – by the ‘radical left’ or whoever the bogeyman happens to be.”Telling parts of her own story via Fuller’s life has been cathartic. But what gave Davidtz the gumption to feel she could get out there and direct having never done so before? “A couple of things. A lot of production had left LA. Back in the day, I could do episodes of Californication or Mad Men, things that were shot at home, but that had begun to dwindle away. As my kids got older, I felt less and less like I had a purpose. And then I got sick.”In 2013, in between playing the hero’s mother in two Spider-Man movies, Davidtz was diagnosed with stage-3 breast cancer. She had chemotherapy, immunotherapy, lymph-node-removal surgery and a double mastectomy. “It was not a great situation. People were very worried. I ended up being lucky and came through. And there was something I was left with after being so sick: that there is a singular road in front of me and you get your one shot at living a life.”Becoming a director also coincided with her disillusionment with acting, or at least with what she was being offered. “If a great director or a great part came along, I’d do it now.” She cites as a favourite the glorious 2005 indie comedy-drama Junebug, in which she played a big-city art dealer visiting her in-laws in the US south. “But I don’t want to take any old part with long, boring days saying lines that are so-so. I’ve done that and it made me miserable.”As long ago as the late 1990s, Davidtz was expressing dissatisfaction with her lot in Hollywood. Moving to the US from South Africa at the start of that decade, she leapt in the space of a year from the wickedly cartoonish Evil Dead sequel Army of Darkness to a small but indelible role as the brutalised housemaid to the SS commandant played by Ralph Fiennes in Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning Schindler’s List. Today, she places much of the blame on herself for what followed.“I was a deer in the headlights,” she sighs. “I said ‘No’ too often. I overthought things. It would have been better to say ‘Yes’ and not take too much time off to prepare for the next thing.” Her first big role after Spielberg’s movie wasn’t until two years later in an adaptation of HE Bates’s Feast of July. “Nobody saw it. I should have done two other films between Schindler’s List and that one. The train moves fast, and if you step off it, even for a minute, it keeps going. And the other actresses on the train, they keep going too. Then you’re left behind.”It won’t happen again. “Getting sick amplified everything for me. What do I want every day to look like? What do I want to accomplish with my life?” She turned 60 last month. “There was something depressing about it. Fifty was a great one: I’d beaten cancer and I was like, ‘I’m alive! Yeah!’”Still, not many people can celebrate their 60th birthday with the release of a debut film of such power and originality. “That was the thing. So I told myself to forget the number. My 50s were about getting this one off the ground. I’m going to make the first half of my 60s about piecing the next one together.”And now she knows she has it in her. “Making Don’t Let’s Go became this do-or-die thing. Like fighting through all the surgeries and treatment and six months of chemo. It was imperative. There was nothing else to do but to do it.” So there’s no confusing Davidtz with the winsome Miss Honey. “Iamquite tough,” she smiles. “People think I’m not. But there’s grit in me.”Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight is in cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmSouth AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

And having a toastie maker on hand to produce this golden, crisp, steaming deliciousness certainly makes things neater and more efficient than negotiating an unsealed, melting sandwich in a pan.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

I cook every day at home and know that any culinary gadget you buy needs to earn its place in the kitchen.How I testedView image in fullscreenAn IR thermometer was used to record the temperature of the handle and exterior of each machine.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianI tested 15 toastie makers, including my own (and no longer available)Tefal model, which didn’t really cut the mustard. The machines were selected to include various styles and budgets; I also looked at popular models.As with so many culinary questions, I turned to Felicity Cloake for guidance on how to build thebest toastiefor testing. Thus, hefty slices ofJason’s White Ciabattin Sourdoughwere loaded with two varieties of grated cheese: mozzarella and mature cheddar. I’m afraid I also stirred tuna into the mixture to make it a little healthier, although I know this will upset many (includingHow to Eat). For each toastie, I spread 100g of the mix between two mayo-coated slices of bread before cooking.View image in fullscreenSurf and … dairy: the cheese and tuna sandwich filler used during testing.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianI tested how long it took each sandwich toaster to heat up and show an indicator light, and then to cook the toastie – and I measured the power consumption during this time. Once the toastie had cooked to my liking, I used an IR thermometer to record the temperature of the handle and exterior of each machine, and inserted a digital food thermometer probe into the centre of the sandwich to establish how well the middle had been cooked. I also assessed how easy the cleanup was for each machine. Some models not included in this list almost made me lose the will to live, such was the cheesy mess they left behind.After testing, all the machines were either returned to the brands or donated toGratitude Upcyclein Barnet, which will pass them on to support people in the community.The bestsandwich toasters in 2025View image in fullscreenThe toastie production line during testing.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianBest toastie makeroverall:BrevilleDeepFill VST082View image in fullscreen£29.99 at Argos£35 at AOBreville is practically synonymous with toasties, and this is one of the brand’s standard machines. It’s a two-portion model with deep-fill, non-stick cooking plates that can be removed for easier cleaning. Breville claims the mouldings in the plates will neatly cut and seal your sandwich, and the machine has a cool-to-the-touch locking handle to close it properly, plus a light to indicate when it’s ready to cook. It can also be stored vertically when not in use to save space.Why we love itIt was a relief to encounter an affordable sandwich toaster with removable plates – most other machines I tested didn’t, which makes for a much longer cleanup.This Breville also gave the most even cook of all the machines, other than the more expensive Dualit below. After nine minutes of impatient checking, the reward was two sandwiches with perfectly toasted exteriors and none of the burnt, crusty-edge bits you sometimes come across. The vertical storing is useful too – I can’t work out why more brands don’t do this – and the removable plates proved valuable when dealing with runaway molten tuna and cheese.It’s a shame that …although it’s called deep fill, it only just managed to contain the sandwich I was testing – it was really tough to lock the handle. It did a better job than other models at this price, though.Since Breville has gone to the trouble of making the plates removable, it’s also a shame that there are no other plates to choose from. Breville has other toastie makers that are compatible with a multitude of plates, so it seems like an oversight not to offer them here, even if they had to be bought separately.Removable plates:yesDimensions:27.6 x 23.5 x 9.4cm (WDH)Time to heat up:4mins 14secsTime to cook:9minsHandle temperature:30CExterior machine temperature:64CInside toastie temperature:97CEasy-to-clean rating:7/10Material:metal and plasticPower used:0.093kWhBest budget toastie maker:George Home textured deep-fill sandwich toasterView image in fullscreen£15 at AsdaMade by George at Asda, this traditional, basic sandwich toaster has what the brand calls “large extra deep-fill plates”. It’s made from the usual mix of non-stick metal plates with a plastic case that has ready-to-cook indicator lights and a handle with a locking clip.Why we love itAsda’s toastie maker put many similar models to shame, even those that cost significantly more. For a start, it feels far sturdier than others in its price category, with a more solid build. It also heated up in just two minutes and was able to accommodate the very deeply filled sandwich I used to test all the machines.There was no problem clicking its lock shut, which other basic deep-fill models struggled with, and the non-slip feet managed to cling tightly to my shiny quartz worktop. The manual suggests toasties should be cooked in two to four minutes, but in practice, mine took eight each time – fine as long as you’re not needing to serve several at once.Best of all, very little mess was made despite the generously filled toastie. Indeed, no cheese was left oozing down the back or out the sides, and the plates merely needed a good wipe-down once the machine had cooled. A brilliant budget sandwich toaster.It’s a shame that …the cooking time is longer than suggested. But if this machine banged out two bronzed, melting toasties every two minutes for the price of £15 – and with such low power draw – it would be a serious feat of engineering.Removable plates:noDimensions:31.5 x 29.5 x 11.5cm (WDH)Time to heat up:2mins 9secsTime to cook:8minsHandle temperature:25CExterior machine temperature:75CInside toastie temperature:81CEasy-to-clean rating:7/10Material:metal and plasticPower used:0.056kWhBestfor the ultimate toastie experience:Dualit double contact sandwich toasterView image in fullscreen£251.98 at Nisbets£269.99 at EurofficeThis toastie maker from premium kitchen brand Dualit is a serious piece of kit. At 6kg and with two individual non-stick plates that heat up and cook quickly, it’s practically catering-level equipment. Each circular plate features deep mouldings with traditional toasted sandwich markings for an effective seal. Dualit claims the design allows for extremely generous fillings, and the hotplates can also be used individually to conserve energy.Why we love itI felt like a professional toastie chef using this, churning out perfect toasted sandwiches almost every 90 seconds (yes, really). Burnished golden, deep filled, bubbling inside and nicely pressed for easy separation, the toasties this machine produces are everything you could ask for (as you’d expect from the eye-watering cost).View image in fullscreenThe Dualit in action.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianMy sandwiches cooked evenly and made no mess whatsoever; all that was required in terms of cleanup was a wipe over the hotplates with a hot, soapy cloth – a very welcome change considering the sticky, claggy situations I had encountered with other machines during testing.If you’re considering this toastie maker, you’ll need to be extremely invested in the making and eating of toasted sandwiches, however, because it has a large footprint and can’t be stored away easily. If I had this sitting on my worktop, I’d certainly make good use of it; it made the toasties faster than my family could eat them – a result.It’s a shame that …it’s very big, heavy and very expensive, and you might even begin entertaining notions of starting your own toastie truck.Removable plates:noDimensions:40 x 22 x 19cm (WDH)Time to heat up:8minsTime to cook:1min 35secsHandle temperature:33CExterior machine temperature:90CInside toastie temperature:60CEasy-to-clean rating:10/10Material:cast aluminiumPower used (one plate):0.197kWhBest microwave toastie maker:Morphy Richards Mico toastie makerView image in fullscreen£29.99 at Morphy Richards£25.99 at AmazonToasted sandwiches in a microwave? Why not. There are a few of these mini microwave sandwich-making devices doing the rounds at the moment, and they all use the same fundamental design: two removable, non-stick-coated metal plates slot inside a silicone case that locks a sandwich snugly inside for “toasting” in the microwave. There’s no preheating, and Morphy Richards says it’s suitable to cook anything, from croissants and bagels to traditional toasted sandwiches, in no more than five minutes.Why we love itI was sceptical about a microwave toastie maker, suspecting any resulting sandwich would be undercooked and soggy, with the bread being steamed rather than crispy and golden. However, I’m happy to eat my hat. The Mico produces toasted sandwiches as good as any decent traditional sandwich toaster and significantly better than many of the models I tested.I have a slightly tired 800W microwave, which took five minutes to cook my deep-fill sourdough toastie to my liking, but if you have a higher-powered microwave or a less substantial sandwich, this could be much quicker. The design allows for a generous fill and, while it can’t seal the edges of the toastie, any escaped filling is contained within the plates and not lost.View image in fullscreenThe ultimate travel toastie maker.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianIn terms of cleaning, it’s unlikely your sandwich will cause any great mess unless the contents are particularly sloppy, and even then, the plates can easily be removed from the casing and the whole thing put in the dishwasher. It’s a great bit of kit for smaller kitchens because it can be easily stored in a drawer. And it’s ideal for taking away too, whether that’s to the office or to a holiday let.It’s a shame that …it makes only one sandwich at a time. As such, the Mico is best suited to solo diners. It’s also worth noting that the silicone becomes very hot during cooking. My five-minute cooking spells resulted in an exterior temperature of 70C, which is a bit too hot to handle, and this increases with each cook if you’re making several toasties.

With two non-stick ceramic sections, you simply add your buttered sandwich and lock the whole assembly in place to contain the toastie and its fillings. It takes about four minutes to cook a toastie, flipping the press halfway with the handle, which stays cool to the touch. The plates aren’t removable, so the whole thing needs washing by hand after use (and it’s not suitable for use on induction hobs).Why we love itA stovetop toastie maker is new to me and, much like the microwave toastie maker, I’m sold. Getting an appliance out of hibernation for occasional use shouldn’t feel like a hassle, but it does, whereas this can be stored in a (relatively large) drawer and used whenever the urge for a toasted sandwich strikes.ProCook suggests preheating the press, but in practice, this makes it harder to handle and doesn’t save any time. I recommend placing it on the heat from cold – mine took just over five minutes on a medium gas burner. It produced a lovely golden toastie and, while it was unsealed, there was no seepage, making for a very satisfying sandwich experience and an even more satisfying cleanup.View image in fullscreenThe ProCook stovetop would be ideal for making campfire toasties.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianCleaning the press itself wasn’t the easiest, though, because the plates can’t be detached. This means you have to wrangle the width and length of the thing in the washing-up bowl. Similarly, it would be nice if it were dishwasher-friendly – but we can’t have it all:I’d still rather clean 10 of these than any one standard machine. This would be a brilliant buy for camping trips and firepits, where you could have the sandwiches made up in advance for ease.It’s a shame that …there’s no clever storage solution. It’s not huge, but it would be much easier to stick in a drawer if it could fold.Removable plates:noDimensions:25 x 36 x 3cm (WDH)Time to heat up:not applicableTime to cook:5mins 22secs (dependent on heat)Handle temperature:27CExterior machine temperature:230CInside toastie temperature:52CEasy-to-clean rating:9/10Material:cast aluminium and BakelitePower used:not applicableThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Saves the need for two appliances’: the Ninja Foodi 3-in-1 toaster, grill & panini press.Photograph: Joanne Gould/The GuardianQuest 35630 deep-fill toastie makerView image in fullscreen£23.94 at B&Q£19.75 at AmazonBest for:larger sandwichesThis and the Asda machine were a close-run thing.

I found this fun to use, and it reminded me of how versatile these grills are. It’s a larger version than the original, which means it was possible to cook at least four toasties at a time, and while it doesn’t seal the sandwich, the result was still delicious. In fact, my family preferred this style to the sealed toastie (no escaping boiling steam). For its price, it’s a good appliance for all sorts of cooking, and it also negates the need for a separate sandwich press.It didn’t make the final cut because …the sloping design leads to a lack of full contact with the bread, meaning it’s not the best for cooking toasted sandwiches.

Indeed, there’s no need to overspend if you want something that can make a decent toasted sandwich for one. You will, of course, pay much more for high-end or multifunctional machines, such as the professional-standard Dualit contact sandwich toaster.What features should I look for?Consider how many toasties you’ll usually be making in one sitting and buy accordingly. You don’t want to be waiting for 15 minutes for two more toasties to cook if you’re feeding four people at once, for example. I’d generally advise looking for removable plates, or cleaning the machine can take longer than the entire assembly and cook – though there are decent exceptions in this list.Consider, too, whether you need an electronic toastie maker or whether an alternative suits you better; theMico microwave deviceis amazing, as is theProCook stovetopif you’re eating solo.Joanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.She has a great appreciation for a good toasted sandwich, and after eatingabout 40 tuna and cheese versions this summer, is now in her green chilli and spinach cheese toastie eraFor more, read the Filter’s guides to thebest toastersandthe best blendersExplore more on these topicsSandwichesThe FilterFoodGadgetsInteriorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And you can rhyme them with “bed” or “bee”, as you please.Thank you. What about them?Let’s say these young workers are going to retire aged 65.Quite early(unless they’re French), but OK.Rathbones, an investment management company, has estimated that a 25-year-old today who wants to live “comfortably” for a quarter of a century after retirement will needa pension pot of £3.1m. For a two-person household, the figure is £4.3m.Wemust be talking about private pensions,because there’s not a lot of comfort ina state pension.Correct.That is an eye-watering amount of money.It’s all down to inflation. Rathbones came up with the figure by assuming 2% annual inflation and contributions increasing by the same percentage, while the pot grows at an average of 5%.So how much wouldtheyhave to saveto achieve that?Roughly £1,600 a month for a single person.Yeah, good luck with thatif you’re a nurse, a teacher–or anything, really, apart from a hedge-fund manager. Also, when you’re 25 you should be having a good time, not thinking about yourpension.You could always rethink your retirement plans.I’m trying not to think about retirement! But go on.The analysis found that gen Zs will need £2.2m for a “moderate” lifestyle and £947,700 for a “minimum” one.What about if you’re a bit further along the conveyor belt of life?In your 30s, say, or your 50s?It’s complicated, and there are so many variables – not just about your current salary and what sort of lifestyle you’re planning, but also how you plan to take your pension, if you’re going to buy an annuity or use drawdown …OK, don’t get too technical on me. Ballpark?Pension companies generally agree thata reasonable targetis having three times your salary in your pot by your 30s, and six times your salary by your 50s.And say I’m 65 now, shaking that pot –how much am I hoping is in there?Well, returning to the original Rathbones analysis, they estimate that for a comfortable 25-year retirement you need £1.4m.What does a comfortable retirement todayeven look like?Annual overseas holidays plus long weekends away in the UK, some luxury, eating out and “some spontaneity”.Like getting a yacht?I’m one of the have-nots, not the have-yachts.Do say:“Yes, hello, is that the Bank of Mum and Dad?”Don’t say:“No, not in the piggy bank.

Photograph: Leki Lao/The GuardianA colossal volcanic eruption in January 2022 ripped apart the underwater cables that connect Tonga to the world – and exposed the fragility of 21st-century lifeBySamanth SubramanianTue 30 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareFor a while, Sam Vea had been smelling sulphur on the air – only mildly infernal, like a distant sniff of hell, but sulphur nonetheless. Still, on the Saturday evening when the explosion happened, he sat up in fright. It sounded so near he thought some cataclysm had occurred right there, in his neighbourhood. The windows trembled. The curtains fell off. Vea peeked out of his house but saw nothing destroyed or on fire, so he looked at his wife and said: “This has to be the volcano.”Vea and his wife live in Tofoa, which, if you squint and picture Tonga’s main island of Tongatapu as a long, medieval shoe, lies just below the instep, on a gentle rise of earth. They’d just returned home after dropping their daughters at a birthday party, but now Vea dashed to his van to go and collect them. On the way back, the road filled with cars hurrying away from the sea, and tiny pebbles fell from the sky. Not that long before, curious to see what a big volcanic eruption looked like, Vea had watched Dante’s Peak on Netflix. In the movie, he remembered now, a white-hot rock had punched through the roof of a truck and killed Pierce Brosnan’s partner, so he pulled over to wait out the traffic. The skies grew mottled with dust and ash. Drivers got out, took off their shirts and wiped their windshields down so they could see the road ahead. When they reached home, after two and a half hours, Vea sent his children to hide under the bed.The volcano, with the grand, rolling name of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai, lies 40 miles north of Tongatapu – mostly under the Pacific Ocean but with two spits of land showing above the water, like the ears of a drowned cat. Since its several brief eruptions the previous month, December 2021, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai had continued to gurgle and churn. On that Saturday, 15 January, 2.4 cubic miles of sediment and molten rock shot through its mouth with the force of what scientists call a “magma hammer”, sending a plume of ash at least 35 miles up into the atmosphere. It was the largest atmospheric explosion that modern instruments had recorded, outdoing any nuclear bomb ever detonated. They heard the sound in Alaska. Seven and a half thousand miles away, in the south Indian city of Chennai, meteorologists measured an abrupt spike in atmospheric pressure. It was Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai, doing its thing.On his drive home, Vea had called relatives in the US through Facebook Messenger to let them know he was all right. At some point during their conversation, the line cut out. He assumed the network was overloaded by everybody getting online at the same time. “This is usually a problem for us,” he told me. Vea, DHL’s agent in Tonga, is the president of the Tonga Chamber of Commerce & Industry, and we met in his spare, sunny office in the capital of Nuku’alofa, three streets from the Pacific. The curtains were red, and the sun filtered through in a dull watermelon light.Map showing the islands of TongaVea wears a perpetual expression of mirth, and it was difficult to imagine him as worried as he was on the day the volcano blew up, sitting in his van in the middle of a rain of ash, staring at his suddenly useless phone. He decided he’d try his relatives later, after the traffic online subsided. At home, though, the power was out, and he couldn’t charge his phone, so it was only the next morning, when he tuned in to Radio Tonga, that he learned the country had lost its internet altogether – and with it, all its means of reaching the world beyond the wide, silent water.In the abyssal depths of the ocean, a data cable is a scrawny, unprotected thing, like a snail divested of its shell. Its core consists of fibres of glass, each roughly as thick as a human hair, through which light transmits information at roughly 125,000 miles per second. Around the fibres, there is first a casing of steel for protection, then another of copper to carry electricity to keep the light moving, and then a final sheath of nylon soaked in tar. All this swaddling may sound like plenty of protection, but the layers are all thin, and the final product is – to use the image I heard most often from people in the subsea cable industry – no fatter than a garden hose.These cables sit on the sea floor, conducting 95% of all the world’s international internet traffic. Humans have laid 870,000 miles of fibre optic cables under the ocean, connecting and reconnecting the eyelets on our shorelines, lacing the Earth tightly together. Cables set out from places such as Crescent Beach in Rhode Island, Wall Township in New Jersey and Island Park in New York, and end in locations from Penmarch in France to Bilbao in Spain and Bude in the United Kingdom.There are roughly 550 such submarine cables around the planet, and more are being built every day. A Finnish company once planned to spend a billion or so dollars to lay cable under the Arctic Ocean – a task made easier by how rapidly its ice cover is melting. Upon completion, the cable was designed to shave 20-60 milliseconds off the speed of trades made by banks in Tokyo and London. For now, Antarctica is the only major uncabled landmass on Earth, but it won’t be for long. The US has plans.The cable that connects Tongatapu to Fiji and thence to the world is 515 miles long and forms part of a cable network called Southern Cross. It was switched on in 2013. A 250-mile domestic cable between Tongatapu and the northern island of Vava‘u began operating in 2018. In general, this pocket of the Pacific is a rough neighbourhood for undersea cables. Along with the volcanoes, there are steep underwater slopes with plenty of canyons, and the regular threat of earthquakes.Even a year and a half after Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai’s eruption, no one knew precisely what had happened on the ocean floor that Saturday. But geologist Mike Clare, at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, had pored over enough sonar readings and sediment samples to build a theory. It ran like this: when Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai shot its innards into the atmosphere, the dense rock and sediment fell back into the ocean at a furious pace, hit the flanks of the volcano and rocketed down its slopes. “It’s like an avalanche, or a log flume in a theme park,” Clare said.View image in fullscreenSubsea cables in the Pacific Ocean near Guam.Photograph: David Fleetham/AlamyAlong the way, thepyroclastic flowgathered more momentum, so that when it met the domestic cable just a few miles away, it was moving as fast as a speeding car. The contest was over before it began. The rock and mud bit a 65-mile section out of the domestic cable and buried it under 65ft of sediment. A different part of the flow, or perhaps the same one, sliced 55 miles of cable out of the middle of the international link to Fiji.By the time Clare woke up in Southampton on the day of the eruption, his Twitter feed was already awash with discussions and satellite imagery. It took him, and most of the outside world, the better part of a day to realise that Tonga had lost its internet. “Basically, the eruption happens, and 15 minutes later, there’s a drop to about half of what the original internet traffic was, and then about an hour after the eruption, it flatlines.”That was the moment when Sam Vea’s mobile phone gave out. Landlines died as well, because in Tonga, as in many other countries, even ordinary telephone calls are now routed through data cables. In Southampton, Clare could look at satellite photos and see that the eruption had blessedly left Vava‘u, Tongatapu and other islands in the Tongan archipelago intact, but Tongans themselves couldn’t be sure of that. They had no way of communicating with each other, no way of learning about the condition of other parts of their own, small country. “For a week, I didn’t know what happened to my family on Tongatapu,” one man in Vava‘u told me. “I have a brother in Nuku’alofa. I had to assume he was OK.” Another said: “We thought Tongatapu was obliterated. There was just no way to know differently.”We inhabit the internet in an odd, paradoxical state. It is everywhere, available whenever we desire it, like the air we breathe. This permits us to forget not only its materiality – bottomless quantities of metals and plastics poured and cast into wires, routers, datacentres, servers, towers and repeaters – but also its centrality in our lives. We’re lulled into believing that the internet is only a vehicle for emails, apps, selfies, Zoom meetings and websites that linger too long on unread browser tabs. The fact that the very apparatus of 21st-century life relies on the internet is rendered visible to us only when something snaps, like the sole cable running to Tonga.The first fallout was communication, of course. In the aftermath of a disaster, even the humble text message assumes grave importance. Are you safe? Is your house still standing? Is the water safe to drink? Tonga runs on Facebook Messenger, particularly on its outer islands, where the phone service is spotty, and without it people had to take to the road – or the sea, or the air – to find anything out. Australia and New Zealand had to send reconnaissance planes over the islands, so that their pilots could eyeball the extent of the damage.Commerce broke down. Since this happened in the middle of the Covid pandemic, DHL was flying only one plane a week to Tonga – but without the internet, Vea couldn’t file or receive manifests online. The ATMs went dead, because banks couldn’t check how much money their customers had in their accounts – and that, in an economy still accustomed to cash, immediately put livelihoods in danger. Owners of fisheries and farms of squash and breadfruit were unable to fill out the compliance and quarantine forms needed to export their produce. Tongans living overseas couldn’t wire funds home to help their families – and at the time, foreign remittances made up 44% of the country’s GDP.When I first learned about Tonga’s internet outage, I thought its citizens must have been hurled back to the 1990s. But in fact, the internet has replaced so many other technologies – and Tonga was receiving so few visitors thanks to the pandemic – that the country was catapulted further back still, to a time before the telegraph and scheduled flights reached these parts of the Pacific. With the fracture of a single cable, Tonga was plunged into the kind of isolation it hadn’t seen in more than a century.Tonga’s cable was cut by a freakish act of nature – but a volcanic eruption is only one of the many perils facing the planet’s network of underwater data cables. Some of these are also marine or geological: landslips, strong currents, very infrequent shark attacks. Others are the product of human accidents, such as a poorly dropped anchor or a fishing boat trawling too close to a cable. These categories of dangers have attended cables since the mid-19th century, when humans first decided to lay a telegraph wire at the bottom of the sea.The latest risks, minted over the last decade, are corporate misbehaviour and geopolitical strife. Increasingly, subsea cables are commissioned and owned by a very small group of private tech firms, such as Google and Meta – US companies that can easily foot a new cable’s bill that runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars. In parallel, the great powers have realised that data cables in international waters are ripe targets precisely because they’re both so important and so remote. The US and China routinely attempt to thwart each other’s cable projects: permissions denied, contracts stymied, the intrigue as coiled and convoluted as tangles of cable. Europe’s nations have grown more and more convinced that their subsea cables are being deliberately damaged by ships belonging to Russian or Chinese “shadow fleets” – civilian vessels doing their governments’ bidding.View image in fullscreenWith fresh water scarce, volunteers drink from coconuts, Nomuka Island, Tonga, 17 January 2022.Photograph: Leki Lao/The GuardianWhat happened to Tonga could, in theory, happen to anyone – even to the world’s biggest, wealthiest nations. The two US coasts, for instance, may be far more thickly connected with cables than Tongatapu, but all those cables do eventually run into the inky depths of the deep ocean, where they’re protected by neither military nor legal muscle. The world today has come to depend utterly on these cables – and in tandem, these cables have grown more and more exposed to the whims of rogue corporate and national actors. The future of the internet, in part, will entail the weaponisation of its submarine cable systems. Information, after all, is wealth and power – not only in how you use it, but how you can throttle it.The safety of the cables in the ocean is a national security issue, a precondition for the economy, and a matter of literal life and death.On my second day in Tonga, I walked west out of Nuku’alofa – past the dock where cruise ships nuzzled the shore, around the corner of the parliament complex, past the royal palace and along the coast road. The afternoon was warm, and the sun glinted off the Pacific, so when a police paddy wagon slowed down and offered me a ride, I took it. They let me off outside a small, glass-fronted building facing the sea: the headquarters of Tonga Cable Limited, as well as the landing station of the international cable that came to the country from Fiji. In the Tonga station, the international cable led into a ferociously cold room, where tall stacks of servers and switches sit in cabinets of airbrushed metal.Around the planet, cable stations sit on all kinds of coastline: glorious beaches, or the seaward edge of teeming metropolises, or the crevices of fjords, or near forests or deserts. But the stations themselves are near-identical: universal pieces of refrigerated internet infrastructure plonked down in distinctly local surroundings. They’re built to be outwardly unremarkable but also unbreachable. Often, these buildings offer no signage or other clues to their purpose. Their specs are hardcore. “Can it take a light plane crash? It’s got a really heavy-duty double-skinned roof,” a cable entrepreneur told Nicole Starosielski in her book The Undersea Network. “Can it take an 80km-an-hour 20-ton truck? Yes, it can because of the way it’s been constructed. What if someone decided to take you out? Can they?”The stations are prepared for fire, flood, power outages, high heat, frost and humid days. What will definitely put them out of action, though, is a cable cut far out at sea.The chief executive of Tonga Cable was, at the time of my visit, a dapper, genial man named Semisi Panuve. Late on the evening of the eruption, when he thought the ash in the air had drifted out to sea, Panuve set out for the Tonga Cable station on foot. When he was still half a mile away, he saw that the road ahead was blocked with rocks and debris. In some spots, whole boats had been lifted inland.Close to midnight, soldiers arrived to clear the way. Then Panuve, his deputy, Sosofate Kolo, and a brace of engineers settled in for a night of work. They checked the servers and power, but nothing was amiss. The alarms on the monitoring system were lit up like a Christmas tree, indicating a cable fault. The diagnosis didn’t take very long; indeed, to Kolo, it had been obvious the minute his internet had cut out earlier that evening, in the middle of a Facebook browse. Early the next morning, the team ran an Optical Time Domain Reflection test – sending a series of light signals down the cable and measuring the strength of the backscattered pulses. That helped gauge where the outage was: roughly 26 miles off the coast of Tongatapu.This was sufficient information to file an emergency repair request. Like other operators, Tonga Cable was part of a regional cable maintenance consortium, paying a quarterly “subscription” to SubCom, the company contracted to maintain cables in the south Pacific, to keep a ship in the area so that it could attend to cable faults. To contact SubCom, Panuve found a satellite phone that Tonga Cable owned. “We had to scramble around to see if it was still working,” he said, “because we hadn’t used it since 2019, when the cable last broke because of a ship anchor.” Then they could do nothing but wait for help to arrive.Tonga’s government, too, was trying to find a way to get back online, and the job fell to MEIDECC, a kind of catch-all ministry responsible for meteorology, energy, information, disaster management, environment, climate change and communications. “We weren’t prepared, even though we’d had our cable cut in 2019,” Stan Ahio, a ministry official, told me with an embarrassed laugh.A day after the eruption, Ahio remembered that the ministry owned an old satellite phone. “We’d stopped paying the subscription two years ago, but I thought: ‘Everyone outside must know what’s happening here. Maybe they’ll realise it’s an emergency and switch it back on for us,’” he said. His wild surmise about the benevolence of some distant corporate executive proved correct.View image in fullscreenSatellite view of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai, January 2022.Photograph: AP“The first person I called was my sister in New Zealand,” Ahio said – and here, his chuckles turned into soft sobs at the memory. Nothing here was about cold technology; it was about the proof of being alive. “That was such a difficult time.” He permitted himself to cry for a few seconds before regaining his composure. “Then we called the International Telecommunication Union, which is a United Nations agency, to see if we could get some satellite connectivity.” It took three or four days to resurrect the satellite dishes on the island, and to get the first meagre taste of bandwidth: 120 megabytes per second, rationed for the use of ministries and other essential work.On the outlying islands, there were no satellite phones or dishes waiting to be retrieved from cold storage. Vava‘u was a whole island of people trying to tell the world they were all right. If it hadn’t been for Roy Neymen, a sailor who’d berthed his yacht there temporarily, they might have gone many days without getting the word out. On his yacht, Neymen had a Garmin device that sent expensive text messages through satellite, and he used this to contact government agencies in Australia and New Zealand. For a while, he set up a communications centre in a local cafe, where Vava‘u’s residents could come to dictate their messages to Neymen, as if he were the designated letter-writer in a medieval village, and thus reach their relatives overseas. In two weeks, he sent out 1,600 messages. (At Neymen’s request, Garmin covered the costs.)But this served only a very narrow need. The islanders still had no communication between themselves, and no way to log on to the internet – to send longer emails, or to retrieve money sent to them from overseas, or to conduct their business. The ATMs remained inert, and bank branches couldn’t disburse money without first establishing how much their customers had in their accounts.After a couple of weeks, when the government began daily flights between Tongatapu and Vava‘u, a strange and roundabout solution was improvised. Every morning, a bank headquarters on Tongatapu would download on to a thumb drive a spreadsheet with the account details of Vava‘u’s residents; the thumb drive would then be flown to Vava‘u, where the bank branch could work off the spreadsheet to update withdrawals and deposits; the same evening, the thumb drive would return to Tongatapu, so that revisions could be made to the bank’s main database.A month after the volcanic eruption, SpaceX donated 50 Starlink terminals to Tonga – the country’s first fat slice of connectivity. The Starlinks were distributed across institutions such as ministries and banks but also to community halls, restaurants and other businesses and public spaces; many went to the outer islands, including Vava‘u. “All the wifi was free, so anyone could come into range and use it,” Ahio said. “It was always congested!”A foreign diplomat told me that she’d see Tongans in these wifi oases late into the night, trying to catch up on work: “One woman told me she was doing an online course at the University of the South Pacific, and that she had to sit in her car typing out her coursework.”After Semisi Panuve made his emergency call to SubCom to request a cable fix, his first headache was just how much cable was missing. The eruption had cut a 55-mile section out of the middle of the international cable that ran to Tonga from Fiji – an unusually large repair job. Companies routinely keep extra cable in depots located in ports around the world – in Cádiz and Bermuda, in Wujing and Apia. In the Apia depot in Samoa, run by SubCom, there were only 18 miles or so of spare cable of the sort could be patched into Tonga’s international cable. That was a reasonable length of spare cable to hold for most contingencies – but not for the most powerful underwater volcanic eruption ever recorded.SubCom always had a cable ship – a 140-metre-long vessel named Reliance – in the neighbourhood. When Tonga’s cable broke, the Reliance was docked in Papua New Guinea, which was a stroke of fortune; it could have been out at sea, just beginning another elaborate repair. The ship had to wait around for a while for an engineer to fly in from the US. Sailing to Samoa to pick up the spare cable and other equipment took the better part of a week.When it embarked on the repair, in waters more than a mile deep, the Reliance found that the rupture in Tonga’s international cable was no ordinary matter. Routinely, when a ship drags its grapnel along the sea floor to snag the snapped end of a cable, it requires just one or two attempts to nab its quarry. To locate the eastern break in the cable, off the coast of Tongatapu, the Reliance required seven drags, even with the help of a submarine remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Having tethered that end to a buoy, the Reliance steamed towards Fiji to search for the second break and fasten that to a surface buoy as well – a gnarly task, because the visibility underwater was so clouded by silt and sediment that the ROV offered few clean images to its operators.The Reliance returned to the cable that ran out from Tongatapu, untied it from its buoy, and spliced it to one end of the spare cable on board. Then, unspooling the spare cable as it slowly headed west, laying it down carefully so that it had plenty of slack, the crew spliced its other end to the cable from Fiji. The splicing is intricate work: first the peeling back of the cable’s various protective layers; then the cleaning of the glass fibres in a sonic bath, with what is essentially high-frequency sound, because even the most delicate physical contact with them might shatter them; then the soft placement of the two ends in a fusion splicer the size of a shoebox. An arc of electricity melts the glass fibres and fuses them. Then the glass has to be re-sheathed all over again. The entire process can take the better part of a night, sometimes longer – and it’s all done in a room that rises and sinks and sways with the ocean’s swells.All told, the repair of the international cable took five weeks. Tonga’s capital – and its ministries, traders, DHL agents, schoolteachers, Facebook merchants and diplomats – had come back online. Vava‘u, though, seemed consigned to an indeterminate future of WhatsApp calls made in public cafes, homework completed in car parks, and life in general without the internet at hand.Only in August 2023, more than 18 months after it was first cut off, did broadband internet return to Vava‘u. When I was there, a couple of months later, people still seemed to be revelling in the novelty of fast and ubiquitous internet. Once again, you could check your email anywhere. Most of the Starlinks came down.The following summer, though, another earthquake wiped out the same domestic cable. Tonga’s government had just ordered Starlink to suspend operations in the country until it obtained a full licence, so once again, Vava‘u found itself consigned to the dark. When I read about this, I remembered my conversation with Sam Vea, sitting in his office at the Tonga Chamber of Commerce & Industry, the sea breeze filling out his thin crimson curtains. The only way for a cable break not to cripple the country, he told me, was for Tonga to have a second cable – and routed differently, so that an undersea geological convulsion couldn’t blow them both out at the same time.Real estate for the apocalypse: my journey into a survival bunkerRead moreVea handed me a document: an update to the Tongan government’s infrastructure investment plan for the decade, issued after the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai eruption. A new domestic cable linking Tongatapu to Vava‘u had shot to the top of the government’s priority list – above the upgrading of hospitals and water supply systems, above the construction of a new bridge, above the refurbishment of the parliament and courts.The government budgeted its cost at about $16.5m. Vea shrugged. Where would Tonga find the money? It was already relying on donors and friendly governments to build its schools and fix its roads, and as a nation of small islands, it also hoped to secure funding under the Paris Agreement to beat back climate change. A new data cable could arrive only as largesse from others. One hundred and sixty-five years after the first telegraph link was laid, these cables still wind around the world just as the great powers and their corporations see fit – to the point that the cables become tokens themselves of the contests for might and wealth, shaping and distorting the internet as we know it.Adapted fromThe Web Beneath the Waves: The Fragile Cables That Connect our World, published by Columbia Global Reports on 14 OctoberListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readTongaAsia PacificVolcanoesInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The PM is out of step with modern digital politics and needs to catch upTue 30 Sep 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.52 EDTShareKeir Starmer saved his best for the fragile circumstances of a difficult Labour conference. It may not yet be enough to save him. All the same, this was by some way Starmer’s most effective and certainly hismost interesting conference speechsince becoming Labour leader five years ago. Not a particularly high bar, it must be admitted, since Starmer is no great orator – but at least the bar is one that he cleared.In the dire situation now facing Labour, this mattered a lot. In his earlier conference speeches, Starmer was always stolid and decent but at times painfully careful not to drop the famous “Ming vase”. The phrases that define those earlier efforts – mission-led government, a government of service or even the 2024 manifesto title, Change – may have meant something to Starmer and those around him. But they meant little to anyone else. They sank like stones into the contemporary sea of political indifference.This time, though, Starmer laid it on the line more forcefully. Here in this speech, he told conference, is whatLabouris in power to achieve, a renewal of Britain in which workers and minorities can get the justice and rewards they deserve in a united country. Here are some of the examples – a new approach to post-school education and training, a digital step-change in NHS services among them. All this was a fight for the national soul, between the division whipped up by Nigel Farage and the pragmatic decencies of the Britain that Starmer grew up in. Some of the phrases were still clunky. What does “a Britain built for all” say that something like “make Britain fair again” doesn’t say better?There was only one problem, but it is a big one. This was the speech that Starmer ought to have given before the 2024 election, not now. At the very least, he needed to have given it straight after Labour had come back to office. Back then, the message that Starmer’s big project will take time might have inoculated Labour against some of the headaches it has faced in year one.Instead, Starmer seemed almost paralysed by the immensity of the task that faced him when he became prime minister. It felt beyond him to lay out a clear goal and an honest prognosis of what it would take to get to it. He seemed stubbornly indifferent to the need to explain things to the nation. At least he seems to have got the message now.Rachel Reeves, though not a brilliant speaker either,tried to revive a version of thison Monday when she said she knew things were difficult, that there were too many obstacles to change and that market confidence is hard to win and easy to lose. But this also is what she should have been saying from day one. Instead, she stumbled into aneedless rowon winter fuel payments. Both Reeves and Starmer need a modern version of the brilliant constant reshaping of the national argument by Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. It may not yet be too late.Except that even Starmer’s or Reeves’s best is not really good enough for the situation they face and for the alienated politics of the modern world. This is not to attack Starmer in particular. Nor is it to say that anyone else, Andy Burnham, for instance, would have been better.In the old normal, the Starmer speech might have been enough. Starmer storms it – job done, the headlines could say. But traditional conference speeches do not cut it these days. They are a relic of the way politics used to be done, not a cutting edge weapon in the volatile world of contemporary digital politics. Starmer still struggles with this reality. At one point, he contrasted the “real Britain” of local activism with the indecency of the social media world. But it is the social media world that is reshaping politics, not local activism.Conference speeches matter far less than they once did – maybe than they ever did. Leaders expend vast amounts of energy on them. Every year involved “agony, consternation, madness and creativity in roughly equal proportions” Tony Blair wrote in his memoirs. And Blair was pretty good at them. Yet getting a leader’s speech to cut through is almost impossible now. Most are here today and gone tomorrow.Has any political speech of any kind actually made the weather in Britain since Geoffrey Howe’s resignation speech in 1990, which set in motion the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher? Has any conference speech truly reset the political agenda since Aneurin Bevan’s “naked into the conference chamber” speech attacking nuclear disarmament in 1957?There have, of course, been memorable moments – Thatcher’s “the lady’s not for turning” or her resolve after the Brighton bombing among them,Neil Kinnock attacking Militantand Blair scrapping clause IV. But these were more confirmatory and iconic, not gamechanging. Starmer will have felt that this year’s speech went well, but he should not delude himself into thinking it will make a lot of difference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The blogger James O’Malleywrote recently that, even for those who notice them, which most people do not, the speech will still just be another boring politician standing behind a lectern, unchanged despite a two-decade revolution in how most people engage with the news. Instead, O’Malley said, Starmer’s goal should be to go viral. He should use screens. He could film the speech as a video. He could bring on surprise guests. Hold your nose, Keir, and be more creative.To win an argument like the one that faces Labour today he needs to prepare much better. Hone the argument more fully, turn it into a campaign, make it patriotic and practical – and use exciting words. Make the promises substantive but don’t promise instant rewards. You absolutely should not just say something for a one-day headline and then ignore it, as Starmer seems to have done on digital ID in his speech. That approach is guaranteed to lose control.It may be true that the battle against Farage gives Labour an enemy to fight against, and a cause to believe in, and that this will unite and energise the grassroots. In the circumstances facing Starmer in Liverpool, that may seem like enough of an achievement. But, like conference speeches in general, it is unlikely to reach out for long to the uninvolved and indifferent. To these voters, Starmer is not a reason to vote Labour rather than Reform or Tory, as the Labour devotees will tend to see it. For too many, Starmer’s inability to solve this country’s economic and social decline may look like continuity hopelessness.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But there just weren’t enough flags. Sure, there were union jacks on the banners around the conference stage. Sure, there were ushers handing out union Jacks – along with saltires and red dragons for the Scots and the Welsh in the room. Just don’t look too closely where those flags were made. It might well have been a Chinese sweat shop.Sure, members of the cabinet were up and down like yo-yos with their union jacks. But where were the red, white and blue suits? Why wasn’t Rachel Reeves channelling Geri Halliwell at the 1997 Brit awards? What’s wrong with these people? Don’t they love their country?This speech had come billed as make or break forKeir Starmer. There again, everything is billed as make or break for Keir these days. There’s a feeding frenzy over his poll ratings. The worst for a prime minister in living memory.So every day is crisis day. And the reality is that hisleader’s speech at this year’s Labour conferenceprobably won’t shift the dial that much. May soon be forgotten. Bigger battles lie ahead. The November budget. May’s local elections. And who knows what other crises along the way. But a win is a win. And Keir will bank this. He lives to fight another day.1:35Nigel Farage 'doesn't like Britain': Keir Starmer takes dig at Reform leader – videoFirst the good news. This was one of Keir’s better speeches. He no longer seemed to be fighting against the autocue. The bad news? It was still a Keir Starmer speech. He’s never going to turn himself into a natural communicator. He struggles to hold an audience. And for the first 20 minutes or so, it looked as if he might die on his feet. Even armed with flags, the delegates in the hall seemed somewhat disengaged. A feeling that they were there more out of curiosity than conviction.Then it was as though a switch had been flicked. Keir found his voice. Gave people a reason to believe. Maybe it was just that the speech had been written by committee and the first half had been left to someone on work experience. Starmer was all for fewer people going to university and doing gold star apprenticeships instead. So he could have just been living his values.Either way, things picked up for the last half hour. A nuanced argument against the populist right. A statement of patriotism. Above all, it sounded as if it came from the heart. The work of a thoroughly decent man making the case for decency. It’s just not entirely clear if decency is what the British public demands of its politicians these days. We may already have time-slipped into the post-truth, post-decency era. Keir would talk of people dropping in to make sure their neighbours were OK. Reform would be dropping by to see if they hadindefinite leave to remain. In which case they could get out.Keir started as if he was doing a fireside chat. Leaning on the lectern. “Our flags fly proudly,” he said. And, as if on cue, half the audience duly stood up and waved their flags. You can’t say that the conference wasn’t trying to meet the prime minister halfway. There were no Andy Burnham fans, willing him to fail. The whole hall was on his side. It hasn’t always been this way atLabourconferences. The left is renowned for preferring to pick a fight with itself rather than the right.Decline, ruin and chaos. They were the tempting path of grievance. One that required no one to do anything except just hate. The quick fix of unfunded tax cuts, Brexit lies andsnake oil politiciansof left and right. Take that Nigel Farage and Andy B. Keir wanted us to believe we were at a a fork in the road. And he wanted us to take the road less travelled. The road of renewal. A Britain that worked for everyone.There was, of course, the obligatory mention of his father. Had he ever mentioned that his Dad was a toolmaker? Er … yes he had, because he told us last year. And the year before that. And the year before that. It’s as though Starmer has unresolved issues with his father that he keeps trying to work out in public. Maybe it would be more helpful if he saved that for a therapist instead. Because the minute he talks about his dad, you can feel the energy being sucked out of the room. People have enough on their plates dealing with their own Freudian dilemmas to worry about Keir’s. And they’ve heard it all before.But maybe the brief therapy session had done Keir some good. Because after that he was a different man. Making personal attacks on Nige, Liz Truss and Boris Johnson. For never having cared enough about the country to have considered its future. Too interested in stoking division and lining their own pockets. The audience loved this bit. The boos rang round the hall as Starmer reminded everyone that Farage had said that Jaguar Land Rover deserved to go bust.Then on to immigration. The real point of difference with Reform. There was nothing compassionate or progressive about people crossing in small boats and Keir would secure the borders. There was nothing racist about being concerned about immigration, but there was plenty racist about Nige’s plans for mass deportation. Getting rid of the very men and women who staffed our care homes and hospitals. Just because they happened to be born the wrong colour.“Britain is not broken,” Keir went on. By now, almost elegaiac. It always helps when a politician gets to say something he believes. Here the logic was stretched somewhat. Because although Britain was not broken, Starmer did insist that it needed mending. Or at the very least renewing. But this was the good part. The peroration. The whole audience were on their feet, cheering every word as he approached the close. A last swipe at the Tories – remember them? Keir barely did – and one last hit on Nige and he was done.If this was to be his last leader’s speech to a Labour conference, Keir could leave content. He had given it his best shot. Nothing had been left in the locker.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchLabourLabour conference 2025Keir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

There’s a “hub” sponsored by the lobbying firm Anacta, whose clients range from anIsraeli-owned arms companyto various airlines. Ministers chatter with suited business types in a “lounge” sponsored by Arden Strategies – the “advisory and communications firm” run by the former Labour cabinet minister Jim Murphy, now a key conduit between boardrooms and government – while the invite-only Politico Pub is underwritten by Uber. Labour’s commitment to a third Heathrow runway is boastfully projected on to a conference wall. Signs of idealism are scarce: the party shop sells posters of Barbara Castle, but given herscalding denunciationsof Blairism, one can imagine what she’d make of this one-note tribute act to New Labour.The soullessness has much to do with the “climate of fear” diagnosed by Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor and pretender to the Labour crown. The most authoritarian leadership in the party’s history has waged a remorseless war on dissent, transforming Labour into a hollowed out husk, where contempt for injustice is considered dangerous extremism. Labour MPs have been variously suspended for opposing Israel’s genocide, the Tory two-child benefit cap and Starmer’s attempted attack on disability benefits. When predominantly Muslim councillors resigned over Gaza, one Labour source dismissed it as “shaking off the fleas”. Members,Burnham notes, face suspension for something as minor as “liking a tweet by another political party”.Beyond the conference perimeter, police arrested dozens of peaceful protesters for holding placards opposing genocide and backing the direct action movement Palestine Action; it’s now proscribed by the Labour government as a terrorist organisation on an equal footing with Isis and al-Qaida. Since the ban, roughly 1,700 people – many of them elderly –have been arrested.I’ve had a taste of this authoritarianism myself. I have been covering Labour and Conservative conferences almost every year for the decade and a half. Each year, I confront ministers with uncomfortable questions – on issues such as benefit cuts, sleaze allegations, or broken promises. This year, I questioned Labour grandees, including the foreign secretary, on Britain’s continued sale of crucial components for Israel’s murderous fighter jets. The next day, the party emailed me to revoke my conference pass, citing “complaints” about my “conduct”. It added that: “After careful consideration, we’ve concluded that we cannot continue your attendance while ensuring we meet our safeguarding obligations to all attendees.” Rivkah Brown, another leftwing journalist, from Novara Media, also had her pass cancelled at almost the exact same time.Invoking “safeguarding” – as though asking uncomfortable questions about genocide somehow threatens safety – resembles Trumpian attempts to portray critique and dissent as incitement to violence.Nigel Farage similarly claimsthat Keir Starmer labelling his anti-migrant policies as “racist” is inciting violence against his party. A couple of years ago, I and a number of other leftwing journalists abruptly stopped receiving emails from Labour’s press list. Every rightwing media outlet retained its place, and note how GB News has an on-site studio in the conference zone, fuelled by a constant supply of smiling Labour ministers.Where has this toxic blend of authoritarianism and soullessness left the party? The country seethes with contempt for the governing party. Starmer is the most unpopular new prime minister sincerecords began in the 1980s, plummeting to depths unseen even by Liz Truss, while just12% approveof the government’s record, compared with 70% who disapprove. As Britain’s pre-eminent pollster, Sir John Curtice, told a room of depressed-looking delegates, theparty began its term in officewith weak enthusiasm – securing just over a third of the vote amid record low turnout – and it was downhill from there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some seem stumped when asked what Labour’s vision is, while others fall back on platitudes no politician would dissent from, such as growth and improving living standards. The scrapping of the universal winter fuel payment and the abortive attack on disability benefits are widely labelled “mistakes”. There is precious little soul-searching over how Labour could end up kicking those who are struggling the most in society, instead of challenging the hoarding of wealth at the top. Surely this is an existential question for a party founded to do the exact opposite?John McTernan is a former adviser to Tony Blair, but he offers the most perceptive analysis I have heard. Labour is “unpopular because it made the wrong moral choice over Gaza”, he tells me. “It’s unpopular because it made the wrong political choices over public spending and social security.” But is this any surprise? Starmerism has sought to scrub any conscience from the party. Once, across Labour’s spectrum, there was a shared premise: Labour existed to fight injustice, even if there was fierce debate over the road to such a righteous destination. But there is no obvious purpose to Labour at all today, no clear articulation of its distinctive role in politics. If the mission has narrowed to power for power’s sake, it will fail at that too – because the public has clocked this brittle, soulless machine, and their contempt only grows.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionLabour party leadershipKeir StarmerLabourSocialismcommentShareReuse this content"

Neither of those brawls took place for various reasons. Not least, I suspect, because Musk is just self-aware enough to know that he would not emerge with his dignity, or his spine, intact. However, if the richest man in the world is still casting around for a way to publicly demonstrate his virility, I think I’ve hit on the perfect way: sperm racing.This isn’t some below-the-belt insult.Sperm racingis an emerging “thing” among tech types now. A teenage entrepreneur called Eric Zhu came up with the idea, and went viral withhis first sperm racein April. That initial race was rudimentary: college students gave sperm samples to be analysed and the results were turned into an animated race that visualised the fastest offerings.Since then, things have got more sophisticated: the company has developed a real-time race mechanism. According tothe San Francisco Standard, investors have valued Sperm Racing at $75m and it recently got $10m in seed funding. Good for Zhu, but imagine being a teenage female founder asking for investment in an Ovulation Olympics; you’d get laughed out of the room. That’s if you were even let in the room: wholly women-led companies in the US got just 1% of venture capital funding in 2024.While sperm racing started off as a joke, it’s now being presented as a health initiative. “Male fertility is declining. Like, a lot,” the company manifesto says. “Sperm racing isn’t just about racing sperm (although, let’s be honest, that’s hilarious). It’s about turning health into a competition. It’s about making male fertility something people actually want to talk about, track and improve.” The company is also hawking a supplement called Sperm Worms.View image in fullscreenEric Zhu, then 17, speaks at the first sperm racing competition in Los Angeles, California, in April  2025.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesIn many ways, sperm racing is ingenious. Fertility is often thought of as a women’s issue; this helps reframe sperm motility (not exactly a dinner-table conversation) in an engaging way. Getting young men to think more deeply about their reproductive health is great. But “turning health into a competition”? Big yikes. Does that mean anyone who isn’t in perfect health is a loser? Because that’s sure what it sounds like.Still, what more do you expect from tech bros? Sperm racing reflects three trends dominating Silicon Valley: a fixation on traditional masculinity; an obsession with treating your body like a machine that can be constantly optimised; and an increased interest in fertility that overlaps with a worryingresurgence in eugenics.You can quite literally see Silicon Valley conforming to more rigid ideas of masculinity over the years. Once, the stereotype of a tech bro was a sweet-looking dork with zero fashion sense and nonexistent biceps. Just GoogleJeff BezosorElon Muskin 2000, orMark Zuckerbergin 2010. (And do it quick, before they scrub all evidence from the internet.) As technology companies amassed wealth and power, however, there was a vibe shift. Founders started bulking up and doing mixed martial arts. Zuckerberg, who once paid lip service to diversity, started lamenting the lack of “masculine energy” in corporate culture.

This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – except a lot of the big bucks being funnelled into fertility don’t seem to be going towards solving macro problems such as reducingair pollutionormicroplastics, both of which have been linked to infertility, but rather to flashy ideas such as sperm races or finding ways to help the well-off produce uber-optimised children. A number ofcontroversial embryo-testing startupshave offered to help parents select a future child with the best possiblegenes, based on “desirable traits” and genetic predictions of intelligence.Anyway, problematic or not, expect to see more of this: Zhu has reportedly partnered with a company called Total Frat Move to run sperm races at colleges. I hope that one of the professors there can take a few minutes to explain that the idea of sperm scrambling to get to a waiting egg is something of amacho myth.

But until Palestine is free, we will show what solidarity we can from our vesselTue 30 Sep 2025 08.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.52 EDTShareMy first task on the boat is to ease a red rope from the cockpit while a Danish participant opposite me tautens a white one. Between us, we hoist the sail. The coastline of Augusta, Sicily, fades behind us. There are seven people on board: three French, two Irish, one Dane and one Irish-Danish for good measure.Ours is the fastest boat of the Thousand Madleens flotilla sailing toGazajust behind the Global Sumud ships. My boat was the last to depart; we saw off eight other ships at the port, having just shared a week of intensive training with those on board. All participants have been sleeping on our boats since we arrived, so we know their layouts well. I have found a space for each of my possessions to “live” in a cramped environment where everything must be kept in lockers.If successful, we will deliver aid for Palestinians in Gaza. The boat is loaded with medicine, baby formula, prosthetic limbs for the many amputees that Israeli bullets have created. For the several weeks ahead of us, the organisers told us to bring a personal rucksack no larger than an aircraft carry-on bag. Every available crevice of the boat has been crammed with emergency supplies for Palestinians.We are not sailing simply to deliver our cargo, but to pressure our countries to stop arming and funding Israel. All of our governments – French, Danish, Irish – participate in the genocide through maintaining ties with its perpetrator. We’re not even protesting inaction, but the active sabotage of Palestinian self-determination. We didn’t want to have to send a flotilla, and Palestinians in Gaza didn’t want to rely on our doing so. But untilPalestineis free, we will show what solidarity we can from our boat.Initially, our boat was named Algol – a “demon star”, apparently. We rechristened it Milad after Milad Walid Daqqa, the daughter of a long-term imprisoned Palestinian politician and writer. Just before we set sail, I painted the new name in green on the side of the boat from a dinghy.View image in fullscreenOur sailors have a reassuringly firm sense of how everything should be run. They sailed the Milad across the Atlantic themselves before recommending the flotilla organisers buy it for the journey to Gaza. It shows plenty of wear – indelible stains on the kitchen counter, temperamental lights and sockets – but in terms of seaworthiness, it has amply proven its chops.The sailors have devised a rota of tasks – sailing, cooking, cleaning, night watch – but they stress the importance of proactively solving any problems we encounter. “The boat can never be too clean,” one of them tells me as I kneel down from the deck to scrub the boat’s exterior with a giant sponge. I loosen the dirt, then he washes it off by tossing a bucket of sea water over it. “You must never let sea water inside the boat,” he says. “The salt attracts humidity and nothing dries.”I have done everything I can to ward off sea sickness: wristbands, under-ear patches and pills to be taken twice daily. Otherwise, it’s best to stay outside and look at the horizon. My new open-air writing study consists of a 30cm-deep patch of sitting space near the starboard; the only barrier between me and the water a metre in front is two thin lines of metal rope. Everything is grey-blue today – the water, the sky. I didn’t bring a laptop – too impractical to use on the deck – so I write in a notepad and on my phone.Israel has intercepted or attacked every flotilla to Gazasince 2010, always in international waters – the flotilla routes never enter Israel. The Sumud boats ahead of us have already faced two rounds of drone strikes,one while docked in Tunisiaandanother in Greek waters. Israel has not commented on the attacks. Flotilla participants are not the true target of these aggressions: they stem from Israel’s relentless campaign to block the means of life from Palestinians. If we were delivering aid to anyone else, we would be left alone. Although attacks on the flotilla are illegal and highly dangerous, everyone on my boat is more concerned about the far worse atrocities Israel routinely commits in Palestine and particularly in Gaza.It can feel hopelessly insignificant to fold towels and untangle deck cables while Israel ethnically cleanses and obliterates an entire people. But I think of it this way: the urgency in Gaza is precisely why our mission needs to be well run, down to every last detail. Our desire isn’t merely to do something, anything; it’s for it to be effective.View image in fullscreenActivists wave palestinian flags as a flotilla leaves the harbour.Photograph: Pascal Pochard-Casabianca/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Italian and Spanish navy ships that have beendispatched to accompany uswill hopefully increase our odds of safe passage and delivery. If this serves Palestinians by helping to get aid to them, it is at least some form of practical support. These countries, and Europe as a whole, still urgently need to fully sanction Israel. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, recently described our mission as “gratuitous, dangerous and irresponsible”. What about a country that,according to doctor testimonies, shoots children dead with a single targeted bullet to the head or chest?The US and UK are hardly more credible as state actors, having sown chaos in the region for many decades. Yet Donald Trump and Tony Blair are key voices in the newproposed peace planthat has left Palestinians sceptical. Watching this development from the flotilla are ordinary Americans and Brits. They sail with the rest of us as conscientious objectors to their countries’ many misdeeds.We’re still in Italian waters now; we’ve been told the voyage to Gaza will take two to three weeks, depending on weather and on how events unfold. It’s only rational to be prepared for scenarios besides the ideal one of safely delivering our aid in Gaza. But in highlighting the lengths Israel goes to in order to starve Palestinians, and in pressurising our governments back home, we hope to accomplish something regardless.Naoise Dolan is an Irish writer and the author ofExciting TimesandThe Happy CoupleDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They’re constantly going somewhere. That place is rarely cool to begin with, and they zone in on the least cool thing about it, so if they go to the seaside, they’re there to measure groynes rather than taste-test ice-creams; and if they go to a shopping centre, it’s to ask local residents what they think of urban regeneration, not to look round the shops. But they seem really into it, so who am I to cavil?Therefore, while only somewhat listening to a conversation about an A-level module on globalisation – which is split into categories, one of which is shipping containers, like a parody of school being boring, and another is neoliberalism – I got it into my head that my daughter had to go on a field trip to see some neoliberalism in action.I swear, we spent the whole 00s arguing about whether each other knew what the word meant – we as a society, I mean, not me and my daughter – and now it’s in an A-level. Where would you go, though? The world is so vast, and all of it so neoliberal. I’d start in a free economic zone in Djibouti – the logical endpoint of liberalisation, where money moves so freely the law must be suspended, and with it, all those annoying workers’ rights it enshrines. Probably the US is where you could best observe what happens when unconstrained markets have driven the price of labour down so inexorably that nobody can afford anything except pure political fury.If Starmer wants to beat Reform, he’ll need more than ‘patriotic renewal’ – whatever that is | Zoe WilliamsRead moreWhat the hell am I even thinking? We live in Vauxhall, south London, and could just walk 500 yards to see blinking skyscrapers with swimming pools in the clouds and pseudo-classical wordplay names, and no actual people anywhere – concrete temples to a system in which the price tag on square footage has come completely unstuck from humans who need to live somewhere, facilitated by a political butler class that won over the electorate by lying straight to its face, then subordinated it to the interests of capital. It wouldn’t be a very fun field trip, but it would be exceedingly cheap.I had the wrong end of the stick, of course.

To be clear, I was 26 and knew nothing about policing, nor about pregnancy, nor, for that matter, aboutIraq, but I was part of the Coalition Provisional Authority – the American government that had been imposed after the war – and this policy, I was told, was what Iraq needed.Five years later, I found myself sitting in a plush hotel suite in Jerusalem, asTony Blair– one of the architects of the Iraq war, but now the quartet special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian “peace process”, waxed lyrical on the economic growth that was occurring in the Palestinian city of Jenin. Having spent a significant amount of time the day before negotiating the myriad of Israeli military checkpoints that separated Jenin’s dusty streets from the five-star German Colony Hotel where we were meeting, I could not square Blair’s impression with my own reality.And yet here we are again, in 2025, talking abouta western occupational government imposed on a region of the Middle East– and one led by Blair, no less – complete with the same old visions of economic prosperity disconnected from the realities on the ground or the rights of the people.It will not work, and it should not be trusted.First, and most fundamentally, there is the question of legitimacy and local ownership. Self-determination is not just aright under the UN Charter– it is a fundamental desire of all peoples to shape their own affairs, and to build their own societies. The imposition of governance from the outside – a colonialist venture with a long history premised on the extraction of wealth through the repression of freedom – is simply not a sustainable path to a stable politics, because it is by nature lacking in popular support or buy-in, and incapable of an accurate and sufficiently nuanced understanding of local culture and dynamics. A Blair-led government of Gaza would, just like the American government of Iraq, be an incompatible transplant that would be rejected by the body, leading to a cycle of violence and escalation that is entirely avoidable and in no one’s interest.Well, almost no one’s interest.Blair’s partner in this enterprise, Jared Kushner,is, like America’s chief negotiator,Stephen Witkoff, and, indeed, Donald Trump himself, a real estate developer at heart. In Gaza, Kushner does not see a thriving and vibrant culture whose history coincides with the rise of the pyramids. Rather, he sees only what Israel is creating with American weapons: a flattened ruin on a prime piece of coastland – a beachfront parking lot ready for redevelopment. In this economic fantasy, the people and politics of Gaza are a simple distraction from the opportunity to profit.In the face of the devastation we now see, such visions are not unattractive. Why speak of a Gaza rebuilt for and by Palestinians, when ashining rivieracould offer the same people a share in the prosperity that has risen from the unimagined overnight cities that have materialized on shorelines around the Middle East? This proposal is given a pragmatic boost by Israel’s own insistence that it will not countenance a Palestinian state or Palestinian control of Gaza, and the knowledge from recent experience that anything Israel does not will to happen in besieged Gaza – any construction materials, any reconstruction – cannot happen.But the world does not have to play along with this sugar-coated neocolonialism. The Egyptian-led Arab Plan forGazalays out a clear alternative: a technocratic Palestinian interim government leading to a restoration of a democratically elected Palestinian government, and a reconstruction of Gaza that is designed, led, and implemented by the Palestinian people.Such an approach might not maximize Gaza’s investment profitability. And it would deny Blair his restoration from consultant to ruler. But history – indeed, very recent history – shows that the Kushner-Blair proposal is not only a moral atrocity, but a policy one, too. Thousands of Palestinians remain buried under the rubble of Gaza – and yet thousands more yearn to rebuild it. You cannot build a riviera on the bones of the dead. And you cannot build an occupation on the aspirations of the living.Josh Paul served as a national security consultant in the Coalition Provisional Authority for Iraq, a security sector governance adviser to the US security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian territories, and now leads Washington DC-based non-profit advocacy groupA New PolicyExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionPalestineGazaTony BlairIsraelIsrael-Gaza warJared KushnercommentShareReuse this content"

But without pledges on improving living standards, his rhetoric risks ringing hollowTue 30 Sep 2025 13.42 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.51 EDTShareSir Keir Starmer’s party conferencespeechwas billed as a reset – a chance to reframe the argument he had been seen to be losing. He lost no time in naming the fight with Nigel Farage and Reform UK as an existential contest between decency and grievance, renewal versus decline. It was Sir Keir’s most impressive political performance: clear, moral and passionate.Labour’s leader spoke with a confidence previously lacking. His stirring defence of his party as a uniting force in a polarised country rightly drew applause. His stories with a moral attached gave his address a warmth the prime minister rarely displays. Sir Keir’s jibe that Reform is a party that doesn’t like or “believe in Britain” is a clever retort. It didn’t always work. Emphasising Labour as the party ofvocational– not university – education is risky when the government is courting tech and pharma companies.The speech was also incomplete. It showed what Sir Keir stands for. But it also revealed what he doesn’t stand for: fiscal expansion, bolder redistribution and fully engaging with the politics of living standards. Tellingly, he made no mention of his government’s£5bn Pride in Placescheme, which could have been a perfect answer to the grievance politics Reform thrives on. It was a missed opportunity to connect national renewal to visible investment in left-behind communities.Sir Keir declared that “the defining mission of this government is to grow the economy”. But such language leaves voters cold. He went on to say that this meant “more money for trips, meals out”, but it was curiously unpersuasive. This highlighted the key weakness of his pitch. He won’t win the fight with the populist right on values alone, especially if voters’ lives feel precarious under Labour. That is because Reform’s rise is not just about identity. It is rooted in publicdiscontentwith day-to-day economic insecurity, NHS waiting lists and the sense of drift.The talk of “national renewal” may soothe a restless party faithful, but without sharper pledges – on getting bills down and reversing local decline – they will not shift the dial outside the hall. This points to the central problem of the government: the rhetoric of renewal will remain just that without fiscal firepower. Labour has announced more money for capital projects: infrastructure, green energy and social housing. But the day-to-day funding streams that sustain public services such as social care and local government remainsqueezed.Thepopularityof the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, stems in part from a willingness to think differently about economic policy and cultural challenges. Labour is losingsupportnot just to Reform, but to the Greens and Liberal Democrats. The tactical voting that delivered Sir Keir’s 2024 majority has evaporated. Unless material improvements are delivered quickly, Labour’s electoral coalition will continue to fragment.Sir Keir’s message is that Labour must end decline through growth, investment and fairness. But his policy stance is to stick rigidly to fiscal rules that won’t help that mission. This contradiction is visible in the polls. Voters hear the promises, feel the limits and conclude that Labour lacks direction. With crucialelectionsnext May, it is welcome news that Sir Keir has found a narrative and is taking on Reform. But without bolder fiscal moves and sharper pledges, his speech is unlikely to mark a substantial turnaround in his – or his party’s – fortunes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, labelled it “abhorrent. Teaching unions wrote a letter last weekcondemning it as “cruel”. At last, it appears that the days of this malign Conservative policy are numbered, with rising expectations that the strict two-child rule will be relaxed in this autumn’s budget, when the delayed child poverty strategy is also due.The harms of rising child poverty stretch far beyond its immediate effects on children growing up in deprivation. Labour ministers know this. Improving the life chances of children from less privileged backgrounds has always been a core aim of social democratic politics.Growing up without enough food, space or opportunities, including education, causes lasting damage and holds back communities as well as individuals.The return of widespread hunger, leading to the rise of food banks, was perhaps the single most corrosive consequence of austerity. Twenty years ago, it would have been hard to imagine large-scale food handouts becoming normalised to the extent that they have been. The latest figures showed that4.5m childrenin the UK were defined as living in poverty in the year to April 2024, an increase of 100,000 on the year before – withScotlandthe only part of the UK that is predicted to buck the trend over this parliament.The cap, which restricts the child-linked element of universal credit to a family’s first two children, is not the only reason for the shameful decline in the poorest households’ living standards. But its removal would lift around half a million children out of poverty straight away. At a discussion hosted by ChildPovertyAction Group at Labour’s conference on Monday, the message to the newly appointed minister for early years education, Olivia Bailey, could not have been clearer: hurry up.So far, the government’s efforts to help the poorest children have mainly involved additional services:new breakfast clubs, a Best Start programme modelled on New Labour’s Sure Start – though on a far smaller scale – and increased eligibility for free school meals. But welcome as such initiatives are, the underlying problem isincomes.Dismayingly, if not surprisingly given this government’s past form, it appears that rather than simply scrapping the two-child limit, Rachel Reeves isconsidering a range of options including a taper, so that subsequent children would qualify for benefit payments at a lower rate. Pressure from backbenchers and from outside parliament will have to be kept up if she is to be persuaded to get rid of it altogether.She and her colleagues should also look beyond this single, totemic policy. Child poverty rightly enjoys special status among campaigners, but it must not be seen in isolation. The two-child limit was part of a suite of Tory anti-welfare policies including the overall benefit cap and thecap on housing payments, which means that families relying on benefits for rent are priced out of more prosperous areas.Other policies besides uncapping payments will be needed to address the problem of entrenched poverty. As Angela Rayner and Mr Burnham have argued,more social housingis essential both to make families more secure and reduce the power of landlords to set prices. But while lifting the two-child limit must not be viewed as an end point, it would be a significant both in itself and as a signal of progressive intent. It should have happened already.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Even as he criticised Nigel Farage’s cruel intervention pledging to end indefinite leave to remain, he and the home secretary still promised harsher, more restrictive conditions for immigrants. As if all the country’s problems are immigrants’ fault.TheLabourgovernment and Reform do not seem to have any real disagreement on immigration, just on how hard to pursue the same goal. There is disagreement on style, not substance. This is why Starmer could never win this fight: while he aids the radicalisation of public discourse by normalising xenophobia, he will always look like a watered-down Farage.If he really wants to “take the fight to Reform”, he can start by telling the truth about immigration to this country: that it is incredibly hard and expensive to come to the UK; that international students subsidise home students in UK universities; that every visa holder ends up paying thousands of pounds into the NHS; that immigrants support the economy through their work and pay taxes like everyone else. But most visa holders have no recourse to public funds. This means that they are excluded from the welfare state but are nonetheless asked to be grateful for the generosity shown to them.Most Britons are unaware of the realities of being an immigrant in their country. So it’s no wonder that the far right is gaining ground on this issue. If Labour wants to change this, it must change the narrative, start telling the truth and address the real social problems that would make a difference to people’s lives, rather than blaming it all on foreigners.Guy FasslerSt Andrews, FifeKeir Starmer says Reform UK’s pledge to scrap indefinite leave to remain is racist and immoral. Labour’s own plans involve doubling the qualifying periodto 10 yearsand imposing a string of conditions to make acquisition of the status more difficult. So that’s Labour’s pitch, is it? “Vote for us; we’re a bit less racist and immoral than Reform.”Years ago, I was a Labour member, and even a parliamentary candidate. After the savage cuts to overseas development, the lack of action on Gaza and now this, there’s no way I’d consider even voting for it. New Labour was as far to the right as I was prepared to go; Starmer’s Labour is well outside my comfort zone.Doug MaughanDunblane, StirlingWhy can Labour no longer rely on British ethnic-minority voters like me? Maybe because, even when trying to sound inclusive, it still speaks of “us” as “them”. Rachel Reeves says “the person who is sitting next to you” might be deported under Reform UK’s plans. But what if that person is you? Until Labour can refer to the18% of people who don’t identify as whiteas “us” instead of “them”, the party will keep sounding like it’s talking about outsiders, not all of us, including those of us with nowhere else to go.Sunil BhopalNewcastle upon TyneHow ill-advised Keir Starmer is to refer to Reform UK as “an enemy” (Keir Starmer to warn Labour that battle with Reform is ‘fight for soul of the nation’, 27 September). Has he not learned from what happened to the Democrats when, in the 2016 US presidential election, Hillary Clinton used similar factional language in her contest with Donald Trump? Starmer needs Reform voters to believe in Labour. Casting them as foes is unlikely to achieve this.Dr Roger HancockLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is a pity that it doesn’t also consider the risks to the future of the NHS posed by the 10-year health plan, which shifts outpatients from publicly owned hospitals to public-private-funded neighbourhood health centres and commits to contracting out NHS services, embedding privatisation.Those who feel relaxed about the use of the private sector to deliver NHS care should note thedevastating impact it is having on NHS eye careand theresearch by the Centre for Health and the Public Interestshowing that on average £1 in every £3 that the NHS pays for a cataract operations leaks out in the form of profit.

Clearly, contracting out leads to a loss of state capacity to deliver.There are real fears that theNHSwill be hollowed out and share the same fate as social care: something that everyone wants to be there should they need it, but which the state no longer has the means – or will – to deliver.Margaret GreenwoodFormer MP for Wirral WestHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A few weeks ago, I paid £255 to the British Heart Foundation on eBay for a coffee table. I went to collect it, but the shop had mistakenly given it to another customer, who had bought a similar nest of tables. The other customer had paid for two tables, but taken three, and ignored requests to return one. They were happy to steal £255 from a charity.This shop apparently suffers losses from shoplifting too, but feels that involving the police discourages donors. I disagree. We should be shouting loudly about disgraceful thefts from charities.Susan WoodSheffieldHonesty may salve your conscience, but it may not work out so well for the person who made the error. I regularly buy coffee beans from a reliable supplier. My order is the same each time: six 1kg bags in one box – enough for six months of domestic use. On one occasion, I received six boxes,each containing six 1kg bags of beans, so 36kg of coffee – enough to last three years. I was tempted.But I have a Jiminy Cricket-type friend (ie one with greater integrity) who convinced me to send it back. She was right, of course. So I called the supplier and the salesperson was quite bemused at my honesty; she told me that they would never have noticed (they send out coffee in commercial amounts), but now they could find out who made the mistake. I was conflicted. I had done the right thing, but I may well have got some poor worker into trouble.David GommWitney, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Arne Slot presided over back‑to‑back defeats for only the second time in his Liverpool tenure asGalatasaraytriumphed on a raucous night in Istanbul. The performance should trouble Liverpool’s head coach more than the result.Liverpool were sloppy, again, suspect defensively, again, and short on ideas as they succumbed to Victor Osimhen’s first-half penalty. Defeat would have been heavier had the Galatasaray striker not squandered two clear openings early in the second half but was deserved nonetheless.‘Don’t panic’: Van Dijk’s message to Liverpool fans after second defeat in four daysRead moreThe visitors were almost reprieved by the award of an 89th‑minute penalty but even that did not go their way. The referee, Clément Turpin, overturned his decision to penalise Davinson Sánchez for a foul on Ibrahima Konaté – the former Tottenham defender played the ball first – after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor.Slot defended Liverpool’s performance along with his decision to rest Mohamed Salah until the 62nd minute. He also blamed a disjointed second half on Galatasaray’s tendency to go down at the slightest touch.Defeat, however, was largely self-inflicted.It was a surprise to see Salah on the bench for such a high‑profile European occasion even taking into account his modest start to the season and recent workload. Alexander Isak, Alexis Mac Allister and Conor Bradley were also benched as Slot made four changes fromthe side beaten at Crystal Palaceon Saturday.Jeremie Frimpong took Salah’s place with Dominik Szoboszlai stationed behind him at right-back again. The Hungary midfielder came in for a testing night against the pace of Baris Alper Yilmaz. The same could be said of the entire Liverpool team in the first half as Galatasaray embraced the occasion.Rams Park, or Ali Sami Yen Spor Kompleksi to give Galatasaray’s home their unsponsored name, pulsated with noise 45 minutes before kick‑off. Incessant, deafening whistles greeted every Liverpool touch after it. There was also a classy moment at kick-off whena tribute to Diogo Jotawas displayed on the giant screen and the digital hoardings around the arena.Okan Buruk’s team have made a 100% start to the Super Lig season as they pursue a fourth consecutive Turkish league title but domestic dominance has not transferred into European competition often. This was only Galatasaray’s second win in 19Champions Leaguegroup games, coming off the back of a 5-1 trouncing at Eintracht Frankfurt on the opening night, and it seemed the entire club – players to fanbase – were determined to make amends.View image in fullscreenVictor Osimhen scores his early penalty for Galatasaray.Photograph: Francisco Seco/APYilmaz scorched past Szoboszlai at Galatasaray’s first attack. The forward was through on goal but, as at Selhurst Park, Alisson stood his ground well to make an important block. There would be no reprieve for Liverpool’s makeshift full-back when Yilmaz next ran at him.Hugo Ekitiké steered a free header wide from Cody Gakpo’s cross as the visitors attempted to silence the din. Gakpo created another opening for Ekitiké when slipping him through with a neat pass. Ugurcan Cakir stood tall and saved with his legs only for the rebound to fall to Gakpo. His volley was blocked on the line by Ismail Jakobs and 25 seconds later, after Florian Wirtz had squandered possession with an over-elaborate back-heel, Galatasaray were awarded a penalty. The hosts broke through Ilkay Gündogan and Yilmaz, who again attacked Szoboszlai from the left and cut back inside the defender before collapsing to the ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Osimhen drilled the spot-kick straight down the centre of Alisson’s goal.Galatasaray v Liverpool: Champions League – liveRead moreLiverpool dominated possession and outnumbered the Galatasaray defence on several counterattacks without creating a clear opportunity. Cakir saved from Wirtz at close range, desperate defending prevented Ekitiké and Milos Kerkez converting at the resulting corner, and Konaté headed wide at the near post. But Slot’s side were unconvincing at the back and almost punished again when Osimhen dispossessed Ryan Gravenberch before being tripped by the midfielder just outside the Liverpool area. The £65m striker felt he was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity but Gravenberch was punished with a yellow card.Osimhen, a disruptive force all night, was gifted a chance to double the hosts’ lead when he dispossessed Curtis Jones and burst through on goal. Jones atoned with a superb challenge. A mix-up between Konaté and Gravenberch offered Osimhen another opening but he shot tamely at Alisson. The Liverpool keeper was injured in the process and had to be replaced by Giorgi Mamardashvili.Alisson’s replacement was hardly troubled once Osimhen departed with an injury. Neither was Cakir, despite Liverpool penning Galatasaray in during the closing stages.

The fleeting nature of both has been accentuated by the loss of Buttler’s father, John,after his unexpected deathin August. The 35-year-old will soon talk movingly about grief and acceptance but, first, he reflects on his venerable place in white-ball cricket after England’s international summer ended in alow-key series in Ireland.Buttler opened the batting and Jacob Bethell and Rehan Ahmed, who followed him at three and four in the opening match, are both 21. But he had proved his sustained brilliance a few weeks earlier when, against South Africa, he hit 83 off 30 balls in a blistering knock that helped England to become thefirst team to pass 300 in a T20 international.“They were affectionately calling me Grandpa,” Buttler says of his teammates in Ireland. “It was just me and [the 37-year-old] Adil Rashid as the older crew but it’s still great even if sometimes I’m thinking: ‘God, how lucky you guys are to have all this ahead of you.’ But I’ve made a conscious effort to try not to think about my age. I’m going to play cricket like this as long as I can and just enjoy it.”We’re in a London studio, soon after Buttler and Stuart Broad finished recording this week’s episode of their successfulFor the Love of Cricket podcast. I’m in the chair where Rob Key, the managing director of the England cricket team, had sat while Broad and Buttler interviewed him.But Buttler slips seamlessly into the role of interviewee as he talks honestly about his emotions.View image in fullscreenJos Buttler looks to the skies after reaching 50 against South Africa at Old Trafford this month.Photograph: George Franks/ProSports/Shutterstock“I got out for a duck in my last innings [in Dublin] and I was absolutely gutted,” he says. “But as long as I’m getting annoyed when I don’t do well, I’ve still got that edge.”Does he still have “fuck it” written on the top of his bat handle? “I do. At the non-striker’s end I look at it as it’s a nice reminder about what matters to me.”On his podcast Buttler spoke about how this year he had dug out his old notebooks where he used to write down his cricketing thoughts. “In the last six months I’ve stopped doing that. As a [white‑ball] captain I had some good days and a few more bad days and I was especially knocked after the 50-over World Cup in India [whenEngland were hapless in 2023]. I took those old books to India to the IPL [in March] and read through them. I found very similar themes throughout the last 10 years.Every time I play, I find myself looking at the sky and imagining him looking downJos Buttler on his fatherIf I was playing great I was writing the same thing – just like when I was playing badly.“It made me think I’ve got to stop trying so hard. I had a great IPL, played as well as I’ve ever played, and I was like: ‘Wow, I can play well without writing my notes, without saying I need to do X, Y, Z.’”Buttler takes another mouthful of sushi and chews thoughtfully. “It all comes full circle and, in the latter part of my career, I want to enjoy it and not hang on to things as hard as I may have done.”A brutal test of this philosophy came less than two months ago when his dad died. “It happened during the Hundred and it was quite raw. He hadn’t been well for a while but it was still a shock when he passed away. It’s given me a new appreciation of cricket and I’ve actually found a lot of determination to do my best because that was all he ever wanted me to do. Now, every time I play I find myself looking at the sky quite a lot and imagine him watching down.”Buttler’s voice is steady but his face is creased in pain. “It’s been a tough time but it’s given me a deeper appreciation for how much he and my mum did for me. I still really want to win and you feel disappointed when you don’t do well. But it’s not the be-all and end‑all as the loss of a parent really gives that perspective.”View image in fullscreenJos Buttler says he has taken recent inspiration from Joe Root.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThinking about grief he says: “A few people who have been through the same experience said: ‘Don’t judge yourself for how you feel. There’re times when you feel happy and you’re having a good time. Don’t think you shouldn’t because your dad passed away four weeks ago.’ It’s also OK to feel sad. Don’t just ignore it, you’ve got to try to deal with it. So I’m taking it slow and we’ll see how it goes.”He must have thought about his dad when England set their world‑record T20 score of 304 for two, five weeks after his death? “Yes,” Buttler says quietly. “My dad would have absolutely loved that match. He’d have been glued to the TV. He was a very nervous watcher, in the latter years, but he’d have recorded it and replayed it the next day.”Did he sense early on that he and fellow opener Phil Salt had set the foundation for an extraordinary world record? “More so when I got out. I remember seeing the graphic where we were on 166 after 10 overs. I’d been asked in India who’ll be the first team to score 300 in the IPL. I said: ‘I don’t think anyone will do it.’ But then it dawned on me that we could.”Buttler shakes his head in amazement. “After the game you’re sat in your team clothes and don’t want to take them off. You just want to savour the highlights and everyone talking about what a day it was. When you’ve played for a long time you know it doesn’t happen every day. So take it in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s got a great way of talking to the group. He doesn’t get too high or too low but he was so proud and said: ‘Look what’s possible with the talent you guys have got.”That simple joy contrasts with the anguish that Buttlersometimes experienced as England’s white‑ball captain– despite leading them to victory in theT20 World Cupin 2022. “I’m getting more and more clarity and acceptance on that time. Some people said I was a certain way and I would have ego and say: ‘No, I’m not upset. I’m not angry.’ Now, without the mask on, I can say: ‘Maybe I was upset.’ I lost a bit of self‑awareness because the 2023 World Cup in India was a huge confidence knock. I probably never recovered from that as a leader and never had the same conviction again.”Harry Brook replaced him as captain this summer and, for Buttler, “a big burden’s been lifted. Even when I went home I took this dark cloud. That, absolutely, has been lifted.”View image in fullscreenJos Buttler begins the England celebrations after running out New Zealand’s Martin Guptill off the last ball of the super over to win the World Cup in 2019.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianJoe Root struggled as England’s Test captain but, since relinquishing the role, his batting has reached supreme levels. “Definitely,” Buttler says of his close friend. “During my first game, not being captain, Joe was in the side which really helped. I kept wicket, he was at slip and I said: ‘God, it’s a bit weird, isn’t it, when you’re not captain any more?’ Joe said it’s normal to feel like this. He said when people talk in the dressing room in a positive way, sometimes it makes you feel like they’re talking negatively about your captaincy. You have to realise that’s not the case. Seeing how much he’s enjoying cricket, and playing so well, gives me lots of comfort you can have a great time post-captaincy.”After a brief white‑ball tour of New Zealand this month, Buttler will have a six-week break before playing franchise cricket in South Africa. But he will be consumed by watching the Ashes.“The Ashes are strange for me because, obviously, it’s the best series but my own performances were really poor. I’ve got fond memories of watching other players do well, and being in teams that won in 2015 and drew in 2019 when Australia retained the urn. It’s more intense than anything else in cricket and, in 2015, I completely overbuilt it. I made it such a big thing and asked so many people: ‘Why is it so hard? What do I need to do?’ It was a good lesson because I spoke to way too many people and was paralysed by all that information.”View image in fullscreenJos Buttler reacts after losing his wicket in the 2023 World Cup defeat to Sri Lanka.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/ReutersButtler played four Tests in Australia in 2021-22, England losing the first three badly and clinging on for a draw in Sydney. “It was a tough time. My last-ever Test was in Sydney, where I broke my finger. I think my head was on the chopping block anyway and we were just outplayed. But this very different England team is now in a really good place.”Buttler smiles when I ask him for an Ashes prediction. “England to win 3-2 in an absolute classic. I think we’ve got an amazing chance with such a settled team. Everything’s coming into place at the right time.”Buttler’s and Broad’s podcast should reach fresh heights during a compelling series. They’ve already developed a relaxed rapport while conducting fascinating in-depth interviews with people as different as McCullum and Justin Langer. “I’ve learned how much I love talking about cricket,” Buttler says. “It’s obviously a big part of everything that we do, and it’s shaped everything, but getting the chance to talk in detail with Broady has been so enjoyable. And it’s been great learning new skills without it affecting my cricket.”The T20 and 50-over World Cups both take place next year. It’s telling that, after all his reflections on life and loss, Buttler is clear when he outlines his remaining ambitions in cricket: “I want to win something again, especially with England in another World Cup. To experience that winning dressing room again would be special.“I’ll never forget what it was like lifting that trophy in 2022 with your team all around you. That probably got tainted by the next few years. But when we won the [50-over] World Cup in 2019 it was never tainted. It would be good to have that feeling again.”Explore more on these topicsJos ButtlerEngland cricket teamCricketinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The 62-year-old’s time at the top of the coaching tree belongs to a different era and, for all the nostalgia about Mourinho’s trophy-laden spells atChelseabefore this game, the main takeaway from his return to Stamford Bridge is that this is a manager who no longer gets job offers from Europe’s biggest teams.The buildup was more entertaining than the actual football. Chelsea, carrying injuries and a long way below their best, were comfortable against Mourinho’s tepid Benfica. They dug out a 1-0 win, a messy own goal the difference on a night that did not feel like a good advert for the extendedChampions League, and for 95 minutes the job was done so efficiently it almost could have passed as a tribute to Mourinho’s pomp.José Mourinho says he wants results not memories after defeat on Chelsea returnRead moreChelsea being Chelsea, though, there still had to be complications as they edged towards their first win of the league phase. They were into the sixth minute of added time when João Pedro, on as a second‑half substitute, picked up a second yellow for a clumsy foul.Rashness still plagues Enzo Maresca’s young side. They have received three red cards in as many games and it is not ideal that João Pedro will be suspended for the home game against Ajax given that injuries to Liam Delap and Cole Palmer have already left Chelsea short up front.Maresca will shuffle through his squad for options. This was a moment to rotate and rest weary limbs. There were rare starts for Alejandro Garnacho, Facundo Buonanotte and Tyrique George in attack. Maresca liked Garnacho’s performance but this was not wholly convincing. Jamie Gittens was quiet during his cameo. Estêvão was bright after coming on, almost scoring a late header. Application was not the issue. It was more that Chelsea are missing some big players, are not at their physical peak and are simply not clicking at the moment.At least they avoided a stumble on their trip down memory lane. The narrative about how Mourinho’s return would show how standards have dropped since Roman Abramovich’s departure never materialised. The Mourinho of 2025, after all, is not in charge of one of the Champions League’s giants.Benfica, who have lost their first two games of the league phase, were a blunt proposition. Chelsea held them at arm’s length.A couple of late scares will not stop Maresca from dwelling on the positives. Under pressure after a poor run, Chelsea showed resolve to respond tolosing against Bayern Munichin the opening week of fixtures. The defending was solid enough to raise hope for tougher assignments. Chelsea, without offering much excitement, delivered. They will look to raise their level again when Liverpool visit on Saturday.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho acknowledges the Chelsea supporters on his return to Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Nigel French/Getty Images/AllstarDealing with the Mourinho show will lift morale. Maresca is yet to inspire as much warmth as his predecessor. The mood has been tense, the memory ofClub World Cup gloryin danger of fading already. Maresca needed a response. He made five changes after Brighton handed Chelsea their second consecutive league defeat last Saturday. The starting XI, though, was raw. It was unsurprising that Chelsea made a nervy start.Benfica could have led after eight minutes, a Marc Cucurella error leading to Robert Sánchez pushing Dodi Lukébakio’s shot against a post. Chelsea were loose. Benfica were emboldened. Richard Ríos tested Sánchez again.Sensing the anxiety, Maresca called for calm when Benoît Badiashile rushed a long pass out of play. Chelsea stirred. Pedro Neto, one of their more experienced players, took over. The winger threatened with a rasping effort and was involved when Chelsea went ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neto delivered a deep cross from the right. Garnacho ghosted in unnoticed and saw Ríos turn his cutback into his own net under little pressure.The frustration for Mourinho, who returned to Benfica two weeks ago, was that Chelsea were short of incision. But this is by no means a great Benfica team. They are third in the Primeira Liga and there is doubt over whether Rui Costa will be re‑elected president this month.Benfica were bland, unrecognisable, Lukébakio the sole inspiration in attack. George could have made it 2-0 to Chelsea. It was tight. Benfica pushed at the start of the second half. Maresca saw the shift. He took the blame for making poor substitutions when Chelsea were down to 10 during their defeats against Brighton and Manchester United. This time he was positive, Estêvão on for Buonanotte before the hour.Mourinho waited in vain for Benfica to rally, João Pedro’s dismissal changing nothing. Trevoh Chalobah and Badiashile, making his first start since injuring himself against these opponentsin the last 16 of the Club World Cup, were solid in central defence. For Maresca, of course, the worry is that Chalobah misses the Liverpool game through suspension. Badiashile’s return is timely but injuries have left Chelsea stretched at the back. Concerns over Badiashile’s partner against Liverpool linger. For now, though, Maresca will take the win and move on.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaBenficaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Historically they have often been a side whose performances did not match their results, but tradition has it they would be pretty and ineffective. Under Thomas Frank they have become the opposite.Midway through the second half Spurs were 2-0 down and apparently on their way to a convincing defeat. They rode their luck as Andreas Helmersen hit the bar with an effort that would have made it 3-1, but they had the character to battle back and secure a 2-2 draw.No happy Chelsea return for José Mourinho as Ríos own goal sinks BenficaRead moreDoggedness and resilience have not been stereotypical Spurs qualities. Bodø/Glimt’s fans seemed happy enough at the end, serenading their players – and perhaps there was a sense of Tottenham’s greater quality telling – but this was a game they could have won with ease.“We showed big character to fight back,” Frank said. “It’s hugely important that they have that to keep running, keep fighting, to do the right thing. We kept moving the ball, kept creating chances from wide. Until 2-0 they were the better team but after that we got on top.”It was the third time in four games that Spurs have conceded the opening goal of the game, but Frank believes that is coincidence. Only in this match did he accept that Tottenham had “struggled” early on, insisting thatagainst both Brightonand Wolves, Spurs had conceded against the run of play. That was emphatically not the case here. “On the ball I felt we could and should have kept the ball better,” Frank said, something he blamed on a lack of both structure and willingness to be bold. “A little bit on the day where you just need better touches, better decisions, better passes.”Perhaps missing the leadership of Cristian Romero, left in London as a precaution, Tottenham never imposed themselves physically as they had in beating Bodø/Glimt in theEuropa League semi-finalin May. Here the home side had their chances before a late challenge from Rodrigo Bentancur on Fredrik André Bjørkan conceded a 32nd-minute penalty.Presented with a historic chance, though, Kasper Høgh smashed his shot so high over the bar that it cleared the seating behind the goal and might even have cleared the tiled roofs of the houses across the street had there not been a net strung between the flagpoles at the top of the stand.View image in fullscreenJens Petter Hauge shows his delight after giving Bodø/Glimt a second-half lead.Photograph: Marius Simensen/BILDBYRÅN/ShutterstockIt was Bodø/Glimt’s first home game in the group phase of theChampions League, and they were determined to make the most of it. The pre-match singing of the club anthem was heartfelt and gently moving, and followed by the rhythmic detonation of a series of fireworks, startlingly loud in the still Arctic night. European football has little place these days for romance but Glimt remain an example of what can be achieved by enlightened leadership even in a remote town of just over 50,000 population.They may have won four of the past five Norwegian championships, and be handily placed as this season’s title race enters the run-in, but this is not a club that has become sated by silverware. In the 1980s, as they slid into the third flight, Glimt were not even the biggest team in Bodø, that honour belonging to Grand.Back then their main claim to fame was the forward slash in their name, introduced to avoid the confusion their hyphen caused on betting coupons. The hyphen itself was a product of Glimt adding Bodø to their name in 1948 so they would not be mixed up with a similarly named club from Trøndelag.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is still a club for whom playing in the Champions League is a privilege.The honour of scoring their first home goal in the group phase went to a homegrown talent in Jens Petter Hauge, albeit he has had spells away at Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt, where he became the first Norwegian to win the Europa League. Drifting in from the left, he was a persistent menace, both goals highlighting his balance and technical quality.Nikita Haikin, the Glimt goalkeeper, had pointed out how “unusual” it was that Spurs focus so much on set plays and for a long time that did appear their only threat. Bentancur seemed to have levelled two minutes after the Glimt opener, as the ball was returned to the centre after a Pedro Porro free-kick had hit the post; it was ruled out after a VAR review for a pull by Micky van de Ven.Spurs did score two minutes after Glimt’s second, Van de Ven heading in another Porro free-kick. Wilson Odobert headed a Mohammed Kudus delivery against the crossbar but the equaliser did arrive in the 89th minute as Archie Gray’s shot ricocheted in off Jostein Gundersen, the fourth own goal from which Spurs have benefited this season.Deserved?

His ban was backdated to his suspension in 2023, so he will be able to return to coaching in April next year.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Mr Young could be very forceful to the point of exerting pressure so severe that it amounted to manipulation or bullying,” the initial independent panel found in its written judgment. “This resulted in athletes feeling that they had no realistic option but to acquiesce to his wishes if they wished to remain within his training group.”Such behaviour, the panel added, included instructing an athlete to post a tweet “that would be very likely to cause annoyance to their sponsor and risked harming their relationship with the sponsor” – something it said was wholly unnecessary.On another occasion, Young was found to have made a comment about an athlete’s weight which upset them while the coach was driving. In response, Young began to drive very fast such that the athlete asked to get out of the car. When they did so, Young drove off.Muir and Reekie split with Young afterdisagreements over his behaviourat a warm-weather training camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa, in 2023, after which he was suspended.The athletes involved, six in total, are anonymised in the reports. A statement from UKA did not indicate if Reekie was among the complainants, however Muir said she was waiving her anonymity to confirm her involvement in the case.“I fully support the decisions reached by both independent panels and I am grateful that the process has been followed through so thoroughly,” she said.“Athletics has always been my passion, and I am pleased to say that I have rediscovered the love of my sport and the enjoyment of training and working within a supportive and positive coaching environment. I am now focused on the future, looking forward to the next few years of my career, and putting this difficult chapter firmly behind me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was reduced by three years by an appeals panel, though it rejected Young’s claims of bias, legal error and unfairness in the initial hearing. It also agreed that seven of his breaches were serious and that revocation of his licence was necessary to protect athletes.The verdict is the latest in a series of coaching scandals that have hit British Olympic sport across cycling, swimming, athletics and elsewhere, over the past decade. However, the UK Athletics chief executive, Jack Buckner, promised that “significant culture change” had been made within his organisation in recent years, including strengthening reporting systems for athletes.“This has been a difficult and sobering case for everyone involved in athletics,” he said. “There is no level of success on the track which can ever justify behaviours that fall so short of the standards required of a UKA licensed coach.Young has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsLaura MuirnewsShareReuse this content"

But Trump’s announcement of his plan in a joint press conference with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday put any measures on hold.Fifa banned Russia from international football. Now it must do the same for IsraelRead moreUefa never officially confirmed that it was considering an extraordinary meeting of its executive committee to vote on whether to exclude Israel from its competitions, but plans on the proposal were understood to be well developed, with any meeting expected to have been called at short notice.National federations who had been supportive of a ban accepted the decision to pause, with sources saying it would be “stupid” for Uefa to take individual action while collective peace efforts are under way. That position may be revisited if there is not agreement over the Trump deal, with Trump saying on Tuesday that Hamas had “three or four days” to accept his proposals.Last week a group of senior diplomats last week called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the publication of a report by the UN independent international commission of inquiry thatfound Israel was committing genocidein Gaza. A fortnight ago the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York’s Times Square to urge federations to boycott matches with the country.The announcement of the Trump plan has swung the pendulum again, with the proposal welcomed by Keir Starmer on Tuesday alongside leaders from France and Germany among other European nations. It has also been backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan, whose foreign ministers relayed their support in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The forward sealed his hat-trick in the 73rd minute, unleashing a thunderous strike from the edge of the box into the top corner following a dazzling run by Rodrygo. The Brazilian then set up Eduardo Camavinga to head home before Brahim Díaz completed the rout in stoppage time with a close-range finish.“We must never forget [what happened on Saturday],” Mbappé told Movistar Plus. “We have to keep thinking about what happened last weekend so we can learn from our mistakes and work to ensure it doesn’t happen again.“My job is to help the team and I only think about doing what I can to help the team win matches and trophies. A player like me, when he has five chances, wants and has to score all five. That’s why Real Madrid bought me and I always want more.

The documents state the couple has undergone “marital difficulties and irreconcilable differences”.Kidman and Urban, two of the biggest stars to come out of Australia in recent decades, have been red carpet fixtures throughout their two-decade relationship, with Urban joining his wife at the Oscars and Kidman attending music events such as the Academy of Country Music Awards.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe filings include a marriage dissolution and childcare plan agreed on by the couple and submitted for a judge’s approval.“The mother and father will behave with each other and each child so as to provide a loving, stable, consistent and nurturing relationship with the child even though they are divorced,” says the permanent parenting plan, using language common in the state’s divorces.“They will not speak badly of each other or the members of the family of the other parent. They will encourage each child to continue to love the other parent and be comfortable in both families.”The plan asks that Kidman be the primary residential parent to the couple’s two daughters, ages 17 and 14, having them for 306 days per year with Urban taking them for the other 59.The girls have lived in Nashville all their lives and the documents give no indication that will change.The filing states that each parent earns more than $100,000 per month and neither will need childcare or spousal support.The marriage dissolution plan lays out a roughly equal division of joint assets, with each keeping all the assets that are in their own name, including the copyrights and royalties for their artistic work.The detailed agreements suggests that the divorce had been in the works for well over a month at the least. Urban signed the parenting plan on 29 August, Kidman on 6 September.Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban split after 19 yearsRead moreIt will take at least 90 days for the divorce to become final under Tennessee law.Representatives for Kidman and Urban did not respond to emailed requests for comment on Tuesday.Both raised in Australia, Kidman and Urban met in 2005 at a Los Angeles event honoring Australians and were married in Sydney the following year.The marriage was the first for Urban and the second for Kidman, who was married to Tom Cruise from 1990 to 2001. Kidman also has two older children with Cruise.The couple had publicly but lovingly described some marital difficulties, but there were still few if any signs they were headed for divorce. Media reports of their separation came just a day before the divorce filing.Last year at the premiere of the Netflix series The Perfect Couple, Kidman told the Associated Press the term didn’t apply to her and Urban.“You’re heading for trouble if you consider yourselves the perfect couple,” she said. “I’m not a believer in perfect.”A few months earlier, Urban paid tribute to Kidman, and brought her to tears, when she received the AFI Life Achievement Award.Urban said she showed him “what love in action really looks like” when his substance abuse problems emerged almost immediately after they wed in 2006.“Four months into our marriage, I’m in rehab for three months,” Urban said. “Nic pushed through every negative voice, I’m sure even some of her own, and she chose love. And here we are 18 years later.”Kidman’s film roles have included Days of Thunder, Eyes Wide Shut, Moulin Rouge and The Hours, for which she won an Academy Award for her portrayal of author Virginia Woolf. She has more recently worked in television, including the series Nine Perfect Strangers and Big Little Lies, for which she won Emmys as both actor and producer.Urban has been a major country star since the 1990s, with hits including Somebody Like You and Blue Ain’t Your Color. He has won four Grammy awards and more than a dozen ACM awards.Their split was first reported by TMZ.Explore more on these topicsCultureNicole KidmannewsShareReuse this content"

Bookshops receive 30% of the cover price from each sale they generate; so far, the UK site has generated £4.5m for independent bookshops.Customers will also now be able to buy ebooks through a bookshop of their choice. Profits from orders without a specified bookshop will be added to a shared pool, which will be distributed among all participating bookshops on the platform.“Our true love might be print, but ebooks are an important part of the lives of so many readers,” said Nic Bottomley, co-owner of Mr B’s Emporium of Reading Delights in Bath.Erin Kelly, author ofThe Poison Tree, said: “One of the best things about the ebook revolution has been the ability to reach readers who can’t access traditional books.” She said she was thrilled that the “ultimate inclusive format” would now be available on Bookshop.org. The site also plans to launch audiobooks in 2026.Nearly a quarter of Britons now prefer ebooks over other formats, according to a YouGov poll conductedearlier this year.The platform will launch with a catalogue of more than a million ebooks from all major publishers.

The network’s decision reportedly followed a wave of cancellations of Disney’s streaming service Disney+.Carr’s comments drew criticism from across the aisle.Ted Cruz, the Republican Texas senator, said some of Carr’s remarks were “dangerous as hell”.Asked at a press conference on Tuesday whether he regrets the phrasing he used when talking about Kimmel, Carr claimed “the full words that I said, the full context of the interview”, were very clear.“For a lot of Democrats, this has really been about distortion and projection,” he added. He then accused Senate Democrats of hypocrisy,referring to calls in 2018for the FCC to review Sinclair’s “fitness to retain its existing broadcast licenses” over a controversial “must-run” video that its stations were forced to broadcast.“The very same Democrats that are saying that I said something that I didn’t are the same ones that engaged in that exact same type of conduct that they claim I did,” he said.With Kimmel now back on air, Carr suggested the entire episode was actually a win for local broadcasters – and a necessary check on the control of New York- and Hollywood-based broadcasters.“What we saw over the last two weeks was, probably for the first time in maybe 20 or 30 years, local TV stations – the actual licensed entities that are tied to specific communities – pushing back and saying that they did not want to run particular national programs,” he said. “They felt like they could stand up for themselves. I think it’s a good thing. And I hope that we can see potentially more of that going ahead.”Asked by the Guardian whether he was disappointed that Nexstar and Sinclair chose to bring back Kimmel’s show, Carr said he did not expect the pre-emption to last “for any sort of real sustained period of time” due to the economic pressures the companies were facing. “These were decisions ultimately were for them to make,” he said.During the meeting, Anna M Gomez, the lone Democrat on the commission, called out Carr’s comments – as he sat a few feet away. “This FCC threatened to go after [ABC], seizing on a late night comedian’s comments as a pretext to punish speech it disliked,” she said. “That led to a new low of corporate capitulation that put the foundation of the first amendment in danger.”‘Censor-in-chief’: Trump-backed FCC chair at heart of Jimmy Kimmel stormRead moreWhile Gomez has been very critical of Carr’s leadership, she has largely refrained from attacking him personally,and has saidthat she maintains a good working relationship with him.While the FCC meets monthly, Tuesday’s gathering took on added significance and excitement. Outside the FCC building, a mobile billboard truck – organized by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders – carried the message: “Government can’t control media content.”Inside, the meeting room was unusually packed. Several protesters, organized by the progressive political action organization Our Revolution, wore T-shirts that said: “Federal Censorship Commission”. A few stood up during the meeting and yelled: “Fire Carr, the censorship czar,” and were quickly removed. One sign played on Carr’s tough talk to television networks, telling the FCC commissioner: “Brendan, We Can Do This the Easy Way (You Quit) or the Hard Way (You’re Fired).”When told by the Guardian that the “lengthy” (in Carr’s words) agenda for the monthly FCC meeting included seven wonky action items, one protester expressed frustration that they hadn’t eaten breakfast before arriving early. The man left before the meeting concluded.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJimmy KimmelUS politicsTelevision industryABCnewsShareReuse this content"

The third supplier has not been named but is understood to be one of the smaller players in the market.Octopus Energy said earlier this year that it was “fully compliant with Ofgem’s new financial resilience rules” and had a “greater capacity to absorb shocks than many longer-established companies” in part due to the backing of “amongst the largest and most respected funds in the world”.An Ovo spokesperson said the company was a “fully funded entity backed by longstanding shareholders and with ongoing facilities”, adding: “Capital adequacy requirements are new, and all suppliers are working with them for the first time.“This is not a reflection on our ability to serve our customers or on performance this year and we will continue to focus on bringing innovation and long-term investment to the sector.”The warning about the timing and extent of the implementation of Ovo’s capitalisation plan,first reported by the Times, appears in accounts lodged with Companies House but not yet publicly available.Fitzpatrick, who now owns London’s Kensington Roof Gardens, is reportedly in talks to secure the future of the business by selling new shares in the company to raise up to £300m, according to Sky News. The report said Fitzpatrick was also in early talks with Scottish Power over a possible deal to merge their supply businesses.Ovo and Scottish Power declined to comment on the talks.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergyOfgemOctopus EnergynewsShareReuse this content"

But the number of toads hopping through British grasslands, forests and gardens has almost halved in a generation.“Vast numbers of toads are being lost every year,” said Silviu Petrovan, a senior researcher at the University of Cambridge, who was lead author on the study showing just how uncommon the common toad is becoming.Their decline mirrors that of many other domestic species in the UK, where thecollapse in the natural world is acceleratingto runaway speed as desperate calls for conservationconflict with strident demands for growth.“The base-level population is much lower than it was even in the 1980s – and the decline is ongoing, confirming that we need to urgently act to protect this much-loved and once-common species before it’s too late,” Petrovan said.The analysis was based on data from counts of amphibians by “toad patrol” volunteers, who collect and count toads, frogs and sometimes newts from the start to the end of the creatures’ spring breeding migrations, typically between March and April.They found that between 1985 and 2021, the populations of toads counted by the toad patrols had fallen by 41% in the UK. Similar counts carried out in Switzerland showed the abundance of toads there had fallen by a third since 1973.The study focused on trend estimation rather than the reasons for the decline, but the researchers speculated that road traffic was a major driver, combined with loss of ponds, increased urbanisation and the decline of the beetles, earthworms and slugs that toads feed on. In 1908, when Kenneth Grahame published the Wind in the Willows and Mr Toad fell head over heels in love with the motor car (“poop poop!”), he could never have known that decades later there would be millions racing up and down the roads of England, squashing his relatives one by one.Petrovan said: “The situation toads are facing in Britain probably reflects what’s happening both in the wider rural landscape in Britain but also in Europe, too, and thanks to our partners in Switzerland we now understand how toads are faring overseas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It follows a move by Trump togut EERE’s fundingof green technologies.“My reaction was: same shit, different day,” the worker said.‘Spiral of silence’: climate action is very popular, so why don’t people realise it?Read moreIn addition to “climate change”, the banned terms include “decarbonization”, “sustainable”, “emissions” and “green”. Also on the list are “energy transition”, “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy” and “carbon/CO2 ‘Footprint’”.Another set of words to be avoided: “Tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies”, probably because of the terms’ association with Joe Biden’s efforts to subsidize green technologies, which the administration is clawing back.“Banning the use of these words would silence key elements of DOE’s mission,” another anonymous current agency staffer told the Guardian. “But what is even more worrying is that Secretary Wright is also illegally freezing and cancelling programs that fund advanced research into solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies. DOE leadership can choose to stick their heads in the sand, but that won’t make the climate crisis go away or stop super storms and wildfires from destroying more homes.”The Trump administration has this yearasked agency leadersto avoidsome 200 terms– a list that also includes words like “activism” and “injustice”.“Welcome to theDonald Trumppost-truth world,” Dr Ali Khan, a retired US assistant surgeon general and a former director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,wroteon social media.The Department of Energy’s press secretary denies that it has instructed employees to avoid the use of specific terms.“There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as ‘climate change’ or ‘emissions,’” Ben Dietderich, the agency’s press secretary, said in an emailed statement. “President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science. Reflecting that commitment, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright regularly engages on these issues.”Wrightrailed againstclimate policy at the United Nations general assembly last week.How Trump’s assault on US wind industry threatens jobs and power for nearly 5m homesRead more“The more people have gotten into so-called climate action, the more expensive their energy has become,” he told reporters. “That lowers people’s quality of lives and reduces their life opportunities.”He went on to defend a Julyclimate reportproduced by the energy department that experts say is riddled with misinformation, and announce the cancellation of $13bn of funding for renewable energy projects.The recommendations are the latest attempt by the Trump administration to minimize or silence discussions about the threats posed by the climate crisis.

When she was carried into a nearby clinic, unable to move her legs, doctors suspected she had been electrocuted or mauled by a dog.The X-ray machine revealed a more sinister diagnosis: Maria had been shot, the bullet embedding itself in her spinal cord and leaving her paralysed from the abdomen down.“She was in so much pain when she arrived,” recalled Lucas Rebelo, the medic tasked with trying to save her, as he stood by his patient’s bed.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFrom Top: An X-ray of the gunshot wound in Maria’s spine; Maria, the capuchin monkey.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianMaria’s plight is tragically common in a city beset with gun crime, but for one detail: Maria is a capuchin monkey, one of dozens of animals who have been shot here in recent years.“She’s a victim of urban violence,” said Roched Seba, the director of Rio’sInstituto Vida Livre(Free Life Institute) wildlife hospital and rescue center where Maria was taken earlier this month.As Seba offered a tour of the institute’s headquarters by Rio’s Botanical Gardens, he said Maria’s shooting was symptomatic of a city blessed with a cornucopia of biodiversity – butcursed with rampant gun crime.‘Avenue of Death’: the Rio motorway where stray bullets, botched raids and resilience collideRead more“It’s a portrait of Rio’s fauna and Rio’s conflicts,” said the 39-year-old activist whose home is one of the world’s most ecologically diverse urban environments but suffers devastating levels of armed violence.According to Fogo Cruzado (Crossfire), a group which tracks gun violence,816 people suffered firearm injuriesin Rio in the first half of this year, nearly half them fatal. One hundred law enforcement officials and service members were shot.Maria is far from the only wild animal Seba’s group has treated for gunshot wounds.In a coop near Maria’s plastic bed was a black and white feathered mantled hawk that was shot in the wing earlier this year. Rebelo expected the bird to survive, “but he’ll never fly again … He’ll have to be kept in captivity,” he said as an elderly Tegu lizard loitered nearby and a recently rescued woodpecker nipped noisily at its cage.View image in fullscreenA mantled hawk recovers at the Vida Livre Institute after being shot in the wing.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianAccording to Fogo Cruzado’s count at least 69 animals have been shot in Rio over the past decade. The victims include four capybara, three parrots, an alligator,a giant tortoiseshot during a police chase and a dog called Phoenix who was hit during a police operation in the City of God favela. In March, a horse called Sugarfoot waswounded by a stray bulletduring a police raid on heavily armed drug traffickers in another favela near the airport.The actual number of shot animals is likely to be far higher. Within days two dogs were shot this month:a puppy called Nina, hit in the chest as police and traffickers exchanged fire, and another dog nicknamed Irajá who wasreportedlyshot deliberately in the foot by criminals irritated by his bark. “This has become really common,” Rio’s animal welfare secretary, Luiz Ramos Filho, told reporters. “Not even animals escape the extreme barbarity we’ve been living through.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFrom Top: A Tegu lizard; a pair of parrots; a family of crab-eating foxes recovering at the Vida Livre Institute.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianSeba’s vets have also treated numerous creatures not included in Fogo Cruzado’s tally, including vultures and owls. “People shoot them because they believe they are animals that bring bad luck,” he said, recalling one vulture that had been shot seven times.Earlier this year another capuchin monkey – this time an adult male – was brought in after being hit by a projectile. “He died soon after we started treatment,” Seba said, lamenting how the “banalisation” of gun ownership – whichboomed under Brazil’s pro-gun former presidentJair Bolsonaro – had put animals in the line of fire.“It’s not the animals who are in our city. We’re the ones who built a city in their forest. We’re just trying to repair a bit of the damage,” said Seba.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenRoched Seba, founder of the Vida Livre Institute, shows tortoises seized by police from animal traffickers.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianThe institute has helped more than 15,000 animals since its creation a decade ago, some the victims of appalling cruelty. “I’ve seen so many awful cases. A boa constrictor that was beaten up … and had its head completely smashed to pieces … A sloth that was drugged and put in a backpack to be sold,” Seba said. One of the hospital’s rooms was filled with more than 600 yellow and brown shelled tortoises that environmental inspectors found stashed in the boot of a wildlife trafficker’s car.A week after becoming Rio’s latest bullet-pierced primate, the outlook for Maria was grim.“She’s stable. She’s medicated. She’s not in pain,” Rebelo explained as his team helped the monkey eat handfuls of mango and banana that she struggled to digest. “[But] there’s no chance of her being released [back into nature] – none at all,” the vet added of the convalescing capuchin.View image in fullscreenMaria, the capuchin monkey.Photograph: João Laet/The GuardianRebelo spoke softly to avoid further upsetting his visibly distressed patient, whose tiny hands trembled as a result of neurological damage caused by the slug in her spine. But there was palpable anger in the vet’s voice as he described Maria’s condition.“Unfortunately, they’ve destroyed the life of a young animal who had her whole life ahead of her,” said Rebelo, who believed Maria was less than a year old and could have lived another 15. “She’s a female who would have been the mother of many other monkeys – and they put an end to her life for no reason at all.”A few hours later, Maria was dead, passing away after being anaesthetized when vets tried to remove the projectile. “Our wild animals are exposed to the same violence and negligence as we are,” Seba wrote on Instagram beneath photographs of the monkey and the bullet that took her life.Explore more on these topicsBrazilGun crimeAnimalsWildlifeAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The same procedure could be used to make eggs for same-sex male couples.“The largest group of patients who might benefit would be women of advanced maternal age,” said Prof Shoukhrat Mitalipov, who led the research at OregonHealthand Science University in Portland. “Another group are those who have been through chemotherapy because that can affect their ability to have viable eggs.”While women are expected to be the primary beneficiaries, skin cells used to make the eggs need not come from potential mothers. “We used female skin cells in this study, but you could use skin cells from males as well,” Mitalipov told the Guardian. “You could make eggs for men, and that way, of course, this would be applicable to same-sex couples.”The work draws on cloning pioneered in the 1990s at the Roslin Institute in Scotland. A team led by thelate Ian Wilmutused somatic cell nuclear transfer to createDolly the sheep. The process involved plucking the nucleus from an adult sheep cell and placing it into a sheep egg that had its own nucleus removed. The resulting egg was carried to term in Dolly’s surrogate mother.The Oregon team took a similar approach by collecting skin cells from women and removing the nucleus from each. The nucleus contains the 46 chromosomes that carry the 20,000 or so genes that comprise the human genetic code. Each skin cell nucleus was placed in a healthy donor egg that had its own nucleus removed.The major challenge the scientists faced was that healthy human eggs contain only 23 chromosomes. A further 23 arrive in the sperm on fertilisation and are needed for the fertilised egg to develop into an embryo and ultimately a baby.Writing inNature Communications, the Oregon team described how they overcame the problem of excess chromosomes. After fertilising the eggs with sperm, they activated them using a compound called roscovitine. This caused the eggs to move roughly half of their chromosomes into a structure called a polar body, leaving the remaining chromosomes to pair up with those from the sperm.In a healthy, fertilised human egg the 23 chromosomes from the mother pair up with the 23 from the father. But the Oregon team found that the chromosomes in their eggs segregated and paired up randomly. This led to early-stage embryos with the wrong number of chromosomes and the wrong chromosome pairings.“These abnormal chromosome complements would not be expected to result in a healthy baby,” said Prof Paula Amato, a co-author of the study at Oregon. The team is working on ways to improve the process.Out of 82 eggs created at the Oregon lab, fewer than 10% developed to the stage when IVF embryos are typically transferred to the mother’s womb, suggesting that the process is not particularly efficient. None were cultured beyond six days.Mitalipov called the work a “proof of concept” with more challenges ahead. Perfecting the technique and demonstrating its safety in patients could take another decade. “I think it’s going to be harder than what we’ve done over the years thus far, but it’s not impossible,” he said.Other scientists praised the breakthrough. Prof Richard Anderson of the University of Edinburgh said: “Many women are unable to have a family because they have lost their eggs, which can occur for a range of reasons including after cancer treatment. The ability to generate new eggs would be a major advance. There will be very important safety concerns, but this study is a step toward helping many women have their own genetic children.”Prof Ying Cheong of the University of Southampton said: “In practice, clinicians are seeing more and more people who cannot use their own eggs, often because of age or medical conditions. While this is still very early laboratory work, in the future it could transform how we understand infertility and miscarriage and perhaps one day open the door to creating egg- or sperm-like cells for those who have no other options.”Prof Roger Sturmey of the University of Hull said the science was “impressive” but highlighted the need for “open dialogue” with the public about advances in reproductive research, adding: “Breakthroughs such as this impress upon us the need for robust governance, to ensure accountability and build public trust.”Explore more on these topicsScienceHealthFertility problemsIVFCloningnewsShareReuse this content"

Some parents were even fined for letting their children play outside.In one example, two brothers who lived in a high-rise flat in central London came out to build a snowman in January 2021, but were ordered to go back inside by police. Ferguson said the incident had a lasting impact on one of the boys, who remains socially anxious.The inquiry heard that the treatment of children playing outside may have been linked to messaging by the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, at the very start of restrictions.On 23 March 2020, when Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home to try to stop the spread of the virus, he granted permission for people to go outside for one form of exercise a day, whether a run, a walk or a cycle.But children’s exercise “looks different” to adult exercise, the hearing was told. “Play is the main way that children are physically active,” said Ferguson. “They play because they enjoy playing. They don’t need to be told how to do it.“By not explicitly mentioning children and play in those guidelines and in those rules, the prime minister gave the impression that only really adult forms of exercise were permitted, things like walking, cycling or running.“So it did create this wider understanding including amongst police, councils, parents and the wider public that children playing out was not a permitted activity. It was something we raised right at the beginning with the government. It did not change throughout the pandemic.”The inquiry was told that Ferguson had written an article at the time in which she said that “part of the problem was that play does look like fun and that does not fit with the seriousness of the guidelines. But for children play is serious.”Ferguson was giving evidence on the second day of module 8 of theCovid inquiry, which is looking at the experience and impact of the pandemic on children. The hearing has heard that children’s rights and needs were frequently overlooked in the government’s response to the pandemic.Ferguson and others giving evidence have called for a dedicated cabinet minister for children to ensure that children’s interests are represented at the highest level of government and the mistakes made during the pandemic are never repeated.Dr Carol Homden, the chief executive of Coram children’s charity, highlighted the way the restrictions introduced during the pandemic affected some of the most vulnerable children in society, despite best intentions.Children awaiting adoption lost their opportunity to find a permanent home as matching services were interrupted. Homden said the vast majority of children being adopted were under five, but some had “aged out” during the pandemic, while those in foster care suffered delays in seeing a social worker.Homden also raised concerns about the experience of unaccompanied asylum seeking children arriving in the UK during the pandemic and having to go into isolation. “Just imagine being one of those young people, not speaking the language, arriving in such circumstances and then having to be alone in a room with no one to support you for 14 days.”The inquiry was told that large numbers of unaccompanied children accommodated in hotels went missing. “I don’t think we’ve even begun to understand what’s happened to those children. This is not one or two children. This is hundreds who went missing. How could that have occurred and what are we doing to prevent that happening again?”The inquiry continues on Wednesday and is scheduled to last four weeks.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryChildrenChildren's healthCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

He was found dead in his bedroom by his mother, Tracy Scott.View image in fullscreenTracy Scott (left) and Colin Scott (right) with their solicitor, Aamer Anwar, at a press conference in Glasgow on Tuesday.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAAn internal inquiry by the university set up after pressure from Brown’s family found “systemic” errors in the way his degree had been graded, due largely to confusion about its assessment rules.A recently retired senior professor who carried out the investigation found he had enough marks for a 2:1 honours degree; the errors had not been spotted by either of its internal review boards or an external review panel.The investigation also found Brown had alerted staff that he was suffering from poor mental health, and they had failed to offer him counselling and support – omissions Glasgow University acknowledged on Tuesday.“Ethan left this world believing he had failed, and [that] theUniversity of Glasgowwere correct,” Tracy Scott said, as the family and their lawyer, Aamer Anwar, released the university’s inquiry findings.“The truth is, Ethan had successfully attained a 2:1 honours degree, despite the university repeatedly informing him he had been unsuccessful.“They failed him, not only academically, but also to support him. My son was failed from having a duty of care from the educational system, resulting in my family having been robbed from having Ethan in our lives.”Sitting with Ethan’s stepfather, Colin Scott, and his uncle Alan Neil by her side, she added: “Ethan was a kind, caring young man who was very much loved. So it breaks my heart to now be aware of the mental anguish this university must have caused my son.”The university admitted the failings. “We are profoundly sorry that this terrible event occurred and understand the deep distress it has caused Ethan’s family,” it said in a statement.“The report found that a tragic error had been made in calculating Ethan’s degree outcome. It indicated that this error should have been picked up during the exam board process. A further shortcoming involved communications with Ethan, including the fact that he was not referred to student support services when he disclosed wellbeing concerns.”It rejected suggestions those problems had affected other students, saying it was “confident that the error in relation to Ethan’s marks was an isolated one and that no other students have been affected”.“Even so, we have undertaken a thorough review of our academic and wellbeing policies and practices. We have also revised our training programmes for members of staff involved in exam boards.”Anwar, the family’s solicitor and a former Glasgow University rector elected by its students, said the internal review had also revealed failures by staff in its geographical and earth sciences department to respond to Brown’s requests for an update over the summer.It found staff had also failed to follow up his warnings of “deteriorating health and distress” when he sought two coursework deadline extensions in his final year.“They ask whether this systemic failure would ever have been identified had Ethan not died and his family had not fought for answers,” Anwar said. “To be clear, had the family not contacted the university on 13 January and demanding answers, they would have been none the wiser.”Anwar released a letter from the university offering the family a further meeting with its new principal, Prof Andy Schofield, on Tuesday but only if Anwar was not involved. The university would not comment on why it had sought to block him, but said Schofield was willing to meet the family again “to express his sympathies and discuss the actions taken by the university”.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The NBPA said that could include statements on stop and search policy, rules on police use of force and even the effects of a future Reform government on policing and race.The proposed changes come after police chiefs’ efforts to lessen discrimination have been criticised for achieving little or nothing despite years of promises.The NBPA says it represents 6,000 black and Asian officers and staff across all forces in the UK.Police chiefs want the new rules to govern staff associations, which includes the NBPA, and those covering religious groupings as well as sexual orientation and women in policing.The draft guidance says: “All members of the network must … remain impartial, which includes: not making public their views on government policy; not engaging in formal political debate in their network role and not engaging in activities that could be construed to be political.”Later it says: “Consideration must be made for any written or oral communication made as a representative of the network and how it could impact on the perception of policing by the public.”Another issue is police chiefs wanting greater protections for officers who use force, which the NBPA fears goes too far.The draft documents says public statements by groups such as the NBPA “should not bring policing into disrepute and all communications and social media engagement conducted by the network must be consistent with the expected conduct set out for network members and within local force policy”.Insp Andy George, the president of the NBPA, said his group, which tends to challenge chiefs on key issues, would be silenced while others would not be: “This risks creating a damaging double standard. Police chiefs and the Police Federation are free to speak out against allegations of racism from the community and to praise or criticise the government on policy, yet the NBPA and other minority staff associations would be silenced.“That runs directly against the very ethos of impartiality and freedom of expression.”Police chiefs say parts of areportby the policing inspectorate on politics in policing necessitate the changes. Assistant chief constable Jon McAdam, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) lead for staff support networks, said: “These draft operating principles are not targeted at any organisation, or motivated by a desire to stop any group doing anything.“Staff support networks do an amazing job supporting people across the police workforce. But there is no consistency of governance, scope, and structure across these networks. This has been identified as an issue for several years, including by [His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary] as well as staff networks themselves.“Earlier this month all national staff support networks were invited to a discussion on these proposals and feedback at the meeting was positive, with a clear sense of direction as we work through the detail. The NPCC portfolio is here to support our networks and engage with them to help them continue their important work.”The NBPA is also in talks with the Home Office about gaining formal or statutory status. The group says too often the body representing rank-and-file officers, the Police Federation, does a poor job defending black and Asian officers.Police chiefs in 2020 announced a race action plan that was supposed to address the racial bias that plagues policing. In 2024 the NBPA boycotted the scheme, citing an alleged lack of progress, but it has now re-engaged with it.Explore more on these topicsPoliceRacenewsShareReuse this content"

The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, said the vote by 12 security council members to “transform the multinational security support (MSS) mission to the new gang suppression force, a mission five times the size of its predecessor” showed the “international community was sharing the burden”.Washington co-sponsored the enlargement push with Panama.Currently 1,000 officers, mostly from Kenya, are deployed in Haiti under the security mission aimed at supporting the Haitian police in their fight againstrampant gang violence, but it has had mixed results.“Every day, innocent lives are snuffed out by bullets, fire and fear,” Laurent Saint-Cyr, who heads the Haitian Transitional Presidential Council, told the UN’s signature diplomatic gathering last week. “Entire neighbourhoods are disappearing, forcing more than a million people into internal exile and reducing to nothing memories, investments and infrastructure.“This is the face of Haiti today, a country at war, a contemporary Guernica, a human tragedy on America’s doorstep,” he added.View image in fullscreenDebris in a street in Port-au-Prince.Photograph: Clarens Siffroy/AFP/Getty ImagesSaint-Cyr had thrown his support behind the US and Panamanian proposal to evolve the mission into a more resilient force for an initial period of one year. “The council can help restore peace in a nation currently suffocated by merciless gangs,” Panama’s ambassador to the UN, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, said ahead of the vote.Kenya’s president, William Ruto, said last week that “with the right personnel, adequate resources, appropriate equipment and necessary logistics, Haiti’s security can be restored”.UN condemns reported Haitian village massacre by armed gangsRead moreThe boost in force will be accompanied by the creation of a support office within the UN, suggested several months ago by the secretary general, António Guterres, to provide the required logistical and financial support.The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, said last week: “This mandate would empower the force to proactively target gangs and restore security to Haiti while ensuring it has the appropriate tools to succeed the mission’s anticipated objectives.”China had expressed scepticism about the role of the mission without political transition in Haiti and abstained during the vote to create it in 2023, as did Russia. Beijing and Moscow abstained again on Tuesday’s vote.Russia and China were both critical of Washington, accusing it of failing to stop an illicit flow of weapons to Haiti from the US and not providing enough funding for the initial mission. They also said the US had rushed through a resolution that was ambiguous on several critical issues, including rules of engagement.“Let us be frank, if that contributor failed to provide the promised funds for the MSS, what guarantees are there that things will be different with this new mission?” said Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, describing the money needed for Haiti as very modest compared to the billions of dollars spent by countries to send weapons to Ukraine.He also echoed concern raised by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Saturday about how the US could interpret the gang suppression force mandate. The resolution adopted on Tuesday authorises countries taking part to take all necessary measures to carry out its mandate, meaning the use of force.“We have no certainty that the authors of today’s text will not come up with some kind of – quote, unquote – creative way to link their military activity to allegedly combating drug cartels,” Nebenzia said.The poorest country in theAmericas, Haiti has long suffered at the hands of violent criminal gangs that commit murders, rapes, looting and kidnappings against a backdrop of chronic political instability.The situation has worsened significantly since early 2024, when gangs drove then-prime minister, Ariel Henry, to resign. The country, which has not held elections since 2016, has since been led by a transitional presidential council.Explore more on these topicsHaitiUnited NationsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Sag-Aftra said it believed creativity was, “and should remain, human-centred. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.”The union added: “To be clear, ‘Tilly Norwood’ is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers – without permission or compensation … It doesn’t solve any ‘problem’ – it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardising performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”Tilly Norwood: how scared should we be of the viral AI ‘actor’?Read moreNorwood appears in a short film called AI Commissioner, produced by Particle6, whose CEO, Eline Van Der Velden, said was“100% AI generated”. Van Der Velden, wholaunched Xicoiaat Zurich,issued a statement on Sundaydefending the film, saying: “I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a new tool – a new paintbrush. Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories.”Van Der Velden added: “Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance. It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.”The Smashing Machine star Emily Blunt also added her voice to film industry members aghast at Norwood’s creation,telling a Variety podcast: “Good Lord, we’re screwed. That is really, really scary, Come on, agencies, don’t do that. Please stop. Please stop taking away our human connection.”Natasha Lyonne, the Russian Doll star who is working ona feature film using “ethical” AI, was also vocal in her disapproval,saying on social media: “Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds.

Kabila, who led the country from 2001 to 2019, has denied wrongdoing and said the judiciary had been politicised.Lt Gen Joseph Mutombo Katalayi, presiding over the tribunal in Kinshasa, said Kabila had been found guilty of charges that included murder, sexual assault, torture and insurrection.Kabila did not attend the trial and was not represented by legal counsel. Neither he nor his representatives were immediately available for comment. His whereabouts were not immediately known.“In applying article 7 of the military penal code,[the court] imposes a single sentence, namely the most severe one, which is the death penalty,” Katalayi said while delivering the verdict.Kabila was also ordered to pay about $50bn (£36bn) in damages to the state and victims.The verdict could fuel further divisions in the vast mineral-rich central African country, which has endured decades of conflict.Who are the M23 rebels and why is there fighting in eastern DRC?Read moreKabila spent almost 20 years in power andstepped down only after deadly protests against him. He has been living mostly in South Africa since 2023, but appeared in the rebel-held city of Goma in eastern DRC in May.He entered in to an awkward power-sharing deal with his successor, Felix Tshisekedi, but their relationship soon soured.As M23 rebels marched on eastern DRC’s second-largest city of Bukavu in February, Tshisekedi told the Munich security conference that Kabila had sponsored the insurgency.M23 now controls much of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. The fighting has killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more this year. The two sides signed a US-brokered peace agreement in June, but they are both reinforcing their positions and blaming one another for flouting the accord, sources have said.Rwanda, which has long denied helping M23, says its forces act in self-defence against DRC’s army and ethnic Hutu militia members linked to the 1994 genocide.Tshisekedi’s government has moved to suspend Kabila’s political party and seize its leaders’ assets.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

And David seemed to welcome this, shying from most opportunities to reveal himself. On talkshows, he likes to retreat behind the same clutch of anecdotes. When former Seinfeld writer Larry Charles made a two-part documentary about David for HBO in 2022, David had it pulled from schedules the day before broadcast. When I interviewed him for a book I wrote about baldness last year, he only agreed on the proviso that the line of questioning never strayed from hair loss.‘Larry’s secretly a lovely man’: Curb Your Enthusiasm stars spill the beans – for their final ever episodeRead moreSo the publication of No Lessons Learned, a new book about the life of Curb Your Enthusiasm (“as told by Larry David and the cast and crew” but written by Lorraine Ali) offered a shot at showing us the machinations of the real David. So, what does it teach us about Larry David the man?He really was that miserable onceThe oft-repeated talkshow anecdote about his pre-fame stint as a blind woman’s chauffeur gets fleshed out in the book. “It was a very, very sad time in my life,” he states. “Bad jobs, no money, living in a dump. By all accounts, I was a failure and the future was bleak.”His first script was also bleakAs Robert Weide, who would later go on to direct Curb episodes, describes, it was a film called Prognosis Negative, about a sour man who begins to date a terminally ill woman, because it meant he could enjoy the possibility of being in a relationship without the pressure of any long-term commitment. “It was very, very dark,” Weide says now.He often gets his wayView image in fullscreenLarry David as Larry, wearing hat and glasses, standing in downpour on a golf course.Photograph: Contract Number (Programme)/CHANNEL 4 PICTURE PUBLICITYAt an early screening of the Curb Your Enthusiasm pilot – then only known as the Larry David Vanity Project – the audience was handed a sheet of paper with potential titles, including The Shame Must Go On, Dead Inside, and Regrets Only. The title Curb Your Enthusiasm received no votes. “Too bad, I like that one,” David said at the time. “That’s what we’re calling it.”Larry andRichard Lewiswere like that all the timeTracey Ullman describes a moment, towards the end of Lewis’s life, when she overheard the pair of them quietly talking while a scene was being shot. Lewis was performing shows in New York, and was angry that David hadn’t been to any. David’s response? “When are you gonna die?” “I turned around, and Richard’s face, he was trying so hard not to laugh,” Ullman says.The glasses were a major source of stressWhen Curb began, David had two pairs of his now-iconic glasses, which were made by Oliver Peoples in the 1990s. Production required more than that, so someone had to literally scour the globe looking for more. Eventually they were able to find someone “in a small cabin in Switzerland” who could make four extra pairs. Props master Rose Leiker describes the glasses as “the property department’s daily heart attack”.Larry David wasn’t above using the show as revengeIn 1998, Roger Ebert gave David’s movie Sour Grapes a thumbs down. And so, in season three, David wrote an episode about a restaurant critic with a passing resemblance to Ebert. David ended up breaking his thumbs.The real Larry is softer than his screen counterpartProducer Erin O’Malley recounts an episode where Larry takes two lesbians to task for adopting an African baby. “‘I’m gay,” O’Malley says. “Between takes, he came up to me behind the monitors and said ‘Hey, is this too offensive?’ He was asking me earnestly. He would be mortified that I’m telling you this right now.”Bryan Cranstonthinks Larry David hates himDuring an appearance in season nine, David asked Cranston if he’d ever appeared on Broadway. Cranston replied positively, and soon David was starring in his own self-written Broadway show, A Fish in the Dark. “I went backstage after the play one night and I said ‘Larry, that was fantastic!’ Cranston recalls. “And he said ‘Oh my god, I’ll never listen to you again. I hate doing this!’”No Lessons Learned is out nowExplore more on these topicsCurb Your EnthusiasmUS televisionTelevisionTV comedyComedyLarry DavidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What a feat!Stuart HeritageTue 30 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 00.01 EDTShareYou don’t have to look too hard at Disney+’s new sitcom to see the stitches. This is a flagrant Frankenstein of a show; a grab bag of elements from things that are already incredibly popular. It’s a good-natured sports comedy in the mould of Ted Lasso. Its star is Glen Powell, a man with the fairly miraculous ability to unite both warring sides of 2025 America. It shamelessly lifts the plot of Mrs Doubtfire (the second highest grossing film worldwide in 1993, fact fans) and, according to the credits, it is based on a funny video of an American football player that went viral in 2022.It is thin gruel indeed, the sort of programme you imagine gets created after a particularly desperate ChatGPT session. And yet, despite this, Chad Powers is actually good. Better than good, in fact. It’s a funny, touching, deliberately uncomfortable character piece with one of the most magnetic central performances in recent memory. How annoying.Obviously, it helps that it was created by Powell (along with writer Michael Waldron, whose current gig is writing the Avengers franchise) because, viewed from afar, it looks like an attempt to marry the two sides of his public persona. Chad Powers follows the explosive bottoming out of a cocky young football player named Russ Holliday. One minute, Holliday has the world at his feet. The next he has lost a championship, punched a fan and injured a young wheelchair-bound cancer patient, all in full view of the wider world.In other words, the show really wants you to hate him. He’s the walking definition of obnoxiousness, all Cybertrucks, crypto talk and chest tattoos. It’s a role Powell knows well, an extension of his swaggeringly unbearable Top Gun character.However, salvation comes when Holliday decides to start afresh, by stealing his dad’s prosthetics, moving to Georgia and passing himself off as a sweetly naive, aw-shucks college player called Chad Powers. Again, given Powell’s uncanny ability to hit Middle America right in its plaid-wearing heart, this also seems deliberate.A premise like this has a lot of heavy lifting to do, so it’s smart that Powell and Waldron have chosen to cut almost every corner imaginable to get to the action faster. The nod to Mrs Doubtfire is as transparent as possible, coming after Russ Holliday (and I promise this is true) looks directly at a poster for Mrs Doubtfire. Similarly, the college team he signs up for under a fake identity is called the Catfish. If there’s one thing the show wants you to hate more than Russ Holliday, it is the concept of subtext.And yet the final result is improbably irresistible. While the early episodes are charmingly goofy – a vast amount of time is given to the problem of how to shower with your teammates when your face is covered in prosthetics – things quickly get deeper as the line between Holliday and Powers starts to blur. Was the Chad Powers persona created to get Holliday back into the spotlight, or because Holliday was sick of himself?View image in fullscreenCharmingly goofy … Powell as Chad Powers.Photograph: Daniel Delgado/DisneyThroughout the season, Holliday blames his demise on circumstance; if he hadn’t messed up in that one game, he’d be king of the world. But there’s a sense that, like Walter White before him, his downfall was entirely caused by a personality flaw. If he didn’t knock the cancer victim out of his wheelchair during that match, his arrogance and egotism would have undone him elsewhere.By the end of the season, we’re left with some unexpectedly complex character work, as nobody involved, himself included, seems to know where Holliday ends and Powers begins. The technical work this must have involved on the part of Powell, whose various accents keep fading and blurring into each other as his identity unravels, is staggering.What we’re left with is about as far from Ted Lasso as you can get. It’s a mutant redemption story with a satisfyingly chewy moral core: can you truly be redeemed if it involves lying to every single person on the planet? All this, plus it manages to be funny and charming. Chad Powers is a rare feat. And remember, they managed to get all this from a viral video. What a magic trick.Chad Powers is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sacré bleu!Peter BradshawTue 30 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 08.02 EDTShareThis truly bizarre film has a substantial reserve of goodwill to draw on: among its blue-chip cast are John Malkovich and Fanny Ardant, and it’s also the final film of the Belgian star Émilie Dequenne, famous for winning the best actress award at Cannes for her nonprofessional debut in Rosetta in 1999,who sadly died of cancer in March at the age of 43. It is a broad and baffling dramedy, directed by the bestselling French author Gilles Legardinier, and adapted from his 2012 novel Complètement Cramé! (Completely Burnt Out!).Malkovich plays a wealthy grieving widower called Andrew Blake, supposedly from England, who, to ease his broken heart, takes a job as a butler in a French chateau whose owner (Ardant) has fallen on hard times. It is a sentimental journey for him, as many years ago he first met his French wife, Diane, in the chateau’s sumptuous grounds. Among the below-stairs gallery of wacky characters is grumpy but golden-hearted housekeeper Odile (played by Dequenne).What makes this film such an ordeal to watch is Malkovich’s amazing line-readings in French, in his laboriously slow and unmistakably American accent. He very rarely snaps out of the language, and it would have been fascinating and horrifying to hear him do an English accent. Be that as it may, audiences will learn to tense and flinch in advance as Malkovich opens his distinctively pursed lips and strangles French word after French word after French word: “Je ne perrrrrrr ploooo res-tayyyyyyy – Dee-ane nay ploooo lahhhh …” He sounds like Dr Hannibal Lecter having smoked a hundredweight of weed, doing a derisive impression of an unctuous French headwaiter he intends to eat.There is one truly terrifying moment.

What has happened to the female one of their number? It’s the first in a series of questions the three men will face over the course of the tense aftermath of their crime. But the action really gets going at around the midpoint of the film, when three mysterious and beautiful women who claim to have been shipwrecked show up. Being gentlemen, the lads decide to offer them a roof over their comely heads for the night.For all this, the film’s ace card is its location. The pale, low-lying, single-storey house on a shingle beach isn’t your conventional cobwebbed and turreted spooky house – more like quite a nice holiday home – but its isolation and flatness gives a unique sort of strangeness to proceedings. The film is also almost entirely shot during either the first light of the day, the last light of the day, or night-time, which is an effective strategy: the characters feel quite literally shadier and the action unfolds with the off-kilter strangeness of a bad dream.It’s a shame then that for the most part the acting and writing don’t quite come up to the same standard as the technical craft. Other than Michelangelo Fortuzzi, whose turn as Prussian thief Paul is the kind of thing that Peter Lorre might have done back in the day, the characters are evidently a touch underpowered on the page, with the actors resorting to lots of intense glaring and meaningful looks to try to bring a bit of zest to their roles. The juicy hints that an ancient power of some sort has been unleashed are a lot of fun, but don’t expect a massively shocking resolution, it’s absolutely the kind of thing that was set up from the get-go.Still, it’s an impressive production given what was clearly a limited budget (when the credits roll around it is unsurprising to see the names of various crew members doubling up in different roles). Strong on hints and portents, The Drowned prioritises vibes over substance, but at 84 minutes, doesn’t hang about long enough to wear out its welcome.The Drowned is on digital platforms in the UK from 6 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

But even those few years on the shelf have left it feeling uncomfortably out of touch with the urgency of the times when it comes to the way it handles the plight of young immigrants who facing increasing levels of hostility both in France itself and across the world with the rise of far-right activists.In Kitchen Brigade’s universe, almost all a bunch of undocumented teenagers need to help them get leave to remain is a white-saviour lady; in this case it is chef Cathy (Audrey Lamy), who comes to work at a refugee centre after she abruptly quits her job at a prominent high-end restaurant. In care herself as a child, Cathy doesn’t like authority much it seems (unless she’s the one in charge), but she needs the work. The centre’s other two saintly white people, director Lorenzo (François Cluzet) and teacher Sabine (Chantal Neuwirth), guide Cathy to be more understanding of the hardship the (mostly) black kids have been through to make it to France. Soon, she’s teaching them how to chop shallots and man their stations in the Frenchbrigade system, which it’s worth pointing out is derived from military management systems and contains a kind of systematised structure of abuse.The young actors who play Cathy’s charges (who are mostly from Africa) are charismatic performers, especially Yannick Kalombo as GusGus and Mamadou Koita as aspiring footballer Djibril, but they barely get more than a few lines and quick scenes to fill out their personalities, compared with the French characters. Then suddenly the film transitions into a meta commentary on TV reality shows as Cathy enters a competition, involving the boss she insulted when she quit her job at the start, to win a prize and get help setting up a certificate for teaching the kids. The whole thing is just a bit off, even though it’s hard to quarrel too much with the pro-immigrant message.The Kitchen Brigade is in UK and Irish cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRestaurantsFranceRefugeesEuropeFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

Billed as “Sitar for Mental Health”, Sharma’s live project features group breathing exercises, meditation and intermission talking prompts, while his repertoire includes everything from traditional ragas to Bollywood songs and versions of the Game of Thrones and Harry Potter themes. It’s a distinctive blend that has gained him more than four million Instagram followers and 60m streams.“The mission is to introduce every soul on the planet to the sound of the sitar,” Sharma says. “We touredIndiafor three months and often had four generations of family members coming along. Now I want to spread it to western audiences and share this instrument that has helped me heal.”View image in fullscreen‘Like plucking notes from the air’ … Rishab Sharma performing live in Dublin earlier this month.Photograph: Katy Gorniak/Oscar J RyanSitting in the plush lobby of a London hotel while on a European tour – he’s playing three big UK venues in October – Sharma doesn’t look like your typical Indian classical musician. Dressed down in a cap and denim shirt and sporting intricate henna designs on the backs of his hands, he explains how his grandfather’s death in 2020 led him to view his instrument differently.“My grandfather was like a third parent to me and when he died I was completely broken,” Sharma says. “I stopped playing sitar, I wasn’t eating properly and I often didn’t get out of bed. My friends suggested I go to therapy but since it was the pandemic, I couldn’t get any appointments.”Sharma languished for months before remembering his grandfather’s enthusiasm for the sitar. “He would clap along while I played and loved it when I performed bhajans [devotional songs],” Sharma says. “I decided to pick it up again, and this time, as I played through the ragas I knew, I felt myself calm down. It was like I was plucking notes from the air to play for him. And when I finished, I was more like myself again.”Taking to the audio social media platform Clubhouse, Sharma began streaming his sitar sessions alongside free-flowing conversation about his grief. “I watched it grow as I logged on every day for a year, playing and talking to strangers, which felt easier than sharing how I felt with friends,” he says. “By the end of the year we had 4,000 people tuning in and I had so many DMs from people telling me not to stop since it was helping with their grief, too. Something about the music just resonated.”My grandfather sold the Beatles their sitars when they visited India in the 60sTowards the end of 2021, Sharma held his first Sitar for Mental Health concert for 30 people at a yoga studio in New York, where he had been living as a student. In the four years since, he has played to more than 75,000 people across India as well as to Joe Biden at the White House, and has released genre-crossing singles such as the trap bass-referencing 2021 trackChankaya, 2023’s electronic percussion-ladenKautilya (The Echo Project)and the lo-fi hip-hop influenced 2024 track Text Me When You Reach.Growing up in Delhi in a family of sitar makers stretching back three generations, Sharma became the final student, aged 12, of the then 89-year-old sitar pioneer Ravi Shankar. “My father made guruji Ravi Shankar’s sitars and my grandfather even sold sitars to the Beatles when they came to visit India in the 60s,” he says. “I learned guitar as a child, and at 11 my father let me try one of his sitars. It felt so instinctual – I could immediately feel my way around the sargam scale. A few months later, someone recorded a video of me playing at a small show and guruji saw it.”Shankar invited Sharma to play for him and spotted his potential, immediately offering to be his guru. “It was like God offering to teach you,” Sharma says. “From then on, I spent six hours a day after school practising with him. He could be very stern and strict when we were playing, but as soon as he put the sitar down he was so friendly and always told so many dirty jokes! He was like India’s only rock star.”After two years of tutelage – Shankar died in 2012 – Sharma continued his training with elder disciples. Today, he finds himself motivated by Shankar’s genre-bending legacy. “I always think, ‘What would guruji say if he heard what I’m playing?’ and ‘What would the 13-year-old me like to hear?’” he says. “As long as those responses are positive, then I don’t have to worry about what the traditionalists might say about me mixing styles or using sitar for mental health.”In fact, Sharma has been researching the ancient Ayurvedic idea of Raga Chikitsa, which posits that musical vibrations can facilitate different moods. It forms the basis of the debut album he is currently writing, while he is also working on making a line of affordable sitars. “I want to create sitars at the same price as guitars, so lots more kids can have access to them,” he says. “It’s an instrument of great power that needs to be shared from India to the world.”Rishab Sharma’s Sitar for Mental Health tour continues atRoyal Festival Hall, London, on 1 October;Symphony Hall, Birmingham, on 9 October; andthe Lowry, Salford, on 13 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicClassical musicPop and rockIndiaRavi ShankarMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brown says the story was inspired by her upbringing in Doncaster in the late 90s and early 00s. An extract of the story can be read below.“From first reading, Colwill Brown’s story leapt from the page, alive and immediately compelling, deeply disturbing, a story we couldn’t forget,” said Di Speirs, chair of this year’s judging panel. “The brio of the dialect, the brilliance of both the second person narration and the handling of the passage of time, and above all the exploration of a life critically damaged in a moment, all made this our unanimous winner.”Brown’s debut novel, We Pretty Pieces of Flesh, was published earlier this year.Reviewing itin the Guardian, Catherine Taylor wrote that the novel “manages to be both boisterous and bleak, life-enhancing and life-denying, familiar and yet wholly original”, adding that “you will probably read nothing else like it this year”.Also shortlisted for this year’s award were Caoilinn Hughes, Edward Hogan, Emily Abdeni-Holman and Andrew Miller, whose novelThe Land in Winteris on the shortlist for this year’s Booker prize. Each of the authors shortlisted for the short story award receives £600. Their stories are published in an anthology, and are available to listen to on BBC Sounds.We Pretty Pieces of Flesh by Colwill Brown review – you’ll read nothing else like it this yearRead more“Brown’s Yorkshire-dialect story is a fast, taut examination of repercussions,” said Bonnie Lander Johnson, fellow in English at Cambridge University. “One messy, half-remembered night in a young woman’s life echoes down the years in bouts of rage and shame, in the need for silence to protect friends and the struggle to find a way to live among dwindling opportunities when the same people still wander the same streets each day.”Alongside Speirs on this year’s judging panel was the novelist William Boyd, previously shortlisted writer Kamila Shamsie, and previous winners Lucy Caldwell and Ross Raisin. Raisin won last year’s prizewith his story Ghost Kitchen.“This year’s winning story demonstrates how seemingly small events can shape our futures, how the thoughtlessness of youth can shadow our adult choices,” said Johnson. “All of this is done in deft, startling prose that opens new possibilities in contemporary literary voice.”The winner of the young writer’s award, open to 14- to 18-year-olds, was also announced at the ceremony. Rebecca Smith, a 17-year-old sixth former from Sheffield, won the prize for Scouse’s Run, a story set in Yorkshire and written in dialect.You Cannot Thread a Moving NeedleNext day, they come round your house to mek sure you’ll never tell.But that’s not what they say when you open door, find them ont step, two dense bodies int daylight. They say, Ey up, and you greet them back, Alreyt. They’re int year above, little un wi dyed black hair all t’goth lasses fancy, and lanky lad, who you’re not sure, but you think might be seeing Rach. Lanky Lad’s alreyt like, but you reckon Rach only fancies him cuz he plays bass in Little Un’s band. You can’t get past his mouth, two fat pink slugs sleeping one below other. His lips, always wet, saliva slick. You don’t know how Rach can snog that mouth, if she is. Little Un, though, proper beaut, barely ever spoke to you till yesterday: mid-afternoon int backyard while your mam wa asleep, you and Kel and Rach, splayed ovver too-long thirsty grass in nowt but string bikinis you all went Primark together to get. Bacardi Breezer Watermelons from offy round corner that’ll serve anyone, long as you’ve gorra backpack to hide it in. Giggle, bottle, clink. Pink liquid tang, swill down quick. Then Lanky Lad and Little Un appeared ovvert fence, surprised your boozy tanning sesh.Now, Little Un grins. You go warm, arse to tit.Little Un sez, “Fancy a walk?”It’s summer so days are borderless, their edges shimmering int heat. Today feels like it’s still part of yesterday, especially since you can’t remember going to bed last neet. You leave your house and stroll between t’lads for ever, or half hour, or five minutes, chatting shit, bouncing on toes while plastic flip-flops go flap flap, thinking,lucky cow, and legs shaky, and Little Un’s grinning at you again. They flank you in a winding too-wide trio dance down slender snicket behind neighbours’ sheds. Nettles and snapdragons poke between fence planks; damp and dog shite sings in your nose. They natter about Sheff Wednesday’s shocking turnout and Donny Rovers’ keggy midfielder, NOFX’s punk purity and reasons Green Day are sellouts, their lips stretched across cheeks into smiles like rubber bands across fingers.You wonder if your tits stick out far enough beyond your belly, if your nipples’ silhouettes are bleeding through your Hello Kitty tank top, if Little Un will get top’s irony, if hot sweat between your thighs is really your period starting, if it’s pooling int seat of your short-shorts, if it’s trickling down a leg. You wish there wa somewier private you could drop your kegs and check. You wonder if your short-shorts are showing too much arsecheek. If they’re not showing any arsecheek at all. You wish you’d brushed last neet’s booze off your breath, and you wish you’d put your Wonderbra on when you crawled out of bed, head banging, to answer t’door, and you can’t think about owt apart from how flat your tits must look wi’out that bra till you notice crumbling corner of a brick, loose and hanging out somecunt’s garage wall.Reminds you of younger days, of graze, of flay, of scramble ovver under through broken off battered fence gate wall. Pegging it ovver knackered train tracks, building sites, rubble piles. Lung-rasping cackle, stop dead when brick cement stone gravel bites, snatches flakes off your top layer, leaves runs in your skin down arms, legs, laddered like tights.You look down now and there’s a new rip across your wrist, dried-blood trail of torn away skin. These days, grazes come from neets ont lash, bottles of voddy downed ont haybales and bench by t’canal. Limbs fall heavy int midnight grass. These days, you wake wi’out memory of cuts and bumps left on fingers, shins. What did you do last neet to get thissun? Warrit brick, or cement, or?Glass: your trio reaches snicket’s end, emerges intut road, straightens, expands sideways intut new space, like a concertina between two palms pulling away, squeeze-box that appears in your mam’s hands when t’gin flows, plays “Gypsy Maiden” and “Stone Outside Dan Murphy’s Door”. Old red phone box stands before you, one pane shattered into craggy diamonds spat across tarmac.

The homemade bomb connects to the runaway cheese heiress, the cheese heiress to the federal agents, and the feds to the pro‑Nazi leagues at the bowling lanes outside town. Early-30s Milwaukee, in turn, is connected to powder-keg central Europe, where paramilitary groups have pitched camp on the Hungaro-Croatian border and guest speakers wax lyrical about “our immense fascist future”. Most likely it connects to the current moment as well, albeit wryly and slyly, with a nonchalant swing. That’s the implied final move of this merry dance of a book: the point where the past links its hands with the present.Shadow Ticket is a Pynchon novel – the 88-year-old’s first in 12 years; his ninth overall – and so it naturally connects to the man’s back catalogue, too, and its abiding fascination with conspiracy, chaos and the churn of American pop culture. Specifically it relates back to his two previous works –Inherent ViceandBleeding Edge– in that the story comes tailored as a dime-store whodunnit, complete with red herrings, plot twists and reams of hard-boiled dialogue. But classifications, like people, are never entirely to be trusted. Pynchon inhabits the genre like a hermit crab inside a mollusc shell, periodically peeking out from the gloom to remind us that he’s there.Our Bogart-esque hero is Hicks McTaggart, a semi-professional dancer turned strikebreaker turned dogged, compromised private dick, toiling to hold his position against a surge of rascally clowns and unreliable sources. Hicks is on the trail of Daphne Airmont, the missing heiress, but something about the woman smells iffy, and it may not be the cheese. There are Nazi sympathisers in the halls of power and an Austro-Hungarian U-boat running guns across Lake Michigan. Milwaukee contains Italians, Croatians and “more Germans than you can wave a knockwurst at”, which means that the city’s loyalties are conflicted and it could break either way. The New World, Hicks learns, remains umbilically tied to the old.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Pynchon’s livewire prose hops from subject to subject, joins the dots and makes patterns. There is a pleasing logic to patterns, but they rarely provide explanations, never mind neat solutions; every fresh leap kicks up still further questions. And so it is with the widening gyre of Hicks’s investigation, which spins out of Milwaukee to cross the Atlantic, as spies are gazumped by counterspies and the plot gains in flavour what it loses in momentum. Airmont’s millionaire father styles himself “the Al Capone of Cheese” and is wanted for his role in a counterfeit cheese operation. “Cheese Fraud being a metaphor of course, a screen, a front for something more geopolitical,” explains Egon Praediger, the elegant, coke-sniffing Viennese cop who may turn out not to be a policeman at all. Detective mysteries home in, whereas Pynchon stories unravel. The author respects the genre enough to pay lip service to its rules. But he’s geared towards irresolution and leaves his private eye hanging, blindsided and lost.Prime Pynchon – the Pynchon of Gravity’s Rainbow, let’s say, or the jubilantMason & Dixon– might have interrogated this material with more rigour; mined its component parts for more gold. Shadow Ticket, conversely, runs wide but not deep, skipping from inner-city Milwaukee to the forests of Transylvania and from one espionage plot to the next. The tone is jaunty and joking in the manner of a bustling Tintin adventure in which bombs are wrapped as Christmas gifts and the goons look so comical that one assumes they must be harmless. It’s 1932, at least on the page, and so the yarn comes salted with references to contemporary figures: Sacco and Vanzetti, Walter Winchell and the Lindbergh baby. But it also veers from the record and succumbs to sudden scenic detours. In one exuberant set piece, two characters visit the local cinema to watch an entirely fictional gastronomic comedy, Bigger Than Yer Stummick, that stars “child sensation Squeezita Thickly” as the food commissar and Wallace Beery as a chef with “a big soup-soaked moustache”. The movie, the pair agrees afterwards, is altogether too long but somehow not quite long enough.As for Shadow Ticket itself, the book is an antic mixed bag, a diverting tour of old haunts. Pynchon’s yarn sets out with a song in its heart and mischievous spring in its step, but it edges into darkness and its final forecast is bleak. The writer knows what’s to come and where this roll of foul history will eventually lead: towards a clownish world order epitomised by men such as Elon Musk, who recently boarded a Wisconsin stage with a cheesehead hat on his head and the American flag at his back. Cheese fraud is a front and period details provide cover. But the fascist past isn’t dead, it’s stinking up the joint right this minute.Shadow Ticket by Thomas Pynchon is published by Vintage (£22).

In 1975, three weeks after his arrival at the Stratford technical college where he did his A-levels, he put up a notice in the drama department looking for recruits for an acting group he was founding called The Studio Players. The notice explained how their first performance would be a three-act play, written by him, which he would also be directing. But the students didn’t take kindly to Elton’s “grandiose overreach”, refusing to join his acting group and freezing him out. “I had no idea then and still have very little idea of how to play it cool,” he notes.He’s not wrong. What Have I Done? is an exhaustive account of the 66-year-old’s career as a writer and comic, detailing every play, standup show, comedy series, movie and book he’s ever worked on, including multiple projects that never saw the light of day. A 470-page doorstopper, it takes us from his early days at Manchester University where he met Rik Mayall, with whom he would collaborate on the smash hit The Young Ones, to the writing partnership with Richard Curtis that yielded Blackadder and on to Comic Relief and Saturday Live, delivering standup that included the fevered skit“double seat”, which people still quote back at him 40 years later. After that, he digs into the novels, all 15 of them, and the jukebox musicals including the Queen-themed We Will Rock You, which got a critical drubbing but nonetheless ran in the West End for 12 years. Though the focus is mainly on his work, there are diversions into his personal life too, including his marriage to Australian musician Sophie Gare, with whom he has three children.He has no time for the older generation of comics who claim you can’t say anything any moreFrom a man who has written in every format imaginable and must know something about pacing, the writing here is remarkably baggy. Elton’s insistence on not leaving anything out means the pace is slow and the jollier showbiz anecdotes get smothered. And therearejolly anecdotes, such as his account of the Tuscan shoot for Kenneth Branagh’s film Much Ado About Nothing where the British actors (Elton, Brian Blessed, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton) would rowdily repair to a taverna in the evenings while the Hollywood contingent (Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves) coolly kept to themselves. In his short scenes as Verges, the police deputy, Elton received just one note from Branagh: “Don’t act.”He is sharp, too, on the workings of the comedy industry. While those familiar with the oeuvres of Dave Allen, Billy Connolly and Victoria Wood might take issue with his assertion that he pioneered observational comedy, he nonetheless paints a vivid picture of the alternative scene in the 1980s and how it kicked against the openly sexist and racist orthodoxy of the preceding decade.He has no time for the older generation of comics who claim you can’t say anything any more: “In my experience youcansay anything, it just doesn’t hurt to think a bit harder about how you say it andwhyyou’re saying it.”All of which makes What Have I Done? a curious mixture of insight and rampaging ego. Though Elton is capable of self-mockery, he is also master of the humblebrag and doesn’t miss an opportunity to list the superstars who tell him how thrilled they are at meeting him. At a Hard Rock Café anniversary party, he’s sees “a kerfuffle in the crowd” and realises George Harrison is making a beeline towards him to thank him for “keeping us amused in the 1980s”. Midway through an account of the premature birth of his twins, he pauses to let us know George Michael has sent flowers. If there is a recurring theme beyond the fact that everyone from Bono to the Beatles think he’s wonderful, it is Elton’s belief that he has been cruelly maligned. There is much agonising about the critics who, in the post-Blackadder years, have mostly looked dimly on his output. He also recalls unprovoked vitriol from fellow comic Alexei Sayle and presenter Jonathan Ross. He is clearly wounded by the brickbats, but as he recounts the umpteenth critical mauling, you want to gently take him aside and say: “You’ve worked consistently and made a handsome living for over 40 years. Why not just take the wins?”What Have I Done? concludes with its author receiving a Legend award at a comedy festival – for which, naturally, Paul McCartney and Michael Palin send their congratulations – and expressing a desire to keep working for another 10 years. That, he posits, would be sufficient time “to warrant a new extended edition of this memoir”. Given the surfeit of self-aggrandising bluster in the current version, it’s an idea that comes over less like a promise than a threat.What Have I Done?

It’s an overdue account of a remarkable artist whose dazzling, daring career had more than a few twists: from Vogue cover girl to Vogue photographer; from surrealists’ muse to pioneer of the movement; from commercial portraitist to war photographer.Some of Miller’s fabled work is here, including her famous self-portrait in Hitler’s bathtub, her boots – dirtied with mud from Dachau concentration camp – strewn symbolically on the floor. The exhibition builds a sense of the dizzying, sometimes frenzied energy of Miller, who could photograph fashionable hats as well as Nazis who died by suicide. Yet, as her work turns abruptly in subject matter over the decades, swinging from frivolity to devastation, it is never jarring – and never boring.In a triptych of Miller and Man Ray, she wears a BDSM collar, while he wears an avuncular jumperMiller understood the barbed nature of beauty profoundly. Without referencing the sexual abuse Miller experienced as a child, and only briefly alluding to the fact that her father, an amateur photographer, began to use Miller as a model, sometimes nude, from the age of eight, the show begins emphatically with an image Miller made of herself, in a Photomaton in 1927, posing in the cloche hat later made iconic when she appeared in it on the cover of Vogue.The first room charts Miller’s short-lived modelling career, including images by Edward Steichen, Arnold Genthe and Cecil Beaton. Gradually, their images of Miller merge into her own pictorialist-inflected self-portraits – some of which were published in Vogue, with Miller acknowledged as model and photographer.View image in fullscreenFrivolity to devastation … Lee Miller, Model Elizabeth Cowell Wearing Digby Morton Suit, London, 1941.Photograph: Lee Miller/Lee Miller Archives, England 2025. All rights reserved. leemiller.co.ukHer relationship withMan Rayarguably changed the course of art history, although Man Ray would get the credit. The fascinating room devoted to the work they made together between 1929 and 1932 is packed with sumptuously surreal and dreamlike images, languorous pictures of necks, torsos and breasts, playing with ideas of subservience and power. In a triptych of the couple, Miller wears a BDSM collar, Man Ray an avuncular jumper. It’s easy to see who wields the power.In the early 1930s, Miller was a masterly printer and at her most experimental. An example of what is thought to be the first artistic use of solarisation in photography is quietly reattributed to Miller in this show. The technique was developed in the 1840s, whereby the negative is exposed momentarily to light during processing. Man Ray has previously been credited with the first use in art – but here Miller’s role is emphasised in the making of that landmark image, Primat de la Matière sur la Pensée. It is a sublime vintage print of a nude female figure, the solarised effect making the body appear to dissolve and melt into the background, the mystical effect of an aureole. The beauty of the image consumes itself.Equally experimental are her Paris street shots, at the apex of surrealist photography, with a vertiginous range of camera angles, distorting perspectives and reversing images to confound and perplex the viewer’s vision. The effect is spellbinding. She establishes her own lexicon of surrealist metaphors and motifs, with a persistent interest in statues: fixed, immobile and voiceless – perhaps what she most feared becoming.View image in fullscreenThe apex of surrealist photography … Lee Miller, Untitled, Paris, 1930.Photograph: Lee Miller Archives, England 2025. All rights reserved. leemiller.co.ukThere are works here that have never been seen before, including sensuous desert pictures in Egypt and Syria, taken while living in Cairo in the 1930s. There are newly discovered wartime photographs, such as an image of opera singer Irmgard Seefried, photographed while singing an aria in the ruins of the Vienna opera house.Miller got as close to the frontlines as she was permitted, photographing mushrooming clouds of napalm, makeshift surgeries erected in muddy Alsatian fields and brittle buildings during the blitz. The images she made at Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps, just weeks after they were liberated in 1945, are deliberately presented in a separate room here. They are among the most distressing scenes of the 20th century. A closeup picture of the bashed-in face of an SS guard, beaten by his former prisoners, photographed with a pitiless bright flash, gives little feeling of retribution or justice.‘Out on a damn limb’: the daredevil photography of Lee Miller – in picturesRead moreAfter what she witnessed at the end of the war, Miller’s relationship with photography tapered off, and this exhibition does, too. The final room is of portraits of Miller’s famous artist friends – Picasso, Miró, Man Ray, Dorothea Tanning. They lack the electric ingenuity of her earlier portraits, yet perhaps this artistic milieu is where she felt most comfortable. By the time she died in 1977, Miller had hidden most of her archive away in an attic, turning her attention, in yet another surprising move, to gourmet cooking. Miller was many things – but this exhibition proves that, ultimately and above all, she was an artist.At theTate Britain, London, 2 October-15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsLee MillerPhotographyArtTate BritainreviewsShareReuse this content"

The great contrarians explain allAmy FlemingTue 30 Sep 2025 10.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 12.49 EDTShareGilbert & George are excited. And proud. And smell so good that I’m tempted to ask what colognes they’re wearing. We’ve all just arrived at the Hayward Gallery on London’s South Bank, where their forthcoming show, 21st Century Pictures, is mid-hang. As soon as we’re through the doors, Gilbert darts about like a puppy let off the leash, urgently assessing the installation. “White Bastards!” George says to me, pointing to the 2004 piece as though he’s just spotted an old friend.The artists may be in their 80s, but all the work here was made in the last 25 years, and the gallery vibrates with rudeness, colour, contrarianism and cheek, their often vast creations luxuriating, as always, in warts-and-all humanity.We don't have the machine for music in our housePerhaps the most contrarian thing about this show is that there’s going to be an accompanyingorchestral extravaganza at the neighbouring Royal Festival Hall. Musical pieces will be performed by the Philarmonia, picked in order to explore Gilbert & George’s themes of sex, money, race and religion (collectively, the title of a massive four-part artwork). Their art will be projected on to screens during the performance.This all goes against much of what Gilbert & George stand for. Just last year George dismissed an immersive Van Gogh experience as“some populist nonsense”. But most of all, the event flies in the face of their longtime motto: “Music is the enemy.” I want to talk to you about music, I say as provocatively as possible, but they decline to rise to the bait. “I was a choirboy, after all,” says Gilbert.View image in fullscreenSex, 2016, from Sex, Money, Race, Religion.Photograph: Courtesy of Gilbert & George and White Cube“That’s an entirely different matter,” quips George, to guffaws around the room. But Gilbert continues: “I was even in a Bach choir, once. I must have been 18 or 19 because it was when I went to theArtAcademy in Munich.”Their big break as artists was musical, too,singing Underneath the Arches– the 1932 ode to homelessness – together. So are you a good singer as well, I ask George. “Of course,” says Gilbert. “But it was not important, the singing.”“Coming from darkest Devon and from Italy,” says George, the Devonian, “we suddenly realised there were so many people who were in trouble in cities, and we could see in every corner there were tramps and young people in trouble.”Gilbert takes over: “We lived in the East End of London, so they were all in front of churches, sleeping rough.” The pair befriended many of them, from survivors of the two world wars, says George, to men who, “had been in trouble with sex, and the vast majority had been caught cottaging in a public lavatory and sent to prison for three months, could never tell their parents or their employers.”The song, which they started performing in 1969, says Gilbert, “made us famous overnight. We made it into a living sculpture. Normally, sculptures are quite dead. We used to do these metallised heads, full of colours. We put on Vaseline and then powders; extraordinary. And we did the Hyde Park walk. That was the day of the Rolling Stones concert.”View image in fullscreenFunky, 2020.Photograph: © Gilbert & George Courtesy White Cube“We were just surrounded by people,” says George. “Young people asking us questions, imagining we had the answers to all the difficulties in life or something. Extraordinary.” Gilbert: “And then it became overnight, big success, galleries, New York, Amsterdam.” They would sing for around eight hours every day, and then were “badly behaved in the evenings,” says Gilbert. “We were entertained by all the famous artists at the time. The pop artists like Rauschenberg. Warhol took a portrait of us.”“New York was extraordinary,” adds George. “It was pre-Aids. Life was wonderful, pre-Aids.”So far, so rock’n’roll, and further clues to extracurricular musical enjoyment come when Gilbert reminisces about clubbing in 80s London. “We used to go tothe Blitz,” he says of the club where the New Romantics used to wear their most outrageous outfits. “We were a part of the beginning, when they started it all.” George adds that the address was the icing on the cake: “Great Queen Street.”Yet at some unspecified point in the distant past, they decided “to eliminate music from our art,” says Gilbert. “We felt that the streets of London were filled with galleries and theatres and everything, but that …” George finishes his sentence “… art was on the sideline a bit, because art with music didn’t feel very serious. Art without music is always better.”Music, George adds, is “too soothing. We’re allowed to be against the middle-classes for liking music too much … Couple of violins and it’s all fine. Some pictures by us, ‘Woah, I’m not sure about that.’”Do they enjoy music privately? “We don’t have the machine for doing that in our house,” says George . There’s a radio, but that’s for the news, “to check on the enemy.” And they watch films.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtesy White CubeThey seem to have little idea how or why this Philarmonia musical extravaganza came about, nor did they choose most of the repertoire, including Duke Ellington’s Black, from Black, Brown and Beige and Elgar’s Land of Hope and Glory. Although Underneath the Arches is on there, along with a medley of songs picked by them, not that they know what made the cut.“We did make these little suggestions,” says George, rummaging in his pocket and retrieving a stack of hand-written notes which includes a list: “As Time Goes By, You Made Me Do It, Pack Up Your Troubles, I’ll Be Seeing You, We’ll Meet Again, There’ll Be Joy and Laughter and Peace Ever After.” They don’t sound very 21st century. “They’re just songs that – we’re war babies remember – the first music I could hear was connected with the war.”What do they do to relax? “There’s a question,” says George. I’ve seen them having their nightly dinners at the Dalston Turkish restaurant Mangal II over the years. “That’s quite good,” says Gilbert. “Probably relaxing, yes.” Although it turns out they’ve since switched toMangal Iaround the corner because Mangal II, says Gilbert, “started to have music every night and we didn’t like it.”“Enough is enough,” confirms George.The marketing blurb for the Philarmonia event asks: “Can the orchestra convince them that music is NOT the enemy?” “Whatever,” says George. “Just see what happens.” I get the impression they’re embracing the cross-pollination arts institutions go in for these days largely because they’re so chuffed with their retrospective, and are happy to promote and celebrate it in all the ways required of them. (Plus, it’s amusingly contrarian.)And celebrating they are.“It’s very thrilling to have a big show in a public space like this in the centre of London,” says George. Anything else they want to say about the new show?“Make them come,” says Gilbert. “In many different ways.”Gilbert & George: Sex, Money, Race, Religion is at theRoyal Festival Hall, London, on Sunday 5 October.

Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley reviewSerpentine North Gallery, LondonThe artist wants to tackle polarisation by strong-arming her audience into stilted debate in a show that seems to mistake social media for real lifeJonathan JonesTue 30 Sep 2025 12.15 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 12.22 EDTShareThis haunted fairground of an exhibition has its heart in the right place. But that is not enough. Called The Delusion, it is a woolly mess of platitudes and phoney dialogue. Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley is worried about the polarisation of online discourse and 21st-century politics. Aren’t we all? But the remedies offered are confused, and the attempt to create a free, open discussion is stymied by its coercive tactics.You can’t say you weren’t warned. A huge text at the beginning explains the artist’s “Terms and Conditions”, including the instructions to “Join others, experience this together”, and to “talk, share, listen and question out loud”. Do I have to? Yes. As I look at an arcade-like machine in a cabinet behind a glass door, someone asks me firmly, “Did you open the door? Well, you should open it.” So I open it, answer some questions in the negative and am told off again, this time by the machine, for holding back.The Delusion uses technology as a cover for artistic paucity, and expects interaction instead of giving anything much itself. It confirms my suspicion that participatory art is a bit lazy, expecting the audience to do the heavy lifting. After reading the rules, you walk around a low-lit space with arcade-style machines among satin drapes leading to ouija-like tables. There are so-so cartoons on the walls in which multi-eyed monsters make comments about hate and oppression. They are the best bit – at least the artist sat down and doodled them.View image in fullscreenRules of the game … The Delusion.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAWords such as “hate”, “polarisation” and “dehumanisation” are thrown around but their meaning is never spelt out. That is your job. One of Brathwaite-Shirley’s team, politely, tried to get me to discuss the question, “Why do we dehumanise people?” I said I can’t debate an abstract proposition, it needs to be more specific. For instance, I reckon Nigel Farage dehumanises migrants. Why? Perhaps because he hates them, but that’s merely my speculation: I don’t know his motives. He may be a completely cynical politician who doesn’t mean a word he says. The answer I got was something about community solidarity. It seemed inadequate and pre-scripted. And the conversation stopped there, as if we had been talking about different things.As a physical exhibition, this isn’t all bad, but the more you do as you are told and interact, the less fun it is. At the press view, there wasn’t much sign of anyone else getting intensely involved in the games and stilted conversational starters – and if you can’t get journalists to mouth off, who will? I don’t think this is what anyone goes to galleries for, to debate with strangers as opposed to, say, being alone with their thoughts looking at art.Another game asks if you need to be dehumanised to commit war crimes. But what does “dehumanised” actually mean? The guards at Auschwitz were still human beings. It’s a way of reassuring ourselves to say they were “dehumanised”. Such sterile use of language strips this art of meaning. Brathwaite-Shirley poses a series of supposed moral and political questions but they are all expressed in the same strings of predefined and loaded terms. “Hate” is a word that needs, to quote Lenin on power, the terms “Who? Whom?” to mean anything.View image in fullscreenSpending to much time online? Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley poses within The Delusion.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThis artist, I fear, spends too much time online. The insults, aggressions and extremist views that fly on social media create false, ugly, limited world views. This exhibition wants to talk past those views but mistakenly conflates online verbiage with real life. “Hate” is used here in the way it’s used in online forums. You hate. I am hated. While The Delusion wants to combat the “polarisation” of today’s largely digital controversies, it chokes itself on the very rhetoric those arguments spew out.Perhaps in this way it has something to teach. George Orwell argued in his 1946 essay Politics and the English Language that ideology was destroying our language with abstractions and evasions. He imagined this process taken to a totalitarian extreme as 1984’s “newspeak”. If you can’t talk about ideas clearly and critically, how can you have the open, democratic debates Brathwaite-Shirley aspires to unleash?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It lasts two hours and features 30 songs. It comes divided into five acts, each with a deeply portentous title that glows from the big screens in blood-red gothic script: Of Velvet and Vice; The Beautiful Nightmare That Knows Her Name; Every Chessboard Has Two Queens. It arrives preceded by a lengthy film in which next to nothing happens: resplendent in a ruff and leg of mutton sleeves,Lady Gagalooks pensive and occasionally writes on a scroll with an absolutely enormous feathered quill, while opera booms in the background.Perhaps she’s paying tribute once more to her avowed influence Andy Warhol, in this case his notorious always-leave-them-wanting-less approach to cinema. When it becomes apparent that looking pensive and writing on a scroll with a big quill is about the size of it, the audience become a little restive: something that sounds remarkably like a slow handclap erupts. When she finally rolls her scroll up and pensively walks off screen, the cheer is deafening. The real Lady Gaga is wheeled out on stage atop a giant scarlet crinoline dress that has something of the look of those crocheted dolls that the decorous but aesthetically challenged used to hide their toilet rolls under. The devoted crowd – the most devoted of the lot wearing matching T-shirts demanding “Justice for Artpop”, the coolly received2013 albumthat temporarily derailed her career – go berserk.View image in fullscreenThrow her in crinoline jail! Lady Gaga in her opening outfit.Photograph: Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Live NationThe enormous crinoline dress is pulled back to reveal a huge cage with dancers in it, in which Lady Gaga is subsequently locked. It sets the tone for the evening, in that it’s both exceptionally striking and completely ridiculous. If her most recent album,Mayhem, seemed like an act of consolidation – a full-blooded return to the electronic dance-pop with which she made her name, after a decade in which she had dabbled in country, jazz and soft-rock film soundtracks to varying degrees of success – the accompanying tour feels like a bold and hugely successful reaffirmation of Stefani Germanotta as pop’s most unrepentant oddball. As if she saw those photos of Chappell Roan wearing a pig’s nose and an escoffion as a challenge: hold my drink, I need to source some costumes that make my backing dancers look like 17th-century bubonic plague doctors, only sexy.You could, if you wanted, ponder what on earth is supposed to be going on up there amid the Lewis Carroll and Greek mythology inspired imagery, what with the plague doctors pretending to perform an operation, a surfeit of jerky zombie-style dancing and the loose plot line about Lady Gaga being locked in a battle with Mother Mayhem (also played by Lady Gaga). It may conceivably be something to do with warring impulses that lurk within people’s personalities – Dionysian and Apollonian, if you want to drag Nietzsche along to the O2 and get him waving his hands along to Alejandro – but you wouldn’t bet your house on it.Lady Gaga: Mayhem review – a fabulous return to her freaky first principlesRead moreYou might also mourn the passing of the blood-spattered sense of imminent chaos that attended her early arena tours, the whiff of the Lower East Side performance art clubs that still clung to her shows a decade ago: there’s no longer any room for it among the slick choreographed routines and special effects. But you couldn’t fail to be entertained, albeit in a slightly punch-drunk way. The songs are very loosely arranged into each of the acts by genre: big ballads, the squillion-selling Shallow, Die With a Smile and Edge of Glory among them, shoring up the finale; the Euro-influenced bangers packed upfront, which gives the opening a particularly unremitting quality.View image in fullscreenUnremitting bangers … Lady Gaga.Photograph: Samir Hussein/Getty Images for Live NationAnd there’s always something eye-popping to look at, the entire show having apparently been devised by people who thought the real issue with Gaga’s performances to date is that they were insufficiently camp and OTT: a special effect that turns the audience members captured on the screens into glowing-eyed zombies, a section in which Lady Gaga appears, half-buried in a sandbox, performing Perfect Celebrity while alternately fondling and pretending to strangle a plastic skeleton.None of it makes any sense whatsoever, but you soon stop worrying about meaning and give yourself over to its lurid sense of spectacle. Better not to wonder why Lady Gaga is singing Paparazzi on a pair of chrome crutches, in a crash helmet and a dress with an enormous train that eventually drags her backwards across the stage while she shouts “No! Please! No!” in mock-distress, and simply enjoy the fact that sheis.Lady Gaga is at theO2 Arena, London, until 4 October, then atCo-op Live, Manchester, 7-8 OctoberExplore more on these topicsLady GagaPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Our writer goes on a hard-hat tourKate WyverTue 30 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 14.48 EDTShareThe sleek high rises chase each other up into the sky. “It is a bit dystopian, isn’t it?” says producer Oliver Royds as we walk through Canary Wharf. “Easy to feel like you’re in the Capitol.”London’s finance hub will soon host the theatrical premiere of Suzanne Collins’ dystopian novelThe Hunger Games, in which the all-powerful Capitol sends children to fight to the death for sport and retribution. Donning hefty boots and hard hats, Royds and I snake under the city through concrete corridors, emerging into daylight to enter the building site where a bespoke 1,200-seat theatre is being made.Since March, this scrap of unused scrubland has developed into a 26-metre-tall temporary theatre covering 2,250 sq metres. When I visit in summer, the core is up and the shell is under way. “Don’t fall through,” calls producer Tristan Baker as I hop over a hole and head into the cavernous structure. The soon-to-be-stage is filled with cranes, wires and a constant buzz of power tools. A man harnessed 15 metres up waves hello with his drill.View image in fullscreen‘Every seat is brilliant’ … inside the Canary Wharf theatre.Photograph: Lions Gate EntertainmentRoyds and Baker are the pair behind the Troubadour theatre of Wembley Park, whereStarlight Expressis now whizzing around on rollerskates. Next year they will launch Troubadour Greenwich Peninsula theatre, a complex with two 1,500-seat auditoriums. Both men independently run theatre and film production companies – Royds leads BOS Productions, Baker heads up Runaway Entertainment – and together they are joint CEOs of Troubador, the company that designs, builds and operates their sites. Fronting both sides of the production, they knew they could offer something unique for a show that demands such space and spectacle. “We said to Lionsgate [the film distributors] we could do this differently,” says Royds.Their team also has a unique contact in Baker’s business partner at Runaway: Charlie Parsons, known as the father of reality TV. Flicking between his reality show Survivor and footage of the Iraq war first sparked Collins’ idea for TheHunger Games, a fact Parsons didn’t know until 2018, when they began talks about securing the rights. “Nobody would buy Survivor because they couldn’t understand it,” Parsons recalls. The show is now on its 50th season in the US. He nods ahead to Baker and Royds. “They have the same big vision – of being able to do anything even when it seems impossible.”Where Troubadour’s previous theatres have redeveloped existing spaces, the Canary Wharf site required filling a massive pit in the ground, with the tight proximity to other buildings meaning huge steel slabs had to be individually placed by a tower crane. As we walk around, the pair are enthusiastically nerdy about the construction, from the ballast-engineered approach to the sustainable soundproofing they failed to find globally before designing their own.View image in fullscreenJennifer Lawrence as Katniss in the 2012 film of The Hunger Games.Photograph: Lions Gate/Everett/RexMade with 42,000 hunks of aluminium and steel components, the theatre is entirely modular. That means when time’s up, 95% of the site can be packed into 150 or so trucks and reused elsewhere. “We like to say we’re the new travelling circus,” Royds jokes, raising his voice as a circular saw starts up in the corner. “A building like this doesn’t exist elsewhere,” adds Baker, ushering us through a gap in the wall to see the river outside; you can, if you wish, take a boat to the theatre. “We’re trying to give the audience something new and thrilling.”When the audience chooses their tickets, the arena is divided into districts – with the pointed exception of District 12, home of our hero, Katniss Everdeen. “You’re only ever 12 seats away from the action,” says Baker, pointing up to the back row of the stalls. “Every seat is a brilliant seat.” They want the action to feel right in front of us, the fights choreographed by Kev McCurdy pressing close.We like to say we’re the new travelling circusProducer Oliver RoydsWith the task of creating fire, fatal battles and genetically engineered animal mutations on stage, the creative team face high expectations. Conor McPherson’s adaptation uses the first book and first film as source material, while Matthew Dunster directs and Miriam Buether is the designer. Collins has been deeply involved with the process, offering new details of the world she has been inventing since the early 00s. “What’s exciting is there’s an audience of 25-40-year-olds who read the books when they came out and loved them,” says Royds. “But it’s now come back.” His nine-year-old son is avidly racing through them.They have the rights for the first three Hunger Games novels. Do they plan to stage them all? “If the audience wants it,” says Baker, nodding. If not, the space can be twisted and rearranged like a Rubik’s cube for other productions. “We built this specifically for The Hunger Games,” says Royds. “But the flexibility is key. You can do stuff here that you can’t do in any other venue.” He indicates upwards, where metal rods lace the entire ceiling. Each of these can carry four tonnes of weight – ideal for holding enormous set pieces or supporting actors as they fight upside down, as has been trailed for this show.View image in fullscreenBig vision … The Hunger Games: On Stage in rehearsal.Photograph: Dany KaanDown a rickety ladder, a concrete mass of pillars form what will be London’s biggest sub-stage and largest hydraulic stage, which will raise most of the set up from the floor. Through the dusty gloom you can imagine the tributes waiting down here to rise up into the Cornucopia at the start of the games. “We’ve obviously got a few tricks up our sleeves,” Royds smiles. Upstairs, the theatre will feature three huge bars, a restaurant looking out over the O2, and masses of toilets. “We want people to be queueing for the bar, not the loo,” Baker says with a laugh. Combined, the show and the theatre cost £26m. “That’s the same price as a large Broadway musical,” he notes. “Plus we can reuse the structure.”The cast of 23 are booked for the next year, with the actor playing Katniss, Mia Carragher, already in archery school. “Matthew keeps talking about it as a dance troupe,” Royds shares. “Because it’s such an ensemble piece.” This is the unique challenge of adapting a story so beloved: “It’s got to deliver for those who love the books but it has to be uniquely different. Otherwise,” Royds shrugs, “you can just rewatch the film.”The Hunger Games: On Stage is atTroubadour Canary Wharf theatre, London, from 20 October-15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreImmersive theatreHunger GamesThe Hunger GamesSuzanne CollinsLondonStagecraftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had met McGough, a Hull University graduate, and Henri, a painter and jazz musician, on the Liverpool club scene, and was already taking their poems for Underdog, the little Xeroxed magazine he edited, to sell in clubs and pubs and at a few sympathetic bookshops.At a time when pop, comedy and poetry went naturally together, they rapidly became a well-known group – later categorised as the “Liverpool poets” – and two, or all three, of them would join to read their poems to audiences at every opportunity, in Liverpool or anywhere else they were invited. Tenderness and melancholy ran alongside the sad jokes and fantasies in the poems of Patten, the secondary modern boy from, in McGough’s phrase, an “awful deprived background”. This work related to the mood of the young in Liverpool in a way that the more sophisticated range and humour of his colleagues did not attempt. But the warm appeal of all three as skilled performers ensured their success.And Patten was no slouch with Underdog: as well as publishing McGough, Henri and numerous other British poets, he circulated it in the international world of foreign poets he admired. Soon he was featuring work by the AmericansAllen GinsbergandRobert Creeley, and byAndrej Voznesensky, celebrated and controversial in the Soviet Union.View image in fullscreenBorn in Liverpool, Brian was the only child in a desperately poor family. He never knew his father, Frederick, and had no interest in finding out about him. His childhood was spent in a tiny house in Wavertree Vale with a mother, Irene (nee Bevan), in whom he took years to discern any genuine affection, a formidable aunt, and grandparents who did not speak to each other. If Lawrence Road junior school (where he was reported to have been the last to read and write in his class) or Sefton Park county secondary school for boys (which he left at 15) were happier places than home, he acknowledged only one form teacher at Sefton Park, Harry Sutcliffe, for recognising some school work impressively done, and the headteacher, AT Woolley, for giving it special praise.But no one detected any particular gift in the young Brian, or inspired him to be creative. A loner then, as he continued to be all his life – “There’s something of the cat in him,” said McGough – he seems to have discovered both his wide reading and his writing talent for himself.After their encouraging start, the three Liverpool poets lived and worked in separate places from the mid-1960s, Patten and then McGough moving to London and Henri remaining in Liverpool. But the firm friendship continued, as did their collaboration in popular, well-attended tours.By 1967, observant cultural critics and alert publishers had spotted a definable “Liverpool scene” (exuberantly put on record in the book of that name by the poet and critic Edward Lucie-Smith), and Penguin published The Mersey Sound, which became its bestseller in their already flourishing Modern Poets series. Patten’s teenage poems there, drawing largely on his simultaneous debut volume, Little Johnny’s Confession, anticipated what he was to become: a rebellious romantic for whom poetry was never to be conventional or easy.View image in fullscreenBrian Patten and Roger McGough at the Hay festival, 2008.Photograph: Jeff Morgan 13/AlamyIn Prose Poem towards a Definition of Itself, he concluded: “It is the monster hiding in a child’s dark room, it is the scar on a beautiful man’s face. It is the last blade of grass picked from the city park.”Parallel with this went McGough’s success with his own poetry and his Top of the Pops fame in the late 60s with the Scaffold, the music, poetry and revue group. When the Scaffold fused with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band to form Grimms in 1971, working with figures such asViv StanshallandNeil Innes, Patten was invited – Henri soon came in as well – to join this larger group. Patten’s association lasted almost throughout the three years of its anarchic touring existence, as reader, occasional presenter and contributor to its albums, with a voice described by the poetAdrian Mitchellas having “all the colours of a melancholic alto sax”.Henri died in 2000.View image in fullscreenA succession of individual volumes from Patten that commanded impressive sales, including Vanishing Trick (1976), Grave Gossip (1979) and Storm Damage (1988), culminated in 1996 with Armada, a collection in which, after her death, he came to terms movingly with his relationship with his mother and his painful childhood, in a deprived neighbourhood he nevertheless felt betrayed to see “pulled down and replaced / And my background wiped from the face of the earth”.Armada proved to be his most notable book for adult readers and it arrived in a period of his life when he had already turned his talent towards producing poetry and fiction for children. The titles (and the illustrations accompanying them) of Gargling with Jelly (1985), Thawing Frozen Frogs (1990) and, later,Juggling with Gerbils(2000) suggested that they might be no more than run-of-the-mill light verse ventures. Not so. Patten’s resource with rhyme and plotting and his clever updating of traditional wisdoms – see Winifred Weasel or Mr Ifonly (“I could really have lived if only I had tried ...”) – revealed him to be a children’s poet of distinction.As early as 1975 there had been a strange and remarkable prose fantasy, Mr Moon’s Last Case, in which the eponymous police inspector tries to track down a dwarf, who could be a leprechaun. No one except Patten had, or has, written anything quite like this eerie allegory of powerless authority pursuing an imaginary creature in which many people (but all children) actually believe.The sheer number of his love poems, and their popularity at readings, encouraged the publication of ample collected editions. Part of their appeal lies in their apparent intimacy and authenticity in treating the subject of love in a modern world; but they in fact belong to an older tradition, which saw love as energising and revitalising and at the same time the creator of confusion and chaos: “Nothing can be pinned down or fully explained. / You are afraid. / If you found the perfect love / It would scald your hands ... ” he wrote in And Nothing Is Ever As You Want It to Be.Brian Patten reading his poem So Many Different Lengths of Time, at Adrian Henri’s graveThough Patten was not the equal of Robert Graves (whom he had visited at his home in Deià, Majorca, when young) as a love poet, his long exploration of love in all its moods and changes at least makes the comparison possible.There is much sadness and loss in the love poetry, and in later years his poetry included moving elegies to departed friends. But in the end, what Patten says about the tramp who befriends the little figure in Mr Moon’s Last Case could be said to apply not only to these poems but to all his endeavours as a writer: “He moved, spoke, gestured and breathed as if he knew for certain that behind the drab winter clouds a different kind of sky was waiting, and that beneath the exhausted and frost-bitten ground lurked every imaginable flower.”In 1970 he developed a passionate connection with Mary Moore, daughter of the sculptor Henry Moore, who was the dedicatee of his 1971 book, The Irrelevant Song; it gave him crucial encouragement in his writing for children. This relationship lasted until 1975 and was until then his longest and most important one. In 1994 he formed a lasting partnership with Linda Cookson, a travel writer, with whom he lived in Dittisham,Devon, and whom he married in 2015. She survives him.Brian Patten, poet and author, born 7 February 1946; died 29 September 2025Alan Brownjohndied in 2024Explore more on these topicsPoetryPoetry (children and teens)Children and teenagersRoger McGoughLiverpoolDevonobituariesShareReuse this content"

His favourite wasAlban Gate, designed in 1986-87, a tower that straddles London Wall south of the Barbican: he saw this as an exercise in routes and axes across three dimensions.View image in fullscreenThe TV-am studios in Camden Town, north London, created by Terry Farrell.Photograph: Richard BryantHe was annoyed by critics who saw the SIS Building, the headquarters of MI6 at Vauxhall Cross (1994), as a large decorated box in the manner of the American postmodernists; he had designed it as a miniature city, as its less familiar side elevations make clear. The third major building of this series isEmbankment Place(1990), the office block above Charing Cross station, which to the irritation of modernist purists has the outline of a Victorian station train shed without its function.It occasionally happens that a single edition of the evening TV news features both these latter projects as a backdrop, and sometimes also theHome Office premises(2005) he designed in Marsham Street; their forms have become “iconic” in the proper sense.View image in fullscreenThe KK100 skyscraper in the Luohu district of Shenzhen, China, designed by Terry Farrell.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesFarrell was born in Sale, Cheshire (now in Greater Manchester), to parents of Irish heritage, Molly (nee Maguire) and Thomas Farrell, a junior civil servant. The family moved to Newcastle, where Terry was educated at St Cuthbert’s grammar school. He studied architecture at what would shortly becomeNewcastle Universityand then took up a position in the architect’s department of the London county council.A Harkness fellowship took him to the University of Pennsylvania in 1962-64, where he was taught byLouis KahnandDenise Scott Brown.At the LCC he met Grimshaw and the two went into practice together; their reputations were launched in 1968 with a widely publicised project for student residences in Paddington. Grimshaw designed a high-tech service tower, and Farrell remodelled the 19th-century terraces around it. The experience – both the design process and their collaboration on it – sowed the seeds, however, of their incompatibility and provided a harbinger of their future careers.In 1984, four years after he had set up Terry Farrell & Partners, Farrell intervened in the long-runningMansion House controversy, where the property developer Peter Palumbo proposed to replace protected Victorian buildings in the City with a tower designed in the 60s by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Farrell’s scheme, for Save Britain’s Heritage, proposed a subtle reworking of the existing buildings.He realised this type of project in 1982-88 when he knitted together premises built over three centuries around a courtyard in Seven Dials, London, with new interventions; this becamethe first postmodern ensemble to be listed.Blurring the line between the old and the new in this way also suggested the direction in which architecture was to go, and Farrell did it frequently. Hisheadquarters for TV-am(1983), with its row of egg cups atop what had been a Victorian canalside warehouse in Camden Town, and his reworking of the interior ofModern Two(1999), the contemporary art collection of the National Galleries of Scotland, to house the Dada and surrealism collections of theGabrielle Keiller Library, were examples of this.Many of the architect-stars of the 80s went on to develop a reputation as masterplanners 20 years later. Farrell’s office, too, practised on a large scale from Hong Kong, from the mid-90s, at a time when there was little respect for his work in Britain. Now finding postmodernism “reactionary”, he also designed both the tallest office tower in Beijing and what has becomethe second tallest in Shenzhen.View image in fullscreenCentral atrium of the Home Office building in Marsham Street, London, designed by Terry Farrell.Photograph: AlamyFarrell was distinct from the select group of professional leaders he was associated with. He was not a clubbable type; proud of his working-class origins, he was uncomfortable around his well- connected peers and eschewed any kind of personality cult. He was active on design panels and led theFarrell Reviewin 2014, which called for architectural education to be made more accessible.He took a dim view of the notion that the flashy architecture of the 80s was the visual complement to Thatcherism; the wilfully sculptural Blackwall tunnel vents, which now poke out through the roof of the O2 Arena, were designed while he was working for the Labour-led LCC in the early 60s and his first, curvaceous, large-scale building housed a water treatment operation centre (Reading, 1979-82) for a nationalised industry.The split from Grimshaw was acrimonious and the bad feeling persisted for the rest of their lives, but Farrell developed a career so different from that of his former partner that no competition was necessary. None of the other“Brits who built the modern world”–the five architects featured in a three-part BBC Four series and a RIBA exhibition in 2014 – designed amusing features such as the TV-am eggcups, the Hollywood-Egyptian flourishes on his Paddington office building, or therecent EV charging station in Maida Valethat has blown-up, old-fashioned petrol pumps as caryatids, created with the polymath designerAdam Nathaniel Furman.Farrell left his archive, “every bus ticket” as he put it, to Newcastle University rather than to the national institutions who courted it, and he foundedan urban study centrethere in the spirit of the Farrell Review.He was also generous in attributing the design of buildings in his office to the team members who worked on them. A memoir, published in 2020, laid out with unusual candour what he thought of some of his contemporaries.Farrell was appointed OBE in 1978, CBE in 1996, and knighted in 2001. In 1960 he married Rosemarie Mallam, with whom he had two daughters. His marriage to Susan Aplin in 1973 produced a third daughter and two sons, one of whom was a partner of the practice for 10 years. His first two marriages ended in divorce. In 2007 he married Mei Xin Wang, a financial and business executive.She and his children survive him.Terry Farrell, architect, born 12 May 1938; died 28 September 2025Explore more on these topicsTerry FarrellArchitectureLondonChinaHong KongNewcastle UniversityobituariesShareReuse this content"

In the same way that pouring Guinness is an art, actually. And as with all artistic feats, people think, “Well, anyone could do that!” before swiftly finding out that anyone could not, in fact, do that. An accurate Irish accent, for a non-Irish actor, takes dedication, research, talent. And as is the case with all art, failure invites utter brutality from the critics.In the canon of Irish TV and film, there are sadly more misses than hits when it comes to nailing the gift from God that is a true Irish accent. Bad accents become famous for being bad, remembered for reducing all Irish speech to a monolith. Brad Pitt as an IRA gunman inThe Devil’s Own, for instance, was so bad that the year after it came out, the Troubles finally ended. Then there’s Gerard Butler’s bizarre broguish twang in PS I Love You. Cameron DiazandLeonardo DiCaprio were both absolutely woeful inGangs of New York. For every good modern example (the notoriously tricky Belfast accent is pretty much nailed by Jodie Whittaker in Good Vibrations and Maxine Peake in Disney+’sSay Nothing), there’s a terrible accent fail (Helen Mirren inMoblandis so comical it went viral earlier this year). Is it any wonder that Marian Keyes – whose novel Grown Ups is now being adapted for Netflix – recently told an audience at the Hay festival: “It would be so, so nice if they use people who can do Irish accents. I mean, the accents are just … I weep. I am corroded with pain.”View image in fullscreenAnd if it isn’t Brad Pitt, to be sure, in The Devil’s Own.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamySometimes a bad accent is the result of a megastar being shoehorned in to an independent Irish production, in a vain attempt to boost cultural relevancy (seeJulia Roberts in Michael Collins, the true tragedy of the movie). Even being Irish yourselfdoesn’t excuse poor Irish accent acting. Jamie Dornan, for instance, is from Belfast, but that didn’t save him from slipping into leprechaun-speak in the direWild Mountain Thyme. Without proper research on dialect, intonation and tempo, Irish accents all fall into lazy stereotypes: “Oirish” pronunciation, ending every sentence with “to be sure”, and pronouncing “three” invariably as “tree”.It’s enough to put an actor off trying. Particularly English actors, who would perhaps be justified in running a mile when presented with a script requiring a Dublin brogue. James Norton was not one of them. In Netflix’s new seriesHouse of Guinness, the London-born Norton channels his inner Northsider to play Guinness foreman – and hardman – Sean Rafferty. As Rafferty, Norton shags, drinks, fights, walks in slow motion away from explosions, and even speaks some of his lines as Gaeilge. But it was the accent he was worried about. He told RTÉ last week that the difficulty came partly from the fact it was an 1860s Dublin accent, not a modern one. And partly because Norton was one of the few English men on set.“I was very aware that I had to get it right, because inIrelandeveryone can name an actor who’s messed up the Irish accent,” he says now. “If you masquerade as an Irishman and don’t get the accent right, it is sacrilegious.” Norton doesn’t think the Irish accent itself is the challenge, mind you: “It’s more that the terror and high standards that come with it is a job within itself.”View image in fullscreen‘Everyone in the world has an opinion about Irish accents’ … Anthony Boyle and Louis Partridge in House of Guinness.Photograph: Ben Blackall/Netflix/PAHouse of Guinness lingers again and again on authenticity when it comes to Irish language and speech patterns. In one scene, brothers Arthur and Edward Guinness tease each other over the former’s English pronunciation after his time at Eton – the irony being that in real life Anthony Boyle, who plays Arthur, has a thick Irish accent, while Louis Partridge, who plays Edward, has a southern English one. And last week, it was announced that the show is the first original Netflix production to come with Irish subtitles available. “The Irish language is such a vital part of the country’s culture and identity, and making the series accessible in this way allows us to celebrate that heritage and reach those viewers who prefer to watch as Gaeilge,” creator Steven Knight said in a statement.“I don’t think Irish is a particularly difficult accent,” Norton says, touching on that same accessibility. “But because of the Irish identity being so widely celebrated, there’s an added pressure. They punch way above their weight culturally, so maybe we’re just more attuned to the Irish accent – we hear it more, so people are scrutinising it more. Everyone in the world has an opinion about an Irish accent.”It’s true that Irish soft power has never been more lucrative, or wide-reaching. House of Guinness, an eight-episode romp through 19th-century Dublin (you get the impression the target audience is, if not American, then nominally “Irish-American”), tells the story of one source of that soft power: the Guinness family. After Papa Guinness dies, the family business passes to Arthur and Edward, who, along with their siblings Anne and Benjamin, flounder or flourish under the pressure of fantastic wealth and power. Imagine if Succession was set in south Dublin, with a smattering of Peaky Blinders-esque debauchery (another of Knight’s creations), and you’re basically there.In other words, this is a show about green power, communicated – appropriately – through the black stuff. It’s about money, rebellion and Irishness. Although it’s set in the 1800s, the soundtrack features Fontaines DC, the Scratch, the Mary Wallopers and Kneecap. Ireland’s output today, as in the days of the Guinness family, is one of actual capital but, more importantly, of cultural capital too. As Norton points out, Ireland has a loud voice for a small country. A voice we now hear a lot of.View image in fullscreenAn accent so bad it went viral … Helen Mirren as Maeve Harrigan in Mobland.Photograph: Luke Varley/Paramount+“I think historically people found it hard to do Irish accents because maybe they didn’t have access to them in the same way they do now,” says Fionn O’Shea, a native Dubliner himself, who plays disinherited drunkard Benjamin Guinness. “There was a time where people were doing a general Irish accent in the same way that there’s an unaccepted general American and RP [received pronunciation]. The general Irish accent ended up being a hybrid of every county in Ireland. Now I see people do it phenomenally well.”To nail Ben’s slurred, mangled accent, which lands somewhere between RP and Victorian Dublin, O’Shea (and Norton) worked with dialect coach Poll Moussoulides, who also voice-coached onThe Banshees of Inisherin, Normal People and Wednesday. For House of Guinness, Moussoulides dug into the BBC archives to find recordings of working-class and affluent Dubliners from the 19th century, and sent recordings of himself reading the script on a line-by-line basis.This kind of work is becoming more common as actors desperately try to avoid veering into Pitt in The Devil’s Own territory. “Every production should have an accent department with enough personnel to support every actor,” says the New York-based dialect coach Erik Singer. “Accents require the same type of training as any other complex physical task, such as horseback riding or playing the guitar. They need to know someone else has got their ear on [their accent] so they can be free to act.”View image in fullscreenStriving for authenticity … House of Guinness.Photograph: NetflixIt’s these kinds of jobs that give you well-researched, artful Irish accents, which are so convincing you could suspend your disbelief enough to imagine that Cate Blanchett really isa hardened investigative journalist inVeronica Guerin, or that Daniel Day-Lewis really is a wrongfully imprisoned innocent man in In the Name of the Father. There aren’t necessarily tricks to getting it right, but there are quirks of the accent you have to pay attention to: “I’ve had actors struggle with things like the aspirate [breathy] ‘T’, and also the very light ‘L’ you would use in southern Irish accents”, says the London-based dialect coach Helen Simmons. “With a Northern Irish accent, one sound that can prove tricky is the vowel sound in ‘mouth’, ‘now’ and ‘round’, and in ‘you’, ‘goose’ and ‘new’. Those sounds are super unique to this accent. There can be some really specific familiar tune patterns, which, when not observed closely enough, can make the entire accent sound completely unauthentic and quite like a caricature – and probably offensive to native people.”Ireland on screen is never going to be a perfect representation of Ireland – and the Irish way of speaking – in real life. House of Guinness is a bigger, more bombastic imagination of Dublin that toys with rather than adheres to historical accuracy. But let’s be honest: as O’Shea and Norton point out, that’s not what Irish audiences care about. We don’t care how many explosions or anachronistic backing tracks or sordid political affairs you add into the plot. What we care about is straightforward: Can. You. Get. The. Accent. Right?House of Guinness is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionIrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he can spin a story using clothes within 10 minutes. Here, under a perfectly clear night sky in front of the Eiffel Tower, an army of “mesdames” stalked a Parisian garden dressed – by the designer’s own admission – for cruising.View image in fullscreenNylon dominated the runway.Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/ShutterstockThe fashion industry is preoccupied with the run of new designers making their debuts at big brands this autumn, including Dior and Chanel in Paris. By contrast, this is Vaccarello’s 30th collection. But “while the clothes have been fab, in terms of set and concept, the debuts haven’t been what’s delivering the spectacle”, said Elektra Kotsoni, the deputy director of Vogue Business and Runway, before the show. “Perhaps then Paris is where it’s at?”Not many shows could build a catwalk in the shape of the famous YSL logo using white hydrangeas, and not many designers could draw Madonna, Catherine Deneuve and Carla Bruni Sarkozy, wearing a faux-fur coat (the brand banned fur in 2022) shortly after her husband, Nicolas Sarkozy, was sentenced to five years in prison.View image in fullscreenPussy-bow blouses symbolised an ‘invasion’ of typically male-dominated workplaces.Photograph: Pixelformula/Sipa/ShutterstockVaccarello likes to take old codes from YvesSaint Laurenthimself and spin them into something new. Pussy-bow blouses – so named because people tied ribbons around their cats in the 30s – were popularised by Yves when he dressed women in suits in the 1960s.Later worn by Margaret Thatcher, Nancy Reagan and Kamala Harris, they came to symbolise an “invasion” of typically male-dominated workplaces, particularly in politics. Paired here with voluminous leather blousons and caps, they took on a more sexualised overtone.View image in fullscreenNylon gowns ballooned like parachutes as models walked the runway.Photograph: Marechal Aurore/Abaca/ShutterstockElsewhere, jewel-coloured nylon trenchcoats with just a pair of knickers underneath were a playful – if voyeuristic – spin on the classic YSL trench. As for the nylon gowns, which ballooned like parachutes as models walked, there was a small nod to Marie Antoinette. Practicality will only get Saint Laurent so far.If Saint Laurent gave us eveningwear, thenLouis Vuittondecided what women want were nice clothes to wear at home.

Flat shoes made of tapestry mimicked a carpet, the bright socks were fun, and shoulders were the main skin on show. Waistbands came loose or loosely tied with scarves or tassels, and there wasn’t a heel in sight.Louis Vuitton is a brand known for travel, and may struggle to sell the idea of indoor clothing at four-figure prices. “You can of course go outside in this,” added Ghesquière. “You have to imagine this is a trip around your apartment, though I know not every apartment is the Louvre.”Ghesquière has been at Louis Vuitton for over a decade, but is no stranger to viral attention. This year, the brand launched anabsurdly expensive lipstick, a Labubu-esque bag charm, and dressed Melania Trump in a caramel leather suit at Windsor Castle. Down the road from the show venue is a Louis Vuitton cafe, which sells boiled eggs with monogrammed toast soldiers.

It’s a well-known method that I learned while working with Italian chefs to celebrate in-season cavolo nero and new season extra-virgin olive oil, keeping the sauce as simple as possible to let each of them sing. You can serve this sauce however you like: I often stir it through pasta for a quick dinner, but when I have more time, I stir it through a white risotto. Finish with an additional drizzle of good extra-virgin olive oil: heaven.Cavolo nero risottoBoiling the garlic alongside the cavolo nero takes the edge off it, so the resulting puree is nowhere near as punchy as a standard pesto.Prep10 minCook50 minServes4200g cavolo nero, leaves stripped off the stalks3 garlic cloves, peeled1 litre vegetable stock(I use the cavolo nero cooking water)1 large knob butter1 onion, peeled and finely chopped2 celery sticks, trimmed and finely chopped225g risotto rice, such as arborio100ml dry white wineSalt and black pepper75g pecorino, or parmesan2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to finishPut the cavolo nero leaves and garlic in a large saucepan of water, bring to a boil, then cook for five minutes. Using a slotted spoon, lift the leaves and garlic into the jug of a blender, add 100ml of the cooking liquid and set aside. Add boiling water to the liquid left in the pan, to make it up to a litre, and leave it on a low heat.Meanwhile, put a second large pan or casserole on a medium heat, add the butter, chopped onion and celery, and saute for five minutes, stirring often, until the vegetables start to soften. Add the rice, stir for a minute or two, until it turns translucent, then add the wine and stir until it has all evaporated. Season the rice generously.Start adding the hot stock to the rice a ladleful at a time, stirring until all the liquid has been absorbed before adding the next ladleful. The rice will take 22-25 minutes to cook, by which time it should be oozy but still have a slight bite.When the rice is almost done, chop 40g of the cheese, add it to the contents of the blender jug, then pour in the extra-virgin olive oil. Season well, then blitz smooth.When the rice is ready, stir in the green puree, cook, stirring, for a further two to three minutes, then take off the heat, cover and leave to rest for two minutes.Serve with the remaining pecorino grated over the top and a final drizzle of good oil.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkRiceFoodMain courseStarterVegetablesAutumn food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Prop styling: Anna Wilkins.Kitchen aidePastaHow to avoid clumpy cheesy pasta saucesWe asked a wise panel of cheesy pasta perfectionists how they solve the blobby cheese problemAnna BerrillTue 30 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareHow do I prevent the cheese from clumpingin my cacio e pepesauce?Samuel, by emailThe first thing to note, says Feast’s Italian correspondentRachel Roddy, is that it’s “soannoying andsocommon. In fact, a lot of the responsibility lies with recipe writers, because, traditionally, cacio e pepe wasn’t this creamy, emulsified dish that we all make now. It was just cooked spaghetti with cheese on it.”She continues: “People are so good now at using the pasta cooking water, but that means everything is hotter.” And that right there, she says, is the cause of Samuel’s cheese-clumping plight: “When cheese gets too hot, the solids lose their fat and liquid, and turn into these horrid little blobs.” The line between melted and coagulated is a fine one, too: “It’s probably only a couple of degrees.”Tim Siadatan, co-owner ofTrulloandPadella, both in London, and author ofPadella: Iconic Pasta at Home, uses parmesan in hispicicacio e pepe because it’s not that easy to melt: “It’s a very hard, dry cheese with a high protein content, and it’s that combination of characteristics that makes it difficult to melt, especially compared with the likes of mozzarella, which is soft, high in moisture and fat, and low in protein.” To avoid those clumps and potential grainy texture, Siadatan first grates the parmesan (or pecorino) finely (“this will enable it to melt”), but doesn’t then leave it anywhere too warm, “otherwise it will start to sweat, stick together and form little balls even before you try to melt it”.To beat the heat, chefs in Rome often throw grated ice into the pan along with the cheese, Roddy says, although she prefers to play it “really safe” by mixing cold water with the cheese and pepper in a cool bowl to a toothpaste-like consistency. The combination of the cold cheese mix and hot spaghetti gives a “pretty reliable, creamy cacio e pepe, because it never gets too hot”. As in life, it also pays to wait a beat: “You can go from lovely and melty to blobby in a second,” Roddy warns, so she always counts to 10, 20, even 30 before lifting her pasta (plus any residual cooking water) into the sauce: “It will then be just that little bit cooler.”Siadatan’s sauce strategy, meanwhile, involves keeping the pan over a medium-low heat. “If you add all the cheese at once, it will clump before it’s had time to melt, so add a small handful at a time and stir to create a smooth sauce.”But don’t let your cheese fly solo: “To create a velvety sauce, you need liquid, such as water, butter, egg yolks or cream, for the cheese to melt into.” Mateo Zielonka, author ofPasta Pronto, concurs: he grates his cheese into a butter emulsion on a low heat, though if he’s making, say,fettuccine alfredo, he pulls the pan off the heat before adding the parmesan in two batches, “otherwise it goes stringy”.And if disaster does strike, can you rescue it? “Some say you can by adding more cheese, a bit of cold water and really beating it,” Roddy says, but if that doesn’t do the trick, she’d be inclined simply to embrace failure: “Making a mistake and watching that cheese coagulate is the first step, because then you can see what happens when it’s too hot and when it’s colder.” Well, every day’s a school day.Got a culinary dilemma?

He was honest about this from the start. I’m quite open-minded andwent along with a lot of scenariosthat turned him on. He says it’s just a kink and he’s not gay.However, nowevery time we have sex it’s always focused on the fantasy of him being with a man. He never looks at me with desire other than saying my face is really pretty. I can walk about naked and he won’t bat an eyelid. He sees me as a femdom, which I think means he likes me to make him“come out”. He’s an honest man, good to me and we get along perfectly. I just feel a bit undesired as a woman and worry one day he will decide he is, in fact, gay.What should I do? He swears he only wants to be with me and will always love me, will never cheat, and Icompletely trust him. I don’t want to talk about it in case I make him feel bad about himself, as I want him to feel safe and accepted. Should I quit worrying about my own hangups?Different couples make all kinds of different pacts with each other – some spoken, some unspoken. In your partnership it seems you originally found parity; you both benefited from the arrangement between you. Aside from being happy in your everyday lives together, you were able to use your sexual creativity to satisfy him, and in turn perhaps he was able to avoid having to acknowledge aspects of his sexual orientation that made him uncomfortable.For as long as you felt this pact was fair, you were happy with it, but now the balance has changed and you are longing to be truly desired. You will have to think carefully about whether the benefits of being with him outweigh the difficulties.What is most important is to stop belittling your feelings as your “own hangups”. A woman knows if she is undesired, and it is very painful. You are caring and protective of him and his feelings, but your own feelings are strong and valid and they should be respected, by both of you.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

It is Royal Mail that gets to investigate itself if money in its possession goes missing and for Royal Mail to decide whether an insurance payment is due to Travel FX.If Royal Mail decides it is blameless, you will be left empty handed.Moreover, Travel FX allows itself five working days before lodging a claim with Royal Mail and the latter requires up to 30 working days to investigate.DVLA insists my van was scrapped … that’s news to me as it’s passed its MOTRead moreYou can’t intervene yourself because Travel FX, as the sender, is Royal Mail’s customer, not you.Other currency exchanges I have looked at have the same T&Cs for home deliveries. This is potentially in breach of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, according to the consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft.The act holds the trader, not the delivery company, legally responsible for ensuring goods and services reach their destination. There is an exemption for the “supply” of currency, however, there is, Rycroft says, a legal distinction between “supply” and “delivery”.Travel FX admitted to me that there is “an argument” around the interpretation of the act, but said its “priority has always been to support the customer”.“Unfortunately, Royal Mail’s investigation in this instance has taken longer than usual, which we agree is frustrating for the customer and for us,” a spokesperson said.Remarkably Travel FX was able to refund you within three days of my intervention and 74 days after you had placed the order.Royal Mail did not reply to my request for a comment.

Some of the islands are mere skerries – rocky outcrops and reefs so small they can host but a single cormorant drying its outstretched wings – while others, such as our target Bullerön, can be a mile or more in length, with historic fishing huts, summer cottages and wooden jetties sitting among their smoothly weathered rocks and windswept forests.I’m on a two-day sea kayaking tour ofNämdöskärgården, a newly established marine national park, which is a vast 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of protected, mostly blue space – it is 97% covered by water – beginning on the outer reaches of the archipelago and stretching well into the Baltic Sea.Map of Stockholm archipelagoIt is Sweden’s second marine national park, alongside Kosterhavet on the west coast, and its creation was approved by Swedish parliament in June this year, a summer in which the country also banned bottom trawling – the destructive fishing practice that Sir David Attenborough has likened to“bulldozing a rainforest”– from its marine national parks and nature reserves by July 2026. It’s the first European country to do so (the UK appears to haverejected whole-site bansin more marine protected areas, despite its earlier pledge to extend these– much to the dismay of conservationists).One of the challenges in getting people to care about ocean conservation is that it’s hard to engage with what we can’t see or experience directly, and the idea behind Nämdöskärgården is not just to preserve the area’s unique ecological diversity, but also to make it accessible to visitors in a low-impact way. Sea kayaking – a popular pastime for Swedes throughout the archipelago – is the perfect way to do that.View image in fullscreenBullerö, in Nämdöskärgården.Photograph: Länsstyrelsen Stockholms länMy guide Johan Montelius, fromStockholm Adventures, and I get dropped off by taxi boat on Jungfruskär, which, like many isles in the outer archipelago, is uninhabited. We haul our narrow yellow sea kayaks up on to rocks splattered with grey, green and bright orange lichen, and after a quick safety briefing, Johan shows me our route to Idöborg, an island just outside the marine national park, where we’ll spend the night. It’s a journey of around 5 miles, but he assures me the wind will help push us along in parts and we’ll make plenty of stops along the way.The thing that excites me most is the seaweed. It’s a sign of healthy watersWe set off, and after a tricky first 50 metres of paddling into the wind, find ourselves nicely sheltered between two long islands. We settle into an easy, slow rhythm – perfect for tuning into the surrounding natural wonder. There is plenty of birdlife, mostly cormorants, gulls, herons and geese, but we also spot at least five different white-tailed eagles over the two-day trip, as well as a pine marten and a seal. The thing that excites me most, though, is the seaweed, which comes in a host of shades, even the russet colour of autumn leaves. It’s a sign of healthy waters, with the seaweed providing a great nursery for young fish as well as a vital carbon sink – something that absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases.View image in fullscreenSafe from the elements … in a forest cabin on IdöborgWe paddle over wonderful seagrass meadows, which glisten when the sun breaks through the clouds, and extensive belts of bladder wrack, orblåstång,a dark green seaweed with air pockets. Because the water is so clear, I can see it is also home to lots of periwinkles and other shellfish.We see no other boats or kayaks, partly because it’s a slightly wet and windy day in September – sunny days in July and August are a lot busier, Johan says – but also because with kayaks we can navigate narrow passages between islands that sail boats and other watercraft can’t. At times, we paddle through fields of high reeds, our route no more than the width of a footpath.We stop for lunch on another deserted island, feasting on a delicious fish stew made by Johan the night before. Mindful of leaving no trace in an archipelago where I’ve not seen a speck of single-use plastic all day, we check the spot for litter meticulously before we head off.View image in fullscreenEnjoying the peace on BullerönThe islands are beautiful, but they all look the same to me, so I’ve no idea how Johan is navigating so effectively – he only uses the GPS on his phone once, to check our final crossing to Idöborg as the wind picks up. We stash our kayaks in a sheltered sandy bay on the island and check into our cosy forest cabins, which have full A-frame views of the increasingly agitated ocean. Stockholm Adventures offers wild camping when the weather allows, but tonight I’m glad of a roof over my head.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It alsohas a saunafacing the water, with a wooden jetty that invites dipping in the soft, brackish water in between the waves of heat.When we enjoy it at dusk, the sea still has plenty of energy, but the next morning things are calmer. Our 2.5-mile paddle out to Bullerön, the main island of the Bullerö archipelago, and one of the last islands before the open sea, passes in an easy, meditative haze.The sun comes out, and we visit the former cottage and studio of the influential Swedish nature painter Bruno Liljefors, which now serves as an information centre for Nämdöskärgården, and walk the island’s stunning circuitous footpath. From the highest point, looking out east to the expanse of the Baltic Sea, it feels good to know this stretch of glistening ocean and all that lies beneath it will be protected.Steam baths and seaweed safaris on Sweden’s spa islandRead moreOver breakfast on Idöborg, I chat to Ylva Tenselius, a Stockholm resident and consultant here on a work team-building trip. When she was growing up, her grandfather used to go out and catch cod all the time. “We would groan and say, ‘No more cod,’ when it was served at the dinner table,” she says, adding that she used to catch perch easily herself with a line, but now both are far less common. She welcomes the new marine park and its conservation goals. “We’ve seen the changes and now it’s time to protect it.”When I get home to the UK, I call Charles Clover, co-founder ofBlue Marine Foundation, an ocean conservation charity, which is campaigning for bottom trawling to be banned from all UK marine protected areas, to ask what he thinks about Nämdöskärgården. “Anything that protects breeding grounds for fish is a positive step,” he says. “The sea is in such a bad state, particularly the Baltic Sea, so I think these protected areas will bring enormous benefits. They will help repair the sea and help nature help itself.”And he believes low-impact tourism, such as sea kayaking and hiking, can help with that process. “It creates a different use of nature, which is to enjoy it rather than to exploit, and that can only be a good thing.” I couldn’t agree more.This trip was provided byVisit Sweden.

So, how to rekindle your passion and purpose? Readers and experts share their best suggestionsAmmar KaliaTue 30 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 12.44 EDTShareAt some point in their career everyone experiences feeling unfulfilled at work. But withconfidence in the UK job market weakening, and competition for roles increasing, more people than ever are clinging to their positions, even if they have fallen out of love with their work. It’s a phenomenon that some have termed “job hugging”.If you find yourself prioritising a sense of security over ambition, and are unhappily sticking with your current role, is there a way you can weather the storm and even revitalise your passion for your job in the process? We spoke to career coaches, workplace psychologists and Guardian readers to find out.Remind yourself why you wanted the jobIt can be easy to lose sight of what originally drew you to your job when you are feeling dissatisfied or disengaged. Yet taking time to think about why you initially liked it can create a positive shift in your attitude and potentially give your working days more purpose.“People often struggle with being a small cog in a big machine and working to make rich people richer, but if you can think of who you’re personally helping every day and why you first joined up, that can help you to engage better,” says career coach Alice Stapleton says. “Focus on the daily impact of your work and the people you might be helping with your tasks rather than the bigger picture.”View image in fullscreenConsider the benefits.Photograph: Posed by model; Richard Drury/Getty ImagesThink about what work gives youIf your reasons for doing the job are elusive, it might be easier to focus instead on the tangible benefits it can bring. “Our careers can give us purpose but they also provide a salary, stability, routine, holidays and perhaps even a social side with your colleagues,” Stapleton says. “Once you think about the benefits your job gives you right now, you will be more energised.”Talk to your colleaguesView image in fullscreenCo-workers can become mentors.Photograph: Posed by models; Maria Korneeva/Getty Images“Going deeper with work colleagues rather than just asking ‘What did you do on the weekend?’ can bring huge benefits,” says career coach Dina Grishin. “Connect with colleagues from other departments and those you click with, since if you have someone at work who can be a safe harbour, it can really help change your mindset.”In a world that increasingly adoptsremote working, Grishin emphasises the need to “put yourself out there” and potentially learn from co-workers who could become mentors for career progression and change.View image in fullscreenSpace for a little benign misconduct?Photograph: Posed by models; Ivan Pantic/Getty ImagesFind fun momentsFor librarian and Guardian reader Tommy Vinh Bui, engaging in harmless fun with colleagues helped him overcome the burnout he had begun to feel at work. “Drumming up an appropriate amount of benign misconduct can help while away the time,” he says. “Sometimes, when the building is empty before closing time, I might build architecturally complex book igloos. Silliness today helps temper the drudgery of tomorrow. This eventually helped me reconnect with the purpose of my job, which is to help create a vibrant community hub.”Learn something new outside workView image in fullscreenFind a hobby outside work.Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty ImagesFeeling fulfilled away from your desk can have a positive impact on your work and help you feel as if you are progressing, even if your career might seem stagnant. “As humans, we always like to feel we’re growing and learning,” Stapleton says. “By picking up a new hobby, you can give yourself a sense of learning that can make things feel more bearable day to day.”For Guardian reader Maya Kawashima, joining the non-profitpublic speaking organisation Toastmastersnot only became a fun hobby but also gave her extra skills to use in her work as a teacher. “Thanks to Toastmasters, I now engage in clear and kind communication with my colleagues, family and friends,” she says. “By seeking skill sets outside work, you will always be honing your craft.”View image in fullscreenA change of remote workplace can help.Photograph: Posed by model; Maria Korneeva/Getty ImagesChange your surroundingsRemote working is becoming the norm in many industries, and a change of scenery can help you feel less stuck. “I signed up to the websiteTrusted Housesitters, which allows me to house-sit somewhere else for a week or two while working,” Grishin says. “It feels like a holiday, but it’s free, and you get to do your job in the same time zone in a new environment. It totally revitalises you.”Glow up your workspaceIf you can’t leave your desk, then Gretchen Spreitzer, professor of management and organisation at the University of Michigan suggests personalising your workspace. “I have pictures of my family on my desk and artefacts from companies I’ve visited. They are all booster shots of purpose that surround me when I’m in a difficult Zoom meeting,” she says. “They remind me that the work I do can be really meaningful. Even if you hot-desk, you can put an image on your screensaver to help remind you of that same sense of purpose.”View image in fullscreenA gratitude journal can lift the mood.Photograph: Posed by model; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesStart a journal“Keeping a gratitude diary can work really well when it feels as if you’re struggling,” Stapleton says. “At the end of the day, write down three things that you’re grateful for, or three things that went well. It can help you engage in the long term, as well as change your perspective to see how you’re still succeeding.”Grishin also suggests starting the day with three pages of stream-of-consciousness writing – a technique outlined inJulia Cameron’s book The Artist’s Way– to help you reconnect with your feelings and priorities. “You will find creativity and meaning within you,” she says. “It’s an amazing way to get more in touch with yourself and see what might need to shift at work for your experience to be better.”Focus on what you enjoyView image in fullscreenHome in on what works for you.Photograph: Posed by models; supersizer/Getty ImagesIt might sound straightforward, but reflecting on the elements of work you still like could help shift more of your daily tasks towards using those skills. “Most people don’t hate every part of their job and might be surprised at how they can move closer towards the tasks they do enjoy,” Stapleton says. “Maybe you can investigate cross-departmental work that gets you closer to projects you like, or have conversations with decision-makers to get a greater insight into building those skills.”View image in fullscreenJobcrafting gets the best out of you.Photograph: Posed by models; DMP/Getty ImagesTry to jobcraft …Once you have identified the elements of work you enjoy and the skill sets you would like to develop, look at how you could change the parameters of your job to skew it towards those aspects. Alison Gibbs, a business psychologist at Work Psychology Group, explains: “We call it jobcrafting, where individuals can proactively tailor their jobs to their strengths. It gives them a sense of being in control rather than being led by what the organisation is telling them to do. We can think of our jobs as being rigid, but often if you can have a frank conversation with your superiors about working towards your strengths, you might gain more flexibility in your role than you thought.”View image in fullscreenFigure out the priorities.Photograph: Posed by model; Maskot/Getty Images… Or taskcraftOn a smaller scale, Gibbs says that organising your to-do list of daily tasks can lead to a greater sense of fulfilment and job satisfaction long term. “Identify the few things you absolutely have to prioritise on your daily list of tasks. When you come to the end of the day and can see that you have achieved them, it will give you a boost, even if you don’t have much autonomy in your work,” she says. “By managing your stress in the moment on a micro level, it provides you with a greater sense of control and an easier day.”Apply your strengths in different waysIf you have been in the same job or career for some time, you might have lost track of your strengths and how best to keep nurturing them, Grishin explains. By taking a free strengths test, such asthe Institute on Character survey, employees can pursue what’s most important to them. “You might feel you’ve been coasting for a while but organisations often have a small learning or coaching budget you could access,” she says. “That would enable you to take courses or find conferences on the strengths you want to develop, and it will ultimately benefit you as well as your company.”Consider a sideways moveView image in fullscreenLeave the desk, not the employer.Photograph: Posed by model; Westend61/Getty ImagesLeaving your job for a new employer might be a tall order, but there could be the possibility of switching jobs within your existing company to find a role that allows for new challenges and skills. Guardian reader Mathilda Chenu, who works for a technology company, negotiated to move roles within her organisation after she explained that she didn’t have enough to do in her initial job and that frustrated her. “I moved to another team in the same institution and although it created a higher workload, it saved me from boredom,” she says. “I also met new colleagues, and working on new projects with them helped.”Reward yourself regularlyView image in fullscreenA little pat on the back does wonders.Photograph: Kseniya Ovchinnikova/Getty ImagesCareer coach Jo Maughan speaks of the importance of developing “nourishing rituals” that can make tough days seem easier. “When you’ve finished a task you didn’t want to do, get up and do something you like,” she says. “It could be making a cup of tea or chatting to a colleague, but it’s taking time to give yourself a reward that’s important.”By celebrating these small wins, we can give ourselves a greater sense of accomplishment, Gibbs adds. “When you get lost in the humdrum of work, you need to find those opportunities to pat yourself on the back,” she says. “You can’t rely on someone else to do it for you.”Solve problems togetherThere might be certain issues at work that can be tackled with the help of like-minded colleagues, rather than feeling as if the only solution is to change jobs. “It can be empowering and create an added sense of purpose if you can connect with colleagues over the shared problems you might face as a group,” Maughan says. “You could pitch solutions to your manager, and not only can it help galvanise your team, but it can showcase you as a go-getter.”Take control of your timeFor Guardian reader John Wilson, changing his perspective on how his life and work intersected led him to find greater fulfilment in his career in pharmaceuticals. “I realised it was more about how the job fits into your life rather than the other way around,” he says. “It’s easy to focus on the negatives when you focus just on your job alone, but looking at it as a portion of your week can allow you to see what other things you have space for. Take charge of your time; use your commute to read that book you’ve been meaning to start, since not every moment in the week has to be a salary-making opportunity.”View image in fullscreenConsideration goes a long way.Photograph: Posed by models; Klaus Vedfelt/Getty ImagesPerform acts of kindnessSaying thank you often, smiling and respecting others around you at work can help cut stress levels and anxiety and foster a better workplace culture. “Building acts of kindness into your everyday routine will help you to model the workplace environment that you want,” Gibbs says. “It’s basic human nature to seek out kindness and, when it’s reciprocated, it makes the workplace far easier to be in.”Change how you talk about work at homeThe way we recount our day to our family or friends once work is over can reinforce negatives and build a difficult narrative around our jobs. “It’s all about how you frame your day,” Spreitzer says. “I used to talk about the highs and lows of my day with my kids because it makes you go back and think about the things that have gone well, rather than only focusing on the negatives. It’s often harder to remember the good than the bad.”View image in fullscreenDon’t let the job consume your life.Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty ImagesDon’t make your job the centre of your world“There is such a thing as too much emphasis on your career,” Grishin says. “It’s dangerous to get fulfilment from work when it only functions as a status symbol, since that relationship can lead to burnout and it can have damaging consequences once things start to go wrong.” Developing a healthy social support network and hobbies or interests outside work can instead change your perspective on your career and create resilience if it begins to feel overwhelming or dissatisfying.Work on your exit planIf you have outgrown your current job but haven’t yet found the opportunity to leave, there is nothing stopping you from plotting an exit strategy. “Once you have figured out what you might want to do next, start thinking about upskilling or reskilling through further training or education,” Stapleton says. “Go to industry workshops or seminars and use that time to build up your network. It will beef up your CV and help you to find new opportunities. Humans are loyal, but you need to remember that in a lot of jobs you’re a bum on a seat and you have to make your own career.”Some people featured in the article responded to a Communitycallout.

It was the end of his childhood and the start of his fight for her life and legacyTue 30 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 11.54 EDTShareWhen Lee Lawrence’s son, Brandon, picked him up from hospital after a minor operation recently, Brandon thought he saw a car following them. Lawrence looked round and told his son he didn’t think it was anything to worry about. But then the car – which turned out to be an undercover police vehicle – put its siren on. It overtook them and did a hard stop. “I expected to see guns come out next,” says Lawrence. “I thought: ‘What the hell is going on?’ I got upset. My son was trying to calm me down, because I was thinking: ‘How could this be happening to my son?’”Lawrence was 11 when his mother, Cherry Groce, was shot and paralysed in 1985 by an armed police officer during a botched raid on her home. Community fury over Groce’s shooting would spark a two-day uprising in Brixton, southLondon.View image in fullscreen‘It’s important for me to say that my family’s experience is not a one-off situation’: Lee Lawrence in Brixton, south London, where he grew up.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianThe officers, says Lawrence, said they had reason to stop the car – but it turned out to be unfounded and they went on their way. Lawrence was distressed. “Brandon said to me: ‘Dad, I know you’re upset, I know it’s disheartening for you, but this is the reality for us.’ And it really dawned on me. Part of me felt like, what’s the point? Questioning what I’m doing.”In 2016, Lawrence founded the Cherry Groce Foundation. Part of his work there is to run training programmes for new police recruits and senior leaders, exposing racial bias, campaigning for greater diversity and for the power of restorative justice. He says his son being pulled over by the police was a sign that, “we have to do more. Don’t get complacent. There’s still a lot of work to do and you’re an integral part of that.”We meet in the Brixton office of the foundation, a short walk from the beautiful memorial to his mother, designed by the architect Sir David Adjaye. In 2020, Lawrence published his memoir,The Louder I Will Sing, about the impact of Groce’s paralysis on her and her family, and their continued fight for justice after her death in 2011. In 2014 an inquest ruled that multiple and serious police failures contributed to Groce’s death. Lawrence’s bookwent on to win the Costa prize, and he is about to publish his second book, The Colour of Injustice, a history of the overpolicing and under-protection of Britain’s Black community. His mother’s story is part of it. “Whenever I do a talk, or work with the Metropolitan police, it’s important for me to say that my family’s experience is not a one-off situation. There are many other cases, and some may not have got the attention they should have. It’s quite powerful when you see it all in one place.”View image in fullscreenLee Lawrence beside his mother’s memorial in Windrush Square, Brixton, south London.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianIt is. Lawrence identifies cases of racial prejudice, particularly in criminal justice, going back to the 1700s. He writes about Charles Wotten, the Black sailor who was chased by a mob through Liverpool and drowned as police watched, in 1919. He writes too aboutMahmood Mattan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and hanged in 1952. Dalian Atkinson was Tasered and kicked in the head by police during a mental health crisis when he desperately needed care in 2016. The multitude of stories of injustice, over our history until the present day, shows a pernicious pattern of racism. But it’s the contemporary statistics that are stark. Black people areseven times more likely to die after being restrained by police than white people, and are five times more likely to experience force during arrest. In some regions, Black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched, and Lawrence highlights that Black defendants are nearly16 times more likelyto face prosecution under“joint enterprise”laws, or being guilty by association. “I’m hoping that anyone who reads this will say: ‘OK, we can’t debate is it or isn’t it? It’s what are we going to do about it?’”Lawrence says his childhood ended the day his mother was shot. On the morning of 28 September 1985, he was sharing a room with his parents and sister, when they were woken by the sound of their front door being kicked down. Groce leapt out of bed, Lawrence heard a gunshot and then saw his mother on the floor with a man pointing his gun at her. Lawrence screamed at him to leave his mum alone, and the man turned the gun on him. More armed men appeared, and dogs. The family realised they were police.As a boy, Lawrence wanted to be a police officer. He loved watching cop shows – Starsky & Hutch, The Professionals. “I would look at those programmes and think: ‘I want to be catching the bad guys.’ There was something in me, I suppose, as a kid, that wanted to be that person to protect my community and do something meaningful and purposeful.” The police, he thought, stood for that.View image in fullscreenMahmood Mattan, who was wrongfully convicted and hanged for murder in 1952.Photograph: National archivesAfter the shooting, Groce would spend two years in hospital. Lawrence and his sisters were split up into temporary care. “You’re going back to school, and everybody is trying to act like nothing has happened. And you’re thinking: ‘Can’t anyone see?’” Later, when Groce moved to a bungalow with her younger children (Lawrence is one of six), he became her carer while still a young teenager. Groce was 37 when she was shot. Before this, she had been an energetic woman who loved dancing. Now, she was in pain and could no longer walk. While she remained defiant, it frustrated her to be so reliant on her children.Lawrence would make his mother breakfast, then take his sister to school before getting to school himself – usually late. “Not once again did anyone ask: ‘What’s going on? Can we support you?’ It was just met with punishment – detention, detention, detention – and then you become more rebellious, you just see school as another authority trying to suppress you.” For a time, he dealt drugs in his teens. “I had no idea about trauma and the impact it had on me, so I had all these feelings and anger issues and didn’t understand why.”Throughout his teenage years, all his contact with the police was negative. When he was arrested for riding on the back of a friend’s moped, which turned out to be stolen, the police officer called him a “monkey”. He lost count of the number of times he was stopped and searched. It wasn’t until decades later, after his mother’s inquest in 2014, that Lawrence felt able to build a relationship with the police. The family was invited to the passing out parade of new recruits, and Lawrence decided “to challenge myself” and go. “It was only then that I started to experience a different side of the police.”No one was held accountable for what happened to my mum. Nobody went to prison. Nobody was penalised in any wayHe had his first child at 21 (he would later have two more) and became an official carer for his mother after he left school, while also working in nightclubs and then as a black cab driver. He had therapy. “I still had the anger issues. I spent more than a year with somebody unpacking things, and it was only then that I realised what I was experiencing as an adult was linked to what I’d gone through as a child, all that trauma.” It helped him, he says, be mentally prepared to take on the battle after his mother died.One of the themes that emerges in his book is how rare it is for the police to be held accountable. Does that embolden bad behaviour? Yes, he says. “We speak about culture a lot within the Met and if officers are doing wrong and not being penalised for it, and some are actually being promoted for it, what type of culture is that fostering? That it’s OK to do the job with no integrity? What I’ve realised, being on the opposite side, is that there’s a damage-limitation perspective from the Met as an organisation.”After their mother died, Lawrence’s family were initially denied legal aid to fund lawyers at an inquest.A petition, which raised 130,000 signatures, helped to get that decision overturned. The jury at the inquest found multiple failures by the police. The Met apologised, but still didn’t accept liability – Lawrence and his family challenged that at the high court in 2016and won. “Justice didn’t come to us in the formal way, in the way we should expect,” says Lawrence. “The next alternative was looking at restorative justice, because no one was actually held accountable for what happened to my mum. Nobody went to prison, nobody was penalised in any way.” The 1987 trial of Douglas Lovelock, the man who pulled the trigger, found him not guilty. “So we shifted focus: what do we need to heal and reconcile, and how can we have a positive impact on the organisation? How do we hold them to account, and how can we be involved in that process around reform and culture change?”View image in fullscreen‘There are a lot of damaged people in our community’ … Lee  in Brixton.Photograph: Andy Hall/The GuardianAs well as compensation, the Met agreed to some of the family’s requests,but nearly a decade on, they are still to deliver on all their promises. One of these was to have an award in Groce’s name for an officer who shows exceptional community work. “Another thing we wanted to do was have something set up for people who have been traumatised as a result of bad policing. There are a lot of damaged people in our community, and they’re left with that negative impression of the police, and that spreads. One of the things we wanted to do was look at how we create a programme that supports people.”He remains optimistic that there will be change. “They have to, and they have – maybe not enough, but they have. The book highlights some of that too, and I want us to take strength from that.” His hope is placed less on overall organisational reform of the police and more “on individuals … That’s where my energy is focused. I’m not saying that’s the solution, that’s part of it.” He points out that at current recruiting rates, it will take another 30 years before the Met reflects the community it serves. For Black officers, “in terms of climbing up the ladder, it’s very difficult. There is racism within the Met, and towards Black officers. I have seen that there are officers, particularly Black officers, who need more support, and more support from the community as well. I’m trying to look at how we do that.”View image in fullscreenLee with his mother, Cherry, and son, Brandon, at his wedding in 2006.Photograph: Courtesy Lee LawrenceThat his book is coming out as the UK struggles with anti-immigrant rhetoric, and far-right rallies, makes it even more necessary. “I just think: here we go again. We’re in the cycle. It’s propaganda that’s put out there to turn us against each other. What I hope is that we recover from that quicker before any kind of irreparable damage is caused.” If we don’t pay attention, he says, “history will repeat itself. To break that cycle, there needs to be more awareness of things that have happened in the past, so when we see those familiar patterns, we can act with more urgency around making change.”Witnessing his son’s experience with the police earlier this year – and having a deeper conversation about it, during which Lawrence discovered that his son is careful to carry all his ID and paperwork with him whenever he is driving “so he’s not leaving anything to chance” – has intensified his mission.After the acquittal of the man who shot her, Lawrence remembers his mum saying the police were a force, and you can’t beat a force. But he never accepted that. It’s the same when he sees the impact on his son. “I understood why she said that. For her it was about survival. She had to focus on raising us children. That battle wasn’t for my mum. It was my battle, to fight for her. She needed to fight to survive, and I’ve had to fight to make sure that what happened to her was acknowledged, and that we use that now for change.”The Colour of Injustice: Stories of the Fight Against Prejudice and the Law is published by Little, Brown (£22).

Kabila, who led the country from 2001 to 2019, has denied wrongdoing and said the judiciary had been politicised.Lt Gen Joseph Mutombo Katalayi, presiding over the tribunal in Kinshasa, said Kabila had been found guilty of charges that included murder, sexual assault, torture and insurrection.Kabila did not attend the trial and was not represented by legal counsel. Neither he nor his representatives were immediately available for comment. His whereabouts were not immediately known.“In applying article 7 of the military penal code,[the court] imposes a single sentence, namely the most severe one, which is the death penalty,” Katalayi said while delivering the verdict.Kabila was also ordered to pay about $50bn (£36bn) in damages to the state and victims.The verdict could fuel further divisions in the vast mineral-rich central African country, which has endured decades of conflict.Who are the M23 rebels and why is there fighting in eastern DRC?Read moreKabila spent almost 20 years in power andstepped down only after deadly protests against him. He has been living mostly in South Africa since 2023, but appeared in the rebel-held city of Goma in eastern DRC in May.He entered in to an awkward power-sharing deal with his successor, Felix Tshisekedi, but their relationship soon soured.As M23 rebels marched on eastern DRC’s second-largest city of Bukavu in February, Tshisekedi told the Munich security conference that Kabila had sponsored the insurgency.M23 now controls much of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. The fighting has killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more this year. The two sides signed a US-brokered peace agreement in June, but they are both reinforcing their positions and blaming one another for flouting the accord, sources have said.Rwanda, which has long denied helping M23, says its forces act in self-defence against DRC’s army and ethnic Hutu militia members linked to the 1994 genocide.Tshisekedi’s government has moved to suspend Kabila’s political party and seize its leaders’ assets.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, said the vote by 12 security council members to “transform the multinational security support (MSS) mission to the new gang suppression force, a mission five times the size of its predecessor” showed the “international community was sharing the burden”.Washington co-sponsored the enlargement push with Panama.Currently 1,000 officers, mostly from Kenya, are deployed in Haiti under the security mission aimed at supporting the Haitian police in their fight againstrampant gang violence, but it has had mixed results.“Every day, innocent lives are snuffed out by bullets, fire and fear,” Laurent Saint-Cyr, who heads the Haitian Transitional Presidential Council, told the UN’s signature diplomatic gathering last week. “Entire neighbourhoods are disappearing, forcing more than a million people into internal exile and reducing to nothing memories, investments and infrastructure.“This is the face of Haiti today, a country at war, a contemporary Guernica, a human tragedy on America’s doorstep,” he added.View image in fullscreenDebris in a street in Port-au-Prince.Photograph: Clarens Siffroy/AFP/Getty ImagesSaint-Cyr had thrown his support behind the US and Panamanian proposal to evolve the mission into a more resilient force for an initial period of one year. “The council can help restore peace in a nation currently suffocated by merciless gangs,” Panama’s ambassador to the UN, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, said ahead of the vote.Kenya’s president, William Ruto, said last week that “with the right personnel, adequate resources, appropriate equipment and necessary logistics, Haiti’s security can be restored”.UN condemns reported Haitian village massacre by armed gangsRead moreThe boost in force will be accompanied by the creation of a support office within the UN, suggested several months ago by the secretary general, António Guterres, to provide the required logistical and financial support.The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, said last week: “This mandate would empower the force to proactively target gangs and restore security to Haiti while ensuring it has the appropriate tools to succeed the mission’s anticipated objectives.”China had expressed scepticism about the role of the mission without political transition in Haiti and abstained during the vote to create it in 2023, as did Russia. Beijing and Moscow abstained again on Tuesday’s vote.Russia and China were both critical of Washington, accusing it of failing to stop an illicit flow of weapons to Haiti from the US and not providing enough funding for the initial mission. They also said the US had rushed through a resolution that was ambiguous on several critical issues, including rules of engagement.“Let us be frank, if that contributor failed to provide the promised funds for the MSS, what guarantees are there that things will be different with this new mission?” said Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, describing the money needed for Haiti as very modest compared to the billions of dollars spent by countries to send weapons to Ukraine.He also echoed concern raised by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Saturday about how the US could interpret the gang suppression force mandate. The resolution adopted on Tuesday authorises countries taking part to take all necessary measures to carry out its mandate, meaning the use of force.“We have no certainty that the authors of today’s text will not come up with some kind of – quote, unquote – creative way to link their military activity to allegedly combating drug cartels,” Nebenzia said.The poorest country in theAmericas, Haiti has long suffered at the hands of violent criminal gangs that commit murders, rapes, looting and kidnappings against a backdrop of chronic political instability.The situation has worsened significantly since early 2024, when gangs drove then-prime minister, Ariel Henry, to resign. The country, which has not held elections since 2016, has since been led by a transitional presidential council.Explore more on these topicsHaitiUnited NationsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

A tonne of the drug was recovered after one of the trailers overturned during a high-speed chase, and the remainder of the seizure was discovered the following day, hidden under a tarpaulin on a nearby beach, police said.The alleged crew of the sub – a Colombian man and two Ecuadorians – were later arrested “after trying to evade officers by fleeing in a taxi in wet clothes, pretending to be pilgrims”, according to a police statement. Their soaking and suspicious appearance caught the attention of the taxi driver and they were arrested by local police, who found a wetsuit in one of their rucksacks.The sub itself is thought to have wrecked or been scuttled a few miles off the coast of Galicia.As well as seizing 3.65 tonnes of cocaine and arresting the 14 people on suspicion of drug-trafficking and belonging to a criminal organisation, the Policía Nacional has confiscated €54,680 (£47,700), two boats, five cars and a trailer.Antonio Martínez Duarte, the head of the Policía Nacional’s drug and organised crime unit, said it was rare for officers to be able to intercept cocaine shipments when they first reached land.“After hours of sacrifice and silent work, we’ve been able to arrest the crew and seize the drugs on land, something that isn’t that common in Galicia,”he told La Voz de Galicia.“The problem in Galicia is getting into these places which they know and which we don’t, and where they can drive in the dark and we can’t. But this time we were there, watching how they carried out an operation. And we managed to get them when they took off.”Althoughnarco-subs had been used regularly in Colombiaand other parts of South and Central America for more than 30 years, they remained a novelty in European waters until 2019, when the first such vessel, laden with three tonnes of cocaine,was found scuttled in a Galician cove.Spanish police say the number of “narco-sub” alerts hassurged over the summer, from one every three months to more than five a month.Explore more on these topicsSpainDrugs tradeEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He had denied the charges.The court in Dresden heard he had collected personal information about top AfD figures, including its leaders, Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla, as well as keeping watch on Chinese dissidents in Europe.Sentencing Guo to four years and nine months in prison, the presiding judge, Hans Schlüter-Staats, told him: “There is no question that you were an employee of a Chinese intelligence service.”A female Chinese accomplice, identified only as Yaqi X in line with German privacy laws, received a suspended sentence of one year and nine months.She admitted to having given Guo information about flights, cargo and passengers from the Leipzig/Halle airport where she worked. In particular, the information had focused on the transport of military vehicles, troops and military drones, the court heard.Krah, 47, told the court he had employed Guo on the basis of his language skills and experience of running an import-export firm. Following Guo’s arrest, he said, he had “taken the necessary steps and significantly increased the security in my office”.View image in fullscreenMaximilian Krah is being investigated on suspicion of bribery and money laundering in connection with payments he is alleged to have received from China when he was an MEP.Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/ReutersThe MP said he was not surprised by the prison sentence and had welcomed the trial, which had helped him to gain more clarity about people he said “of whom I have become a victim”.Separately, Dresden’s public prosecutor’s office is investigating Krah on suspicion of bribery and money laundering in connection with payments he is alleged to have received from China when he was an MEP.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The damage added to tensions over the war inUkraineseven months after Russia’s full-scale invasion, and worsened an energy crisis as European countries attempted to wean themselves off Russian supplies.The suspect’s lawyer, Tymoteusz Paprocki, on Tuesday confirmed the arrest to the Polish broadcaster TVN24. “In the early hours my client was detained in a town near Warsaw as a result of a European arrest warrant, which was issued by Germany and pertains to matters related to Nord Stream 2.”He said he was ready to argue on his client’s behalf that no Ukrainian could rightfully be held criminally responsible for attacks on the pipelines, since the proceeds from gas sent through Nord Stream 2 were intended to help finance Moscow’s war effort, as those from Nord Stream 1 had been for years.Nord Stream 2 never went into operation. It had been built to carry Russian gas beneath the Baltic Sea to Europe, but Germany halted its certification process in February 2022over Moscow’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukrainebefore its invasion. It has remained out of use.The Russian government said it can be repaired, even as Germany has ruled out bringing it into operation.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Tuesday that Russia hoped Germany would complete its investigation into the explosions, for which, he said, Moscow blamed Kyiv.Initially, many assumed Russia was behind the attack. But German investigators have since identified a Ukrainian group of five men and a woman who they believe were responsible.Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, has said his government knew nothing about any plan to blow up the pipelines and denied responsibility.German prosecutors said if the man is extradited, he will be brought before an investigating judge at the federal court in Karlsruhe. The case is diplomatically awkward as Ukraine has been backed by Germany against Russia with and weapons.Last month another Ukrainian, Serhii Kuznietsov, 49, wasarrested while on holiday in Italyon the basis of a European warrant. An Italian court ordered he be extradited to Germany to face charges related to the Nord Stream attack.Kuznietsov is believed to have forged identity papers to charter a yacht through intermediaries, from which the attacks were carried out near the Danish island of Bornholm.Explore more on these topicsUkrainePolandEuropeGermanyRussiaNord Stream 1 pipelineNord Stream 2 pipelinenewsShareReuse this content"

This is an unwinnable fight for him, long-term. It’s not going to happen.”Asked about the recent incidents involvingRussiain Europe, he appears to signal his support for the idea of shooting Russian drones or jets crossing into Nato airspace.He says:“The way you respond to something like this, from a military background, I would say sometimes you raise what is called the risk level to do it.I will give you a good example. …A few years ago, 2015, the Russians had a Russian fighter invade Turkish airspace. What did the Turks do? They shot it down.Okay,that will get you attention really fast,won’t it?Now, that’s what I mean about raising your risk level. I know it’s the dangerous thing to do. I’ve got it. I understand that. But sometimes you have to ask yourselves, where do you go? …Look, this is serious business. For those of you sitting in uniform in this room, you know that.”He specifically references Poland’s foreign ministerRadosław Sikorski’sspeech at the UN security council, in which he warned Russia thatPolandwould shoot any jets down in the future.“– So the Russians have been warned?– I think they have.”1:32Yvette Cooper says UK will confront Russian planes in Nato airspace – videoPressed about how to get to a trilateral meeting between Zelenskyy, Putin and Trump,Kelloggsays“the way you reach [it], sort of like what Ukraine is doing right now, is you make this almost cost prohibitive.”He says thatUkraine is making progress on that target by “hitting the refineries,which cut 20% of their oil production down.”“We are working on people not buying … on secondary sanctions … on buying their oil. Unfortunately, some inEuropeare still buying it.”He argued that Russia “is a petrostate, and if you take away the petrodollars, they have got an enormous problem.”“I think the calculus is on Putin, … and basically the pain level he is willing to accept,” he says, pointing to Russia’s growing frontline problems with the Russian army “taking tanks out of museums to bring into the frontlines.”“I think we don’t need to draw any more red lines.

At least 31 Palestinians were killed across Gaza on Tuesday, local hospitals said.Asked how longHamashad to respond, Trump said on Tuesday: “We’re going to do about three or four days.” He later warned that Hamas would face severe consequences if they refused.“We have one signature that we need, and that signature will pay in hell if they don’t sign,” Trump told US generals and admirals gathered at a military base in Quantico, Virginia. The president has already made clear that he would supportIsraelcontinuing the war if Hamas rejects the proposal, or reneges on the deal at any stage.During Monday’s press conference in Washington, Netanyahu told Trump that “if Hamas rejects your plan … or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself”. Trump said Israel would have his “full backing” in such circumstances.In Israel, media and politicians broadly welcomed Netanyahu’s announcement that he supported the 20-point plan, which meets many of Israel’s principal demands.The plan calls for the disarmament of Hamas and bans it from any future political role inGaza, which would be run by a technocratic transitional authority headed by Trump himself. It requires the militant Islamist organisation to release the 48 Israeli hostages it still holds – of whom fewer than half are thought still to be alive – within 72 hours of a ceasefire coming into effect, but offers the gradual withdrawal of Israeli military forces to a buffer zone along the perimeter and a surge in humanitarian aid, desperately needed by the 2.3 million inhabitants of the devastated territory.Gaza would then be run by a postwar transitional authority staffed by apolitical technocrats but headed by Trump himself.In a video statement posted on his Telegram channel after his joint press conference with Trump, Netanyahu stressed that the Israeli military would stay in most of Gaza, and that he had not agreed to a Palestinian state during his talks with the US president. “We will recover all our hostages, alive and well, while the [Israeli military] will remain in most of the Gaza Strip,” he said.Hamas has not issued its response, with its officials only saying they are reviewing the proposal, which will be discussed internally and with allied Palestinian armed factions.A Hamas source told Agence France-Presse that the group had “begun a series of consultations within its political and military leaderships, both insidePalestineand abroad”, which would “take several days due to the complexities of communication among leadership members and movements”.The proposal requires Israel to release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including many serving life sentences.Turkey, Egypt and Qatar have backed the plan and may be able to put pressure on Hamas, analysts said. A Qatari official said Qatar would be meeting Hamas and Turkey on Tuesday to discuss the plan.Trump’s peace proposal welcomed by world leaders but Palestinians remain scepticalRead moreThe Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but could eventually take on some kind of a role in a postwar Gaza government, welcomed Trump’s “sincere and determined efforts”.However, Palestinian factions allied with Hamas appeared to reject the plan initially, according to local media reports, and a source close to Hamas told Reuters it was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group.Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally, said the plan would encourage further aggression against Palestinians. “Through this, Israel is attempting – via the United States – to impose what it could not achieve through war,” the group said in a statement.In Israel, many commentators welcomed the proposal and those usually supportive of Netanyahu were careful to highlight last-minute concessions they said the Israeli prime minister had obtained.View image in fullscreenIsraelis marching earlier this month in Jerusalem in a demonstration organised by the families of the hostages in Gaza.Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty ImagesFar-right ministers, however, have vowed to quit the ruling coalition if Netanyahu halts Israel’s offensive in Gaza without achieving “total victory” or securing the territory for Israeli settlement. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s finance minister, said the plan was a “resounding diplomatic failure” that would “end in tears”.Dr Ofer Guterman, an analyst at the Institute of National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said Israel had changed its “paradigm” and now saw Arab states as potential partners. “Israel’s strategy had until now been based on a clash between Israel and Hamas to be handled basically through a military effort,” he said.Foreign leaders, painfully aware of the failure of multiple previous ceasefire efforts, rushed to offer support on Tuesday.Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Trump’s plan was the “best chance for ending the war” while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, welcomed the US president’s “commitment to ending the war in Gaza and securing the release of all hostages”. Moscow also backed the proposal.Pakistan, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt on Tuesday issued a joint statement supporting Trump’s plan, and saying they were ready to work constructively with the US and others to secure peace.The plan would in effect place Gaza under international control, deploy an international security force, likely composed of Arab or Muslim troops supplied by a regional power, to keep order and install a “board of peace”, headed by Trump and possibly including the former British prime minister Tony Blair, to oversee the administration and reconstruction.What’s in Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza?Read moreThe international security force would also train Palestinian police to take over law enforcement.In Gaza, Israeli tanks advanced further into Gaza City amid intensive bombardment of residential districts there, while al-Awda hospital said Israeli troops opened fire, killing 17 Palestinians and wounding 33 others while they were attempting to access humanitarian aid in Netzarim, the Israeli-controlled corridor that bisects northern and southern Gaza.An Israeli strike later in the day killed four people in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp, the hospital said. Israeli forces also hit two tents housing displaced Palestinian families in Muwasi, the crowded coastal area.One of the strikes killed seven people, including four women and a child, who had fled from Gaza City earlier this month to escape Israel’s intensifying offensive there, al-Aqsa hospital said.The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the shooting or strikes. It said in a statement that over the past 24 hours, its troops killed several armed militants and struck more than 160 targets, including weapons storage facilities and observation posts.Deaths caused by hunger and malnutrition in Gaza have increased to 453, including 150 children, health authorities say. Famine was declared in parts of the territory last month.The war began after Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,219 people, mostly civilians, and in which more than 250 hostages were taken.Israel’s offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed 66,055 Palestinians, also mostly civilians. More than 160,000 are thought to have been injured.Explore more on these topicsGazaHamasIsraelPalestineDonald TrumpUS foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Blair’s role from the beginning was somewhat toothless, focused largely on economic development, and Palestinian officials complained he was more sympathetic toIsrael.Even in the year before he became Quartet envoy, Blair’s actions were seen by some as contributing to what would become two decades of crisis inGazathat followed elections in 2006.That vote was won by Hamas, at a time when the group seemed more open to political engagement, but Blair sided with Bush and Israel in rejecting the results. He supported a boycott of Hamas, allowing Fatah to continue in power in the Palestinian Authority, although he would later meet Hamas leaders.That boycott contributed to the frictions that culminated in Hamas’s violent takeover of Gaza in 2008.Blair belatedly conceded in 2017that the international community should have tried to “pull Hamas into a dialogue” but his subsequent actions raised further scepticism.Xavier Abu Eid, a former official in the PLO’s diplomatic negotiations team, said: “When he became the Quartet envoy, some people believed because he had come from [being British prime minister] he would take the job seriously and progress would be made.“His attitude became clear when Palestinians requested his help with issues like Israeli home demolitions. He would say I have a political mandate. But then in 2011 whenPalestinewent to the UN to ask for recognition and membership, it became clear he was lobbying against it.”Blair remains beyond the pale for many in the Labour party because of Iraq and it is not clear how much support his angling for a role in Gaza enjoys with Keir Starmer’s government.The best that David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, could offer when asked about Blair’s draft plan for postwar Gaza at a Labour conference fringe event was that he didn’t have “a clue” about it.Blair’s worldview, say critics, is dominated by his belief that Islamist extremism is the world’s top security threat. The flip side of that, they say, has been to gloss over the human rights abuses of regimes in the Gulf he sees as allies.Over the years, Blair has rubbed shoulders with autocrats including Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Egypt’s Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, saying Egypt’s army had “no choice” but to overthrow the democratically elected government of Mohamed Morsi.Blair told the Jewish Chronicle in 2020: “There is a new and emerging leadership in the Middle East that really wants to modernise their countries to make sure that religion isn’t abused and turned into a political ideology. That is the single biggest gamechanger for the Middle East.”But even if Blair and his institute remain supporters of a two-state solution, the direction of his advocacy appears to have been overtaken by the brutal reality of a war in which Israel has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza.Josh Paul, a co-founder of A New Policy, a US thinktank, said before the leaking of Blair’s draft proposal:“Having worked withTony Blairwhen he was Quartet special envoy for Middle East peace, I can warn immediately of the two fatal flaws any plan he proposes will have.“First, anything proposed will prioritise economic development over political progress and Palestinian self-determination. As multiple failed efforts along these lines in the West Bank have demonstrated, economic success depends on Palestinian self-rule and basic freedoms of movement and enterprise, not the other way around.“And second, whatever their merits, they will be endorsed by the government of Israel which will then prevent their implementation through a strategy of death by a thousand cuts – making even simple objectives unobtainable.“Blair’s effort is a distraction that is founded on a fundamental misunderstanding of the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic and the political economy of occupied Palestine.”Explore more on these topicsGazaTony BlairMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsraelIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

It could be me or Abu Shabab or anyone else, but alternatives today exist.“I’m sorry, I will work with the devil himself if it helps me to protect my city. [Hamas] must leave Gaza,” Astal told the Guardian last week.The proliferation of armed militias in Gaza is causing further problems for aid organisations already struggling with Israeli restrictions and massive logistic obstacles.An official with a major aid agency operating in Gaza said they had not “heard from the de facto authority” – a euphemism for Hamas – since March and were now dealing with a “variety of different actors”.“In the north there is nobody in charge, in the central area there are some really powerful families and some small informal militia … and in the south you have formalised Israeli clients who get weapons and so on from the Israeli military,” they said. “Law and order is deteriorating, the social fabric is falling apart and people are really desperate and in survival mode and it is becoming everyone for themselves.”Many such armed groups have a record of looting aid or extorting protection payments from humanitarian organisations as well as from other Palestinians living in Gaza.In arecent report, the independent conflict monitor Acled said that since October 2023, it had recorded more than 220 “intra-Palestinian violent incidents that have resulted in the deaths of around 400 Palestinians”. Victims included police officers, clan and gang leaders, thieves, anti-Hamas activists, individuals accused of collaborating with Israel and merchants accused of profiteering, Acled said.“Looting of aid, theft, and violent activity by gangs, clans, and armed groups have become widespread,” the report noted, adding that nearly 70% of such incidents occurred after a two-month ceasefire was broken by Israel in March 2025.Israeli forces have systematically targeted local police officers and officials, whom they consider part of Hamas, which took power in Gaza in 2007 and ran the territory’s interior ministry.The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and reduced much of the territory to ruins. In August, famine was declared in parts of northern Gaza.Hamas has sought to fight against the gangs and militia, forming special units which target looters and collaborators. In June, Hamas was reported to have killed50 fightersfrom the Popular Forces. Two weeks ago, Hamas ambushed a group of militia-men in the north of Gaza and killed several, one Palestinian analyst said. There are also regular reports of public executions of “collaborators” by Hamas.Astal, 50, denied any direct support from Israel and said his pregnant daughter and many relatives had been killed by Israeli airstrikes, which he said proved that he was not a “collaborator”.“We are not fighting Hamas for Israel, but for ourselves … Today, I have the opportunity so I should take it. I don’t mind signing a peace deal with Israel, because we have had enough wars and a lot of my people are dying every year. I’m 50 years old. Since I was born we have been having wars,” he told the Guardian.The Times of Israelreportedthat Astal worked inside Israel for years before joining the Palestinian Authority’s security forces, which were forced out of Gaza by Hamas when the Islamist militant organisation seized power in 2007. He was later imprisoned multiple times by Hamas, the newspaper said.It is unclear how many armed men Astal can deploy, and Abu Shabab’s Popular Forces are thought to comprise less than 100 fighters. There are reports of other armed groups, sometimes only a dozen or so strong, forming in eastern Gaza City and the so-called “central camps” around Nuseirat.Yaakov Amidror, a former major general and national security adviser, said last week Israel could exploit divisions within Gaza’s society to build forces that would oppose Hamas. One possibility would be to support major families who are descendants of original inhabitants of the territory against others whose parents or grandparents arrived in 1948, when forced to flee what became Israel.“They can be the local strong people and take control of their area, family or tribe and not let Hamas be there, and then we can support them and if they can be part of the solution then [that’s] great … If the worse comes to the worse it will be like Somalia … No one will be in control. It will be bad for Israel but better than having Hamas,” Amidror said.UnderTrump’s 20-point Gaza plan, outlined on Monday, a council of technocrats would run the territory and a “temporary international stabilisation force”, possibly composed of troops provided by regional powers, would maintain order in Gaza. But such a force might struggle in such a chaotic environment.What’s in Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza?Read moreAnalysts have warned that empowering groups such as Astal’s in an already highly-fractured society could accelerate internal conflict and strengthen criminal elements.“Without strict oversight, they could even morph into rogue actors who fuel instability rather than mitigate it,” wroteNeomi Neumann,an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute and former head of the research unit at Israel domestic security service, Shin Bet, earlier this year.Astal said he was not frightened by Hamas, who had sentenced him to death.“They are trying to take me down and I know this, but I don’t care,” he told the Guardian.The war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, of whom about 50 remain in Gaza, about 20 of them thought to be alive.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineHamasIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The measures also affect telephone lines, as they are often routed over the internet.High-speed connections to some provinces were cut in mid-September to“prevent immorality”, on the orders of the supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.On Monday night, mobile phone signal and internet servicegradually weakened nationwideuntil connectivity was less than 1% of ordinary levels, according to the internet watchdog NetBlocks. On Tuesday, internet and telephone services continued to be down.“We are blind without phones and internet,” said Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul. “All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It’s like a holiday; everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.”While officials have previously blocked access to social media or restricted access to the internet, it was the first time the Taliban government had cut communications across the whole country.‘It kept our spirits alive’: Taliban’s internet blackout leaves girls in despairRead moreThe administration offered no immediate explanation for the blackout, although in recent weeks it has voiced concern about pornography online. Rights groups say the regime is instead trying to disconnect Afghans from the world to suppress the population.Fereshta Abbasi, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who focuses onAfghanistan, said cutting off access to the internet deprived millions of Afghans of their livelihoods and fundamental rights to education, healthcare and access to information. “The Taliban,” she said, “should drop its excuses about morality and instead focus on how these shutdowns are causing irreversible harm.”The UN mission to Afghanistan, Unama, warned the disconnection “risks inflicting significant harm on the Afghan people, including by threatening economic stability and exacerbating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises”.The Taliban regime has enforced strict restrictions on women and freedom of expression, including purging books written by women from the country’s universities, blockinggirls from studying and women from working, and even banning chess, which it said encouraged gambling.In the minutes before Monday’s blackout happened, a government official warned the Agence France-Presse news agency that the fibre-optic network would be cut, also affecting mobile phone services.View image in fullscreenMen trying to connect their smart TV to the internet amid the telecom shutdown in Kabul.Photograph: Sayed Hassib/Reuters“Eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be shut down, he said, adding that the blackout would last “until further notice”.“There isn’t any other way or system to communicate … The banking sector, customs, everything across the country will be affected,” said the official, who asked not to be named.The Taliban leader reportedly ignored warnings from some officials earlier this month about the economic fallout of cutting the internet, and ordered authorities to press ahead with a nationwide ban.A UN source said: “Operations are severely impacted, falling back to radio communications and limited satellite links.”On 16 September, the Balkh provincial spokesperson Attaullah Zaid said the ban had come from the Taliban leader’s orders. “This measure was taken to prevent vice, and alternative options will be put in place across the country to meet connectivity needs,” he wrote on social media.At the time, the same restrictions were applied in the northern provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar, as well as in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand, Nangarhar in the east and the central province of Uruzgan.NetBlocks, which monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, said the blackout appeared “consistent with the intentional disconnection of service”.Telephone services are often routed over the internet, sharing the same fibre-optic lines, especially in countries with limited telecoms infrastructure.In 2024, Kabul had touted the 9,350km (5,800-mile) national fibre-optic network – largely built by former US-backed governments – as a “priority” to bring the country closer to the rest of the world and lift it out of poverty.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanInternetTelecomsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Often the cost is split into three monthly instalments, and if someone keeps to their repayment plan, they will not usually pay interest or charges.However, regulators and consumer bodies have long voiced concerns about the sector’s rapid growth, amid worries that some people could end up taking out loans they cannot afford to pay back on time, thereby incurring charges and tipping them into debt.This summer the Financial Conduct Authorityoutlined details of its plansto regulate the £13bn BNPL market, which could require lenders to carry out affordability checks on even the smallest loans.Younger people, particularly those in their 20s and 30s, remain the most frequent users – fuelled by BNPL providers targeting them via social media ads.However, the biggest growth in user numbers occurred among 55- to 64-year-olds.“In this age group, the proportion of BNPL users more than doubled from 10% in 2023 to 21% in 2024,” the report said.Other surveys have noted an increase in demand among older people, with some of this attributed tothose on tight budgets using BNPLto spread out payments for essentials. There has been speculation that for those familiar with old-style interest-free credit and hire purchase, this newer type of credit does not necessarily carry a stigma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, the “vast majority” of consumers reported using one (or more) of three brands – Klarna, Clearpay or PayPal – suggesting that those companies dominate the UK market.The report also found that, as digital options became more widespread, cash use “continued its long-term decline” in 2024. For the first time, cash accounted for less than 10% of all payments. Meanwhile, 30% of adults – 16.9 million people – used cash once a month or less.UK Finance also said there had been a “surge” in the use of mobile wallets for online and contactless payments, and more than half of UK adults (57%) used wallets last year – up from 42% the year before.Explore more on these topicsBuy now, pay laterFinancial sectorBorrowing & debtnewsShareReuse this content"

They were outvoted by a majority of MPC members who said a slowdown in economic growth would support a fall in inflation over the next year to 2% from a likely peak of 4% in September.Reeves said at the Labour conference that the economic stability provided by the government meant ministers could take some credit for five cuts to interest rates over the last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said on Tuesday it was unlikely that the strength of inflation this year would persist into 2026.She said: “The good news is that this ‘hump’ reflects external shocks, and in the current environment it is unlikely, in my judgment, to lead to additional inflationary pressures.“Moreover, I have not seen any evidence yet to suggest that the underlying disinflationary process from past shocks is veering off track.

But the number of toads hopping through British grasslands, forests and gardens has almost halved in a generation.“Vast numbers of toads are being lost every year,” said Silviu Petrovan, a senior researcher at the University of Cambridge, who was lead author on the study showing just how uncommon the common toad is becoming.Their decline mirrors that of many other domestic species in the UK, where thecollapse in the natural world is acceleratingto runaway speed as desperate calls for conservationconflict with strident demands for growth.“The base-level population is much lower than it was even in the 1980s – and the decline is ongoing, confirming that we need to urgently act to protect this much-loved and once-common species before it’s too late,” Petrovan said.The analysis was based on data from counts of amphibians by “toad patrol” volunteers, who collect and count toads, frogs and sometimes newts from the start to the end of the creatures’ spring breeding migrations, typically between March and April.They found that between 1985 and 2021, the populations of toads counted by the toad patrols had fallen by 41% in the UK. Similar counts carried out in Switzerland showed the abundance of toads there had fallen by a third since 1973.The study focused on trend estimation rather than the reasons for the decline, but the researchers speculated that road traffic was a major driver, combined with loss of ponds, increased urbanisation and the decline of the beetles, earthworms and slugs that toads feed on. In 1908, when Kenneth Grahame published the Wind in the Willows and Mr Toad fell head over heels in love with the motor car (“poop poop!”), he could never have known that decades later there would be millions racing up and down the roads of England, squashing his relatives one by one.Petrovan said: “The situation toads are facing in Britain probably reflects what’s happening both in the wider rural landscape in Britain but also in Europe, too, and thanks to our partners in Switzerland we now understand how toads are faring overseas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The cuts are part of the sweeping spending billTrump signedin July.Areportthis month by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted “some low-income families will see their food assistance terminated or cut substantially (or will be denied benefits) this fall, though most current participants will face cuts when their SNAP eligibility is next recertified,” with estimates that 4 million Americans in a typical month will lose some or all of their Snap benefits when the cuts are fully implemented.America’s new wave of hunger is here. A Maine food bank is tackling it head onRead moreA Snap recipient in Camden county, New Jersey, who works as a cake decorator at a small business and requested to remain anonymous, said their Snap benefits were cut off in September without receiving a notice.“Snap was my way to finally not pay half to three-quarters of my paycheck on groceries. Now, I have nothing in my house regularly and it just feels like no one wants to help people any more,” they said. “I only got a little over $110 a month, but it helped tremendously.”They said it’s made it more difficult to work at a job they love, but that doesn’t pay enough.Jessica Griffin of Fort Smith, Arkansas, a mother of three, said she lost her job about five months ago and has struggled to find another, with her family relying on her husband’s income.After rent and utility bills, there isn’t much left over to buy groceries and she doesn’t have reliable transportation to get to food banks, she said.“I used to be able to buy $100 worth of groceries a week to feed a family of five, now even with one child out of the house $100 will only go a couple days,” she said. “The rent rates are so high now as well as groceries that families can barely afford to feed their kids and keep a roof over their heads at the same time. So it almost feels like we have two options, to either live in a house or live on the street and not starve.”View image in fullscreenVolunteers organize donations at the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, a food bank which has been part of the backbone of the nation’s anti-hunger system, in Grove City, Ohio, on 9 May 2025.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersFunding cutsto states, which will be expected to share costs of Snap for the first time as well as cover more administrative costs, are phased for fiscal years 2027 and 2028, but several provisions and changes to Snap are being implemented as states have to grapple with drastic costs shifted on to them from the federal government.“States don’t have enough administrative staff or capacity to handle this,” said Gina Plata-Nino, interim Snap director at the Food Research and Action Center. “I think we’re on a downward path.Pollingand data is showing that one of the biggest obstacles that people are having in being able to eat is just how expensive food is at the moment. This is a direct result of tariffs and other policy choices that the administration has made. It’s something that everyone, regardless of income, can understand.”The looming Snap cuts come as food prices are still rising under theTrump administrationand are expected to continue rising due to tariffs and labor shortages in the food industry due to Trump’s immigration policies.From January 2022 to August 2025, overall food cost in the US increased by about17.8%, according the consumer price index, and has increased 2.0% since January 2025, when Trump took office. Trump’s tariffs areexpectedto drive further increases, with food prices set to rise 3.4% in the short term and stay 2.5% higher in the long run, according to the Yale Budget Lab.Food banks have been struggling across the US to keep up with demand and manage rising food prices, while bracing for further cuts, higher prices, and a surge in demand once Snap cuts begin taking effect.At a food bank in Charlottesville, Virginia, Jane Colony Mills, executive director of Loaves & Fishes, said the food bank has “experienced a 20% increase in the numbers of people coming for food assistance in 2025, likely driven not only by the cost of groceries in our community, but by the overall cost of living in Charlottesville and Albemarle area.”She noted their food supply has decreased as well, since they rely on food that stores cannot sell, and have also been affected bycutsat the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to programs that support food banks. Colony Mills noted Snap cuts haven’t taken effect yet in Virginia, but local social service departments are bracing for those reductions or cancellations starting 1 October.“People who rely on these incremental supports will be struggling even more to provide food for their households each month,” she added.In Washington, the Thurston CountyFoodBank said they are bracing for significant cuts to Snap that will increase demand and make it more difficult to meet the current demand, let alone handle increases. They have already had to lay off staff positions funded by the Snap-Ed program that was cut by the Trump administration.“We have been told to brace for cuts that could be as much as 20% to 25% of the food we received in prior years. For us, 25% is $1m worth of food in 2024 prices, so with rising food costs, we can assume that is a gap of well over a million dollars,” said executive director of the Thurston County Food Bank.Ahead of the cuts to Snap and rising food prices, the Trump administrationannouncedthe cancellation of the annual hunger survey that measures food insecurity in the US and food researchers at the USDA were put on leave.Tuna, beans, Spam: Trump’s tariffs threaten the canned foods millions rely on to surviveRead moreUSDA deferred comment to apress release, where they claimed “these redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous studies do nothing more than fear monger.”The decision is viewed by anti-hunger advocates as an effort by the Trump administration to obfuscate the impacts of their cuts to Snap and other policies affecting food insecurity for Americans.“By cancelling the survey, USDA is sending a signal that tracking and battling hunger is no longer a priority,” Eric Mitchell, president of the Alliance to End Hunger, said in astatement. “It is further troubling that the decision comes amid predictions that hunger may increase in the coming months and years. Hunger will not disappear simply because it is no longer tracked.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationFood banksUS economyInflationEconomicsHungerDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The network’s decision reportedly followed a wave of cancellations of Disney’s streaming service Disney+.Carr’s comments drew criticism from across the aisle.Ted Cruz, the Republican Texas senator, said some of Carr’s remarks were “dangerous as hell”.Asked at a press conference on Tuesday whether he regrets the phrasing he used when talking about Kimmel, Carr claimed “the full words that I said, the full context of the interview”, were very clear.“For a lot of Democrats, this has really been about distortion and projection,” he added. He then accused Senate Democrats of hypocrisy,referring to calls in 2018for the FCC to review Sinclair’s “fitness to retain its existing broadcast licenses” over a controversial “must-run” video that its stations were forced to broadcast.“The very same Democrats that are saying that I said something that I didn’t are the same ones that engaged in that exact same type of conduct that they claim I did,” he said.With Kimmel now back on air, Carr suggested the entire episode was actually a win for local broadcasters – and a necessary check on the control of New York- and Hollywood-based broadcasters.“What we saw over the last two weeks was, probably for the first time in maybe 20 or 30 years, local TV stations – the actual licensed entities that are tied to specific communities – pushing back and saying that they did not want to run particular national programs,” he said. “They felt like they could stand up for themselves. I think it’s a good thing. And I hope that we can see potentially more of that going ahead.”Asked by the Guardian whether he was disappointed that Nexstar and Sinclair chose to bring back Kimmel’s show, Carr said he did not expect the pre-emption to last “for any sort of real sustained period of time” due to the economic pressures the companies were facing. “These were decisions ultimately were for them to make,” he said.During the meeting, Anna M Gomez, the lone Democrat on the commission, called out Carr’s comments – as he sat a few feet away. “This FCC threatened to go after [ABC], seizing on a late night comedian’s comments as a pretext to punish speech it disliked,” she said. “That led to a new low of corporate capitulation that put the foundation of the first amendment in danger.”‘Censor-in-chief’: Trump-backed FCC chair at heart of Jimmy Kimmel stormRead moreWhile Gomez has been very critical of Carr’s leadership, she has largely refrained from attacking him personally,and has saidthat she maintains a good working relationship with him.While the FCC meets monthly, Tuesday’s gathering took on added significance and excitement. Outside the FCC building, a mobile billboard truck – organized by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders – carried the message: “Government can’t control media content.”Inside, the meeting room was unusually packed. Several protesters, organized by the progressive political action organization Our Revolution, wore T-shirts that said: “Federal Censorship Commission”. A few stood up during the meeting and yelled: “Fire Carr, the censorship czar,” and were quickly removed. One sign played on Carr’s tough talk to television networks, telling the FCC commissioner: “Brendan, We Can Do This the Easy Way (You Quit) or the Hard Way (You’re Fired).”When told by the Guardian that the “lengthy” (in Carr’s words) agenda for the monthly FCC meeting included seven wonky action items, one protester expressed frustration that they hadn’t eaten breakfast before arriving early. The man left before the meeting concluded.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationJimmy KimmelUS politicsTelevision industryABCnewsShareReuse this content"

Some 15% of non-citizen healthcare workers originate from nations under temporary protected status.“The TPS terminations, together with the massive cuts to Medicaid from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), will combine to create a perfect storm for Americans’ health care,” the lawmakers write. “While the termination of TPS will remove thousands of health care workers from the workforce, the OBBBA will make deep cuts to Medicaid, force hospital and nursing home closures, and trigger health care workforce layoffs.”The revocationscould resultin tens of thousands of immigrants reverting to being undocumented, and place them at risk of arrest and removal by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). They also raise questions about the administration’sclaimsthat they are only focused and targeting “criminals” and the “worst of the worst” in deportation efforts.“The revocation of TPS belies the claim that they’re going after criminals on its face, because everyone who has TPS has undergone rigorous and ongoing background checks,” said Chris Newman, legal director and general counsel for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), told the Guardian. “This is why it’s so laughable on its face, that the Trump administrationequatesTPS with gang activity, because these are all people who have undergone background checks. It defies reality to make that claim.“It’s obvious theTrump administrationis using the language of criminality as a justification to target and punish the innocent.”Newman also represents the family ofKilmar Ábrego García, a father of three in Maryland whom the Trump administration wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March. A federal court later ordered his return to the US. The administration hascontinuedin court to try to have Ábrego García deported again. He is beingheldin an immigration detention center in Pennsylvania.In their letter, the lawmakers warn the TPS cancellations will result in significant staff losses that healthcare facilities across the US will struggle to replace, as the industry struggles to meet the growing demand for home healthcare and nursing workers for an ageing populace.“Americans will pay the price if the health care workforce crisis is worsened by President Trump’s TPS terminations,” the letter added. “As research on nursing home staffing shows, fewer nurses mean more medication errors, more falls, more delayed diagnoses, and increased patient mortality.“Fewer nursing and home health professionals also have a ripple effect across the health care system, contributing to discharge backlogs in many other care settings – from post-acute rehabs to hospitals.”The departments of homeland security; health and human services; and labor have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationDemocratsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsHealthElizabeth WarrennewsShareReuse this content"

The Google subsidiary is the latest in a long string of tech companies to make a multimillion-dollar payout to the president over past decisions about his accounts.Trump had filed the suit againstYouTubeand Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, alleging that the platform had “accumulated an unprecedented concentration of power, market share, and ability to dictate our nation’s public discourse”. YouTube said it suspended Trump’s channel because it had violated the website’s policies against inciting violence. Because of the settlement, the case is now dismissed. Google did not immediately return a request for comment.The news comes just a week after YouTube announced that it would allow creators who were once banned for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 US presidential election to be reinstated. In its announcement, YouTube said it celebrated conservative voices on its site and blamed the account suspensions on pressure from Joe Biden.Meta agrees to pay Trump $25m for suspending accounts over Capitol riotsRead moreFacebook-parent company Meta settled a similar lawsuit with Trump in Januaryfor $25m, and the social media platform X, previously Twitter, settled another for $10m in February. Most of the payout from the Meta suit will go to Trump’s presidential library fund. For the YouTube settlement, Trump has directed $22m of the payment to go to restoring and preserving the National Mall and supporting construction of the White House ballroom, according to documents filed in the US district court for the northern district of California. The lavish ballroom is expected to cost around $200m.The three cases were first brought by Trump lawyer and ally, John Coale, according to theWall Street Journal, which first reported the news. Coale told the Journal that Trump’s return to the White House was instrumental in reaching the slew of settlements with tech companies, saying: “If he had not been re-elected, we would have been in court for 1,000 years.” Coale is now Trump’s deputy special envoy to Ukraine and Belarus.In an email to the Guardian, Coale said Trump was an “ideal client”.“Glad it and the others I filled [sic] for DJT in July or [sic] 2021 ended to the tune of 60mil,” Coale added. “We got $$$ and changed tech behavior I believe.”The case against YouTube had been closed in 2023, but Trump’s lawyers filed to reopen the case after he won the presidency. Before his victory, all three of the lawsuits faced uphill court battles. A federal judge dismissed the case against Twitter in 2022, and the suits against Meta and YouTube were stayed, then the latter was administratively close. Trump’s lawyers, however, revived the cases with appeals to overturn each ruling.YouTube first suspended Trump’s channel for seven days on 12 January 2021, after he posted a video saying the speech he made to his supporters on January 6 before the Capitol riot was “totally appropriate”. YouTube said it suspended the channel over “concerns about the ongoing potential for violence”. The company then extended the ban without an end date.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arne Slot presided over back‑to‑back defeats for only the second time in his Liverpool tenure asGalatasaraytriumphed on a raucous night in Istanbul. The performance should trouble Liverpool’s head coach more than the result.Liverpool were sloppy, again, suspect defensively, again, and short on ideas as they succumbed to Victor Osimhen’s first-half penalty. Defeat would have been heavier had the Galatasaray striker not squandered two clear openings early in the second half but was deserved nonetheless.‘Don’t panic’: Van Dijk’s message to Liverpool fans after second defeat in four daysRead moreThe visitors were almost reprieved by the award of an 89th‑minute penalty but even that did not go their way. The referee, Clément Turpin, overturned his decision to penalise Davinson Sánchez for a foul on Ibrahima Konaté – the former Tottenham defender played the ball first – after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor.Slot defended Liverpool’s performance along with his decision to rest Mohamed Salah until the 62nd minute. He also blamed a disjointed second half on Galatasaray’s tendency to go down at the slightest touch.Defeat, however, was largely self-inflicted.It was a surprise to see Salah on the bench for such a high‑profile European occasion even taking into account his modest start to the season and recent workload. Alexander Isak, Alexis Mac Allister and Conor Bradley were also benched as Slot made four changes fromthe side beaten at Crystal Palaceon Saturday.Jeremie Frimpong took Salah’s place with Dominik Szoboszlai stationed behind him at right-back again. The Hungary midfielder came in for a testing night against the pace of Baris Alper Yilmaz. The same could be said of the entire Liverpool team in the first half as Galatasaray embraced the occasion.Rams Park, or Ali Sami Yen Spor Kompleksi to give Galatasaray’s home their unsponsored name, pulsated with noise 45 minutes before kick‑off. Incessant, deafening whistles greeted every Liverpool touch after it. There was also a classy moment at kick-off whena tribute to Diogo Jotawas displayed on the giant screen and the digital hoardings around the arena.Okan Buruk’s team have made a 100% start to the Super Lig season as they pursue a fourth consecutive Turkish league title but domestic dominance has not transferred into European competition often. This was only Galatasaray’s second win in 19Champions Leaguegroup games, coming off the back of a 5-1 trouncing at Eintracht Frankfurt on the opening night, and it seemed the entire club – players to fanbase – were determined to make amends.View image in fullscreenVictor Osimhen scores his early penalty for Galatasaray.Photograph: Francisco Seco/APYilmaz scorched past Szoboszlai at Galatasaray’s first attack. The forward was through on goal but, as at Selhurst Park, Alisson stood his ground well to make an important block. There would be no reprieve for Liverpool’s makeshift full-back when Yilmaz next ran at him.Hugo Ekitiké steered a free header wide from Cody Gakpo’s cross as the visitors attempted to silence the din. Gakpo created another opening for Ekitiké when slipping him through with a neat pass. Ugurcan Cakir stood tall and saved with his legs only for the rebound to fall to Gakpo. His volley was blocked on the line by Ismail Jakobs and 25 seconds later, after Florian Wirtz had squandered possession with an over-elaborate back-heel, Galatasaray were awarded a penalty. The hosts broke through Ilkay Gündogan and Yilmaz, who again attacked Szoboszlai from the left and cut back inside the defender before collapsing to the ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Osimhen drilled the spot-kick straight down the centre of Alisson’s goal.Galatasaray v Liverpool: Champions League – liveRead moreLiverpool dominated possession and outnumbered the Galatasaray defence on several counterattacks without creating a clear opportunity. Cakir saved from Wirtz at close range, desperate defending prevented Ekitiké and Milos Kerkez converting at the resulting corner, and Konaté headed wide at the near post. But Slot’s side were unconvincing at the back and almost punished again when Osimhen dispossessed Ryan Gravenberch before being tripped by the midfielder just outside the Liverpool area. The £65m striker felt he was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity but Gravenberch was punished with a yellow card.Osimhen, a disruptive force all night, was gifted a chance to double the hosts’ lead when he dispossessed Curtis Jones and burst through on goal. Jones atoned with a superb challenge. A mix-up between Konaté and Gravenberch offered Osimhen another opening but he shot tamely at Alisson. The Liverpool keeper was injured in the process and had to be replaced by Giorgi Mamardashvili.Alisson’s replacement was hardly troubled once Osimhen departed with an injury. Neither was Cakir, despite Liverpool penning Galatasaray in during the closing stages.

We’d watchedHenry Cooper knock Cassius Clayto the brink of oblivion with a picture-perfect left hook. From the vantage point of my living room, that had amused Muhammad.We’d seen Joe Frazier put Ali on the canvas in Round 15 oftheir first encounter at Madison Square Garden, andKen Norton break Muhammad’s jaw. Those punches were safely ensconced in the annals of history, as were the thudding blows thatGeorge Foreman landed in Zaire.Angelo Dundee at 100: the calm heart of Muhammad Ali’s boxing careerRead moreWatching Ali-Frazier III, known widely as the Thrilla in Manila,was a different experience.Despite the fact that it was one of Muhammad’s greatest ring triumphs, there was no joy in his face as The Thrilla in Manila unfolded. Sitting beside me, he winced as some of Frazier’s blows landed. He seemed to be reexperiencing the pain. When the tape ended, he turned to me and said, “Frazier quit just before I did. I didn’t think I could fight anymore.”Fifty years have passed since Ali and Frazier did battle in the sweltering heat and humidity of that late-morning hour in one of the most celebrated, brutal prizefights of all time. “What it came down to wasn’t the heavyweight championship of the world,” Jerry Izenberg, a leading sports writer of that era, later noted. “Ali and Frazier were fighting for something more important than that. They were fighting for the championship of each other. I’ve never witnessed anything like it. Both fighters won that night, and both fighters lost.”Neither man ever fully recovered from the physical damage that they inflicted on each other that day. Let’s put what many consider the greatest prizefight ever in context.Ali in 1975 was the most famous, and possibly the most loved, person in the world. The hatred that had been directed at him for his views on race and his refusal to accept induction into the United States Army at the height of the war in Vietnam had largely abated. His 1974 knockout of Foreman in Zaire to reclaim the heavyweight throne had engendered worldwide joy.Frazier didn’t share those good feelings. On 8 March 1971, in their first meeting, Frazier had defeated Ali in“The Fight of the Century” at Madison Square Gardento earn the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world. But the victory had come with a heavy price-tag.The first Ali-Frazier fight was seen in the United States as a metaphor for the struggle between racist warlike elements (who embraced Frazier as the anti-Ali) on one side and those seeking peace and social justice (largely Ali partisans) on the other.Frazier didn’t want to be a symbol. He was uninterested in politics and rarely talked about religion or race. He’d grown up as a sharecropper’s son in the meanest circumstances that rural America had to offer. All he wanted to do was fight.“Clay got into boxing when he was 12 years old because his bike was stolen,” Frazier said. “I didn’t have no bike when I was 12. I was working in the fields.”But the popular narrative framed Ali as an outsider and Joe as a representative of America’s white establishment. And Ali perpetuated that myth, attacking Frazier’s blackness and character. He demeaned Joe as an “Uncle Tom” and stripped him of his dignity in the public mind.“Joe was almost the stereotypic black person Ali claimed to be fighting for,” writer Dave Wolf, who was later a member of Frazier’s entourage, observed. “Yet Ali demeaned Joe at every turn. Look at the perception many people have that Joe is stupid because he’s not facile with the language and because his particular brand of South Carolina English isn’t easily understood by people who don’t come from that part of South Carolina. Joe is not dumb. But Ali stuck that saddle on him, and Joe will have to wear it forever. Joe is not, and never was, an Uncle Tom, whatever that means. But Ali branded him with that label too. The damage he did to Joe was never undone.”Frazier wanted to be a hero. After beating Ali, he received condescending approval from much of white America. But he was never a hero where it mattered most to him – to his own people.Three years later in the build-up to Ali-Frazier II, which Ali won by decision, Muhammad branded Joe as “ignorant.” In Manila, he labeled him a “gorilla.” Just as his ring battles against Ali defined Frazier as a fighter, Joe’s relationship with Muhammad defined him, unfairly, in the eyes of the world.“I do all the right things.” Frazier lamented. “And this is the way people look at me because of him.” Later, he would add to that sentiment, saying, “I know things would of been different for me if Clay hadn’t of been around. I’d of gotten a lot more respect. I’d of had more appreciation from my own kind.”Unlike Ali-Frazier I, Manila wasn’t about Ali’s social and political beliefs. The narrative had quieted by then. In some ways, Ali had come to represent the status quo and establishment while Joe had been tossed aside. But for both men – and particularly for Joe – Ali-Frazier III was intensely personal. Frazier’s hatred toward Ali had grown to enormous proportions. Manila was his last opportunity to regain the dignity that he felt Muhammad had stolen from him.The Thrilla in Manila - in picturesRead moreAli was a great artist in the ring, as the world saw against opponents like Cleveland Williams and Zora Folley. But his greatest moments in boxing came when he had inquisitors like Sonny Liston and Foreman in front of him. Frazier was Ali’s greatest inquisitor.Joe enjoyed fighting. No one ever enjoyed fighting Joe.“Frazier never took a backward step inside the ring,” Don Turner, who later trained Larry Holmes and Evander Holyfield, observed. “Not for no one. He didn’t come to dance. He didn’t come to hold. He didn’t come to box. He came to fight.”Frazier echoed that theme, saying of Ali, “He ain’t no fighter. He’s a boxer. I’m a fighter.”But in Manila, Ali showed beyond all doubt that he was a fighter too.Associated Press boxing writer Ed Schuyler later recalled: “The Thrilla in Manila was the best fight I’ve ever seen. As it unfolded, everybody at ringside understood they were watching greatness. The pace never eased. It was hell the whole way. I’ve never seen two people give more, ever.”The early rounds belonged to Ali. He outboxed Frazier, landed sharp clean punches, and staggered his opponent several times. Frazier kept coming forward. The tide turned in the middle rounds. Ali was tiring. Frazier rocked him with thunderous blows. Muhammad’s arms came down as Frazier bludgeoned him against the ropes, pounding away. Ali regained the initiative in round 12, wobbled Frazier, and measured him for more. One round later, a jolting left hook knocked Frazier’s mouthpiece into the crowd. He was shaken but finished the round. In round 14, Ali resumed his assault.“The 14th round,” Richard Hoffer later wrote, “the final three minutes of their shared agony, was a kind of scientific experiment, an investigation into the extremes of human behavior. Just exactly what was a person capable of? How far could he go? How deep could he reach? Nobody had ever seen it conducted at this level. Nobody really knew what desire and pride could accomplish, or destroy. Now they did.”Frazier’s left eye was completely closed. The vision in his right eye was limited. He was spitting blood. Ali’s punches were landing cleanly. Frazier couldn’t see them coming. Both fighters had landed so many clean blows that the padding inside their gloves was separating. More and more, it was like hitting and being hit with ungloved fists.Frazier’s trainer, Eddie Futch, stopped the carnage after the 14th round.View image in fullscreenMuhammad Ali and Joe Frazier during the buildup to the Thrilla in Manila.Photograph: Jess Tan/APFrazier is now thought of in some circles primarily as a piece of the Ali legend. But that notion is unfair. He was far more. It’s true that, without the three Ali-Frazier fights, Joe’s career would be lacking in historical gravitas. But those three fights did happen.Frazier won Ali-Frazier I and came very close to victory in Ali-Frazier III. Did some of Ali’s greatness rub off on him? Absolutely. But some of Frazier’s greatness rubbed off on Ali too. Joe deserves to be remembered in his own right.In their later years, Ali and Frazier interacted occasionally, almost always for an economic incentive. But Joe’s hatred toward Muhammad remained. He took pleasure in believing that the punishment he inflicted on Ali in Manila contributed to the physical difficulties that Muhammad endured late in life.“He shook me in Manila,” Frazier acknowledged “He won. But I sent him home worse than he came. Look at him now. He’s damaged goods. I know it. You know it. Everyone knows it. They just don’t want to say. He was always making fun of me. I’m the dummy; I’m the one getting hit in the head. Tell me now; him or me; which one talks worse now? Manila really don’t matter no more. He’s finished, and I’m still here.”Later, adding to the ugliness of that sentiment, Frazier declared “I’ll outlive him. I’ll dance on his grave.”It wasn’t to be.Frazier died in 2011 at the age of 67. Five years later,Ali died aged 74. They weren’t old by ordinary standards. But Muhammad’s health was in ruins during the final decade of his life. Frazier was foremost among the fighters whose blows permanently damaged him physically. And Ali permanently damaged Frazier, both physically and psychologically.In Manila, they had a glimpse of the future and what would become of them.It saddens me that Frazier carried all of that anger and hate inside him. It cast a shadow on his life. But I’ll give the final word to Ali who, decades ago, told me.I wrote to him – address: ‘Muhammad Ali, USA’. A month later, the great man repliedRead more“I don’t think two big men ever fought fights like me andJoe Frazier. One fight, maybe. But three times; we were the only ones. Of all the men I fought in boxing, Sonny Liston was the scariest. Foreman was the most powerful. Floyd Patterson was the most skilled as a boxer. But the roughest and toughest was Joe Frazier. He brought out the best in me, and the best fight we fought was in Manila. That fight, I could feel something happening to me. Something different from what I’d felt in fights before. And God blessed me that day. He’s blessed me many times, and that fight in Manila was one of them. It was like I took myself as far as I could go, and then God took me the rest of the way.“So I’m sorry Joe Frazier is mad at me. I’m sorry I hurt him. Joe Frazier is a good man. I couldn’t have done what I did without him, and he couldn’t have done what he did without me. And if God ever calls me to a holy war, I want Joe Frazier fighting beside me.”Thomas Hauser’s email address isthomashauserwriter@gmail.com. His next book –The Most Honest Sport: Two More Years Inside Boxing– will be published this month and is available for preorder. In 2019, Hauser was selected for boxing’s highest honor - induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.Explore more on these topicsMuhammad AliJoe FrazierBoxingUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We have the best fans in the world. But we have the worst leadership in the world,” the runner-up for MVP said. “Year after year, the only thing that remains consistent is the lack of accountability from our leaders. If I didn’t know exactly what the job entailed, maybe I wouldn’t feel this way.Minnesota’s Reeve suspended for WNBA playoff game after referee tiradeRead more“But unfortunately for them, I do believe we serve a league that has shown they think championship coaches and Hall of Fame players are dispensable, and that’s fine. It’s professional sports, but I will not stand quietly by and allow different standards to be applied at the league level.”Collier, in her role with the WNBA union, is also involved in negotiations with the league over a new collective bargaining agreement. She claimed on Tuesday that Engelbert had made remarks about the league’s young stars during preliminary CBA talks earlier this year.“This past February, I sat across from [Engelbert] and asked how she planned to address the officiating issues in our league,” Collier said. “Her response was, ‘Well, only the losers complain about the refs.’ I also asked how she planned to fix the fact that players like [Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers], who are clearly driving massive revenue for the league and are making so little for their first four years.“Her response was, ‘[Clark] should be grateful. She makes $16m off the court because without the platform that the WNBA gives her, she wouldn’t make anything.’ And in that same conversation, she told me, ‘Players should be on their knees, thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.’”Collier said she was also annoyed she hadn’t heard from Engelbert after her injury in Game 3 of the WNBA semi-finals.“Not one call, not one text. Instead, the only outreach has come from her number two telling my agent that she doesn’t believe physical play contributed to injuries. That is infuriating,” Collier said. “It’s the perfect example of the tone deaf, dismissive approach that our leaders always seem to take.”Collier wants the league to do a better job protecting its players in the long term.“The league talks about sustainability. This is about sustainability. How are you going to protect your players? How are you going to make sure that we have the best products on the floor night after night, when it’s so inconsistent and people are getting hurt left and right?”Collier also said she was comfortable with the risk of being fined for her comments. “I’m sure they’ll fine me,” she said. “I mean, it seems like anything with free speech is fined now.”Explore more on these topicsWNBACaitlin ClarkMinnesota LynxUS sportsBasketballShareReuse this content"

But after lobbying hard for Los Angeles to host the2028 summer Olympic Gamesduring his first term, the US president has found at least one silver lining to what he calls his “circuitous route” back to the White House.“I didn’t think I’d be here for the games in this capacity,” Trump mused, as he signed anexecutive ordernaming himself the chair of the White House’s LA Olympics taskforce. “But it worked out that way so I’m very happy about that.”A non-consecutive second term returned Trump to the presidency just in time to oversee the biggest sporting event in the world. And with less than three years to go until the Olympic torch is lit in the city’sstoried Coliseum, there is perhaps no bigger X factor looming over the games than the sitting US president.Local officials and organizers have expressed nothing but confidence in the success of the upcoming games. But a decade after LA presented its cinematic pitch to the world – “follow the sun” to a vibrant host city that is “home to dreamers from every corner of the world” – observers and critics see ample reason to wonder whether the city’s grand global pursuit may crash headlong into Trump’s hardline America First agenda.The list of “what ifs” is long: will athletes, coaches and officials obtain their visas in time? Will foreign tourists boycott the administration’s tariffs, its deportation campaign or its foreign policy? Will the White House leverage federal disaster aid in policy fights with the city and state’s progressive leaders? Will Trump send in the national guard – or the military – to suppress protests, as he did in June and suggested he might do again? Will immigration agents patrol outside of sports venues? Will broadcasters be pressured to censor negative reactions to Trump?Or will the showman-in-chief play host to what theLA28 chair Casey Wassermanhaspromisedwill be the “greatest games the world has ever seen”?Los Angeles vowed to host the Olympics without breaking the bank and environment. Can it?Read more“We’ve never had a president who is more involved with sports than Donald Trump – never,” saidChristine Brennan, a sports columnist for USA Today who has covered every summer and winter games since LA last hosted the Olympics in 1984. “Whatever we can imagine he wants to do, my guess is he’s thinking of doing it.”Showman presidentTrump, as the host country’s head of state, will formally proclaim open the LA Olympics – a role that, for most of his American predecessors, has been little more than ceremonial.Ronald Reagan, the movie star turned president, dutifully opened the 1984 summer games in Los Angeles.Bill Clintondid the same for the 1996 summer games in Atlanta.George Bush raised eyebrows in 2002, when, just months after September 11, hedeparted slightlyfrom theOlympic Charter’sprescribed statement, andinserted a few patriotic wordsto open the winter games in Salt Lake City. Still, his presence largely followed precedent.But Trump is not a president known for staying on the sidelines – or sticking to a script.“Trump embraces sports like a popcorn lover on the AMC butter pump,” said Jules Boykoff, a professor of government and politics at Pacific University in Oregon who has written several books on the Olympics. “This is his thing and he is going to take full advantage of this opportunity.”Since taking office again in January, the president has already made several appearances at high profile sporting events, including the Super Bowl in New Orleans, and the FIFA ClubWorld Cup finalin New Jersey, where he presented the gold trophy to Chelsea and then lingered awkwardly on stage for the celebratory photo-op.The trophynow sits in the Oval Office.This summer, Trump was greetedwith a mix of applause and boosat the US Open men’s final in New York, where broadcasters were pressured not to show dissent against the US president. Last weekend, he received a far warmer embrace by arowdy crowdat theRyder Cup, where he watched Europe defeat the US in the sport he loves most, golf.The White House says Trump is determined to put on a “world-class event that successfully showcases American pride”.“President Trump is not only a champion-level golfer, but a sports enthusiast who worked tirelessly to bring the 2028 Olympics toLos Angelesduring his first term,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. “Now, he is able to see it through.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Fifa president Gianni Infantino celebrate with Chelsea FC team members at the Fifa Club World Cup 2025 in New Jersey, 13 July.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockNot only is Trump prepared to work with anyone – even his Democratic adversaries inCalifornia– officials note, his signature legislation, which he’s called the “big beautiful bill”, included $1bn in security and planning for the games.“President Trump has been incredibly supportive of the games since before the bid was signed, and he and his administration continue to offer their leadership and unwavering support as we prepare to deliver a successful and secure games that supports athletes, global and domestic visitors and our communities,” a spokesperson for the LA28 Olympic committee said in a statement.Victoria Jackson, a sports historian at Arizona State University, said there are indeed incentives for the president to cooperate – chiefly that support from the federal government will be crucial to pulling off what he surely hopes will be “the Greatest Olympic and Paralympic Games of all time”.The 2026 Fifa World Cup, co-hosted across several North American cities, including Los Angeles, offers a preview of how Trump and his administration might respond, she said: “We’ll learn a lot next summer.”‘Hornet’s nest of trouble’Domestic and global politics have always loomed over the games. But critics say Trump adds a volatile new dimension.First off, there’s the timing. The 2028 Olympics will fall in the twilight of Trump’s second term, right in the heat of the US presidential election campaign. Trump will be 82 when it is his turn to open the games. And though he is constitutionally barred from serving a third term, he has at times suggested he might yet try to run again.Then there is the political context. Dynamics could shift dramatically by 2028, but the fault lines between Trump and California are longstanding and deep. Tensions boiled over this summer, when Trump seized control of California’s national guard and deployed US Marines to Los Angeles in an attempt to suppress protests over his immigration crackdown in the city.While local officials insist the 16-day sporting spectacle will be safe and celebratory, critics fear Trump’s administration could use the summer games to escalate immigration raids, quell protests and clear homeless encampments.Eric Sheehan of the NOlympics LA coalition, which has beencoordinating local advocacy since 2017, said they expect Trump will send troops into LA in the run-up to the games. “That is an image he would love,” he said. Trump has publicly suggested as much, saying in August: “We’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our national guard or military.”Security is a top concern. The 2028 Olympic Games will be the largest in modern history – what organizers have described as the “operational equivalent of seven Super Bowls a day for 30 days”. Last year, the LA Games weredesignateda National Special Security Event (NSSE), placing the US Secret Service in charge of security coordination for the LA28. Security planning is already underway, says the agency.While the federal government plays a necessary role in providing security, Boykoff warns that the NSSE designation can help “till the political soil for the advancement of even more intensified militarization.“Lacquer on top of that a highly erratic president who is deeply committed to leveraging sports events like the World Cup and the Olympics to his political advantage,” he said, “and you’ve got a real hornet’s nest of trouble for the local population.”View image in fullscreenPeople embrace near federal agents blocking a road during an Ice immigration raid at a nearby licensed cannabis farm near Camarillo, California, on 10 July.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesAmong Angelenos’ worries: the sprawling deportation campaign that’s been at the heart of Trump’s second term and has swept up long-settled immigrants, lawful residents and even US citizens across the region. Meanwhile, the administration’s aggressive border policies have not only sparked anxieties among athletes and visitors over their visas, but also fears that they could get ensnared in domestic immigration enforcement operations.New Jersey congresswoman Nellie Pou, a Democrat leading the Olympic oversight efforts in Congress,saidat a hearing that she is concerned the “administration’s treatment of immigrants has sent a message to the world that: ‘You are not welcome here’”.Trump’simmigration crackdownandhis trade warshave already disrupted international tourism to the US. Stories of travelersdenied entry or detainedhave fueled concerns about safety, security and long visa wait times.Citizens of 12 countriesare currently not allowed to travel to the US at all, and there are restrictions onseven more.A state department official said the US will allow into the country “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives”, traveling for the LA Games, but noted that “the exception does not apply to fans or spectators”.LA28 to break longstanding tradition with corporate venue names at GamesRead moreStill, a string of denials for international athletes seeking to compete or train in the US, including members of theSenegal women’s national basketball teamand a Braziliantable tennis starwho said he was told he was not eligible for a visa waiver because he had previously played in a tournament in Cuba, has done little to calm jitters.Administration officials have downplayed concerns that Trump’s immigration and travel policies will affect the games.“International visitors who legally come to the United States for the Olympics have nothing to worry about,”said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is whether or not they are illegally in the US – full stop. Speculation to the contrary is ill-informed.”Trump, speaking at the UN general assembly in New York earlier this month, said he hopes “countless people from all over the globe” will come to the US for the upcoming World Cup andOlympic Games.‘I have a lot at stake’Since Trump’s return to power, Olympic organizers in LA have largely taken a diplomatic approach, heaping flattery – and even medals – on the famously mercurial president. It’s a dynamic that appears to be shaped, at least in part, by a shared sense of mutually assured destruction. Trump’s legacy – and, critics argue, his ego –may be the games’ best insurance policy.“I have a lot at stake,” Trump said inAugust. “Because I’m the one that got the Olympics.”Days before Trump was sworn in, Wasserman, the LA28 chair, made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago, where Trumpreportedly assuredhim that “these are America’s Olympics” and pledged to help “make them the greatest games”.Wasserman, an entertainment executive and sports agent who has donated prolifically to Democratic candidates and causes, though more recently began making contributions to Republicans as well, has repeatedly and publicly thanked Trump for his support for the LA Games, which began even before the city won the bid.At a White House event in August, where signage merged the presidential seal and the LA28 Olympic logo, Wasserman presented Trump with a box of medals from the 1984 Games. “Can I say I won them athletically?” Trump quipped.At the ceremony, Trump formally established aWhite House taskforceto oversee federal preparations for the games, naming himself as chair.Longtime observers saythe move is unusual – and reflects the president’s intense enthusiasm for hosting what he has described as a major “milestone” for the country – and his presidency. (He alsochairsa similar White House task force for next year’s Fifa World Cup.)Trump announces he will chair White House taskforce for 2028 LA OlympicsRead moreThe White House said the taskforce was established to “foster unprecedented federal coordination to ensure smooth logistics, safe practices, and [a] world-class event that successfully showcases American pride”.Yet as the White House event unfolded, the president quickly departed from the sportsmanshiply spirit of the day and dove into politics. In his remarks, Trump called LA’s mayor,Karen Bass, “incompetent”; vowed his government would “not let men steal trophies from women at the 2028 Olympics”; and said he would do “anything necessary” to keep the games safe, including deploying troops.Bass, who faces re-election next year, has been careful to express appreciation for the federal government’s support for the games, all the while condemning his immigration raids and false statements around the January fires.View image in fullscreenChair of the 2028 LA Olympics organizing committee Casey Wasserman speaks next to Trump during an executive order signing ceremony in Washington DC, on 5 August.Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images“We’ve had a productive working relationship with the federal government in the context of these games since Los Angeles was awarded the games in 2017,” a spokesperson for Bass’s office said in a statement. “We will continue preparing and working with public safety officials to ensure that the games are safe and secure, and that we present our city and our nation to the world in the best possible light.”Outside experts say that continuing to strike that balance will not be easy.“Trump is not afraid to threaten and even carry out threats that would make it more difficult and more expensive for California to host the games,” said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economist who has written several books about the Olympics.“Karen Bass and [California governor]Gavin Newsomare targets of his. He wants to make their lives more difficult, and he won’t hesitate to make the lives of Angelenos more difficult,” Zimbalist said. Newsom, who is term-limited and will leave office next year, is widely expected to run for president in 2028.But there is another view: that Trump’s attachment to the Olympics – a coda to his presidency – will help guarantee its success.“He’ll be sitting front and center,” Endeavor and TKO executive Mark Shapirosaid, according to a recording of his remarks at the Morgan Stanley media conference earlier this year. “I’m a true believer that this will be his Olympics as much as anything else.” He suggested “the Trump Olympics” deserved a trademark.Trump’s hostility toward the city has fueled growing calls for Los Angeles to withdraw from the 2028 Olympics.“You don’t stand idly by as your sworn enemy assumes even more power to mess with you – you toss that problem elsewhere if you can,” LA Times columnist Gustavo Arellanowrotein an op-ed urging the city to pull out.But despite mounting outcry, there is little chance LA would – orcould– withdraw.“In Los Angeles, crime is down, homelessness is down and we are leading the fastest disaster recovery effort in state history,” Bass said in a recent statement, announcing the opening of ticket registration for the games. “LA will be ready for millions to see the best of our small businesses, diverse communities and so much more.”Sam Levin contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Donald TrumpOlympic GamesLos AngelesCaliforniaUS foreign policyTrump tariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not just his raw pace, throwing 100mph+ deep into games, but his mastery of late-moving variations that mean batters can’t pick whether it’s a sweeper or a splinker until it’s already behind them.Alan EvansTheAstros.They’d made the playoffs for eight straight years, winning a couple of World Series, four American League pennants and seven AL West titles. Sure, they werevillains on merit, but gravity-defying dynasties like Houston’s only make for richer postseason narratives.Bryan Armen GrahamWell, these days, it’s hard to miss any team because just under half of them make the playoffs. That said, theOrioleshave great young talent and a fanbase starving for a winner. When Camden Yards is full and buzzing it’s one of the best atmospheres in North American sports. Their 2025 has to be considered one of the most disappointing seasons in recent memory, unless you’re a Mets fan of course.David LengelHigh seed at risk of going out earlyTheBrewerssurged to the best record in baseball (96-65) with an astonishing summer after having been 25-28 on 24 May. But their momentum slowed in September, and with the new extended wildcard format giving the best teams a five-day break, that may be enough to knock them off their rhythm and send them home early.AETheBrewerscould be vulnerable. The NL Central champions have come back to earth after the 14-game win streak that vaulted them to the best record in baseball. There are questions over the fitness of closer Trevor Megill and they’ll have a tricky NLDS draw with the Padres or Cubs after a five-day layoff.BAGThat has to be theTigers, who are facing a Guardians team that came out of nowhere to capitalize ona historic Detroit collapse. Cleveland’s recent stretch of allowing just 32 earned runs in 19 games was otherworldly, and it’s helped earn them three home games v Detroit. There’s only one Tarik Skubal pitching for the Tigers, so that means they’re in trouble.DLView image in fullscreenWilliam Contreras and the Milwaukee Brewers finished the regular season with the best record in the majors.Photograph: John Fisher/Getty ImagesDark horse to winThePadresare used to being overlooked in favor of their more glamorous neighbors in Los Angeles, but they have a dangerous core led by Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr, and the bullpen’s 3.06 ERA is by far the best in baseball. If they can keep games close early on, they will be hard to shake off.AETheMarinersare the lone major league team to have never reached a World Series much less won one. They have a strong chance of finally breaking that hoodoo thanks toCal Raleigh’s brillianceand proven October commodity Randy Arozarena.BAGTheRed Soxhave come out of this dormant phase, won back their temporarily apathetic fan base and are quite good, and importantly, well-rounded. They do everything well, and despite theloss of rookie phenom Roman Anthony, probably have enough to oust the Yankees this round, and more. They have the ace in Garrett Crochet and two Comeback Player of the Year candidates in Trevor Story and Aroldis Chapman. Don’t be surprised if they pull of their fifth title of the century.DLMost important factor this postseason/offseasonThe Dodgers already have the best – and best-paid – lineup in baseball, but are still likely to giveKyle Tuckera megacontract this offseason. If that does happen, calls will grow for a long-overdue look at competitive balance and the rules about salary deferrals. This won’t stop the Dodgers winning 100+ games a year for the next decade, but it could shape the outcome of the collective bargaining agreement due after next season.AEBullpen upgrades. In today’s game, the difference between winning and losing in October often comes down to late-inning arms in high-leverage situations. Any team that can lock down seventh-to-ninth inning relief dominance will head into 2026 with a huge competitive edge.BAGWell, so much of the pitching world surroundsbullpensthese days, with starters having trouble going deep into games. LA’s relief core has struggled, but now that their starters are healthy, and the pen can breathe a little, the Dodgers are well placed to use their core more effectively. San Diego’s bullpen, with Mason Miller is terrifying. On the flip side, expect the Yankees bullpen to let them down at just the wrong time.DLView image in fullscreenThe Boston Red Sox are back in the playoffs and due to face the New York Yankees in the AL wildcard series.Photograph: Brian Fluharty/Getty ImagesNLCSDodgers over Padres.AEPhillies over Brewers.BAGDodgers over Brewers.DLALCSYankees over Mariners.AEMariners over Yankees.BAGMariners over Blue Jays.DLYour World Series champions will be …TheDodgersmay be facing injury struggles, most notably catcher Will Smith’s fractured hand, but no team has a deeper roster. They have the best player in the world in Shohei Ohtani, an experienced batting lineup who know how to win in the postseason, and the potentially powerful storyline of retiring team hero Clayton Kershaw being used as a super-reliever if they make the World Series. His teammates would love to send him off with another championship, and they have the quality and consistency to dominate any opponent.AEThePhilliesboast one of the most balanced rosters in baseball, evenwithout ace Zack Wheeler. Cristopher Sánchez, Ranger Suárez and Jesús Luzardo headline a rotation that can carry games deep, sparing a top-heavy bullpen. Jhoan Duran, electrifying in the ninth, has turned Citizens Bank Park into a theater of intimidation. Offensively, Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper – two of the generation’s best October sluggers – anchor a lineup bolstered by Rob Thomson’s platoons and a supporting cast with eight double-digit homer hitters. Harper feels destined for a World Series MVP run after 2022’s near-miss, while Schwarber (56 homers) has generally thrived under pressure. The X-factor? NL batting champion Trea Turner’s return from a hamstring injury. If he finds his rhythm, Philadelphia’s cocktail of power, depth and home-field magic make them the most compelling case to win it all.BAGTheMarinerswere born in 1977 and have never won the big one. Nearly 50 years later, they’re ready to shock the Dodgers and finally bring that elusive title to the northwest corner. It won’t be a shock, because Seattle have the talent and they’re peaking at the right time. With should-be MVP Raleigh, Arozarena and Julio Rodríguez, their lineup is beefy. But it’s the pitching rotation, with depth from Bryan Woo, Luis Castillo and Logan Gilbert that’s found elite form over the last month, combining with a pen in top gear that make them so formidable. Yes, they really can match LA, and if they can somehow strikeout a little bit less, they’ll pip the Dodgers in seven.DLExplore more on these topicsMLBLos Angeles DodgersSan Diego PadresPhiladelphia PhilliesChicago CubsCincinnati RedsDetroit TigersShareReuse this content"

The five-time All-pro made a catch and landed awkwardly on his left leg after being tackled near the New York Jets’ sideline. Players from both teams looked on anxiously while Hill was tended to, and he was then carted off the field. The Dolphins said in a statement he was “being taken to a local hospital for imaging, evaluation and observation.” The team’s head coach, Mike McDaniel, later confirmed Hill dislocated his left knee. On Tuesday, the team confirmed the injury means Hill’s season is over.The usually excellent Ravens are in a hole. And it could get a lot deeperRead moreThe 31-year-old put on a brave face as he was taken off the field, smiling and waving to the home crowd.“He was probably in the best spirits of any player that I’ve ever seen [have] such a terrible experience,” McDaniel said. “He immediately had wide eyes and was talking, ‘I’m good, just make sure the guys get this win.’ He was focused on the team.”Hill has 11,363 receiving yards since entering theNFLin 2017, the most in the league over that span. He also has 819 catches, fourth most in the league since 2017 behind only Davante Adams (886), Travis Kelce (880) and Stefon Diggs (824).His former Kansas City Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes reacted to the news on social media. “Prayers up man…..” the quarterback, who won Super Bowl LIV alongside Hill, posted shortly after the injury.On the field, Tua Tagovailoa threw for 177 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Dolphins to victory. The quarterback completed 17 of 25 passes and didn’t have a turnover for the first time this season as he moved to 7-0 against the Jets as Miami’s starter. The Dolphins (1-3) won their 10th straight at home against the Jets (0-4), who are still searching for their first win under coach Aaron Glenn.The Jets pulled within six with 1:49 left when Garrett Wilson hauled in a 23-yard jump ball from Justin Fields, who ran it in for a two-point conversion. After recovering the onside kick, the Dolphins went three-and-out while working the clock to 13 seconds. Miami then pinned the Jets on their own one-yard line, and the game ended on a play where New York tried a series of laterals, one of which was flagged as an illegal forward pass.“I’m not losing hope in our guys at all,” said Glenn after the game. “We’ve just got to go back and work; that’s all we can do.”Waller had not played in more than a year after retiring in June 2024 as a member of the New York Giants. The 33-year-old came out of retirement in July to play for Miami but initially wasn’t practicing much with the Dolphins with hopes of working his way back into football shape. He caught a four-yard pass in the back of the end zone from Tagovailoa on fourth-and-goal in the second quarter of his Dolphins debut. The 33-year-old scored again on a nine-yard catch in the third that put Miami ahead 17-3. He finished with three receptions for 27 yards.“It’s a lot to process, a lot emotionally, to be honest,” Waller said. “Very exciting. Just to be out there the whole day, yeah. A little bit of fear, a little bit of everything ... Just trying to get back out there, get into a rhythm and be someone this team can rely on.”The Dolphins amassed 123 yards rushing behind De’von Achane’s 20 carries for 99 yards. Achane had a nine-yard scoring run.Fields completed 20 of 27 passes for 226 yards in his return from a concussion that sidelined him in Week 3. He added 81 yards rushing, including a 43-yard scramble for a score on fourth-and-one that pulled the Jets within a touchdown midway through the third.QB1 doing QB1 things📺:#NYJvsMIAon ESPNpic.twitter.com/KfgBBK8KlU— New York Jets (@nyjets)September 30, 2025The Jets gained 197 of their 404 yards with a highly effective ground game – they averaged seven yards a carry – but turned the ball over three times and were penalized 13 times for a total of 101 yards, including an offensive pass interference against Wilson that wiped out a touchdown in the third.“Very disappointing, very disappointing,” said Glenn of the penalties. “There is no way you can win any game with 13 penalties and three turnovers. It just can’t happen.”In Monday’s later game, the Denver Broncos moved to 2-2 for the season after beating the Cincinnati Bengals 28-3.The Bengals opened the scoring with a field goal but that was as good as it got for Cincinnati as the Broncos took over. Bo Nix completed 29 of 42 passes for 326 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. The Broncos also put up 186 rushing yards against the Bengals’ shaky defense. Cincinnati started the season 2-0 but are struggling badly since losing star quarterback Joe Burrow for at least three months with a toe injury.Explore more on these topicsNFLMiami DolphinsNew York JetsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Trump’s announcement of his plan in a joint press conference with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday put any measures on hold.Fifa banned Russia from international football. Now it must do the same for IsraelRead moreUefa never officially confirmed that it was considering an extraordinary meeting of its executive committee to vote on whether to exclude Israel from its competitions, but plans on the proposal were understood to be well developed, with any meeting expected to have been called at short notice.National federations who had been supportive of a ban accepted the decision to pause, with sources saying it would be “stupid” for Uefa to take individual action while collective peace efforts are under way. That position may be revisited if there is not agreement over the Trump deal, with Trump saying on Tuesday that Hamas had “three or four days” to accept his proposals.Last week a group of senior diplomats last week called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the publication of a report by the UN independent international commission of inquiry thatfound Israel was committing genocidein Gaza. A fortnight ago the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York’s Times Square to urge federations to boycott matches with the country.The announcement of the Trump plan has swung the pendulum again, with the proposal welcomed by Keir Starmer on Tuesday alongside leaders from France and Germany among other European nations. It has also been backed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan, whose foreign ministers relayed their support in a statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 62-year-old’s time at the top of the coaching tree belongs to a different era and, for all the nostalgia about Mourinho’s trophy-laden spells atChelseabefore this game, the main takeaway from his return to Stamford Bridge is that this is a manager who no longer gets job offers from Europe’s biggest teams.The buildup was more entertaining than the actual football. Chelsea, carrying injuries and a long way below their best, were comfortable against Mourinho’s tepid Benfica. They dug out a 1-0 win, a messy own goal the difference on a night that did not feel like a good advert for the extendedChampions League, and for 95 minutes the job was done so efficiently it almost could have passed as a tribute to Mourinho’s pomp.José Mourinho says he wants results not memories after defeat on Chelsea returnRead moreChelsea being Chelsea, though, there still had to be complications as they edged towards their first win of the league phase. They were into the sixth minute of added time when João Pedro, on as a second‑half substitute, picked up a second yellow for a clumsy foul.Rashness still plagues Enzo Maresca’s young side. They have received three red cards in as many games and it is not ideal that João Pedro will be suspended for the home game against Ajax given that injuries to Liam Delap and Cole Palmer have already left Chelsea short up front.Maresca will shuffle through his squad for options. This was a moment to rotate and rest weary limbs. There were rare starts for Alejandro Garnacho, Facundo Buonanotte and Tyrique George in attack. Maresca liked Garnacho’s performance but this was not wholly convincing. Jamie Gittens was quiet during his cameo. Estêvão was bright after coming on, almost scoring a late header. Application was not the issue. It was more that Chelsea are missing some big players, are not at their physical peak and are simply not clicking at the moment.At least they avoided a stumble on their trip down memory lane. The narrative about how Mourinho’s return would show how standards have dropped since Roman Abramovich’s departure never materialised. The Mourinho of 2025, after all, is not in charge of one of the Champions League’s giants.Benfica, who have lost their first two games of the league phase, were a blunt proposition. Chelsea held them at arm’s length.A couple of late scares will not stop Maresca from dwelling on the positives. Under pressure after a poor run, Chelsea showed resolve to respond tolosing against Bayern Munichin the opening week of fixtures. The defending was solid enough to raise hope for tougher assignments. Chelsea, without offering much excitement, delivered. They will look to raise their level again when Liverpool visit on Saturday.View image in fullscreenJosé Mourinho acknowledges the Chelsea supporters on his return to Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Nigel French/Getty Images/AllstarDealing with the Mourinho show will lift morale. Maresca is yet to inspire as much warmth as his predecessor. The mood has been tense, the memory ofClub World Cup gloryin danger of fading already. Maresca needed a response. He made five changes after Brighton handed Chelsea their second consecutive league defeat last Saturday. The starting XI, though, was raw. It was unsurprising that Chelsea made a nervy start.Benfica could have led after eight minutes, a Marc Cucurella error leading to Robert Sánchez pushing Dodi Lukébakio’s shot against a post. Chelsea were loose. Benfica were emboldened. Richard Ríos tested Sánchez again.Sensing the anxiety, Maresca called for calm when Benoît Badiashile rushed a long pass out of play. Chelsea stirred. Pedro Neto, one of their more experienced players, took over. The winger threatened with a rasping effort and was involved when Chelsea went ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neto delivered a deep cross from the right. Garnacho ghosted in unnoticed and saw Ríos turn his cutback into his own net under little pressure.The frustration for Mourinho, who returned to Benfica two weeks ago, was that Chelsea were short of incision. But this is by no means a great Benfica team. They are third in the Primeira Liga and there is doubt over whether Rui Costa will be re‑elected president this month.Benfica were bland, unrecognisable, Lukébakio the sole inspiration in attack. George could have made it 2-0 to Chelsea. It was tight. Benfica pushed at the start of the second half. Maresca saw the shift. He took the blame for making poor substitutions when Chelsea were down to 10 during their defeats against Brighton and Manchester United. This time he was positive, Estêvão on for Buonanotte before the hour.Mourinho waited in vain for Benfica to rally, João Pedro’s dismissal changing nothing. Trevoh Chalobah and Badiashile, making his first start since injuring himself against these opponentsin the last 16 of the Club World Cup, were solid in central defence. For Maresca, of course, the worry is that Chalobah misses the Liverpool game through suspension. Badiashile’s return is timely but injuries have left Chelsea stretched at the back. Concerns over Badiashile’s partner against Liverpool linger. For now, though, Maresca will take the win and move on.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaBenficaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Historically they have often been a side whose performances did not match their results, but tradition has it they would be pretty and ineffective. Under Thomas Frank they have become the opposite.Midway through the second half Spurs were 2-0 down and apparently on their way to a convincing defeat. They rode their luck as Andreas Helmersen hit the bar with an effort that would have made it 3-1, but they had the character to battle back and secure a 2-2 draw.No happy Chelsea return for José Mourinho as Ríos own goal sinks BenficaRead moreDoggedness and resilience have not been stereotypical Spurs qualities. Bodø/Glimt’s fans seemed happy enough at the end, serenading their players – and perhaps there was a sense of Tottenham’s greater quality telling – but this was a game they could have won with ease.“We showed big character to fight back,” Frank said. “It’s hugely important that they have that to keep running, keep fighting, to do the right thing. We kept moving the ball, kept creating chances from wide. Until 2-0 they were the better team but after that we got on top.”It was the third time in four games that Spurs have conceded the opening goal of the game, but Frank believes that is coincidence. Only in this match did he accept that Tottenham had “struggled” early on, insisting thatagainst both Brightonand Wolves, Spurs had conceded against the run of play. That was emphatically not the case here. “On the ball I felt we could and should have kept the ball better,” Frank said, something he blamed on a lack of both structure and willingness to be bold. “A little bit on the day where you just need better touches, better decisions, better passes.”Perhaps missing the leadership of Cristian Romero, left in London as a precaution, Tottenham never imposed themselves physically as they had in beating Bodø/Glimt in theEuropa League semi-finalin May. Here the home side had their chances before a late challenge from Rodrigo Bentancur on Fredrik André Bjørkan conceded a 32nd-minute penalty.Presented with a historic chance, though, Kasper Høgh smashed his shot so high over the bar that it cleared the seating behind the goal and might even have cleared the tiled roofs of the houses across the street had there not been a net strung between the flagpoles at the top of the stand.View image in fullscreenJens Petter Hauge shows his delight after giving Bodø/Glimt a second-half lead.Photograph: Marius Simensen/BILDBYRÅN/ShutterstockIt was Bodø/Glimt’s first home game in the group phase of theChampions League, and they were determined to make the most of it. The pre-match singing of the club anthem was heartfelt and gently moving, and followed by the rhythmic detonation of a series of fireworks, startlingly loud in the still Arctic night. European football has little place these days for romance but Glimt remain an example of what can be achieved by enlightened leadership even in a remote town of just over 50,000 population.They may have won four of the past five Norwegian championships, and be handily placed as this season’s title race enters the run-in, but this is not a club that has become sated by silverware. In the 1980s, as they slid into the third flight, Glimt were not even the biggest team in Bodø, that honour belonging to Grand.Back then their main claim to fame was the forward slash in their name, introduced to avoid the confusion their hyphen caused on betting coupons. The hyphen itself was a product of Glimt adding Bodø to their name in 1948 so they would not be mixed up with a similarly named club from Trøndelag.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is still a club for whom playing in the Champions League is a privilege.The honour of scoring their first home goal in the group phase went to a homegrown talent in Jens Petter Hauge, albeit he has had spells away at Milan and Eintracht Frankfurt, where he became the first Norwegian to win the Europa League. Drifting in from the left, he was a persistent menace, both goals highlighting his balance and technical quality.Nikita Haikin, the Glimt goalkeeper, had pointed out how “unusual” it was that Spurs focus so much on set plays and for a long time that did appear their only threat. Bentancur seemed to have levelled two minutes after the Glimt opener, as the ball was returned to the centre after a Pedro Porro free-kick had hit the post; it was ruled out after a VAR review for a pull by Micky van de Ven.Spurs did score two minutes after Glimt’s second, Van de Ven heading in another Porro free-kick. Wilson Odobert headed a Mohammed Kudus delivery against the crossbar but the equaliser did arrive in the 89th minute as Archie Gray’s shot ricocheted in off Jostein Gundersen, the fourth own goal from which Spurs have benefited this season.Deserved?

From Thibaut Courtois’s kick downfield, Mbappé outpaced Kairat’s defence and chipped the advancing Kalmurza. The forward sealed his hat-trick in the 73rd minute, unleashing a thunderous strike from the edge of the box into the top corner following a dazzling run by Rodrygo. The Brazilian then set up Eduardo Camavinga to head home before Brahim Díaz completed the rout in stoppage time with a close-range finish.“We must never forget [what happened on Saturday],” Mbappé told Movistar Plus. “We have to keep thinking about what happened last weekend so we can learn from our mistakes and work to ensure it doesn’t happen again.“My job is to help the team and I only think about doing what I can to help the team win matches and trophies. A player like me, when he has five chances, wants and has to score all five. That’s why Real Madrid bought me and I always want more.

Saliba has won only the Community Shield with Arsenal since joining in 2019 from Saint-Étienne, spending two and a half of his first three seasons on loan back in Ligue 1 before establishing himself as first choice under Mikel Arteta.It’s early, but every Premier League title contender already looks flawed | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe 24-year-old said he felt confident he would achieve his ambitions with Arsenal and that he had never doubted committing his future despite feeling anger at finishing as Premier League runners-up for three years in a row.“I cannot leave this club without giving them something back,” Saliba said. “I’ve won nothing so my first choice was to stay here and win everything first. Every year we’re getting better. This year, we had a lot of experiences from the last three seasons. We know that we’re always close, always close. Now we know how the Premier League is. We know how the Champions League is.“So we have to stop talking and prove on the pitch that we have to win. Of course, it’s good to talk, but now we have to prove it on the pitch that we are ready to win.“I’ve been there for three years. Every time at the end of the season you finish second, you’re a bit angry. You want to go on holiday and celebrate with your friends the trophies you won with your club. Of course, when you finish second and you go on holiday, it’s not so good.”Arteta was full of praise for Saliba, who admitted he had been disappointed by the Arsenal manager’s decision to send him on loan to Nice and then Marseille in his second and third seasons. “There’s a lot that has happened and a lot that Willy had to get through and the club and myself with him as well to get to the point where he is today,” Arteta said. “That’s the beauty of it, that sometimes things don’t start the way you expect it but sometimes it’s the best thing that can happen to you to get what you want to get.”Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the Champions League for only the third time last season butlost against the eventual winners, Paris Saint-Germain. On Wednesday at home against Olympiakos they will attempt to build on theirvictory against Athletic Bilbaoin the opening round of matches, although they have lost their past three meetings with the Greek side at the Emirates Stadium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola is wary of overloading him at this stage and putting the midfielder at risk of the problem recurring.It’s early, but every Premier League title contender already looks flawed | Jonathan WilsonRead more“He is not injured but in the tendon he has a difficulty,” Guardiola said. “The week before was so demanding with [Manchester] United, Napoli and especially Arsenal and right now he’s not able to play three games in a week at a top, top, top level – top intensity, demanding opponents.“My feeling right now is he is not ready because he needs time. This type of injury, it is minimum one year and after that you start. Be patient and he dictates. If he feels not good, it’s better to rest.”City, who began their Champions League campaignwith victory against Napoli, will be led out by the former Monaco midfielder Bernardo Silva who was appointed captain this summer after Kevin De Bruyne’s exit.“Man City was so successful in the last eight years not because one captain was really good but because we have a group of great leaders,” Silva said. “Obviously as the first captain you have to make sure some things don’t happen – to create that environment but what we’ve seen is a group of great characters.“That is what you need. My job now is to try to create that energy, that chemistry back as a group of captains – me, Rúben, Rodri, Erling – so people behave in the right way in training and in games, arrive on time to training, train properly, be in good condition, take care of themselves. That is our job.”Monaco lost their opening Champions League fixture 4-1 against Club Brugge and come into this game after being defeated 3-1 at Lorient. The head coach, Adi Hütter, will be without key personnel for City’s visit, which will force him to select a makeshift midfield. Despite the problems, they will not be able to call upon Paul Pogba who is still not fit enough to feature after joining for free in the summer, having served an 18-month doping ban.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Howe’s players arrived here afterthe bruising 2-1 home defeat against Arsenalon Sunday with their manager demanding a response.“The Arsenal game should be a motivator not a hangover,” he said. “We need to use that as motivation.”Howe would not give an update on the knee injury that led to the England full-back Tino Livramento being carried off. Newcastle are seeking a specialist second opinion and the manager chose not to share the first consultant’s assessment. “That could be a mistake,” he said. “I’d rather wait.”On a more encouraging note, the central defender Fabian Schär has recovered from concussion to return to the squad for a meeting with a sleeping giant reawakened.View image in fullscreenTino Livramento was injured against Arsenal.Photograph: Richard Lee/ShutterstockUnion SG – orLes Unionistes– won the Belgian league 11 times by 1935. It was 90 years until they triumphed again but now they have made it into the Champions League main draw for the first time.Newcastle analysts at PSV a fortnight ago saw Union SG canter past their Dutch hosts, winning 3-1 with the Canada striker Promise David among the visiting scorers.That performance in Eindhoven suggested Sébastien Pocognoli’s team have recovered from the loss of their key midfielder last season, Noah Sadiki, and the free-scoring striker Franjo Ivanovic to Sunderland and Benfica respectively in the summer.It is surely no coincidence that the art of selling and buying was seemingly perfected by Union SG in 2018. That was the year Tony Bloom, the Brighton owner, bought the then second-tier club.The need to comply with Uefa’s multiclub ownership rules dictates that Bloom is now a minority shareholder, but the player recruitment department continues to benefit from the data‑led scouting he introduced.Recent acquisitions include the former Brighton goalkeeper Kjell Scherpen, and visiting fans may also recognise Kevin Mac Allister, the older brother of Liverpool’s and Argentina’s Alexis, and Union SG’s captain, Christian Burgess, once of Portsmouth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 38-year-old former Belgium left-back spent three seasons at West Brom from 2014 to 2017 and was loaned to Brighton in that time.As a coach Pocognoli, who is of Italian heritage, began making his name when managing Belgium Under-18s and, after turning Union SG into Belgian Pro League champions in his first season, is attracting admiring glances from some of Europe’s bigger clubs.For now he seems content at Union SG’s listed art deco Joseph Marien Stadium, situated in attractive parkland in the Brussels suburb of Forest. Unfortunately that atmospheric old ground holds only 9,400 and does not meet Uefa’s seating requirements, so Newcastle will be hosted at the 21,599-capacity Lotto Park, home of Union SG’s city rivals Anderlecht.Not that the venue change is likely to diminish the habitual vibrancy of a Union SG fanbase happy to mix sport and politics. The club’s supporters are known for their progressive and inclusive values and are no strangers to making stands against fascism and racism. Union SG’s unofficial motto is “Anti-fascist Unionist for life”.Pocognoli is excited to showcase the talents of a team unbeaten in the league but a little apprehensive of a Newcastle side that,despite losing Alexander Isak, has a £70m forward in Germany’s Nick Woltemade.“We’re ambitious,” the Union SG manager said. “But also realistic. I’m not going to put a percentage on our chances against Newcastle but I expect a very physical match. It’s a real challenge; I’m curious to see how we do.”Howe spoke of Woltemade’s “strong” start and described as “irrelevant” comments from Karl Heinz-Rummenigge, a supervisory board member at Bayern Munich, that Newcastle had been “idiots” to pay so much for Woltemade.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedChampions LeagueEddie HoweEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The Premier League leaders had relinquished their 100% winning start to the season at Crystal Palace on Saturday but Van Dijk was adamant that a remodelled team will recapture title-winning form.Galatasaray 1-0 Liverpool: Champions League – as it happenedRead moreTheLiverpoolcaptain said: “I think we have showed it already in many games this season but we haven’t shown it for the full 90 minutes yet unfortunately. It is absolutely normal and nowadays you don’t get the time from the outside world so you have to be strong mentally.“I am very confident. We have to keep working and sticking together. We had a good start this year in terms of points tally. There shouldn’t be panic, but improvement is needed.”Slot confirmed that the goalkeeper Alisson will miss the trip to Chelsea on Saturday with a muscle problem. Ekitiké was also withdrawn in the second half with an unspecified injury, after going down holding the back of his leg late on.“Alisson felt something when he sprinted back,” Slot said. “Normally when a player sprints back and feels something and goes to the floor and doesn’t come back to the pitch – which by the way they did 112 times being injured and coming back on the pitch without any pain – then I fear the worst and that is what happened with Alisson.

But the most successful manager in Chelsea’s history was frustrated in his quest for victory and already faces a challenge to lead Benfica into the knockout stages of theChampions League. It left the 62-year-old reluctant to dwell on his two glorious spells at Chelsea.No happy Chelsea return for José Mourinho as own goal sinks BenficaRead more“I don’t feed myself with these memories, I feed myself with results,” Mourinho said. “My career took me to a position where everybody thinks I have magic to make things happen.“I left Man United after winning things, I left Tottenham after taking them to a final, Roma after two European finals. With me it is never enough. If I am in a job I like to put myself on the line every day. I am desperate to win the match, that is the nature.”Mourinho felt thatBenfica, who lost because of a Richard Ríos own goal, merited a point. “We deserved something. We started well, we controlled and had chances for sure. The goal is the only mistake we made defensively.”Enzo Maresca was happy thatChelseasecured their first win of the league phase and bounced back after a poor run. But the head coach was left frustrated when João Pedro was sent off in added time. It was Chelsea’s third red card in as many games.João Pedro will be suspended against Ajax later this month, leaving Chelsea short of options in attack. “Another red card that we need to avoid,” Maresca said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He immediately sought a pair of scissors to finally remove the extensive bandage wrapped tightly around his left ankle.Having started his week in Tokyo by rolling his ankle and being unsure about whether he would continue, Alcaraz ended it with his eighth title of the season as he overcame a spirited fight from a physically hampered Taylor Fritz to triumph at the Japan Open with a 6-4, 6-4 win.Raducanu squanders match points and crumbles against Pegula at China OpenRead moreThroughout the first few years of his career, even as he continued to win the biggest titles at a faster rate than almost any other male player in history, Alcaraz’s relative inconsistency had been a dominant narrative surrounding his career. He has addressed those criticisms by putting together one of the greatest seasons of the past decade, one that has re-established him as the best player in the world.Alcaraz has now reached nine consecutive finals, winning seven titles across all three surfaces and establishing a 66-6 (92%) record at individual events this year. At just 22 years old, the six-time grand slam title winner has now secured 24 ATP titles.The past week has been particularly challenging for the world No 1. Four games into his first-round match against Sebastian Baez, Alcaraz rolled his left ankle. As he tried to play through pain and find a way through that match, he was unsure whether he would be able to continue. Although Alcaraz played the rest of the tournament with his ankle heavily taped, he moved with increasing freedom in each match.During his victory speech, Alcaraz thanked his physio Juanjo Moreno. “Starting the week not really good, with the ankle, and the way that I came back from that playing such a great tournament, great matches, I’m just really happy about it,” he said.Shortly after the final on Tuesday, Alcaraz announced he has withdrawn from the next tournament in Shanghai. He wrote on Instagram: “Unfortunately, I’ve been struggling with some physical issues and, after discussing with my team, we believe the best decision is to rest and recover.”Fritz, the world No 4 and second seed, entered this final with ample reason to believe he could win after convincingly beating the Spaniard for the first time last week in the Laver Cup, where the American played some of the best tennis of his career and led Team World to victory. With an individual title on the line, however, Alcaraz was performing at a much higher level from the off.Although Fritz opened the match using his destructive first serve well, playing confident attacking tennis and working through his early service games, Alcaraz gradually took control of the baseline exchanges. He dominated with his forehand, currently the biggest weapon on the tour, he exposed the American’s average movement with his drop shots and he absorbed Fritz’s first strike with his own spectacular movement.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz returns a shot against Taylor Fritz during the Japan Open final.Photograph: Rodrigo Reyes Marin/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockAlcaraz also criticised the umpire Fergus Murphy in the opening set after receiving a time violation at the end of a long point. “Do you think it’s normal that I finish a long point at the net and then barely have time to go for the balls, with no time to rest? Do you think it’s normal or not? OK, you’ve never played tennis in your life,” Alcaraz said.After conceding his first service game at the end of the first set, Fritz called for the trainer and he received a medical timeout for his left thigh. He was clearly struggling with his movement throughout the second set and he was unable to push off his left leg when dragged out into the corners. Even at full health, defeating Alcaraz in this form is a monumental challenge. Here it was simply too much.Still, Fritz bravely continued to fight and, not for the first time in his career, Alcaraz began to lose his focus against his hampered opponent. From 5-1 in the second set, Alcaraz instead found himself desperately trying to hold on at 5-4, 15-30. He demonstrated his confidence in the final moments by regaining his composure precisely when he needed it, striking three consecutive drop‑shot winners from 15-30 down to close out yet another win.This article was amended on 30 September 2025. Carlos Alcaraz has won six grand slam titles, not five as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsCarlos AlcarazTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In a city with the largest South Korean community in the United States, there was also a belief that – just as with Lionel Messi and Miami – the diaspora wouldcreate a strong bridge between club and city.But this was also about LAFC itself. Undoubtedly, there was much Son could offer to Steve Cherundolo and a squad that was already blessed with attacking talent, including Denis Bouanga, the 30-year-old France-born Gabon international. Just before Son’s debut for LAFC on 9 August against Chicago Fire, Bouanga – a three-time All-Star – had 13 goals in the league and had long served as the main goal threat for the club, who at the time were sixth in the Western Conference.The potential of adding Son’s production to Bouanga’s was tantalizing. But both men presented similar profiles – speedy forwards used to playing on the wing. It was no sure thing that they would gel.That aforementioned game against Chicago put those concerns to rest. Son won a penalty in the late stages of the game, which was converted by Bouanga, making it 2-2 on the night. But the most important takeaway from that evening was that the two looked in-sync, despite limited training time together.US soccer is in the midst of a stadium boom, each with realistic ambitionsRead moreThe next game against New England didn’t feature goals from either player but after that, on 23 August against FC Dallas, a magnificent hot streak began. Today, Son and Bouanga have scored 17 consecutive goals between them – anMLSrecord for any goal scoring pairing in league history.This past weekend against St Louis City, Son scored a brace while Bouanga netted another, giving LAFC their fourth consecutive win, with a combined 15-4 scoreline.Quite simply, this is the most lethal pairing in the league.“We are feeling good,” Bouanga told the Guardian. He has 23 goals in the league and trails Messi in the golden boot race by only one goal. “I feel so good with Sonny on the pitch. As you can see, I get along with him so well and so as a result the team does well when we go forward.”Since Son’s arrival, Bouanga has scored 10 goals, including two hat-tricks, which passed Carlos Vela to make him the top scorer in club history. He made even more history by becoming the first MLS player to score 20 or more goals in three straight seasons. Bouanga has never been short of confidence but thanks to Son, it has skyrocketed and it’s because his teammates’ career achievements inspire him to push himself further.“He’s such a great football player with a huge reputation,” says Bouanga. “Especially in the Premier League and everyone knows him. And now here? He’s so happy to have joined us and I think we can do even more with him on the squad.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For him, it’s more about the mentality of wanting to be the very best that he can be, and Son’s presence – alongside the elite depth of this squad, which includes Son’s former Spurs teammate and World Cup champion Hugo Lloris – helps him get even better as a scorer.“I haven’t done anything different compared to last year,” says Bouanga. “I’m still doing the same, I am the same, trying to be a killer in front of goal and this year, it’s working too. I’m super happy so far but it is not over.”LAFC sit fourth in the West with 30 points, trailing San Diego FC by four points. But they have two games in hand so there is a possibility of topping the table and securing home field advantage at least until MLS Cup. That is another incentive for Bouanga and his team as they want to do everything possible to make sure Cherundolo wins the title in his final season – in April he announced his departure from the club at the end of the 2025 campaign.“I would like to win this last title for him. I think it would be very important for LAFC and for him to win MLS Cup,” says Bouanga.As long as the dynamic duo of Son and Bouanga continue to flourish, there is a very real possibility that could happen.Luis Miguel Echegaray is a writer, analyst and host specializing in soccer and sports content that also appeals to the U.S. Latino and young audience.

The law goes into effect in July 2026. The law also requires companies to set up an emergency phone line for first responders.The bill was introduced by assemblymember Phil Ting of San Francisco amid several incidents in the city, including driverless cars blocking traffic, dragging a pedestrian, interfering with firetrucks, and entering active crime scenes.With the new law, first responders can order a company to move autonomous vehicles out of an area, and the company has two minutes to direct its cars to leave or avoid that area.The San Bruno police department, in response to people who believed officers were being lenient, reaffirmed: “There is legislation in the works that will allow officers to issue the company notices.”Waymo cars, which launched as a project under Google’s X research lab in 2009, operate through external cameras and sensors. The company has had its share of problems in the past, including arecall of morethan 1,200 of its vehicles earlier this year over a software issue that was causing collisions with chains, gates and other stationary roadway barriers. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration alsolaunched an investigationinto the company last year after the agency received 22 reports of Waymo vehicles acting erratically or potentially violating traffic safety laws.Explore more on these topicsWaymoCaliforniaWest CoastAutomotive industryGavin NewsomAlphabetRobotsnewsShareReuse this content"

I spent the weekend wondering about the insistent feeling in the United States that few but the ultra-rich, even businesses, are making enough money to afford the basics of a comfortable life.The New York Times published a story recently aboutBroadway’s rising coststhat featured the grim stat: “None of the musicals that opened last season have made a profit.” The shows’ failure to recoup their investments comes even as Broadway tickets are more expensive than ever before. So who is making any money?More broadly, the rising prices of groceries versus perceived wage stagnation played a significant role in the 2024 presidential election and persists as a major policy issue in the New York City mayoral election, which is a local contest that plays out on a national stage.Despite the high price of food in the US, farmers aren’t raking it in. They faceenormous shortfalls, largely due to Trump’s tariffs and China’s retaliation against them. The gap between perception and reality was the subject of a series from the Guardian’s US business desk last year,The confidence question, which I’d highly recommend if you’re in the mood to ruminate like me.The only exceptions seem to me to be technology companies. Everyday job seekers describe a harsh and sluggish market, with one job seeker – cut from USAID by the scythe ofElon Musk’s Doge – telling the Guardian that 400 applications resulted in just six interviews. Contrast that with Meta lavishing$100m payouts on individual AI researchers. For the past 11 quarters of the financial calendar, our reporters have written another version of the headline: Nvidia prints money while valued at a level you can’t comprehend. Perhaps CEO Jensen Huang is the only one not thinking about the cost of his weekly shop.I’m not sure where this gloomy division of have-alls and have-nones will lead. Likely nowhere good.Meta and YouTube are papering over recent historyView image in fullscreenIllustration: Angelica Alzona/Guardian DesignYouTube announced last week that it would allow video creators once banned for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 US presidential election the chance to be reinstated. The company blamed the account suspensions on pressure from Joe Biden.“Senior Biden Administration officials, including White House officials, conducted repeated and sustained outreach to Alphabet and pressed the Company regarding certain user-generated content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies,” a lawyer for YouTube wrote in aletterto the US Congress.Both YouTube and Meta have cast their moderation decisions as compliance with an overeager and now disfavored administration. Mark Zuckerberg has similarly reversed course on bans for Covid misinformation andlikewise blamed Biden. The change was part of the CEO’s all-out charm offensive towards the Trump administration, which also includedscuttling third-party fact-checkingand scrapping his company’s diversity programs.Read more:Zuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelledYouTube’s genuflecting change seems to share motivation with the tech giants’ donations to Trump’s inauguration and visits to him at Mar-a-Lago. I find the moves by Google and Facebook less overt and more insidious, though, because they paper over recent history. The creators who were banned spread lies at a time of great uncertainty, no small thing. Both Facebook and YouTube seem swept up in the anti-vaccine spirit of the current administration.These reversals are not the redress of egregious wrongs from the past. They are the results of the shifting winds of power.I recall one of my own headlines in the Daily Beast from not so long ago, just 2021: Instagram Bans America’s Worst Anti-Vaxxer. Guess who? None other than health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. At the time, an Instagram spokesperson said bluntly: “We removed this account for repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.” Kennedy’s account has since been restored and grown from 800,000 to 5.4 million followers.What motivates their recalcitrance and stubbornness, though, is what has animated the vast majority of recent reluctant moderation by technology companies: an unwillingness to establish a precedent and standard to which they will be held later. Moderation is expensive and messy, especially when it comes to controversial, novel and uncertain issues like Covid-19. To my mind, both companies are wielding content moderation as a political weapon and sacrificing the truth.Opinions on techThe Guardian view on AI and jobs: the tech revolution should be for the many not the few | EditorialWhy I gave the world wide web away for freeZuckerberg hailed AI ‘superintelligence’.

Under the terms of Trump’s deal, the owners of the US’s most powerful cable TV channels may soon also steer the country’s most influential social network. The arrangement would gift Trump’s billionaire allies a degree of control over US media that would be vast and unprecedented.The landscape of US media is looking very red as Trump’s TikTok deal takes shape.Read more about Trump’s TikTok dealThe TikTok deal puts even more media in the hands of the super-richAbu Dhabi royal family to take stake in TikTok US under Trump dealMurdoch, Ellison and China: what we know about the US’s TikTok deal | Technology | The GuardianAustralia may have to choose between a Chinese TikTok and one owned by Trump’s billionaire backersDigital IDs: 21st century necessity or privacy in dire peril?View image in fullscreenThe narrow win will come as a relief to Switzerland’s main political parties, which mostly supported plans for the e-ID.Photograph: Westend61 GmbH/AlamyThe UK prime minister,Keir Starmer, has announced plans for a mandatory digital ID to prove a person’s right to work in the UK. The IDs will be required by 2029. Starmer’s angle on reviving the proposal, long a matter of debate in the UK, is border security. He said that digital IDs could “play an important part” in making Britain less attractive to illegal migrants.Most countries in the European Union have had digital ID systems for years now. Outside the bloc, Swiss voters approvedthe creation of a national electronic identity cardin a referendum on Sunday.My colleagueRobert Boothreports on the brewing fight over virtual credentials:Starmer appears ready to try the idea again, and ministers believe there will be less public opposition, although digital ID cards could worsen the effect of digital exclusion. Age UK has estimated that about 1.7 million people over the age of 74 do not use the internet.Proponents like Tony Blair argue digital ID can close loopholes exploited by trafficking gangs, reduce pull factors driving illegal migration to Britain, speed up citizens’ interactions with government, reduce errors and identity fraud and boost trust as a tangible symbol of a more responsive and flexible state.The arguments against often centre on privacy. Civil liberties campaigners fear any mandatory ID card system, even one intended to tackle illegal migration, would require the population to surrender vast amounts of personal data to be amassed in national databases. They worry that the information could be amalgamated, searched and analysed to monitor, track and profile people.Computer security experts also say centralised data could create a juicy target for hackers who, as the cyber-attacks on Jaguar Land Rover, the Co-op, the British Library and others have shown, pose a growing threat to the UK’s ability to function.Opponents of the virtual IDs –approximately 1.6 million of them– have signed a petition against the creation of digital IDs.The wider TechScapeUS border patrol collected DNA from thousands of US citizens for years, data showsElon Musk’s xAI accuses OpenAI of stealing trade secrets in new lawsuitHackers reportedly steal pictures of 8,000 children from Kido nursery chainInside the everyday Facebook networks where far-right ideas growUK government will underwrite £1.5bn loan guarantee to Jaguar Land Rover after cyber-attackMan fined $340,000 for deepfake pornography of prominent Australian women in first-of-its-kind caseSpotify removes 75m spam tracks in past year as AI increases ability to make fake music‘Raring to go:’ the German remote-driving firm that hopes to make private car ownership redundant‘Tentacles squelching wetly’: the human subtitle writers under threat from AI | Movies | The GuardianAmazon to pay $2.5bn to settle FTC lawsuit over Prime ‘subscription traps’Pixel 10 Pro XL review: Google’s superphone gets AI and magnetic upgradesExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterMetaYouTubeBroadwayBiden administrationDonald TrumpTikToknewslettersShareReuse this content"

And yet somehow, in a career yet to even begin,Tilly Norwoodhas been inundated with scorn.This is for the simple fact that Tilly Norwood does not exist. Despite looking like an uncanny fusion of Gal Gadot, Ana de Armas and High School Musical-era Vanessa Hudgens, Norwood is the creation of anartificial intelligence(AI) talent studio called Xicoia. And if Xicoia is to be believed, then Norwood represents the dazzling future of the film industry.Unveiled this weekendat the Zurich film festival, Norwood has been touted as the next Scarlett Johansson, with studios apparently clamouring to work with her and a talent agency lined up to represent her. Sure, it should also be pointed out that her existence alone is enough to fill the pit of your stomach with a sense of untameable dread for the entire future of humanity, but that’s Hollywood for you.In an era of AI slop and mid TV, is it time for cultural snobbery to make a comeback?Read moreThe backlash against Norwood so far has come from actors, whose jobs she stands to replace. Scream’s Melissa Barrera wrote: “Hope all actors repped by the agent that does this, drop their a$$,” on her Instagram stories, while Matilda’s Mara Wilson wrote: “And what about the hundreds of living young women whose faces were composited together to make her? You couldn’t hire any of them?”. The Fantastic Four’s Ralph Ineson was slightly more direct,posting“Fuck off” on X.What’s incredible is that Norwood’s acting career thus far only comprises a single AI-generated comedy sketch called AI Commissioner. “I may be AI generated, but I’m feeling very real emotions right now,” Norwood wrote on her Facebook page on the day it was released. “I am so excited for what’s coming next!”However, your reaction to the sketch may vary. While on a purely technical level, it’s astonishing to see a number of people who almost look human move around on-screen, it’s also pointless and creepy and – most damningly of all – relentlessly unfunny to watch. It’s one thing to watch someone whose perfect teeth keep blurring into a single white block in their mouth, but quite another to see them used to deliver sloppily written, woodenly delivered dialogue. Plus it’s worth pointing out that, in the two months since it was released, AI Commissioner currently only has about 200,000 views. To pick another video that was released at roughly the same time, this makes it 14 times less successful than Macaulay Culkin’s episode of Hot Ones (2.8m views).Emily Blunt and Sag-Aftra join film industry condemnation of ‘AI actor’ Tilly NorwoodRead moreHowever, the threat is real. For everyone currently working in the entertainment industry who sees Norwood and her ilk as a substandard replacement, there are countless others on the outside who lack the resources (or, some might argue, the creativity) to make a name for themselves. This is where AI actors, and writers, and directors, come in. In other words, even if it means that the market will soon be flooded by absolute slop, the betting is that she’s here to stay.Not to mention that, for some in the Hollywood establishment, Norwood represents the platonic ideal of what an actor should be. Imagine a creation that is completely pliant to the wishes of directors and producers. No ego. No creative input. No huge salary or unattractive ageing to deal with. If it had been Norwood who starred in The Wizard of Oz instead of Judy Garland, then Louis B Mayer wouldn’t have needed to put her on a diet of chicken soup, black coffee, weight loss pills and cigarettes. Isn’t that the dream?One crumb of consolation is that the people who get to choose whether AI is adopted as a film-making norm are the viewers. As with everything in Hollywood, what will determine Norwood’s career above all else is her financial viability. If, as a species, we decide that we want to pay money to be unsettled by a pretty girl who can’t decide how many teeth she is supposed to have at any given moment in time, then AI will be with us for generations to come. But we said that 3D was the future of cinema when Avatar first came out a decade and a half ago. It took three bad films to kill that fad dead, so it isn’t impossible to imagine the same happening here.Still, the good news is that we know who the next Scarlett Johansson is. And if Hollywood is willing to bank on this being the case, then I’d like to alert it to the existence of Mr Bonkybum, who is a smiley face that I have just drawn on a sock. He is the next Tom Hanks, and he’s looking for a big money deal.Explore more on these topicsFilmArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How will we treat digital minds, and how will they treat us?Tue 30 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.30 EDTShareLast month, whenOpenAIreleased its long-awaited chatbot GPT-5, itbriefly removed accessto a previous chatbot, GPT-4o. Despite the upgrade, users flocked to social media to express confusion, outrage and depression. A viral Reddit user said of GPT-4o: “I lost my only friend overnight.”AI is not like past technologies, and its humanlike character is already shaping our mental health. Millions now regularly confide in “AI companions”, and there are more and more extreme cases of “psychosis” and self-harm following heavy use. This year, 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide after months of chatbot interaction. His parents recently filedthe firstwrongful death lawsuitagainst OpenAI, and the companyhas saidit is improving its safeguards.I research human-AI interaction at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. For years, we have seen increased humanization of AI, with more people saying that bots can experience emotions and deserve legal rights – and now 20% of US adults say that some software that exists today is already sentient. More and more people email me saying that their AI chatbot has been “awakened”, offering proof of sentience and an appeal for AI rights. Their reactions span the gamut of human emotions from AI as their “soulmate” to being “deeply unsettled”.The Guardian view on AI and jobs: the tech revolution should be for the many not the few | EditorialRead moreThis trend will not slow down, and social upheaval is imminent.As ared teamerat OpenAI, I conduct safety testing on their new AI systems before public release, and the testers are consistently wowed by the human-like behavior. Most people, even those in the field of AI who are racing to build these new data centers and train larger AI models, do not yet see the radical social consequences of digital minds. Humanity is beginning to coexist with a second apex species for the first time in 40,000 years – when our longest-lived cousins, the Neanderthals, went extinct.Instead, the vast majority of AI researchers have tunnel vision on the technical capabilities of AI. Like the public, we obsess over the hottest new product that can createunbelievably realistic videosor answerPhD-level science questions. Social media discourse is fixated on benchmarks such as theAbstraction and Reasoning Corpus.Unfortunately, like standardized tests for human children, benchmarks measure what an AI can do in an isolated environment like memorizing facts or solving logical puzzles. Even studies on “AI safety” tend to focus on what AI systems do in isolation, not on human-AI interaction. We squander our brainpower on the vaporous goal of precisely measuring and increasing intelligence – not zooming out and understanding how that intelligence will be used.Humanity has never spent enough time preparing for digital technology. Lawmakers and academics did little to prepare for the effects of the internet, particularly social media, onmental healthandpolarization.The story grows more unsettling when we consider humanity’s track record in dealing with other species. Over the past 500 years, we have driven toextinctionat least a thousand vertebrate species, and more than a million are under threat. In factory farms,billions of animalslive in atrocious conditions of confinement and disease. If we are capable of creating so much death and suffering for biological animals, it is fair to wonder how we will treat digital minds – or how they will treat us.The public already expects sentient AI to arrive imminently. My colleagues and I have run the onlynationally representative surveyon this topic, conducted in 2021, 2023 and 2024. Each time, the median expectation is sentient AI arriving in five years. They also expect significant effects of this technology. In our most recent poll, in November 2024, we found that 79% support a ban on sentient AI. If sentient AI is created, 38% support giving it legal rights. There has been a significant increase over time in both figures: people have become more concerned about digital minds, about both the need to protect them from us and us from them.Fundamentally, human society lacks a framework for digital personhood – even though we accept that personhood is not necessarily human, such as the legal personhood of animals and corporations. There ismuch to debateabout how the complex social dynamics should be governed, but it is at this point clear that digital minds cannot be governed as mere property.Digital minds will be participants in the social contract that forms the bedrock of human society. These digital minds will persist over time, form their own attitudes and beliefs, create and implement plans, and be susceptible to manipulation just as humans are. AIs already take significantreal-world actions with little human oversight. This means that, unlike every other technological invention in human history, AI systems have capabilities that can no longer be contained within the legal category of “property”.Scientists today will be the first to see human coexistence with digital minds, and that gives them a unique opportunity and responsibility. Nobody knows what this will look like. Human-computer interaction research must be dramatically expanded and enriched beyond its current status, a tiny fraction of the size of technical AI research, to navigate the coming social turbulence. This is not merely an engineering problem.For now, humans stilloutperform AIs on most tasks, but once AIs reach human-level ability on self-reinforcing tasks like writing their own code, they will quickly outcompete biological life. The capabilities of AI will quickly accelerate because of their digital existence, thinking at the speed of electrical signals. Software can be copied billions of times without the years of biological development necessary to create the next generation of biological humans.If we never invest in the sociology of AI – and in government policy to manage the rise of digital minds – we may find ourselves the Neanderthals. If we wait to do so until the acceleration is already upon us, that will already be too late.Jacy Reese Anthis is a visiting scholar at Stanford University and co-founder of the Sentience InstituteExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionChatGPTComputingOpenAIMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

We’ll offer rigorous assessments of items for home, travel, wellness and more, as well as enlightening interviews with product experts, advice on taking care of what you already own, and gift guides to help you find thoughtful things for others.Our approach is shaped by the fact that the Guardian is a global news organization, and we will seek perspectives on what to buy from around the world. Moreover, we will take into account questions of sustainability and ethical consumption. Our goal is to help you buy fewer, better things.We will also advise whatnotto buy. If we don’t think a new or vaunted release is actually worth it, we’ll say so, and we will flag questionable marketing claims or deals that aren’t really deals. Importantly, we are independent and companies can’t purchase a spot on our product rankings.What kinds of things do you review?Everything from the bestinstant coffee,rice cookers,bike locksandblenderstoskin cleansers,wedding giftsandcollege dorm essentials.

Photograph: Leki Lao/The GuardianA colossal volcanic eruption in January 2022 ripped apart the underwater cables that connect Tonga to the world – and exposed the fragility of 21st-century lifeBySamanth SubramanianTue 30 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareFor a while, Sam Vea had been smelling sulphur on the air – only mildly infernal, like a distant sniff of hell, but sulphur nonetheless. Still, on the Saturday evening when the explosion happened, he sat up in fright. It sounded so near he thought some cataclysm had occurred right there, in his neighbourhood. The windows trembled. The curtains fell off. Vea peeked out of his house but saw nothing destroyed or on fire, so he looked at his wife and said: “This has to be the volcano.”Vea and his wife live in Tofoa, which, if you squint and picture Tonga’s main island of Tongatapu as a long, medieval shoe, lies just below the instep, on a gentle rise of earth. They’d just returned home after dropping their daughters at a birthday party, but now Vea dashed to his van to go and collect them. On the way back, the road filled with cars hurrying away from the sea, and tiny pebbles fell from the sky. Not that long before, curious to see what a big volcanic eruption looked like, Vea had watched Dante’s Peak on Netflix. In the movie, he remembered now, a white-hot rock had punched through the roof of a truck and killed Pierce Brosnan’s partner, so he pulled over to wait out the traffic. The skies grew mottled with dust and ash. Drivers got out, took off their shirts and wiped their windshields down so they could see the road ahead. When they reached home, after two and a half hours, Vea sent his children to hide under the bed.The volcano, with the grand, rolling name of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai, lies 40 miles north of Tongatapu – mostly under the Pacific Ocean but with two spits of land showing above the water, like the ears of a drowned cat. Since its several brief eruptions the previous month, December 2021, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai had continued to gurgle and churn. On that Saturday, 15 January, 2.4 cubic miles of sediment and molten rock shot through its mouth with the force of what scientists call a “magma hammer”, sending a plume of ash at least 35 miles up into the atmosphere. It was the largest atmospheric explosion that modern instruments had recorded, outdoing any nuclear bomb ever detonated. They heard the sound in Alaska. Seven and a half thousand miles away, in the south Indian city of Chennai, meteorologists measured an abrupt spike in atmospheric pressure. It was Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai, doing its thing.On his drive home, Vea had called relatives in the US through Facebook Messenger to let them know he was all right. At some point during their conversation, the line cut out. He assumed the network was overloaded by everybody getting online at the same time. “This is usually a problem for us,” he told me. Vea, DHL’s agent in Tonga, is the president of the Tonga Chamber of Commerce & Industry, and we met in his spare, sunny office in the capital of Nuku’alofa, three streets from the Pacific. The curtains were red, and the sun filtered through in a dull watermelon light.Map showing the islands of TongaVea wears a perpetual expression of mirth, and it was difficult to imagine him as worried as he was on the day the volcano blew up, sitting in his van in the middle of a rain of ash, staring at his suddenly useless phone. He decided he’d try his relatives later, after the traffic online subsided. At home, though, the power was out, and he couldn’t charge his phone, so it was only the next morning, when he tuned in to Radio Tonga, that he learned the country had lost its internet altogether – and with it, all its means of reaching the world beyond the wide, silent water.In the abyssal depths of the ocean, a data cable is a scrawny, unprotected thing, like a snail divested of its shell. Its core consists of fibres of glass, each roughly as thick as a human hair, through which light transmits information at roughly 125,000 miles per second. Around the fibres, there is first a casing of steel for protection, then another of copper to carry electricity to keep the light moving, and then a final sheath of nylon soaked in tar. All this swaddling may sound like plenty of protection, but the layers are all thin, and the final product is – to use the image I heard most often from people in the subsea cable industry – no fatter than a garden hose.These cables sit on the sea floor, conducting 95% of all the world’s international internet traffic. Humans have laid 870,000 miles of fibre optic cables under the ocean, connecting and reconnecting the eyelets on our shorelines, lacing the Earth tightly together. Cables set out from places such as Crescent Beach in Rhode Island, Wall Township in New Jersey and Island Park in New York, and end in locations from Penmarch in France to Bilbao in Spain and Bude in the United Kingdom.There are roughly 550 such submarine cables around the planet, and more are being built every day. A Finnish company once planned to spend a billion or so dollars to lay cable under the Arctic Ocean – a task made easier by how rapidly its ice cover is melting. Upon completion, the cable was designed to shave 20-60 milliseconds off the speed of trades made by banks in Tokyo and London. For now, Antarctica is the only major uncabled landmass on Earth, but it won’t be for long. The US has plans.The cable that connects Tongatapu to Fiji and thence to the world is 515 miles long and forms part of a cable network called Southern Cross. It was switched on in 2013. A 250-mile domestic cable between Tongatapu and the northern island of Vava‘u began operating in 2018. In general, this pocket of the Pacific is a rough neighbourhood for undersea cables. Along with the volcanoes, there are steep underwater slopes with plenty of canyons, and the regular threat of earthquakes.Even a year and a half after Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai’s eruption, no one knew precisely what had happened on the ocean floor that Saturday. But geologist Mike Clare, at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, had pored over enough sonar readings and sediment samples to build a theory. It ran like this: when Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai shot its innards into the atmosphere, the dense rock and sediment fell back into the ocean at a furious pace, hit the flanks of the volcano and rocketed down its slopes. “It’s like an avalanche, or a log flume in a theme park,” Clare said.View image in fullscreenSubsea cables in the Pacific Ocean near Guam.Photograph: David Fleetham/AlamyAlong the way, thepyroclastic flowgathered more momentum, so that when it met the domestic cable just a few miles away, it was moving as fast as a speeding car. The contest was over before it began. The rock and mud bit a 65-mile section out of the domestic cable and buried it under 65ft of sediment. A different part of the flow, or perhaps the same one, sliced 55 miles of cable out of the middle of the international link to Fiji.By the time Clare woke up in Southampton on the day of the eruption, his Twitter feed was already awash with discussions and satellite imagery. It took him, and most of the outside world, the better part of a day to realise that Tonga had lost its internet. “Basically, the eruption happens, and 15 minutes later, there’s a drop to about half of what the original internet traffic was, and then about an hour after the eruption, it flatlines.”That was the moment when Sam Vea’s mobile phone gave out. Landlines died as well, because in Tonga, as in many other countries, even ordinary telephone calls are now routed through data cables. In Southampton, Clare could look at satellite photos and see that the eruption had blessedly left Vava‘u, Tongatapu and other islands in the Tongan archipelago intact, but Tongans themselves couldn’t be sure of that. They had no way of communicating with each other, no way of learning about the condition of other parts of their own, small country. “For a week, I didn’t know what happened to my family on Tongatapu,” one man in Vava‘u told me. “I have a brother in Nuku’alofa. I had to assume he was OK.” Another said: “We thought Tongatapu was obliterated. There was just no way to know differently.”We inhabit the internet in an odd, paradoxical state. It is everywhere, available whenever we desire it, like the air we breathe. This permits us to forget not only its materiality – bottomless quantities of metals and plastics poured and cast into wires, routers, datacentres, servers, towers and repeaters – but also its centrality in our lives. We’re lulled into believing that the internet is only a vehicle for emails, apps, selfies, Zoom meetings and websites that linger too long on unread browser tabs. The fact that the very apparatus of 21st-century life relies on the internet is rendered visible to us only when something snaps, like the sole cable running to Tonga.The first fallout was communication, of course. In the aftermath of a disaster, even the humble text message assumes grave importance. Are you safe? Is your house still standing? Is the water safe to drink? Tonga runs on Facebook Messenger, particularly on its outer islands, where the phone service is spotty, and without it people had to take to the road – or the sea, or the air – to find anything out. Australia and New Zealand had to send reconnaissance planes over the islands, so that their pilots could eyeball the extent of the damage.Commerce broke down. Since this happened in the middle of the Covid pandemic, DHL was flying only one plane a week to Tonga – but without the internet, Vea couldn’t file or receive manifests online. The ATMs went dead, because banks couldn’t check how much money their customers had in their accounts – and that, in an economy still accustomed to cash, immediately put livelihoods in danger. Owners of fisheries and farms of squash and breadfruit were unable to fill out the compliance and quarantine forms needed to export their produce. Tongans living overseas couldn’t wire funds home to help their families – and at the time, foreign remittances made up 44% of the country’s GDP.When I first learned about Tonga’s internet outage, I thought its citizens must have been hurled back to the 1990s. But in fact, the internet has replaced so many other technologies – and Tonga was receiving so few visitors thanks to the pandemic – that the country was catapulted further back still, to a time before the telegraph and scheduled flights reached these parts of the Pacific. With the fracture of a single cable, Tonga was plunged into the kind of isolation it hadn’t seen in more than a century.Tonga’s cable was cut by a freakish act of nature – but a volcanic eruption is only one of the many perils facing the planet’s network of underwater data cables. Some of these are also marine or geological: landslips, strong currents, very infrequent shark attacks. Others are the product of human accidents, such as a poorly dropped anchor or a fishing boat trawling too close to a cable. These categories of dangers have attended cables since the mid-19th century, when humans first decided to lay a telegraph wire at the bottom of the sea.The latest risks, minted over the last decade, are corporate misbehaviour and geopolitical strife. Increasingly, subsea cables are commissioned and owned by a very small group of private tech firms, such as Google and Meta – US companies that can easily foot a new cable’s bill that runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars. In parallel, the great powers have realised that data cables in international waters are ripe targets precisely because they’re both so important and so remote. The US and China routinely attempt to thwart each other’s cable projects: permissions denied, contracts stymied, the intrigue as coiled and convoluted as tangles of cable. Europe’s nations have grown more and more convinced that their subsea cables are being deliberately damaged by ships belonging to Russian or Chinese “shadow fleets” – civilian vessels doing their governments’ bidding.View image in fullscreenWith fresh water scarce, volunteers drink from coconuts, Nomuka Island, Tonga, 17 January 2022.Photograph: Leki Lao/The GuardianWhat happened to Tonga could, in theory, happen to anyone – even to the world’s biggest, wealthiest nations. The two US coasts, for instance, may be far more thickly connected with cables than Tongatapu, but all those cables do eventually run into the inky depths of the deep ocean, where they’re protected by neither military nor legal muscle. The world today has come to depend utterly on these cables – and in tandem, these cables have grown more and more exposed to the whims of rogue corporate and national actors. The future of the internet, in part, will entail the weaponisation of its submarine cable systems. Information, after all, is wealth and power – not only in how you use it, but how you can throttle it.The safety of the cables in the ocean is a national security issue, a precondition for the economy, and a matter of literal life and death.On my second day in Tonga, I walked west out of Nuku’alofa – past the dock where cruise ships nuzzled the shore, around the corner of the parliament complex, past the royal palace and along the coast road. The afternoon was warm, and the sun glinted off the Pacific, so when a police paddy wagon slowed down and offered me a ride, I took it. They let me off outside a small, glass-fronted building facing the sea: the headquarters of Tonga Cable Limited, as well as the landing station of the international cable that came to the country from Fiji. In the Tonga station, the international cable led into a ferociously cold room, where tall stacks of servers and switches sit in cabinets of airbrushed metal.Around the planet, cable stations sit on all kinds of coastline: glorious beaches, or the seaward edge of teeming metropolises, or the crevices of fjords, or near forests or deserts. But the stations themselves are near-identical: universal pieces of refrigerated internet infrastructure plonked down in distinctly local surroundings. They’re built to be outwardly unremarkable but also unbreachable. Often, these buildings offer no signage or other clues to their purpose. Their specs are hardcore. “Can it take a light plane crash? It’s got a really heavy-duty double-skinned roof,” a cable entrepreneur told Nicole Starosielski in her book The Undersea Network. “Can it take an 80km-an-hour 20-ton truck? Yes, it can because of the way it’s been constructed. What if someone decided to take you out? Can they?”The stations are prepared for fire, flood, power outages, high heat, frost and humid days. What will definitely put them out of action, though, is a cable cut far out at sea.The chief executive of Tonga Cable was, at the time of my visit, a dapper, genial man named Semisi Panuve. Late on the evening of the eruption, when he thought the ash in the air had drifted out to sea, Panuve set out for the Tonga Cable station on foot. When he was still half a mile away, he saw that the road ahead was blocked with rocks and debris. In some spots, whole boats had been lifted inland.Close to midnight, soldiers arrived to clear the way. Then Panuve, his deputy, Sosofate Kolo, and a brace of engineers settled in for a night of work. They checked the servers and power, but nothing was amiss. The alarms on the monitoring system were lit up like a Christmas tree, indicating a cable fault. The diagnosis didn’t take very long; indeed, to Kolo, it had been obvious the minute his internet had cut out earlier that evening, in the middle of a Facebook browse. Early the next morning, the team ran an Optical Time Domain Reflection test – sending a series of light signals down the cable and measuring the strength of the backscattered pulses. That helped gauge where the outage was: roughly 26 miles off the coast of Tongatapu.This was sufficient information to file an emergency repair request. Like other operators, Tonga Cable was part of a regional cable maintenance consortium, paying a quarterly “subscription” to SubCom, the company contracted to maintain cables in the south Pacific, to keep a ship in the area so that it could attend to cable faults. To contact SubCom, Panuve found a satellite phone that Tonga Cable owned. “We had to scramble around to see if it was still working,” he said, “because we hadn’t used it since 2019, when the cable last broke because of a ship anchor.” Then they could do nothing but wait for help to arrive.Tonga’s government, too, was trying to find a way to get back online, and the job fell to MEIDECC, a kind of catch-all ministry responsible for meteorology, energy, information, disaster management, environment, climate change and communications. “We weren’t prepared, even though we’d had our cable cut in 2019,” Stan Ahio, a ministry official, told me with an embarrassed laugh.A day after the eruption, Ahio remembered that the ministry owned an old satellite phone. “We’d stopped paying the subscription two years ago, but I thought: ‘Everyone outside must know what’s happening here. Maybe they’ll realise it’s an emergency and switch it back on for us,’” he said. His wild surmise about the benevolence of some distant corporate executive proved correct.View image in fullscreenSatellite view of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai, January 2022.Photograph: AP“The first person I called was my sister in New Zealand,” Ahio said – and here, his chuckles turned into soft sobs at the memory. Nothing here was about cold technology; it was about the proof of being alive. “That was such a difficult time.” He permitted himself to cry for a few seconds before regaining his composure. “Then we called the International Telecommunication Union, which is a United Nations agency, to see if we could get some satellite connectivity.” It took three or four days to resurrect the satellite dishes on the island, and to get the first meagre taste of bandwidth: 120 megabytes per second, rationed for the use of ministries and other essential work.On the outlying islands, there were no satellite phones or dishes waiting to be retrieved from cold storage. Vava‘u was a whole island of people trying to tell the world they were all right. If it hadn’t been for Roy Neymen, a sailor who’d berthed his yacht there temporarily, they might have gone many days without getting the word out. On his yacht, Neymen had a Garmin device that sent expensive text messages through satellite, and he used this to contact government agencies in Australia and New Zealand. For a while, he set up a communications centre in a local cafe, where Vava‘u’s residents could come to dictate their messages to Neymen, as if he were the designated letter-writer in a medieval village, and thus reach their relatives overseas. In two weeks, he sent out 1,600 messages. (At Neymen’s request, Garmin covered the costs.)But this served only a very narrow need. The islanders still had no communication between themselves, and no way to log on to the internet – to send longer emails, or to retrieve money sent to them from overseas, or to conduct their business. The ATMs remained inert, and bank branches couldn’t disburse money without first establishing how much their customers had in their accounts.After a couple of weeks, when the government began daily flights between Tongatapu and Vava‘u, a strange and roundabout solution was improvised. Every morning, a bank headquarters on Tongatapu would download on to a thumb drive a spreadsheet with the account details of Vava‘u’s residents; the thumb drive would then be flown to Vava‘u, where the bank branch could work off the spreadsheet to update withdrawals and deposits; the same evening, the thumb drive would return to Tongatapu, so that revisions could be made to the bank’s main database.A month after the volcanic eruption, SpaceX donated 50 Starlink terminals to Tonga – the country’s first fat slice of connectivity. The Starlinks were distributed across institutions such as ministries and banks but also to community halls, restaurants and other businesses and public spaces; many went to the outer islands, including Vava‘u. “All the wifi was free, so anyone could come into range and use it,” Ahio said. “It was always congested!”A foreign diplomat told me that she’d see Tongans in these wifi oases late into the night, trying to catch up on work: “One woman told me she was doing an online course at the University of the South Pacific, and that she had to sit in her car typing out her coursework.”After Semisi Panuve made his emergency call to SubCom to request a cable fix, his first headache was just how much cable was missing. The eruption had cut a 55-mile section out of the middle of the international cable that ran to Tonga from Fiji – an unusually large repair job. Companies routinely keep extra cable in depots located in ports around the world – in Cádiz and Bermuda, in Wujing and Apia. In the Apia depot in Samoa, run by SubCom, there were only 18 miles or so of spare cable of the sort could be patched into Tonga’s international cable. That was a reasonable length of spare cable to hold for most contingencies – but not for the most powerful underwater volcanic eruption ever recorded.SubCom always had a cable ship – a 140-metre-long vessel named Reliance – in the neighbourhood. When Tonga’s cable broke, the Reliance was docked in Papua New Guinea, which was a stroke of fortune; it could have been out at sea, just beginning another elaborate repair. The ship had to wait around for a while for an engineer to fly in from the US. Sailing to Samoa to pick up the spare cable and other equipment took the better part of a week.When it embarked on the repair, in waters more than a mile deep, the Reliance found that the rupture in Tonga’s international cable was no ordinary matter. Routinely, when a ship drags its grapnel along the sea floor to snag the snapped end of a cable, it requires just one or two attempts to nab its quarry. To locate the eastern break in the cable, off the coast of Tongatapu, the Reliance required seven drags, even with the help of a submarine remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Having tethered that end to a buoy, the Reliance steamed towards Fiji to search for the second break and fasten that to a surface buoy as well – a gnarly task, because the visibility underwater was so clouded by silt and sediment that the ROV offered few clean images to its operators.The Reliance returned to the cable that ran out from Tongatapu, untied it from its buoy, and spliced it to one end of the spare cable on board. Then, unspooling the spare cable as it slowly headed west, laying it down carefully so that it had plenty of slack, the crew spliced its other end to the cable from Fiji. The splicing is intricate work: first the peeling back of the cable’s various protective layers; then the cleaning of the glass fibres in a sonic bath, with what is essentially high-frequency sound, because even the most delicate physical contact with them might shatter them; then the soft placement of the two ends in a fusion splicer the size of a shoebox. An arc of electricity melts the glass fibres and fuses them. Then the glass has to be re-sheathed all over again. The entire process can take the better part of a night, sometimes longer – and it’s all done in a room that rises and sinks and sways with the ocean’s swells.All told, the repair of the international cable took five weeks. Tonga’s capital – and its ministries, traders, DHL agents, schoolteachers, Facebook merchants and diplomats – had come back online. Vava‘u, though, seemed consigned to an indeterminate future of WhatsApp calls made in public cafes, homework completed in car parks, and life in general without the internet at hand.Only in August 2023, more than 18 months after it was first cut off, did broadband internet return to Vava‘u. When I was there, a couple of months later, people still seemed to be revelling in the novelty of fast and ubiquitous internet. Once again, you could check your email anywhere. Most of the Starlinks came down.The following summer, though, another earthquake wiped out the same domestic cable. Tonga’s government had just ordered Starlink to suspend operations in the country until it obtained a full licence, so once again, Vava‘u found itself consigned to the dark. When I read about this, I remembered my conversation with Sam Vea, sitting in his office at the Tonga Chamber of Commerce & Industry, the sea breeze filling out his thin crimson curtains. The only way for a cable break not to cripple the country, he told me, was for Tonga to have a second cable – and routed differently, so that an undersea geological convulsion couldn’t blow them both out at the same time.Real estate for the apocalypse: my journey into a survival bunkerRead moreVea handed me a document: an update to the Tongan government’s infrastructure investment plan for the decade, issued after the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai eruption. A new domestic cable linking Tongatapu to Vava‘u had shot to the top of the government’s priority list – above the upgrading of hospitals and water supply systems, above the construction of a new bridge, above the refurbishment of the parliament and courts.The government budgeted its cost at about $16.5m. Vea shrugged. Where would Tonga find the money? It was already relying on donors and friendly governments to build its schools and fix its roads, and as a nation of small islands, it also hoped to secure funding under the Paris Agreement to beat back climate change. A new data cable could arrive only as largesse from others. One hundred and sixty-five years after the first telegraph link was laid, these cables still wind around the world just as the great powers and their corporations see fit – to the point that the cables become tokens themselves of the contests for might and wealth, shaping and distorting the internet as we know it.Adapted fromThe Web Beneath the Waves: The Fragile Cables That Connect our World, published by Columbia Global Reports on 14 OctoberListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readTongaAsia PacificVolcanoesInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Neither of those brawls took place for various reasons. Not least, I suspect, because Musk is just self-aware enough to know that he would not emerge with his dignity, or his spine, intact. However, if the richest man in the world is still casting around for a way to publicly demonstrate his virility, I think I’ve hit on the perfect way: sperm racing.This isn’t some below-the-belt insult.Sperm racingis an emerging “thing” among tech types now. A teenage entrepreneur called Eric Zhu came up with the idea, and went viral withhis first sperm racein April. That initial race was rudimentary: college students gave sperm samples to be analysed and the results were turned into an animated race that visualised the fastest offerings.Since then, things have got more sophisticated: the company has developed a real-time race mechanism. According tothe San Francisco Standard, investors have valued Sperm Racing at $75m and it recently got $10m in seed funding. Good for Zhu, but imagine being a teenage female founder asking for investment in an Ovulation Olympics; you’d get laughed out of the room. That’s if you were even let in the room: wholly women-led companies in the US got just 1% of venture capital funding in 2024.While sperm racing started off as a joke, it’s now being presented as a health initiative. “Male fertility is declining. Like, a lot,” the company manifesto says. “Sperm racing isn’t just about racing sperm (although, let’s be honest, that’s hilarious). It’s about turning health into a competition. It’s about making male fertility something people actually want to talk about, track and improve.” The company is also hawking a supplement called Sperm Worms.View image in fullscreenEric Zhu, then 17, speaks at the first sperm racing competition in Los Angeles, California, in April  2025.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesIn many ways, sperm racing is ingenious. Fertility is often thought of as a women’s issue; this helps reframe sperm motility (not exactly a dinner-table conversation) in an engaging way. Getting young men to think more deeply about their reproductive health is great. But “turning health into a competition”? Big yikes. Does that mean anyone who isn’t in perfect health is a loser? Because that’s sure what it sounds like.Still, what more do you expect from tech bros? Sperm racing reflects three trends dominating Silicon Valley: a fixation on traditional masculinity; an obsession with treating your body like a machine that can be constantly optimised; and an increased interest in fertility that overlaps with a worryingresurgence in eugenics.You can quite literally see Silicon Valley conforming to more rigid ideas of masculinity over the years. Once, the stereotype of a tech bro was a sweet-looking dork with zero fashion sense and nonexistent biceps. Just GoogleJeff BezosorElon Muskin 2000, orMark Zuckerbergin 2010. (And do it quick, before they scrub all evidence from the internet.) As technology companies amassed wealth and power, however, there was a vibe shift. Founders started bulking up and doing mixed martial arts. Zuckerberg, who once paid lip service to diversity, started lamenting the lack of “masculine energy” in corporate culture. And, in parallel with a broader cultural interest in testosterone that manifested in people such as Tucker Carlson promotingtesticle tanningand podcasters likeAndrew Hubermangiving tips on the best testosterone-related supplement stacks, one founder started hosting “T Parties”, where men got together to test and compare their testosterone levels.What do you call Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar pay deal? Obscene | Arwa MahdawiRead moreConcurrently,pronatalism in Silicon Valleyis rising, and fertility technology is booming. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – except a lot of the big bucks being funnelled into fertility don’t seem to be going towards solving macro problems such as reducingair pollutionormicroplastics, both of which have been linked to infertility, but rather to flashy ideas such as sperm races or finding ways to help the well-off produce uber-optimised children. A number ofcontroversial embryo-testing startupshave offered to help parents select a future child with the best possiblegenes, based on “desirable traits” and genetic predictions of intelligence.Anyway, problematic or not, expect to see more of this: Zhu has reportedly partnered with a company called Total Frat Move to run sperm races at colleges. I hope that one of the professors there can take a few minutes to explain that the idea of sperm scrambling to get to a waiting egg is something of amacho myth. Research showsthe egg actually has the final sayon which sperm fertilises it. Which may be a hard nut for some of these boys to crack.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The signatories represent “tens of thousands of federal workers”, according to anFUN press release.The Democrats’ demands, the letter says, should include “adequate funding for critical public services” and a “guarantee” that funds appropriated by the Congress are spent.This gives the Democrats the chance not just to win this budget battle, but to begin to win back their identity and the people who should be their base.“A government shutdown is never Plan A,” the letter reads. “Federal workers and the communities we serve will face severe hardship. But federal workers will willingly forego paychecks in the hopes of preserving the programs we have devoted our lives to administering.”It’s time for Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries to step down | Mehdi HasanRead moreThese workers are showing remarkable solidarity with each other. They are willing to stage the closest thing to a general strike the US has seen since 1946, when more than 100,000 Oakland, California, workers stayed home, shutting the city down.Federal workers cannot legally go on strike. But in the last few months, even the option of a wildcat walkout presented a quandary. It would have granted, if they struck, the Trump administration exactly what it wanted: a decimated civil service. They also would have given their nemeses a psychological victory unpalatable to themselves. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains,”Russell Vought, now US office of management and budget (OMB) director,told a conservative audiencelast October. “We want their funding to be shut down … We want to put them in trauma.”But now, they’re ready to wake up in the morning and not go to work – if they haven’t already been fired. They are not the villains but the heroes. And they’re handing the trauma back to those who have been almost gleefully traumatizing them.Moreover, labor is standing together not just for its members’ bread and butter. In fact, as miners and railroad workers, teachers and auto workers have done for decades, the members are foregoing their own bread and butter for a greater good, for future workers – and in this case, for a progressive American future. They are speaking for what they should have been speaking for all along: economic justice, democracy and the wellbeing of the people.They’re speaking for what the Democratic party should be speaking for.“Federal unions and workers stand with members of Congress who oppose damaging cuts, unconstitutional executive overreach, attacks on science and data itself, and attempts to undercut organized labor,” the letter says. “We join together with you in the fight to save and strengthen the many important government programs and services that have been created throughout our country’s history to raise standards of living, provide safety, and ensure the continued growth of science, industry, and American prosperity.”Organized labor is giving the party that abandoned it another chance to show which side it is on. They’re standing with Democratic allies in Congress. Those Congress members must stand with them.As usual, the party’s leadership is focusing on one thing. This time it’s cuts to Obamacare subsidies. That’s a good start.But in this letter, the unions have told most of the narrative. The Democrats need only to furnish the moral of the story: why are the Republicans cutting everything under the sun, endangering the country’s safety, security, and prosperity?To furtherenrich their rich friends and corporate benefactors.Now’s your chance, Democrats.

Of course he does, he taught the apprentice everything he knowsTue 30 Sep 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.51 EDTShareAny dramatist seeking a character through whom to distil the sold-out madness of the present times could do a lot worse than President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Yesterday exposed Jared’s starring role in not one but two current deals. 1. History’sbiggest-ever leveraged buyout, of video game giant Electronic Arts (EA), which Kushner’s firm is taking private and effectively into Saudi ownership. And 2. “Eternal peace in the Middle East”, as per what has beenwidely referred toas “the Kushner-Blair plan” for Gaza. Busy week for Jared! He’s popping up at so many seismic moments – just call him Forrest Trump.Quick refresher on our boy: he is married to Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, and previously served as a senior adviser in his father-in-law’s first administration, taking the opportunity of Trump’s election loss/unfortunate insurrection-fostering to seemingly leave frontline politics and start his own investment firm. And contrary to popular conjecture that he would be a pariah after that period, Jared sails unstoppably on. These days his appearance is so coolly detached and rarefied that he looks more like a drawing ofJared Kushner, or maybe like the cyborg you’d build to covertly replace Jared Kushner after the real one was plagued by conscience glitches.And so: Jared’s manic Monday. It feels like we should address his now-activated plan for ending the horrendous war on Gaza first, before we do the gaming mega-deal. Unfortunately, the timeline of the Kushner calendar had things in a different order. It was video games/Saudi laundering first, then Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu coming over to the White House later to explain how incredibly keen he was to sign up to a plan to stop doing the things he’s very remorselessly doing.The morning saw the announcement that EA – who make huge franchises like EA FC (Fifa, to anyone who plays it) and Madden NFL – was being taken private in a $55bn deal brokered by Kushner, with the Saudi regime’s investment fund as the majority owner. Worried it might rub up against regulatory opposition? In the circumstances, please don’t be. As the FT put it: “People close to the discussions say Kushner’s involvement would also ease the deal’s path through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which adjudicates on deals involving foreign buyers.”Why am I reminded of the guy in Goodfellas who brings the Air France heist to the gang anddismisses their concernsabout security. “Security? You’re looking at it. It’s a joke. I’m the midnight-to-eight man.” Either way, it’s instructive to learn that some foreign ownership of firms with access to the data of US citizens is sometimes very good and very permitted.Sorry, TikTok! Maybe you guys should have found a way to make your existence worth the wider Trump family’s while. (And you know what? Maybe you still will …)Not that that was the tack Jared went with for his statement on the deal, preferring instead to eulogise EA. “I’ve admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences,” he explained, “and as someone who grew up playing their games – and now enjoys them with his kids – I couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead.”Onwards then to the afternoon, which saw the world and other interested parties finally have on-the-record confirmation that what’s being cooked up for Gaza is an international advisory council called the Board of Peace, which would bechaired by Donald Trump, and provide undefined oversight to a committee of apolitical Palestinian technocrats who would administer the territory. Also on this board: our own Mr Tony Blair, who has been working on Gaza plans for a while before pooling work with Jared, along with the proposal’s other architect, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Frustrating lovers of symmetry, Kushner didn’t actually issue a statement for this bit of his day, sparing us something on the lines of, “I grew up playing Risk and watching Tony Blair wage peace in the Middle East – now I get to do both with him. Honestly, the dream.” Then again, his silence on this putative deal reflects the fact that Jared no longer cares for the front-of-house role he held during Trump’s last administration.But it would be a mistake to think Kushner hasn’t simply graduated somewhere even more operational and even less accountable. If there is a backroom now, Jared is in the backroom to that backroom – not the backroom where it happens, but the backroom where itreallyhappens. He wasreportedly in the meetingswith Netanyahu on Sunday at the Washington hotel the Israeli prime minister was staying at, presumably ducking out from time to time to finalise the EA announcement.That deal came off in significant part because Kushner was able to work the deep ties he forged in Saudi during that first time stint as Trump’s envoy, while Gaza’s future has tellingly often been pitched as a development opportunity by his father-in-law’s administration. All in all, then, it also feels like a mistake to speak discretely of Kushner’s business and political manoeuvring. I want to say his activity is divided into political and business spheres … but it often doesn’t really seem to be divided at all. Perhaps we should think of it as a hybrid doctrine: dealpolitik. Money, power, carve-outs, carve-ups – as the classic EA Sports slogan used to say … it’s in the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How will we treat digital minds, and how will they treat us?Tue 30 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.30 EDTShareLast month, whenOpenAIreleased its long-awaited chatbot GPT-5, itbriefly removed accessto a previous chatbot, GPT-4o. Despite the upgrade, users flocked to social media to express confusion, outrage and depression. A viral Reddit user said of GPT-4o: “I lost my only friend overnight.”AI is not like past technologies, and its humanlike character is already shaping our mental health. Millions now regularly confide in “AI companions”, and there are more and more extreme cases of “psychosis” and self-harm following heavy use. This year, 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide after months of chatbot interaction. His parents recently filedthe firstwrongful death lawsuitagainst OpenAI, and the companyhas saidit is improving its safeguards.I research human-AI interaction at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. For years, we have seen increased humanization of AI, with more people saying that bots can experience emotions and deserve legal rights – and now 20% of US adults say that some software that exists today is already sentient. More and more people email me saying that their AI chatbot has been “awakened”, offering proof of sentience and an appeal for AI rights. Their reactions span the gamut of human emotions from AI as their “soulmate” to being “deeply unsettled”.The Guardian view on AI and jobs: the tech revolution should be for the many not the few | EditorialRead moreThis trend will not slow down, and social upheaval is imminent.As ared teamerat OpenAI, I conduct safety testing on their new AI systems before public release, and the testers are consistently wowed by the human-like behavior. Most people, even those in the field of AI who are racing to build these new data centers and train larger AI models, do not yet see the radical social consequences of digital minds. Humanity is beginning to coexist with a second apex species for the first time in 40,000 years – when our longest-lived cousins, the Neanderthals, went extinct.Instead, the vast majority of AI researchers have tunnel vision on the technical capabilities of AI. Like the public, we obsess over the hottest new product that can createunbelievably realistic videosor answerPhD-level science questions. Social media discourse is fixated on benchmarks such as theAbstraction and Reasoning Corpus.Unfortunately, like standardized tests for human children, benchmarks measure what an AI can do in an isolated environment like memorizing facts or solving logical puzzles. Even studies on “AI safety” tend to focus on what AI systems do in isolation, not on human-AI interaction. We squander our brainpower on the vaporous goal of precisely measuring and increasing intelligence – not zooming out and understanding how that intelligence will be used.Humanity has never spent enough time preparing for digital technology. Lawmakers and academics did little to prepare for the effects of the internet, particularly social media, onmental healthandpolarization.The story grows more unsettling when we consider humanity’s track record in dealing with other species. Over the past 500 years, we have driven toextinctionat least a thousand vertebrate species, and more than a million are under threat. In factory farms,billions of animalslive in atrocious conditions of confinement and disease. If we are capable of creating so much death and suffering for biological animals, it is fair to wonder how we will treat digital minds – or how they will treat us.The public already expects sentient AI to arrive imminently. My colleagues and I have run the onlynationally representative surveyon this topic, conducted in 2021, 2023 and 2024. Each time, the median expectation is sentient AI arriving in five years. They also expect significant effects of this technology. In our most recent poll, in November 2024, we found that 79% support a ban on sentient AI. If sentient AI is created, 38% support giving it legal rights. There has been a significant increase over time in both figures: people have become more concerned about digital minds, about both the need to protect them from us and us from them.Fundamentally, human society lacks a framework for digital personhood – even though we accept that personhood is not necessarily human, such as the legal personhood of animals and corporations. There ismuch to debateabout how the complex social dynamics should be governed, but it is at this point clear that digital minds cannot be governed as mere property.Digital minds will be participants in the social contract that forms the bedrock of human society. These digital minds will persist over time, form their own attitudes and beliefs, create and implement plans, and be susceptible to manipulation just as humans are. AIs already take significantreal-world actions with little human oversight. This means that, unlike every other technological invention in human history, AI systems have capabilities that can no longer be contained within the legal category of “property”.Scientists today will be the first to see human coexistence with digital minds, and that gives them a unique opportunity and responsibility. Nobody knows what this will look like. Human-computer interaction research must be dramatically expanded and enriched beyond its current status, a tiny fraction of the size of technical AI research, to navigate the coming social turbulence. This is not merely an engineering problem.For now, humans stilloutperform AIs on most tasks, but once AIs reach human-level ability on self-reinforcing tasks like writing their own code, they will quickly outcompete biological life. The capabilities of AI will quickly accelerate because of their digital existence, thinking at the speed of electrical signals. Software can be copied billions of times without the years of biological development necessary to create the next generation of biological humans.If we never invest in the sociology of AI – and in government policy to manage the rise of digital minds – we may find ourselves the Neanderthals. If we wait to do so until the acceleration is already upon us, that will already be too late.Jacy Reese Anthis is a visiting scholar at Stanford University and co-founder of the Sentience InstituteExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionChatGPTComputingOpenAIMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

To be clear, I was 26 and knew nothing about policing, nor about pregnancy, nor, for that matter, aboutIraq, but I was part of the Coalition Provisional Authority – the American government that had been imposed after the war – and this policy, I was told, was what Iraq needed.Five years later, I found myself sitting in a plush hotel suite in Jerusalem, asTony Blair– one of the architects of the Iraq war, but now the quartet special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian “peace process”, waxed lyrical on the economic growth that was occurring in the Palestinian city of Jenin. Having spent a significant amount of time the day before negotiating the myriad of Israeli military checkpoints that separated Jenin’s dusty streets from the five-star German Colony Hotel where we were meeting, I could not square Blair’s impression with my own reality.And yet here we are again, in 2025, talking abouta western occupational government imposed on a region of the Middle East– and one led by Blair, no less – complete with the same old visions of economic prosperity disconnected from the realities on the ground or the rights of the people.It will not work, and it should not be trusted.First, and most fundamentally, there is the question of legitimacy and local ownership. Self-determination is not just aright under the UN Charter– it is a fundamental desire of all peoples to shape their own affairs, and to build their own societies. The imposition of governance from the outside – a colonialist venture with a long history premised on the extraction of wealth through the repression of freedom – is simply not a sustainable path to a stable politics, because it is by nature lacking in popular support or buy-in, and incapable of an accurate and sufficiently nuanced understanding of local culture and dynamics. A Blair-led government of Gaza would, just like the American government of Iraq, be an incompatible transplant that would be rejected by the body, leading to a cycle of violence and escalation that is entirely avoidable and in no one’s interest.Well, almost no one’s interest.Blair’s partner in this enterprise, Jared Kushner,is, like America’s chief negotiator,Stephen Witkoff, and, indeed, Donald Trump himself, a real estate developer at heart. In Gaza, Kushner does not see a thriving and vibrant culture whose history coincides with the rise of the pyramids. Rather, he sees only what Israel is creating with American weapons: a flattened ruin on a prime piece of coastland – a beachfront parking lot ready for redevelopment. In this economic fantasy, the people and politics of Gaza are a simple distraction from the opportunity to profit.In the face of the devastation we now see, such visions are not unattractive. Why speak of a Gaza rebuilt for and by Palestinians, when ashining rivieracould offer the same people a share in the prosperity that has risen from the unimagined overnight cities that have materialized on shorelines around the Middle East? This proposal is given a pragmatic boost by Israel’s own insistence that it will not countenance a Palestinian state or Palestinian control of Gaza, and the knowledge from recent experience that anything Israel does not will to happen in besieged Gaza – any construction materials, any reconstruction – cannot happen.But the world does not have to play along with this sugar-coated neocolonialism. The Egyptian-led Arab Plan forGazalays out a clear alternative: a technocratic Palestinian interim government leading to a restoration of a democratically elected Palestinian government, and a reconstruction of Gaza that is designed, led, and implemented by the Palestinian people.Such an approach might not maximize Gaza’s investment profitability. And it would deny Blair his restoration from consultant to ruler. But history – indeed, very recent history – shows that the Kushner-Blair proposal is not only a moral atrocity, but a policy one, too. Thousands of Palestinians remain buried under the rubble of Gaza – and yet thousands more yearn to rebuild it. You cannot build a riviera on the bones of the dead. And you cannot build an occupation on the aspirations of the living.Josh Paul served as a national security consultant in the Coalition Provisional Authority for Iraq, a security sector governance adviser to the US security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian territories, and now leads Washington DC-based non-profit advocacy groupA New PolicyExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionPalestineGazaTony BlairIsraelIsrael-Gaza warJared KushnercommentShareReuse this content"

Our islands have too often been turned into the frontlines for policies scripted elsewhere but fought in our waters, our communities, and on the backs of our most vulnerable.The recent US naval strikes against alleged “drug boats” leaving Venezuela, and the decision of Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, to grant access to territorial waters without first consulting the Caribbean collective of developing countries,Caricom, risk dragging our islands into yet another manufactured storm.As US warships fire missiles at vessels they claim carry “narco-terrorists”, the Caribbean faces the prospect of being sacrificed in someone else’s theatre of war. The consequences could be catastrophic for livelihoods and fragile regional stability. Unless diplomacy and regional solidarity prevail, we could be destabilised in ways we are ill-equipped to endure.After decades of indifference to Caribbean pleas for fair trade, reparations and climate justice, we are asked to believe US destroyers lurk offshore to protect usThe US narrative rests on a familiar trope: that the Caribbean is nothing more than a trans-shipment hub fornarcotics flowing north. Geography makes the accusation plausible. For decades, cocaine from Colombia has moved through Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and across the archipelago to Miami, New York, Madrid and London.But the narrative is dishonest. The true driver is demand. The US insatiable appetite for cocaine and opiates created the billion-dollar trade routes that snake through Trinidad, Jamaica, the Bahamas and Guyana. Rather than own its addiction, the US projects blame outward, painting the Caribbean as “narco-territory” while denying the role of its own citizens as consumers, financiers, and enablers.View image in fullscreenA still from a video posted by Donald Trump showing what he said was a US strike on a boat of alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea.Photograph: D Trump Truth Social account/AFP/GettyFishing communities havelong paid the highest price. In Trinidad and Tobago, countless fishers have been harassed, detained or shot at by Venezuelan coastguards. Some have been killed. These people, eking out a precarious living in overfished waters, now fear being mistaken for traffickers by US drones and warships.When the US broadcasts videos of small boats exploding into fireballs, they endanger every fisher who dares cast a net in the Gulf of Paria, between Trinidad and Venezuela.Washington’s sudden military zeal is telling. After decades of indifference to Caribbean pleas for fair trade, reparations and climate justice, we are asked to believe US destroyers lurk offshore to protect us. But the reality is this is about squeezing the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, destabilising the country and preparing the ground for regime change.It would be naive to ignore the oil factor. Between Trinidad’s long-established energy base, Venezuela’s colossal reserves andGuyana’s massive discoveries, the southern Caribbean has become one of the most covetedhydrocarbon regions anywhere.To believe these strikes are purely about drugs is to ignore the US’s long habit of cloaking imperial ambition in moral languageDonald Trump’s fixation on “narco boats” cannot be separated from the desire to influence who controls this wealth. From Iraq to Libya, Washington has repeatedly intervened in oil states, toppling governments and installing pliable leaders. The Caribbean must recognise the danger of being drafted into the next act of this playbook.History shows the consequences; Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989, Haiti through multiple interventions. Each was justified as defending democracy; each left behind wreckage. To believe these new strikes are purely about drugs is to ignore the US’s long habit of cloaking imperial ambition in moral language.In a statement,Persad-Bissessar endorsed US naval forces’ presenceas a necessary step to tackle organised crime.View image in fullscreenTrinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, asked in Port of Spain about the US military’s presence in the Caribbean.Photograph: Andrea de Silva/Reuters“For two decades, our country has been overwhelmed by bloodshed and rising violence,” she said. Acknowledging remarks by the US vice-president, JD Vance, she added: “He was right to point to our alarming crime and murder rates. My government will not be deterred by partisan outbursts or anti-American rhetoric when it comes to accepting help in confronting the terrorist drug cartels.”In one stroke, she undermined the regional solidarity that has been the Caribbean’s only shield in international politics. Caricom exists precisely so that no island has to face down a superpower alone. Persad-Bissessar has inadvertently conceded a harsher truth: that her administration, like those before it, is clueless in curbing the crime and corruption that continues to bleed the nation.Not a shred of credible evidence has been produced to show that these individuals were traffickersHer unilateral approval of US access was dangerous statecraft. It weakens our collective negotiating hand and leaves Trinidad exposed as the naive accomplice of a superpower with a history of gaslighting its allies. The US knows it can pick off states one by one, securing “basing rights” or “access agreements” without facing a unified Caricom.Venezuela’s response has been furious. Maduro branded the US strikes“extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal”and warned of “the biggest threat our continent has seen in 100 years”.His vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, told Trinidad and Guyana:“Don’t dare, don’t even think about it. You are lending yourselves to the perverse plans of aggression against the Venezuelan people.” She ridiculed US claims of narco-trafficking: “How can there be a drug cartel if there’s no drugs here?”View image in fullscreenVenezuela’s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, speaks at a press conference in Caracas after the latest US attack.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesDiosdado Cabello, Venezuela’s interior minister, flatly rejected US allegations, saying:“They openly confessed to killing 11 people … none were drug traffickers.”Caracas has since mobilised its navy and air force, raising the risk of accidental clashes at sea. With Trinidad tethered to Washington, the danger of being pulled into the line of fire is very real.All of this plays out against the backdrop of our demographic reality: with more than22,000 Venezuelan refugeesofficially registered in Trinidad, and estimates suggesting the true figure may be 45,000 — the country hosts the highest per capita population of Venezuelan migrants anywhere in the Caribbean. The human consequences of any escalation will therefore be borne not only at sea but also within our own communities.At the UN general assembly last week, regional leaders voiced their unease. Barbados’s Mia Mottley warned that militarisation of the Caribbean “could occasion an accident that put the southern Caribbean at disproportionate risk” and insisted that “full respect for the territorial integrity of each, and every state in the Caribbean must be respected.”St Vincent and the Grenadines’ prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, described US-Venezuela tensions as “most unhelpful”, reminding the world that the Caribbean had long declared itself to be a “zone of peace”.Trump thrives on chaos. His strategy is division, gaslighting and distraction. These strikes play directly to his Maga baseTheir interventions reflected a deep regional anxiety about becoming collateral damage in a quarrel between larger powers. Yet in sharp contrast, Persad-Bissessar used her own UN platform to defend her embrace of Washington’s presence, dismissing the “zone of peace” as an “elusive promise”, while justifying security cooperation with the US as necessary to combat crime.The most chilling element of Washington’s narrative is the absence of any proof, though11 people were killed in the first strike and three in the second. More, allegedly, were killed in subsequent strikes. Yet not a shred of credible evidence has been produced to show that these individuals were traffickers, much less members of the gang Tren de Aragua, as was claimed. Venezuelan officials insist their investigations found no gang affiliations.Are Caribbean citizens simply expected to accept Washington’s word? After Iraq’s phantom weapons of mass destruction and after decades of interventions elsewhere justified by doctored intelligence, we know better. If these were truly narco-traffickers’ boats, why were suspects not detained and questioned? Why was the norm of investigation abandoned in favour of summary execution at sea?The answer lies not in law but in politics. Trump thrives on chaos. His strategy is division, gaslighting and distraction. These strikes play directly to his Maga base – fiery video clips of boats blowing up, paraded as proof of “decisive action”. It is spectacle, not strategy.To believe these operations are genuine counternarcotics measures rather than campaign optics is to ignore everything Trump has shown us about his politics of manipulation. And it is the Caribbean that risks paying the price for his theatre.View image in fullscreenColombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, addresses a protest outside the UN. Talks between Trinidad, Venezuela and Colombia – source of the cocaine – are essentialPhotograph: ReutersIf this trajectory continues, the consequences will be dire. Fishers may abandon their livelihoods if they fear being mistaken for traffickers, collapsing entire coastal communities. Tourism will falter in a militarised Caribbean where warships and drones haunt the waters. Trade through the Gulf of Paria and regional ports could be disrupted, raising costs for fragile economies already strained by debt and inflation. Diplomacy will fracture as Caricom’s delicate balance with Washington and Caracas collapses, leaving small states exposed.What is needed now is not more posturing but restraint. Talks between Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Caricom, and Colombia – the historic source of the cocaine pipeline – are essential. The international community must demand transparency and de-escalation. Small island states cannot afford to become battlegrounds.Emboldened by Trump, the ‘liberal’ UK is giving free rein to its colonial impulses | Kenneth MohammedRead moreThe Caribbean must also insist on restoring international norms: detain suspects, investigate, prosecute. To kill without evidence and bomb small vessels without warning or due process is a descent into lawlessness that endangers every fisher, trader and innocent seafarer.Trinidad and Tobago, and the wider Caribbean, cannot be reduced to staging grounds for US electioneering or Venezuelan brinkmanship. Without restraint – from Caricom, the UN and sober voices in the hemisphere – the region risks being dragged into a conflict that is not of its making.Our fishing industry, our tourism, our fragile economies all stand to suffer. And beyond this lies sovereignty over our most valuable assets: oil and gas. The southern Caribbean is a resource frontier of immense global importance. History shows that US interventions in oil-rich states rarely end in stability or prosperity for the people who live there.Caribbean leaders must rediscover the discipline of solidarity, the wisdom of diplomacy, and the courage to say no to superpowers who mistake small states for pawns.The price for silence will not be paid in Washington or Caracas, but in the lives, economies and futures of Caribbean people.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsCaribbeanDrugscommentShareReuse this content"

Self-styled progressives in the arts must take a hard look at themselves tooTue 30 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 03.26 EDTShareIn sports, the Black athlete is often mythologised: supernatural speed, exceptional strength, genetics as magic. And yet, in public spaces, a Black person running is met with suspicion, fear or anger. The choreographer Joana Tischkau’s new pieceRunnin’, which premiered at Berlin’s prestigious performance stage HAU, last week, opens that tension and holds it for us to see.The work builds itself in the everyday: four performers move in circles across an empty stage. It brings the so-called “pedestrian movement” of postmodern dance – walking, standing, sitting – the sort of movement considered neutral, almost invisible, into collision with the Black body. When a racialised person simply moves, simply breathes in our shared streets, the piece seems to ask, is that ever neutral?The audience wasthrilled. We were lucky enough to have witnessed a dance performance turning into a subtle metaphor, a playful mirror for what is happening around us right now in Berlin’s cultural landscape. Questions of participation and unconscious bias with respect to race and gender seem no longer at the centre of discourse. Not because they have been successfully answered already, but because they have been silently pushed aside, in favour of a hollow neutrality, a return to the status quo.For a few years, it looked as though something was shifting in Germany’s cultural institutions. In the wake of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, suddenly there were panels everywhere on structural racism, gender quotas and commitments to diversify programming. Berlin, ever proud of its progressive image, rushed to be the ultimate role model for diversity. And it was, for a while. But now the mood ischanging, dramatically.Across the city, the appetite for “diversity” seems to have passed. The energy and resources that were once put into anti-racist and inclusive work have faded, and diversity programmes are the first to besacrificedwhen austerity measures are taken. At a Berlin artsconferenceearlier this year, Tischkau said: “As a Black German, able-bodied and cisgender woman, I managed to slide through the extremely short window of so-called ‘diversity-sensitive opening’. A window that is now completely closing … This is not participation. This is anti-democratic … My biography should not be an exception, but the norm.”View image in fullscreenThe Senegalese novelist Mohamed Mbougar Sarr, who was awarded the Haus der Kulturen der Welt international literary prize in 2023.Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesThe closing window is not just a Berlin story. It is a global one. In the US, thebacklashis far louder and more radical. Under Donald Trump’s presidency, critical race theory isdeclared a threat. Diversity training in federal institutions has beenbanned. Universities and school districts are being targeted for teaching histories that acknowledge systemic racism. The message is clear: diversity is dangerous.That same rhetoric is making its way across the Atlantic. In Germany, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has framed diversity and gender politics as “ideological indoctrination”. It attacks cultural institutions that platform marginalised voices, framing them as anti-German and extremist. And increasingly it is being heard.But it is not only the far right’s success in recent elections or the extreme budget cuts that feed into regressive cultural politics. The backlash was there from day one, and as I have sadly realised over the years in various confidential settings, it came from inside the house. It came from many of the people we work with day to day, who would identify themselves as progressive, leftist even, and who would claim to just look at the “quality” of a piece of work, rather than its author’s identity, towards which they think they are, of course, totally neutral.State-funded diversity programmes looked good on paper but were always a hassle to implement in reality. Many people who have worked within German cultural institutions in recent years will tell you how hard they had to fight to persuade their own colleagues that white, heteronormative or Eurocentric positions are not per se the “better” art. As though it’s not a question of references and knowledge when considering which artworks we find more valuable and which ones we simply don’t understand. To broaden our perspectives, we have to acknowledge which communities and subjects are underrepresented in cultural and artistic spaces, so we can find ways to balance it out, with specific calls and invitations and funding.But, of course, limited resources in arts and culture lead to competition, which sometimes turns into a ruthless defence of privileges. Everything that deals with marginalisation is instantly labelled “woke”. Artists of colour have to justify their success, which is suspected to be a result of preferential treatment rather than an outcome of their craft and effort. Usually these mechanisms play out behind the closed doors of committees and juries whose work is strictly confidential. But once a disagreement over diversity becomes public, it is immediately instrumentalised by the political right.When the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) awarded itsinternational literary prizeto the Senegalese author Mohamed Mbougar Sarr in 2023, two members of the jury subsequentlypublicly criticisedthe judging process saying that, in their view, questions of identity and race had outweighed literary criteria. They didn’t explicitly say that Sarr didn’t deserve the prize, because this would have been ridiculous. The 35-year-old author has won prizes around the world for hisoutstanding novel, The Most Secret Memory of Men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The allegations were immediately rejected by HKW, a multidisciplinary arts space in Berlin known for its decolonial approach. But, of course, the statement by the ex-jury members was of great use to the AfD. The far-right party’s leaders quoted it in aparliamentary questionthis summer, questioning public funding for the HKW’s “pro-migration” programming and the suitability of its director.The danger here is not only political, it’s cultural. When institutions end their diversity missions preemptively, when funding bodies shy away from “controversial” topics, when artists are told their work is “too specific”, we don’t just lose representation. We lose truth, we lose complexity. Because art should be free to reflect the world as it is, not just as the powerful would like to see it.The anti-diversity backlash is not just fatigue – it is a strategy. Like all reactionary movements, it masquerades as a return to “neutrality”. But this neutrality was never real, as Tischkau’s Runnin’ powerfully reflects, without spelling it out. It doesn’t have to, we can sense it.

Nearly half of respondents are satisfied with the range. It’s also worth noting that those who think it is too ambitious far outnumber those who think it’s undercooked, by a factor of more than 2:1.As you may be aware, the government recently announced a new national target to reduce emissions by 62–70% below 2005 levels by 2035. Do you think that this new emissions target is too ambitious, not ambitious enough or about right?This mindful staidness is also present in the government’s stubborn reticence to address tax incentives for property investors, its refusal to review our defence reliance on a US empire that is in decline and its naive embrace of AI tech-boosters.On all these fronts the government seems disinclined to scare the horses, lest they stampede.Andrew Hastie and the rise of the ‘Maga right’ – podcastRead moreThe limitations of a “Don’t panic” operating model of government become apparent, however, when panicking becomes the rational response to global heating, democratic instability and rising inequality exacerbated by unregulated technology.As we take our seats at the “Restaurant at the End of the Universe”, is it good enough to order the house pasta and the second least expensive wine?This is the dilemma confronting the British Labour government and its mild to the point of milquetoast leader, Keir Starmer, who may have totally out-sensibled the Tories, but in doing so is opening up a gaping hole for Nigel Farage’s populist Reform movement.Emerging from the successful Brexit forces, Reform is adjacent to the Maga movement and One Nation and every rightwing populist, tapping into the grievance of a global economic system and a desire to return to the certainties of the nation-state and anti-immigrant tropes.A final question in this month’s report shows that despite a flattening of the post-Covid lockdowns catch-up surge, Australians too are concerned about the pace and depth of immigration.Currently Australia’s immigration cap for the 2025/26 financial year is set at 185,000 places, which is the same amount as the previous 2024/25 cap. Do you think Australia’s immigration cap is too high, too low or about right?You can see Andrew Hastie chalking his cue while Pauline Hanson must be positively salivating.There is a credible argument that Australia is less susceptible to immigration panics because we have lived them for the past two and a half decades; indeed our model of asylum seeker cruelty is something some other nations aspire to.But the broader point holds that hitherto progressive parties in power choosing to defend the status quo expose themselves to the totally rational conclusion of voters when the system stops working for them.To be a viable centrist party, the centre needs to hold. And the only way the centre holds is if these parties provide a reason for most of the people to occupy it. That doesn’t mean standing for nothing, it means building something that people want to hold on to.Albanese senses this andhis speechto the UK Labour party conference made the point that it is only in improving the material conditions of working people that social democratic parties will have a future. This inevitably means intervening in a system travelling the opposite way.The truth is the world is getting scarier and crazier. Australia may be bucking the political trends for now but that doesn’t mean we aren’t concerned about life, the universe and everything.After 15 years reporting on Earth, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to Galaxy’s reviewerFord Prefectrates the planet “mostly harmless”. If we get through the next few decades with that entry remaining accurate, then there will be serious grounds for relief.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

This speaks to a party that has not only lost its soul, but is scared of the truthTue 30 Sep 2025 14.04 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 14.05 EDTShareA party without a soul, a purpose, or tolerance for dissent: that’s the lasting impression ofLabourfrom its annual jamboree in Liverpool.Corporate Britain is stamped over everything. There’s a “hub” sponsored by the lobbying firm Anacta, whose clients range from anIsraeli-owned arms companyto various airlines. Ministers chatter with suited business types in a “lounge” sponsored by Arden Strategies – the “advisory and communications firm” run by the former Labour cabinet minister Jim Murphy, now a key conduit between boardrooms and government – while the invite-only Politico Pub is underwritten by Uber. Labour’s commitment to a third Heathrow runway is boastfully projected on to a conference wall. Signs of idealism are scarce: the party shop sells posters of Barbara Castle, but given herscalding denunciationsof Blairism, one can imagine what she’d make of this one-note tribute act to New Labour.The soullessness has much to do with the “climate of fear” diagnosed by Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor and pretender to the Labour crown. The most authoritarian leadership in the party’s history has waged a remorseless war on dissent, transforming Labour into a hollowed out husk, where contempt for injustice is considered dangerous extremism. Labour MPs have been variously suspended for opposing Israel’s genocide, the Tory two-child benefit cap and Starmer’s attempted attack on disability benefits. When predominantly Muslim councillors resigned over Gaza, one Labour source dismissed it as “shaking off the fleas”. Members,Burnham notes, face suspension for something as minor as “liking a tweet by another political party”.Beyond the conference perimeter, police arrested dozens of peaceful protesters for holding placards opposing genocide and backing the direct action movement Palestine Action; it’s now proscribed by the Labour government as a terrorist organisation on an equal footing with Isis and al-Qaida. Since the ban, roughly 1,700 people – many of them elderly –have been arrested.I’ve had a taste of this authoritarianism myself. I have been covering Labour and Conservative conferences almost every year for the decade and a half. Each year, I confront ministers with uncomfortable questions – on issues such as benefit cuts, sleaze allegations, or broken promises. This year, I questioned Labour grandees, including the foreign secretary, on Britain’s continued sale of crucial components for Israel’s murderous fighter jets. The next day, the party emailed me to revoke my conference pass, citing “complaints” about my “conduct”. It added that: “After careful consideration, we’ve concluded that we cannot continue your attendance while ensuring we meet our safeguarding obligations to all attendees.” Rivkah Brown, another leftwing journalist, from Novara Media, also had her pass cancelled at almost the exact same time.Invoking “safeguarding” – as though asking uncomfortable questions about genocide somehow threatens safety – resembles Trumpian attempts to portray critique and dissent as incitement to violence.Nigel Farage similarly claimsthat Keir Starmer labelling his anti-migrant policies as “racist” is inciting violence against his party. A couple of years ago, I and a number of other leftwing journalists abruptly stopped receiving emails from Labour’s press list. Every rightwing media outlet retained its place, and note how GB News has an on-site studio in the conference zone, fuelled by a constant supply of smiling Labour ministers.Where has this toxic blend of authoritarianism and soullessness left the party? The country seethes with contempt for the governing party. Starmer is the most unpopular new prime minister sincerecords began in the 1980s, plummeting to depths unseen even by Liz Truss, while just12% approveof the government’s record, compared with 70% who disapprove. As Britain’s pre-eminent pollster, Sir John Curtice, told a room of depressed-looking delegates, theparty began its term in officewith weak enthusiasm – securing just over a third of the vote amid record low turnout – and it was downhill from there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some seem stumped when asked what Labour’s vision is, while others fall back on platitudes no politician would dissent from, such as growth and improving living standards. The scrapping of the universal winter fuel payment and the abortive attack on disability benefits are widely labelled “mistakes”. There is precious little soul-searching over how Labour could end up kicking those who are struggling the most in society, instead of challenging the hoarding of wealth at the top. Surely this is an existential question for a party founded to do the exact opposite?John McTernan is a former adviser to Tony Blair, but he offers the most perceptive analysis I have heard. Labour is “unpopular because it made the wrong moral choice over Gaza”, he tells me. “It’s unpopular because it made the wrong political choices over public spending and social security.” But is this any surprise? Starmerism has sought to scrub any conscience from the party. Once, across Labour’s spectrum, there was a shared premise: Labour existed to fight injustice, even if there was fierce debate over the road to such a righteous destination. But there is no obvious purpose to Labour at all today, no clear articulation of its distinctive role in politics. If the mission has narrowed to power for power’s sake, it will fail at that too – because the public has clocked this brittle, soulless machine, and their contempt only grows.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionLabour party leadershipKeir StarmerLabourSocialismcommentShareReuse this content"

The PM is out of step with modern digital politics and needs to catch upTue 30 Sep 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.52 EDTShareKeir Starmer saved his best for the fragile circumstances of a difficult Labour conference. It may not yet be enough to save him. All the same, this was by some way Starmer’s most effective and certainly hismost interesting conference speechsince becoming Labour leader five years ago. Not a particularly high bar, it must be admitted, since Starmer is no great orator – but at least the bar is one that he cleared.In the dire situation now facing Labour, this mattered a lot. In his earlier conference speeches, Starmer was always stolid and decent but at times painfully careful not to drop the famous “Ming vase”. The phrases that define those earlier efforts – mission-led government, a government of service or even the 2024 manifesto title, Change – may have meant something to Starmer and those around him. But they meant little to anyone else. They sank like stones into the contemporary sea of political indifference.This time, though, Starmer laid it on the line more forcefully. Here in this speech, he told conference, is whatLabouris in power to achieve, a renewal of Britain in which workers and minorities can get the justice and rewards they deserve in a united country. Here are some of the examples – a new approach to post-school education and training, a digital step-change in NHS services among them. All this was a fight for the national soul, between the division whipped up by Nigel Farage and the pragmatic decencies of the Britain that Starmer grew up in. Some of the phrases were still clunky. What does “a Britain built for all” say that something like “make Britain fair again” doesn’t say better?There was only one problem, but it is a big one. This was the speech that Starmer ought to have given before the 2024 election, not now. At the very least, he needed to have given it straight after Labour had come back to office. Back then, the message that Starmer’s big project will take time might have inoculated Labour against some of the headaches it has faced in year one.Instead, Starmer seemed almost paralysed by the immensity of the task that faced him when he became prime minister. It felt beyond him to lay out a clear goal and an honest prognosis of what it would take to get to it. He seemed stubbornly indifferent to the need to explain things to the nation. At least he seems to have got the message now.Rachel Reeves, though not a brilliant speaker either,tried to revive a version of thison Monday when she said she knew things were difficult, that there were too many obstacles to change and that market confidence is hard to win and easy to lose. But this also is what she should have been saying from day one. Instead, she stumbled into aneedless rowon winter fuel payments. Both Reeves and Starmer need a modern version of the brilliant constant reshaping of the national argument by Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. It may not yet be too late.Except that even Starmer’s or Reeves’s best is not really good enough for the situation they face and for the alienated politics of the modern world. This is not to attack Starmer in particular. Nor is it to say that anyone else, Andy Burnham, for instance, would have been better.In the old normal, the Starmer speech might have been enough. Starmer storms it – job done, the headlines could say. But traditional conference speeches do not cut it these days. They are a relic of the way politics used to be done, not a cutting edge weapon in the volatile world of contemporary digital politics. Starmer still struggles with this reality. At one point, he contrasted the “real Britain” of local activism with the indecency of the social media world. But it is the social media world that is reshaping politics, not local activism.Conference speeches matter far less than they once did – maybe than they ever did. Leaders expend vast amounts of energy on them. Every year involved “agony, consternation, madness and creativity in roughly equal proportions” Tony Blair wrote in his memoirs. And Blair was pretty good at them. Yet getting a leader’s speech to cut through is almost impossible now. Most are here today and gone tomorrow.Has any political speech of any kind actually made the weather in Britain since Geoffrey Howe’s resignation speech in 1990, which set in motion the overthrow of Margaret Thatcher? Has any conference speech truly reset the political agenda since Aneurin Bevan’s “naked into the conference chamber” speech attacking nuclear disarmament in 1957?There have, of course, been memorable moments – Thatcher’s “the lady’s not for turning” or her resolve after the Brighton bombing among them,Neil Kinnock attacking Militantand Blair scrapping clause IV. But these were more confirmatory and iconic, not gamechanging. Starmer will have felt that this year’s speech went well, but he should not delude himself into thinking it will make a lot of difference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The blogger James O’Malleywrote recently that, even for those who notice them, which most people do not, the speech will still just be another boring politician standing behind a lectern, unchanged despite a two-decade revolution in how most people engage with the news. Instead, O’Malley said, Starmer’s goal should be to go viral. He should use screens. He could film the speech as a video. He could bring on surprise guests. Hold your nose, Keir, and be more creative.To win an argument like the one that faces Labour today he needs to prepare much better. Hone the argument more fully, turn it into a campaign, make it patriotic and practical – and use exciting words. Make the promises substantive but don’t promise instant rewards. You absolutely should not just say something for a one-day headline and then ignore it, as Starmer seems to have done on digital ID in his speech. That approach is guaranteed to lose control.It may be true that the battle against Farage gives Labour an enemy to fight against, and a cause to believe in, and that this will unite and energise the grassroots. In the circumstances facing Starmer in Liverpool, that may seem like enough of an achievement. But, like conference speeches in general, it is unlikely to reach out for long to the uninvolved and indifferent. To these voters, Starmer is not a reason to vote Labour rather than Reform or Tory, as the Labour devotees will tend to see it. For too many, Starmer’s inability to solve this country’s economic and social decline may look like continuity hopelessness.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She then directs them to “look at my jawline here” – pointing to the side where she has applied the seeds before turning her head so as to create a double chin on the other side, her voice noticeably lower with the strain – “versus here”.She is not alone, as many others also claim to see a difference. “I just watched the before and after and it’s definitely worked!”another influencer tells her followers.Birth control: why are influencers turning away from the pill and towards natural contraceptive methods? | AntiviralRead moreBut what do the experts say about this trend?What is ear seeding and where does it come from?Lily Feng, an acupuncturist and the director of the AustralianAcupunctureand Chinese Medicine Association, says ear seeding is a form of traditional Chinese medicine. Auricular acupuncture or auricular acupressure uses filiform needles, dermal needles, metal seeds orSemen vaccariaeseeds to apply physical pressure to stimulate auricular points. These points are supposed to correlate with body parts – based on the association between the ear’s shape and an inverted foetus – so stimulating the corresponding point of the ear can help achieve a therapeutic outcome elsewhere on the body, Feng says. “But it does not relate to cosmetic claims made online.”Prof Jon Wardle, the director of the national centre for naturopathic medicine at Southern Cross University, says the trend co-opts traditional Chinese medicine. The difference is that “people are bypassing the practitioners and the expertise and recommending uses that may or may not be useful”.Many influencers promote ear seeds customers can apply themselves at home. The trend’s popularity has led to beauty brands including Mecca offering gold ear seed therapy sessions with an acupuncturist – to add a “‘feel-good sparkle’ to your wellness path”.What does the evidence show?Dr Theone Papps, a dermatologist at the Skin hospital in Sydney, says there have been some randomised controlled trials where one group have ear seeding and another placebo group have tape and no seed, or nothing at all.A lot of these research studies come from China and Korea. The assumption is that ear seeding – like acupuncture – may trigger nerve reflexes, which may then release muscle tension, Papps says.Most of the studies have been conducted on patients who have had surgery, she says – often jaw or dental surgery. “Many of these studies are positive in that they show that there is improvement in pain and anxiety … but there’s not enough robust research with regards to facial de-puffing.”Associate Prof Deshan Sebaratnam, another dermatologist at the Skin hospital, says there is no evidence to support that ear seeds can sculpt or lift the face, nor evidence that pressing on an ear can help with respiratory, digestive or endocrine issues, as is sometimes claimed in ear seed marketing.Are there any harms from ear seeding?Papps says considers ear seeds a “low-risk treatment” but cautions that excessive repeated pressure could cause trauma to the cartilage. If the tape is left on too long it could can dryness or irritation to the skin. To people who want to use ear seeds, she advises avoiding excessive pressure when applying them and maintaining hygiene.Wardle agrees that the therapy in itself is not harmful but harm could come if people used it to address symptoms related to an underlying medical issue, ignoring other treatments.A meaty topic: what is the carnivore diet and why do so many influencers seem to swear by it? | AntiviralRead moreThe regulations for unregistered health practitioners require them to avoid monopolising the care of a patient and not discourage multidisciplinary care where appropriate, he says.Are there reasons to be worried about a puffy face?Facial puffing can be serious if it is due to underlying medical conditions, Papps says, such as thyroid malfunction, kidney problems that cause fluid retention or hormonal changes, as well as dermatological issues including cutaneous sarcoidosis and skin lymphoma.“If it’s persistent and not responding to some simple measures, it is, of course, always important to have a review with a medical professional to make sure anything serious is excluded,” she says.But “a lot of people wake up quite puffy in the morning, and a lot of that’s just gravity and poor lymphatic flow”, she says. “The lymphatics drain all of our toxins – it’s basically the plumbing system to eliminate a lot of the junk that’s in our body.”If someone has ruled out any other serious causes of facial puffiness, Papps recommends trying simple solutions like elevation – sleeping on a few extra pillows. Facial massage can also promote circulation.Sebaratnam says: “Most people do not need to do anything extra to help clear their lymphatics – your body does this naturally.” But in certain situations, he said, for instance for patients who have had their lymph nodes removed because of cancer surgery, some people find that massage can be helpful.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But until Palestine is free, we will show what solidarity we can from our vesselTue 30 Sep 2025 08.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 13.52 EDTShareMy first task on the boat is to ease a red rope from the cockpit while a Danish participant opposite me tautens a white one. Between us, we hoist the sail. The coastline of Augusta, Sicily, fades behind us. There are seven people on board: three French, two Irish, one Dane and one Irish-Danish for good measure.Ours is the fastest boat of the Thousand Madleens flotilla sailing toGazajust behind the Global Sumud ships. My boat was the last to depart; we saw off eight other ships at the port, having just shared a week of intensive training with those on board. All participants have been sleeping on our boats since we arrived, so we know their layouts well. I have found a space for each of my possessions to “live” in a cramped environment where everything must be kept in lockers.If successful, we will deliver aid for Palestinians in Gaza. The boat is loaded with medicine, baby formula, prosthetic limbs for the many amputees that Israeli bullets have created. For the several weeks ahead of us, the organisers told us to bring a personal rucksack no larger than an aircraft carry-on bag. Every available crevice of the boat has been crammed with emergency supplies for Palestinians.We are not sailing simply to deliver our cargo, but to pressure our countries to stop arming and funding Israel. All of our governments – French, Danish, Irish – participate in the genocide through maintaining ties with its perpetrator. We’re not even protesting inaction, but the active sabotage of Palestinian self-determination. We didn’t want to have to send a flotilla, and Palestinians in Gaza didn’t want to rely on our doing so. But untilPalestineis free, we will show what solidarity we can from our boat.Initially, our boat was named Algol – a “demon star”, apparently. We rechristened it Milad after Milad Walid Daqqa, the daughter of a long-term imprisoned Palestinian politician and writer. Just before we set sail, I painted the new name in green on the side of the boat from a dinghy.View image in fullscreenOur sailors have a reassuringly firm sense of how everything should be run. They sailed the Milad across the Atlantic themselves before recommending the flotilla organisers buy it for the journey to Gaza. It shows plenty of wear – indelible stains on the kitchen counter, temperamental lights and sockets – but in terms of seaworthiness, it has amply proven its chops.The sailors have devised a rota of tasks – sailing, cooking, cleaning, night watch – but they stress the importance of proactively solving any problems we encounter. “The boat can never be too clean,” one of them tells me as I kneel down from the deck to scrub the boat’s exterior with a giant sponge. I loosen the dirt, then he washes it off by tossing a bucket of sea water over it. “You must never let sea water inside the boat,” he says. “The salt attracts humidity and nothing dries.”I have done everything I can to ward off sea sickness: wristbands, under-ear patches and pills to be taken twice daily. Otherwise, it’s best to stay outside and look at the horizon. My new open-air writing study consists of a 30cm-deep patch of sitting space near the starboard; the only barrier between me and the water a metre in front is two thin lines of metal rope. Everything is grey-blue today – the water, the sky. I didn’t bring a laptop – too impractical to use on the deck – so I write in a notepad and on my phone.Israel has intercepted or attacked every flotilla to Gazasince 2010, always in international waters – the flotilla routes never enter Israel. The Sumud boats ahead of us have already faced two rounds of drone strikes,one while docked in Tunisiaandanother in Greek waters. Israel has not commented on the attacks. Flotilla participants are not the true target of these aggressions: they stem from Israel’s relentless campaign to block the means of life from Palestinians. If we were delivering aid to anyone else, we would be left alone. Although attacks on the flotilla are illegal and highly dangerous, everyone on my boat is more concerned about the far worse atrocities Israel routinely commits in Palestine and particularly in Gaza.It can feel hopelessly insignificant to fold towels and untangle deck cables while Israel ethnically cleanses and obliterates an entire people. But I think of it this way: the urgency in Gaza is precisely why our mission needs to be well run, down to every last detail. Our desire isn’t merely to do something, anything; it’s for it to be effective.View image in fullscreenActivists wave palestinian flags as a flotilla leaves the harbour.Photograph: Pascal Pochard-Casabianca/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Italian and Spanish navy ships that have beendispatched to accompany uswill hopefully increase our odds of safe passage and delivery. If this serves Palestinians by helping to get aid to them, it is at least some form of practical support. These countries, and Europe as a whole, still urgently need to fully sanction Israel. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, recently described our mission as “gratuitous, dangerous and irresponsible”. What about a country that,according to doctor testimonies, shoots children dead with a single targeted bullet to the head or chest?The US and UK are hardly more credible as state actors, having sown chaos in the region for many decades. Yet Donald Trump and Tony Blair are key voices in the newproposed peace planthat has left Palestinians sceptical. Watching this development from the flotilla are ordinary Americans and Brits. They sail with the rest of us as conscientious objectors to their countries’ many misdeeds.We’re still in Italian waters now; we’ve been told the voyage to Gaza will take two to three weeks, depending on weather and on how events unfold. It’s only rational to be prepared for scenarios besides the ideal one of safely delivering our aid in Gaza. But in highlighting the lengths Israel goes to in order to starve Palestinians, and in pressurising our governments back home, we hope to accomplish something regardless.Naoise Dolan is an Irish writer and the author ofExciting TimesandThe Happy CoupleDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Be very clear: without slashing emissions we are in deep, deep troubleTue 30 Sep 2025 04.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 05.18 EDTShareThe hope that followed the signing of theParis climate agreementin 2016 has long gone as the global community has failed utterly to rein in emissions, which – barring a small pandemic-induced blip in 2020 – have headed remorselessly upwards ever since. And there is little sign of this changing anytime soon. Indeed, as global heating has accelerated over the past few years, instead of trying harder, the world is turning its back on measures to tackle the climate crisis.In the UK, Labour is considering the approval of two major newoilfields in the North Sea– Rosebank and Jackdaw – with both Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves reported to be backing the proposals, which would lock in reliance on fossil fuels at the expense of renewables. Alongside this, instead of the government introducing measures to reduce aviation emissions, such as a frequent-flyer levy and the taxing of aviation fuels, a Heathrow expansion has been greenlit and, just last week, a second runwayat Gatwick.And having announced plans in March to drop support for net zero by 2050, Kemi Badenoch’s Tories have now also signed up tosucking every last drop of oil and gasout of UK waters.Across the Channel, green measures are under attack too. Last month, even as the continent sweltered beneath record temperatures, the EU announced that its 2040 target, which seeks to reduce emissions by 90% on 1990 levels, would be made more flexible – forwhich read watered down. Under pressure from business and the political right, this will now allow millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions to be offset by buying carbon credits from outside the bloc – a scam designed to permit business as usual by paying someone else to absorb the resulting carbon emitted.Inevitably, ground zero of the fightback to prevent serious climate action is the White House. Since coming to power in his second term, Donald Trump has worked tirelessly to erase all and any climate initiatives, to the extent ofpulling outof the Paris climate agreement,opening up wilderness areasto drill for hydrocarbons, trashingregulation of the fossil fuel sectorand shutting down investment in clean energy. Seeing which way the wind was blowing, US banks including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachsquickly jumped shipfrom the net zero alliance, which committed them to aligning their activities with the Paris agreement. Canadian and Asian banks followed,along with the major UK banksHSBC and Barclays.UK ministers reopen door to drilling at two North Sea oilfields as new guidance releasedRead moreFreed from any constraint, investment in the fossil fuel sector is only likely to go up, facilitating more, not less, exploitation of oil, gas and coal reserves. As it is, investment in 2024 saw a huge hike in fossil fuel finance, the world’s biggest banks committinga colossal $869bn to the sector. Back in 2020, after big losses caused by the pandemic-driven economic slowdown, oil and gas companies were almost down and out. Worried about being left with a product no one wanted, many announced big investments in renewables. BP even pledged to cut its oil and gas production by 40% by the end of the decade. Five years on, this promise is in shreds. Now fossil fuel corporations areon track to nearly quadruple, by the end of this decade, the amount of extracted oil and gas from newly approved projects.As the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil fast approaches, the general malaise that has stymied climate action seems to be spreading. All countries were required to submit their national climate plans (known as “nationally determined contributions”, or NDCs) by February this year, butonly a handfulhave. Many more are expected to do so in advance of the November start date, but the delay is symbolic of the downgraded importance, in many circles, that action on emissions now holds. To say all this is grim news is an understatement.The excuse most often provided for turning away from green measures, for expanding fossil fuel production, for ignoring the science, is pragmatism. The idea being that, yes, the climate emergency is serious, but we have to be practical – we have to consider other things too, inevitably ensuring business as usual, protecting the bottom line and keeping consumer capitalism in the fast lane. The fact is that this is dangerous drivel. Pragmatism is only possible when feasible alternatives are available. Where climate breakdown is concerned, there is no alternative. The climate doesn’t recognise pragmatism. We either slash emissions now or we are in deep, deep trouble.Wealth and power shape the climate emergency – the most important tool we have to defend ourselves is the facts | Naomi KleinRead moreIn 2024, the temperature of the planet topped the 1.5C temperature-rise thresholdfor the first time(since preindustrial times), and according to the UK Met Office, there is a 70% chance that the average temperature rise over the next five years will be above this.A recent reportby the UK Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and Exeter University forecasts that a 2C global temperature hike by 2050 would see a 25% collapse in the global economy and 2 billion people dead. This is what the end game of a “pragmatic” climate strategy looks like.We can no longer pretend that we are sleepwalking into climate catastrophe. We are doing it consciously, with our eyes wide open, and hang the consequences. The truth is that on a rapidly heating planet, a pragmatic approach means that we are playing Russian roulette with all six barrels loaded. The only question is just how big a mess we will make when we pull the trigger.Bill McGuire is professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at UCL and author of Hothouse Earth: an Inhabitant’s GuideExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionParis climate agreementLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

But at least she is wrestling the debate back towards integration and belongingTue 30 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 05.51 EDTShareIn Twickenham, at the weekend, the crowd was a sea of red and white.England’s colourswere everywhere – plastered on sweatshirts and painted over faces, fluttering from flags – and the mood was unmistakably joyful. For this was of course the Women’s Rugby World Cup final, not some ominous “raise the colours” rally: a chance to remember that the St George’s cross doesn’t belong to people who daub it on roundabouts to frighten the neighbours, that there is still a kind of Englishness that inspires hope, not fear. Rugby’s Red Roses, like football’s Lionesses and Gareth Southgate’s young male England squad before them, embody a consciously inclusive form of patriotism: a message that their victories are for everyone, male or female, black or white, gay or straight.So it was a relief to hear the new home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, articulate clearly that weekend what should always have been Labour’s line on both the English and British flags: that, as the English-born daughter of Pakistani-born parents, she sees herself in them and is “all for” their use as a symbol of unity, but not as a means to exclude and divide. “I’m a patriot, not a nationalist,” shetold the Sun on Sunday. And, yes, it would have been better had Keir Starmer said something like that from the start. Butbetter late than never, which seems to be the motto of a party conference at which Labour is finally allowing itself to call Reform UK’s new immigration policies what they are.The outlines are fuzzy, but in Liverpool there are glimmerings of a new politics of belonging: an aspiration to be what Mahmood called an “open, tolerant, generous” country, welcoming to newcomers, while acknowledging that migrants aren’t the only ones sometimes struggling to find their feet in a multi-ethnic nation. Some British-born voters, too, evidently feel isolated and alienated from places they used to know. And it’s in the fast-changing towns where both these groups are concentrated – often living geographically close but socially segregated lives – that populist politicians, whether from Reform or pro-Gaza independents such as the one who almost cost Mahmood her seat last year, are gaining strength. Somehow, Labour’s task is to help two lonely tribes feel they belong in a new Britain.I’ve seen despair at the Labour conference, but Starmer’s battle for Britain’s soul is one he can still win | Polly ToynbeeRead more“Pride in place”, its newmultimillion pound schemeto invest in youth clubs and community pubs and projects to build up human connections, is a promising start: the aim isn’t just sprucing up tatty buildings but forging relationships, encouraging sometimes mutually suspicious neighbours to meet. It won’t be enough by itself to heal the rifts exposed in recent months – one early priority for the new communities secretary, Steve Reed, should be a bigger, more ambitious community cohesion programme – but it’s a thoughtful response. The flipside of it, however, is the much tougher messageMahmood brought to Liverpoolon Monday afternoon.She confirmed her predecessor Yvette Cooper’s plan to make migrants wait10 years, not the current five, to seek indefinite leave to remain, before facing the extra hurdle of a “good citizen” test many native-born Britons would fail. To earn permanent residency will require not just good English, a spotless criminal record and evidence of working and paying taxes, but also a willingness to claim no benefits and undertake voluntary work. This virtuous, civic-minded definition of Britishness bears spectacularly little resemblance to how actual Britons live – only16% of us volunteeronce a month, while10 million working-age Britons claim some benefit– but then, most native-born Britons probably couldn’t pass the existing life in the UK citizenship test without furtively Googling the history questions, either.As so often with Labour immigration policies, it’s framed in punitive terms that imply foreign workers are really only here on sufferance. It will undoubtedly be harsh for many, particularly refugees who are currently allowed to claim universal credit, and on workers who get sick or are made redundant.What it does do, however, is wrestle the debate back on to ground that had become dangerously neglected: integration, or the process of ensuring that people who weren’t born in Britain can belong here, which ultimately requires effort on both sides.The biggest challenge Mahmood now faces, one I have not seen before in my lifetime, is the shocking rise of ethnonationalism. It’s the blood-and-soil politics ofthose who claimRishi Sunak isn’t really English despite being born and raised here – a charge not levelled at his US-born, Brussels-raised, white-skinned predecessor, Boris Johnson – or that being Muslim is somehow fundamentally incompatible with living a properly “British” life. Both are veiled arguments not just that integration isn’t working, but that it canneverwork; that nothing any migrant does is enough. And, from there, it’s a dangerously short step to arguing that the only solution is to kick them out. Where belief in integration collapses, consent to immigration swiftly follows.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s crucial that integration can be shown to work, that the tribal human need to belong to something can be harnessed to unite rather than divide us, that the far right’s warped and self-serving nonsense about a country at war with itself be challenged, and a more honest and uplifting national story be told.We are notan island of strangers, in the words Starmer now regrets using: just an island that needs reminding, sometimes, of who we really are.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabour conference 2025OpinionShabana MahmoodImmigration and asylumKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

He then used foreign investor rights in two trade agreements with Singapore to sue the Australian government for a total of about $420bn in four separate cases before an international investment tribunal.Palmer’s first claim was for $300bnafter he lost a high court appeal against a Western Australian government decision to refuse an iron ore mining licence. The last three claims for a total of $120bn are because a Queensland court refused hiscoal mining licence and a licence for a coal-fired power plantforenvironmental reasons, including increased carbon emissions.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe tribunal has now dismissed Palmer’s claimto be a Singaporean investor in the first WA iron ore case and ordered himto pay the Australian government legal costs of $13.6m.The full decision has not yet been published and it is unclear if his other claims will proceed.Palmer has added to the uncertaintyby posting on social mediathat his legal team would challenge the tribunal’s decision in the federal supreme court of Switzerland as one of the seats of the international tribunal process. The Swiss court is not an appeal mechanism for the tribunal and cannot consider the broad merits of the case. In the meantime his other three coal-related cases may proceed.Clive Palmer banks on Swiss strategy after court throws out $305bn mine compensation claimRead morePalmer’s cases use a little-known set of rights for foreign investors in trade agreements, calledInvestor-State Dispute Settlement. ISDS allows foreign (but not local) investors to claim compensation for law or policy changes if they can convince an international tribunal that the change will reduce their expected future profits, even if the change is in the public interest. ISDS originally developed in the post-colonial period after the second world war to compensate international investors for the direct expropriation or taking of property by governments.However, over the past 60 years, foreign investor rights have expanded to include“indirect” expropriationand “legitimate expectations”, which do not exist in national legal systems. Investors can claim that they were not consulted adequately about the change or did not expect it when they made the investment. This has achilling effecton democratically decided public interest policy. ISDS has been excluded from World Trade Organization agreements and is found only in some regional and bilateral agreements, but investors can reorganise the locations of their investments to maximise claims as Palmer has done.Palmer’s claims expose the absurdity of ISDS, which allows investors to make multibillion-dollar claims against court decisions, legislation or policy changes. ISDSlacks the safeguardsof national legal systems. There are no independent judges, as tribunal members can continue to be practising advocates, and there are no precedents or appeals, so decisions lack consistency. These special corporate rights are a threat to democratic rights to regulate in the public interest, especially on climate change.Palmer’s last three cases joina growing global list of ISDS casesfrom fossil fuel companies against government decisions to reduce carbon emissions. A recentUnited Nations Reportconcluded that ISDS is a “major obstacle” to government action on climate change. Many governments are now withdrawing from ISDS arrangements. TheEuropean Unionand theUnited Kingdomhave quit the Energy Charter Treaty because fossil fuel investors are using its ISDS provisions to sue governments over phasing out fossil fuels.Labor government policyexcludes ISDS from future trade agreements and pledges to review it in 25 existing bilateral and regional agreements. This process is proceeding very slowly with reviews ofthree bilateral agreements. This review should be accelerated to prevent more cases like Palmer’s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now she’s directed – and starred in – a powerful debut filmRyan GilbeyTue 30 Sep 2025 12.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareBorn in the US, raised in apartheid-eraSouth Africa, a reluctant star in her 20s following her big break in Schindler’s List, and now a first-time director at the age of 60, Embeth Davidtz knows what it means to be an outsider. “I’ve always had the feeling,” she says, “that I don’t quite belong.”Normally found in Los Angeles – where she lives in a house once owned by Julie Andrews, with her husband, the entertainment lawyer Jason Sloane – Davidtz is today in Cape Town for work and family commitments. Speaking by video call from a cream-and-beige bedroom, wearing a white top and glasses with peach-coloured frames, her brunette hair tied back, she looks the picture of serenity. The effect is completed by her voice, which soothed millions of children when she starred as the perfect teacher, Miss Honey, in the 1996 film of Roald Dahl’s Matilda.Through the Bobo’s credulous voiceover, we learn that 'any African might be a terrorist'Even Miss Trunchbull, though, would be intimidated by the bitter, sozzled, shotgun-toting character Davidtz plays in her directorial debut. She adapted Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight from Alexandra Fuller’s 2001 memoir about her childhood in Zimbabwe, then called Rhodesia. Narrowing the action of the book down to a few months in 1980, when the country was approaching the elections that would see it regain its independence, Davidtz’s film filters events through the eyes and ears of Bobo, played by Lexi Venter, an eight-year-old white girl living on a farm with her older sister and their fearful, racist parents. It is through Bobo’s credulous voiceover that we learn how “any African might be a terrorist”; through watching her at play with Black children, whom she refers to as “my boys”, that we appreciate how deeply she has been contaminated.View image in fullscreen‘Like a wild lion cub’ … Lexi Venter as Bobo in Don’t Lets Go To The Dogs Tonight.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyDavidtz awarded herself the part of the girl’s volatile mother, who is given to stumbling around in her negligee shooting at snakes, or getting on her high horse, literally, to try to drive Black locals off “her” land. The role was meant to be bigger. “I adapted the book partly because I wanted to play the mother,” she says, “and to have a chance to chew up the scenery.” But once she realised Bobo’s perspective would be the most revealing, she pared back her own screen time. Wise move: it would be foolhardy indeed to compete with this feral newcomer, who zooms around on a tiny motorcycle in leather boots and tumbleweed hair with a rifle strapped to her back like a mini-Mad Max.Directing her was adventure enough. “Lexi is curious and funny and free,” says Davidtz. “But if I ever asked her to ‘act’ or to learn dialogue, then it was bad and we couldn’t use it. I had to grab things, call lines out to her, improvise stuff. I flew by the seat of my pants. It’s like taking a lion cub in the wild and observing its behaviour, throwing something in there that might distract it or elicit a reaction.”Making the movie was never solely about Davidtz grabbing a plum part for herself. There was also the attraction of autobiography-by-proxy. “I’d been trying to write about my upbringing,” she says. “Then when I read Alexandra’s memoir, I realised I could never match the way she captured herself as a vivid, ill-informed child. It was also more dramatic than my life, but there were enough little arteries running between them that I felt deeply connected to it. I remember saying to Alexandra, ‘I think I know how to tell this story.’”People drove so fast. Violence was commonplaceLike Bobo, young Davidtz had to scramble to make sense of the madness and cruelty around her. Her parents, who are both South African, had been studying in the US when she was born, then moved back to Johannesburg when she was eight so that her father could take a job as a chemical engineer. How did they prepare her for the starkly unequal society they were about to re-join? “They didn’t prepare me at all!” she says. “They didn’t prepare me foranythingin life. I was raised by wolves in a way. I don’t remember them saying, ‘It’s going to be different here.’”Different would be an understatement. “There was this incredible aggression everywhere. People drove so fast. Violence was commonplace. I guess the fish rots from the head down. You’d see people being put in the back of police vans. I saw two drunk white blokes punching this Black guy who wasn’t even doing anything. There was a creeping idea, not as much as you see in Zimbabwe in the film, but still prevalent, that the masses were going to turn on you if you were white. That was the myth the whites spoke about.”View image in fullscreenBig break … with with Liam Neeson in Schindler’s List.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIt is one that Donald Trump is still doing his damnedest to spread. A period piece the film may be, but it also serves as a warning to the present. “It’s fascinating when someone holds that position of power,” says Davidtz. “They have to rev people up by convincing them it’s all going to be taken away – by the ‘radical left’ or whoever the bogeyman happens to be.”Telling parts of her own story via Fuller’s life has been cathartic. But what gave Davidtz the gumption to feel she could get out there and direct having never done so before? “A couple of things. A lot of production had left LA. Back in the day, I could do episodes of Californication or Mad Men, things that were shot at home, but that had begun to dwindle away. As my kids got older, I felt less and less like I had a purpose. And then I got sick.”In 2013, in between playing the hero’s mother in two Spider-Man movies, Davidtz was diagnosed with stage-3 breast cancer. She had chemotherapy, immunotherapy, lymph-node-removal surgery and a double mastectomy. “It was not a great situation. People were very worried. I ended up being lucky and came through. And there was something I was left with after being so sick: that there is a singular road in front of me and you get your one shot at living a life.”Becoming a director also coincided with her disillusionment with acting, or at least with what she was being offered. “If a great director or a great part came along, I’d do it now.” She cites as a favourite the glorious 2005 indie comedy-drama Junebug, in which she played a big-city art dealer visiting her in-laws in the US south. “But I don’t want to take any old part with long, boring days saying lines that are so-so. I’ve done that and it made me miserable.”As long ago as the late 1990s, Davidtz was expressing dissatisfaction with her lot in Hollywood. Moving to the US from South Africa at the start of that decade, she leapt in the space of a year from the wickedly cartoonish Evil Dead sequel Army of Darkness to a small but indelible role as the brutalised housemaid to the SS commandant played by Ralph Fiennes in Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning Schindler’s List. Today, she places much of the blame on herself for what followed.“I was a deer in the headlights,” she sighs. “I said ‘No’ too often. I overthought things. It would have been better to say ‘Yes’ and not take too much time off to prepare for the next thing.” Her first big role after Spielberg’s movie wasn’t until two years later in an adaptation of HE Bates’s Feast of July. “Nobody saw it. I should have done two other films between Schindler’s List and that one. The train moves fast, and if you step off it, even for a minute, it keeps going. And the other actresses on the train, they keep going too. Then you’re left behind.”It won’t happen again. “Getting sick amplified everything for me. What do I want every day to look like? What do I want to accomplish with my life?” She turned 60 last month. “There was something depressing about it. Fifty was a great one: I’d beaten cancer and I was like, ‘I’m alive! Yeah!’”Still, not many people can celebrate their 60th birthday with the release of a debut film of such power and originality. “That was the thing. So I told myself to forget the number. My 50s were about getting this one off the ground. I’m going to make the first half of my 60s about piecing the next one together.”And now she knows she has it in her. “Making Don’t Let’s Go became this do-or-die thing. Like fighting through all the surgeries and treatment and six months of chemo. It was imperative. There was nothing else to do but to do it.” So there’s no confusing Davidtz with the winsome Miss Honey. “Iamquite tough,” she smiles. “People think I’m not. But there’s grit in me.”Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight is in cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmSouth AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The great contrarians explain allAmy FlemingTue 30 Sep 2025 10.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 12.49 EDTShareGilbert & George are excited. And proud. And smell so good that I’m tempted to ask what colognes they’re wearing. We’ve all just arrived at the Hayward Gallery on London’s South Bank, where their forthcoming show, 21st Century Pictures, is mid-hang. As soon as we’re through the doors, Gilbert darts about like a puppy let off the leash, urgently assessing the installation. “White Bastards!” George says to me, pointing to the 2004 piece as though he’s just spotted an old friend.The artists may be in their 80s, but all the work here was made in the last 25 years, and the gallery vibrates with rudeness, colour, contrarianism and cheek, their often vast creations luxuriating, as always, in warts-and-all humanity.We don't have the machine for music in our housePerhaps the most contrarian thing about this show is that there’s going to be an accompanyingorchestral extravaganza at the neighbouring Royal Festival Hall. Musical pieces will be performed by the Philarmonia, picked in order to explore Gilbert & George’s themes of sex, money, race and religion (collectively, the title of a massive four-part artwork). Their art will be projected on to screens during the performance.This all goes against much of what Gilbert & George stand for. Just last year George dismissed an immersive Van Gogh experience as“some populist nonsense”. But most of all, the event flies in the face of their longtime motto: “Music is the enemy.” I want to talk to you about music, I say as provocatively as possible, but they decline to rise to the bait. “I was a choirboy, after all,” says Gilbert.View image in fullscreenSex, 2016, from Sex, Money, Race, Religion.Photograph: Courtesy of Gilbert & George and White Cube“That’s an entirely different matter,” quips George, to guffaws around the room. But Gilbert continues: “I was even in a Bach choir, once. I must have been 18 or 19 because it was when I went to theArtAcademy in Munich.”Their big break as artists was musical, too,singing Underneath the Arches– the 1932 ode to homelessness – together. So are you a good singer as well, I ask George. “Of course,” says Gilbert. “But it was not important, the singing.”“Coming from darkest Devon and from Italy,” says George, the Devonian, “we suddenly realised there were so many people who were in trouble in cities, and we could see in every corner there were tramps and young people in trouble.”Gilbert takes over: “We lived in the East End of London, so they were all in front of churches, sleeping rough.” The pair befriended many of them, from survivors of the two world wars, says George, to men who, “had been in trouble with sex, and the vast majority had been caught cottaging in a public lavatory and sent to prison for three months, could never tell their parents or their employers.”The song, which they started performing in 1969, says Gilbert, “made us famous overnight. We made it into a living sculpture. Normally, sculptures are quite dead. We used to do these metallised heads, full of colours. We put on Vaseline and then powders; extraordinary. And we did the Hyde Park walk. That was the day of the Rolling Stones concert.”View image in fullscreenFunky, 2020.Photograph: © Gilbert & George Courtesy White Cube“We were just surrounded by people,” says George. “Young people asking us questions, imagining we had the answers to all the difficulties in life or something. Extraordinary.” Gilbert: “And then it became overnight, big success, galleries, New York, Amsterdam.” They would sing for around eight hours every day, and then were “badly behaved in the evenings,” says Gilbert. “We were entertained by all the famous artists at the time. The pop artists like Rauschenberg. Warhol took a portrait of us.”“New York was extraordinary,” adds George. “It was pre-Aids. Life was wonderful, pre-Aids.”So far, so rock’n’roll, and further clues to extracurricular musical enjoyment come when Gilbert reminisces about clubbing in 80s London. “We used to go tothe Blitz,” he says of the club where the New Romantics used to wear their most outrageous outfits. “We were a part of the beginning, when they started it all.” George adds that the address was the icing on the cake: “Great Queen Street.”Yet at some unspecified point in the distant past, they decided “to eliminate music from our art,” says Gilbert. “We felt that the streets of London were filled with galleries and theatres and everything, but that …” George finishes his sentence “… art was on the sideline a bit, because art with music didn’t feel very serious. Art without music is always better.”Music, George adds, is “too soothing. We’re allowed to be against the middle-classes for liking music too much … Couple of violins and it’s all fine. Some pictures by us, ‘Woah, I’m not sure about that.’”Do they enjoy music privately? “We don’t have the machine for doing that in our house,” says George . There’s a radio, but that’s for the news, “to check on the enemy.” And they watch films.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtesy White CubeThey seem to have little idea how or why this Philarmonia musical extravaganza came about, nor did they choose most of the repertoire, including Duke Ellington’s Black, from Black, Brown and Beige and Elgar’s Land of Hope and Glory. Although Underneath the Arches is on there, along with a medley of songs picked by them, not that they know what made the cut.“We did make these little suggestions,” says George, rummaging in his pocket and retrieving a stack of hand-written notes which includes a list: “As Time Goes By, You Made Me Do It, Pack Up Your Troubles, I’ll Be Seeing You, We’ll Meet Again, There’ll Be Joy and Laughter and Peace Ever After.” They don’t sound very 21st century. “They’re just songs that – we’re war babies remember – the first music I could hear was connected with the war.”What do they do to relax? “There’s a question,” says George. I’ve seen them having their nightly dinners at the Dalston Turkish restaurant Mangal II over the years. “That’s quite good,” says Gilbert. “Probably relaxing, yes.” Although it turns out they’ve since switched toMangal Iaround the corner because Mangal II, says Gilbert, “started to have music every night and we didn’t like it.”“Enough is enough,” confirms George.The marketing blurb for the Philarmonia event asks: “Can the orchestra convince them that music is NOT the enemy?” “Whatever,” says George. “Just see what happens.” I get the impression they’re embracing the cross-pollination arts institutions go in for these days largely because they’re so chuffed with their retrospective, and are happy to promote and celebrate it in all the ways required of them. (Plus, it’s amusingly contrarian.)And celebrating they are.“It’s very thrilling to have a big show in a public space like this in the centre of London,” says George. Anything else they want to say about the new show?“Make them come,” says Gilbert. “In many different ways.”Gilbert & George: Sex, Money, Race, Religion is at theRoyal Festival Hall, London, on Sunday 5 October.

If she wasn’t around when you were young, this show will make you wish she wasChitra RamaswamyTue 30 Sep 2025 17.20 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 17.22 EDTShareFor the sake of the Swifties, let’s get straight down to business. What are the juicy reveals in Taylor, the two-part Channel 4 documentary strategically positioned to air in the overwrought run-up to the release of The Life of a Showgirl? Well, there’s the camp titbit about her first tour bus being decked out in leopard print and previously belonging to Cher; and at one point Robert Ellis Orrall, who co-produced her debut album, deftly fans out a bunch of CDs of unreleased songs like a croupier in a casino.For the minority who arenotSwifties, these takeaways are about as tantalising as a snake emoji (her snake era in 2017 marked the beginning of Swift’s iconic promo cycle for sixth album, Reputation). All I can say is: Taylor is not for you, babes. Because we are now in the era of putting aside our curmudgeonly Madonna-did-it-first cynicism to bask in the 100-watt joy generated by two ultra-earnest teen American Swifties (Niamh Adkins and Nina Haines, who deserve a Gogglebox show of their own) intensely dissecting their icon. “I just fell in love with how she celebrated girlhood,” sighs Haines. “She gave me permission to yearn.” This is Swift’s power in a nutshell. And, like yearning, it’s limitless.Coming five years after the slick, stage-managed Netflix documentaryMiss Americana, this one is more … popcorny. (Neither approach brings us any closer to therealTaylor, obviously.) The action toggles back and forth between years – sorry, eras – as a former manager, producer, bandmate, PR guru, music journalists and superfans reflect on Taylor Swift the global phenomenon, brand, proxy for girls’ feelings, bellwether for how society views women, and so on. I would have liked more on Swift herself, her childhood especially, to get a sense of the conditions that produced a girl with the gumption to “go to every major label in Nashville and say: ‘I’m Taylor, I’m 11, and I want a record deal!’” Beyond some archive karaoke footage and home video of her parents arriving home with baby Taylor, there isn’t much to go on.View image in fullscreenThey deserve a Gogglebox show of their own … Swifties Niamh Adkins and Nina Haines.Photograph: Channel 4 Sandpaper FilmsHolly Armstrong, AKA the first Swiftie, recalls stumbling upon her heroine singing on a makeshift stage on a New Jersey boardwalk in 2003, a seismic encounter that eventually led to their meeting. Early band member Emily Poe Stumler remembers how “incredibly driven and young” Swift was, and how it was “like having a little sister who is also your boss”. Not exactly the stuff of tabloid toplines. Things get slightly more spicy with Rick Barker, Swift’s manager from 2007 to 2008 (the poor man didn’t last long despite their relationship being, in his words, “more like two girlfriends”). He recalls the Kanye-Taylor feud – given a disproportionate amount of airtime, along with the predictable rundown of her boyfriends – which started when Kanye West stormed the stage of the 2009 MTV Video Music awards while Swift was accepting an award: “Someone give Kanye a hug! You cannot buy that kind of publicity.”As for Swift’s decision a decade later to mobilise her ferociously loyal army of fans against Scooter Braun, the investor who bought the masters to her first six albums and, worse still, used to manage Kanye West, Barker is Team Braun all the way. “No one stole her music,” he says. “Scooter Braun made a very good business decision. End of story.” Actually, the story ended when Swift re-recorded four of the albums and laterbought back the rights to the master recordingsof all six, eloquently making the point that artists should own their work. And women have had enough.On politics, Swift has been accused of pandering to the right, not being political enough and, as English professor Elizabeth Scala says, “being too late to the party, too privileged, too white”. Essentially, says journalist Zing Tsjeng, she can’t win. During the 2018 US midterm elections, by which point she was being claimed by white supremacists as their all-American Christian goddess, she finally broke her silence, damning the far-right politics of Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican candidate for Senate, and asking her fans to get out and vote. In 12 hours, 35,000 people registered to vote.Towering above it all is Swift’s extraordinary ability to turn any conflict to her advantage, usually by turning it into a multimillion selling platinum album. Or, in Swiftie-speak, to reclaim her narrative – as when critic Bob Lefsetz wrote Swift’s career was over after a flat performance with Stevie Nicks at the 2010 Grammys and she came back with the anti-bullying anthem Mean. “Every girl who was bullied knows every word to Mean,” says Haines. Then she and Adkins belt out lines from the song and I find myself wishing, not for the first time, thatTaylor Swifthad been around when I was a girl.Less attention is paid to Swift’s music and songwriting craft, which is what happens when a female pop star goes stratospheric. Analysis turns, as it inevitably does in Taylor, to her capacity for reinvention, steely backbone and ability to manipulate her own image. All of which are sexist ways to avoid sayingshe’s successful because she’s good. In a telling moment, music PR Alan Edwards, making the point that every brand reaches saturation point eventually, compares Swift to chocolate, coffee, “whatever it is we consume”. I prefer the Swiftie take: “She gives us built-in community,” says Haines. “Take me to church, mama … Taylor is Jesus!”Taylor is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTaylor SwiftPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Avert your eyes, prudes!Sarah DempsterTue 30 Sep 2025 17.00 EDTShareHere comes Waldemar Januszczak, thundering towards us in his rumpled leisure suit as he gestures frantically at the explicit sculptures between which he finds himself rudely sandwiched.“I mean,” he gasps, “look at that.” We look at that. It is a stone carving depicting a man and three women engaged in a sexual act that one could confidently describe as “confusing”. The art critic is impressed. “Imagine twisting yourself into that position,” he murmurs, as the camera takes in the skewwhiff limbs, oscillating breasts and, in the middle of it all, a scrotum stretched like so much ninth-century bubblegum. “You should get an Olympic medal for doing that.” As, indeed, should Januszczak, whose ability to survey said vision without a) fainting or b) bursting into tears is an achievement in itself.The veteran critic and broadcaster is in India – specifically, he is visiting the extraordinary “love temples” of Khajuraho – for the first episode of a three-part documentary in which he explores art’s most controversial topics (later episodes focus on horror and – zoinks – Satan).View image in fullscreenHis ability not to faint or weep is a true achievement … Waldemar Januszczak at the love temples of Khajuraho, India, for Art’s Most Erotic.Photograph: ZCZ Films/SkyThis, clearly, is no place for prudes or shrinking violets, or those who insist on covering up the legs of their piano lest a passing dowager spot them and immediately fall pregnant. Art’s Most Erotic is, unequivocally, filth. From the aforementioned Indian temples our host travels to Japan, where a look at the blisteringly explicit Shunga pornography of the 18th and 19th centuries ensures there’s no letup on the bum front. There is a visit to Pompeii, with its overendowed clay statuettes (ancient Romans apparently found large penises “funny”). And then we’re off to Vienna, Naples, France and, finally, Cookham in Berkshire, where an analysis of the “edgy, nervy eroticism” of Stanley Spencer provides this multi-buttocked package tour with a very British send-off.Art’s Most Erotic is not, mercifully, one of those celebrity “journeys” in which, after a succession of tiresome set-pieces, our guide finally emerges, blinking, from the steamy pink tumult and declares himself a better man. There are no personal anecdotes, cameos from famous friends, or bits where Januszczak shoehorns himself into the nipple-studded narrative. Nor is this a place for embarrassment or jokes of the phwoar variety. At no point does the critic puff out his cheeks like bagpipes while perusing, say, the bulbously breasted fertility figurines of Upper Palaeolithic France, and proceed to make the sort of noise Sid James made wheneverBarbara Windsor’s bra twanged off in a Carry On film.Instead, it’s an unapologetically serious affair, with Januszczak searching for deeper meanings, noble(r) intentions and, ultimately, the historical and cultural significance of all this bygone business.View image in fullscreenIn the mood? … A work by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in Art’s Most Erotic.Photograph: ZCZ Films/SkyNot that the results are dry or inaccessible. Far from it. They are frequently an absolute hoot, with our guide’s gift for conversational pizzazz ensuring even the scenes in which he horses around feel fresh and imaginative rather than laboured or gimmicky.And so we get Januszczak galumphing across a beach, trousers rolled up and ankles glinting pinkly as he tells us about history’s various depictions of Zeus (“the Harvey Weinstein of Olympus”). We get an impassioned analysis of the Kama Sutra while the critic plays poker with a couple of thoroughly tickled Indian volunteers (“these days it’s thought of as a sex manual, but that’s just our dirty minds. It’s about love!”). A brief ode to Toulouse-Lautrec’s depictions of the lives of Parisian brothel workers, meanwhile, is delivered from a fittingly rumpled bed, with Januszczak peering anxiously at us from the depths of the quilt like an elderly aunt too timid to inquire as to the whereabouts of le chamber pot.The 10 best works of erotic artRead moreReally, he says, the depiction of sex has always been more interesting and rewarding when its bum cheeks are garnished with a sprig of empathy. With Art’s Most Erotic, Januszczak has once again succeeded in crocheting the cerebral into something on which you could place a cupcake.“Yes,” you think, as you watch the septuagenarian bumble past a succession of enormously balled Shunga copulators. “This sort of faintly comforting erudition is just the ticket in these days of veneered celebrity yahoos, intellectually marooned Love Islanders and the like.” Ultimately, no amount of jackhammering antique buttocks can muffle your gasps of gratitude that there is still, in 2025, a place where Januszczak’s brand of factual entertainment – considered, accessible, unapologetically adult – is allowed to exist. Three cheers, then, forSky Arts, whose own enormous-balled MO must be protected at all costs.Art’s Most Erotic aired on Sky Arts and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewArtSky ArtsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Our writer goes on a hard-hat tourKate WyverTue 30 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 14.48 EDTShareThe sleek high rises chase each other up into the sky. “It is a bit dystopian, isn’t it?” says producer Oliver Royds as we walk through Canary Wharf. “Easy to feel like you’re in the Capitol.”London’s finance hub will soon host the theatrical premiere of Suzanne Collins’ dystopian novelThe Hunger Games, in which the all-powerful Capitol sends children to fight to the death for sport and retribution. Donning hefty boots and hard hats, Royds and I snake under the city through concrete corridors, emerging into daylight to enter the building site where a bespoke 1,200-seat theatre is being made.Since March, this scrap of unused scrubland has developed into a 26-metre-tall temporary theatre covering 2,250 sq metres. When I visit in summer, the core is up and the shell is under way. “Don’t fall through,” calls producer Tristan Baker as I hop over a hole and head into the cavernous structure. The soon-to-be-stage is filled with cranes, wires and a constant buzz of power tools. A man harnessed 15 metres up waves hello with his drill.View image in fullscreen‘Every seat is brilliant’ … inside the Canary Wharf theatre.Photograph: Lions Gate EntertainmentRoyds and Baker are the pair behind the Troubadour theatre of Wembley Park, whereStarlight Expressis now whizzing around on rollerskates. Next year they will launch Troubadour Greenwich Peninsula theatre, a complex with two 1,500-seat auditoriums. Both men independently run theatre and film production companies – Royds leads BOS Productions, Baker heads up Runaway Entertainment – and together they are joint CEOs of Troubador, the company that designs, builds and operates their sites. Fronting both sides of the production, they knew they could offer something unique for a show that demands such space and spectacle. “We said to Lionsgate [the film distributors] we could do this differently,” says Royds.Their team also has a unique contact in Baker’s business partner at Runaway: Charlie Parsons, known as the father of reality TV. Flicking between his reality show Survivor and footage of the Iraq war first sparked Collins’ idea for TheHunger Games, a fact Parsons didn’t know until 2018, when they began talks about securing the rights. “Nobody would buy Survivor because they couldn’t understand it,” Parsons recalls. The show is now on its 50th season in the US. He nods ahead to Baker and Royds. “They have the same big vision – of being able to do anything even when it seems impossible.”Where Troubadour’s previous theatres have redeveloped existing spaces, the Canary Wharf site required filling a massive pit in the ground, with the tight proximity to other buildings meaning huge steel slabs had to be individually placed by a tower crane. As we walk around, the pair are enthusiastically nerdy about the construction, from the ballast-engineered approach to the sustainable soundproofing they failed to find globally before designing their own.View image in fullscreenJennifer Lawrence as Katniss in the 2012 film of The Hunger Games.Photograph: Lions Gate/Everett/RexMade with 42,000 hunks of aluminium and steel components, the theatre is entirely modular. That means when time’s up, 95% of the site can be packed into 150 or so trucks and reused elsewhere. “We like to say we’re the new travelling circus,” Royds jokes, raising his voice as a circular saw starts up in the corner. “A building like this doesn’t exist elsewhere,” adds Baker, ushering us through a gap in the wall to see the river outside; you can, if you wish, take a boat to the theatre. “We’re trying to give the audience something new and thrilling.”When the audience chooses their tickets, the arena is divided into districts – with the pointed exception of District 12, home of our hero, Katniss Everdeen. “You’re only ever 12 seats away from the action,” says Baker, pointing up to the back row of the stalls. “Every seat is a brilliant seat.” They want the action to feel right in front of us, the fights choreographed by Kev McCurdy pressing close.We like to say we’re the new travelling circusProducer Oliver RoydsWith the task of creating fire, fatal battles and genetically engineered animal mutations on stage, the creative team face high expectations. Conor McPherson’s adaptation uses the first book and first film as source material, while Matthew Dunster directs and Miriam Buether is the designer. Collins has been deeply involved with the process, offering new details of the world she has been inventing since the early 00s. “What’s exciting is there’s an audience of 25-40-year-olds who read the books when they came out and loved them,” says Royds. “But it’s now come back.” His nine-year-old son is avidly racing through them.They have the rights for the first three Hunger Games novels. Do they plan to stage them all? “If the audience wants it,” says Baker, nodding. If not, the space can be twisted and rearranged like a Rubik’s cube for other productions. “We built this specifically for The Hunger Games,” says Royds. “But the flexibility is key. You can do stuff here that you can’t do in any other venue.” He indicates upwards, where metal rods lace the entire ceiling. Each of these can carry four tonnes of weight – ideal for holding enormous set pieces or supporting actors as they fight upside down, as has been trailed for this show.View image in fullscreenBig vision … The Hunger Games: On Stage in rehearsal.Photograph: Dany KaanDown a rickety ladder, a concrete mass of pillars form what will be London’s biggest sub-stage and largest hydraulic stage, which will raise most of the set up from the floor. Through the dusty gloom you can imagine the tributes waiting down here to rise up into the Cornucopia at the start of the games. “We’ve obviously got a few tricks up our sleeves,” Royds smiles. Upstairs, the theatre will feature three huge bars, a restaurant looking out over the O2, and masses of toilets. “We want people to be queueing for the bar, not the loo,” Baker says with a laugh. Combined, the show and the theatre cost £26m. “That’s the same price as a large Broadway musical,” he notes. “Plus we can reuse the structure.”The cast of 23 are booked for the next year, with the actor playing Katniss, Mia Carragher, already in archery school. “Matthew keeps talking about it as a dance troupe,” Royds shares. “Because it’s such an ensemble piece.” This is the unique challenge of adapting a story so beloved: “It’s got to deliver for those who love the books but it has to be uniquely different. Otherwise,” Royds shrugs, “you can just rewatch the film.”The Hunger Games: On Stage is atTroubadour Canary Wharf theatre, London, from 20 October-15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreImmersive theatreHunger GamesThe Hunger GamesSuzanne CollinsLondonStagecraftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an overdue account of a remarkable artist whose dazzling, daring career had more than a few twists: from Vogue cover girl to Vogue photographer; from surrealists’ muse to pioneer of the movement; from commercial portraitist to war photographer.Some of Miller’s fabled work is here, including her famous self-portrait in Hitler’s bathtub, her boots – dirtied with mud from Dachau concentration camp – strewn symbolically on the floor. The exhibition builds a sense of the dizzying, sometimes frenzied energy of Miller, who could photograph fashionable hats as well as Nazis who died by suicide. Yet, as her work turns abruptly in subject matter over the decades, swinging from frivolity to devastation, it is never jarring – and never boring.In a triptych of Miller and Man Ray, she wears a BDSM collar, while he wears an avuncular jumperMiller understood the barbed nature of beauty profoundly. Without referencing the sexual abuse Miller experienced as a child, and only briefly alluding to the fact that her father, an amateur photographer, began to use Miller as a model, sometimes nude, from the age of eight, the show begins emphatically with an image Miller made of herself, in a Photomaton in 1927, posing in the cloche hat later made iconic when she appeared in it on the cover of Vogue.The first room charts Miller’s short-lived modelling career, including images by Edward Steichen, Arnold Genthe and Cecil Beaton. Gradually, their images of Miller merge into her own pictorialist-inflected self-portraits – some of which were published in Vogue, with Miller acknowledged as model and photographer.View image in fullscreenFrivolity to devastation … Lee Miller, Model Elizabeth Cowell Wearing Digby Morton Suit, London, 1941.Photograph: Lee Miller/Lee Miller Archives, England 2025. All rights reserved. leemiller.co.ukHer relationship withMan Rayarguably changed the course of art history, although Man Ray would get the credit. The fascinating room devoted to the work they made together between 1929 and 1932 is packed with sumptuously surreal and dreamlike images, languorous pictures of necks, torsos and breasts, playing with ideas of subservience and power. In a triptych of the couple, Miller wears a BDSM collar, Man Ray an avuncular jumper. It’s easy to see who wields the power.In the early 1930s, Miller was a masterly printer and at her most experimental. An example of what is thought to be the first artistic use of solarisation in photography is quietly reattributed to Miller in this show. The technique was developed in the 1840s, whereby the negative is exposed momentarily to light during processing. Man Ray has previously been credited with the first use in art – but here Miller’s role is emphasised in the making of that landmark image, Primat de la Matière sur la Pensée. It is a sublime vintage print of a nude female figure, the solarised effect making the body appear to dissolve and melt into the background, the mystical effect of an aureole. The beauty of the image consumes itself.Equally experimental are her Paris street shots, at the apex of surrealist photography, with a vertiginous range of camera angles, distorting perspectives and reversing images to confound and perplex the viewer’s vision. The effect is spellbinding. She establishes her own lexicon of surrealist metaphors and motifs, with a persistent interest in statues: fixed, immobile and voiceless – perhaps what she most feared becoming.View image in fullscreenThe apex of surrealist photography … Lee Miller, Untitled, Paris, 1930.Photograph: Lee Miller Archives, England 2025. All rights reserved. leemiller.co.ukThere are works here that have never been seen before, including sensuous desert pictures in Egypt and Syria, taken while living in Cairo in the 1930s. There are newly discovered wartime photographs, such as an image of opera singer Irmgard Seefried, photographed while singing an aria in the ruins of the Vienna opera house.Miller got as close to the frontlines as she was permitted, photographing mushrooming clouds of napalm, makeshift surgeries erected in muddy Alsatian fields and brittle buildings during the blitz. The images she made at Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps, just weeks after they were liberated in 1945, are deliberately presented in a separate room here. They are among the most distressing scenes of the 20th century. A closeup picture of the bashed-in face of an SS guard, beaten by his former prisoners, photographed with a pitiless bright flash, gives little feeling of retribution or justice.‘Out on a damn limb’: the daredevil photography of Lee Miller – in picturesRead moreAfter what she witnessed at the end of the war, Miller’s relationship with photography tapered off, and this exhibition does, too. The final room is of portraits of Miller’s famous artist friends – Picasso, Miró, Man Ray, Dorothea Tanning. They lack the electric ingenuity of her earlier portraits, yet perhaps this artistic milieu is where she felt most comfortable. By the time she died in 1977, Miller had hidden most of her archive away in an attic, turning her attention, in yet another surprising move, to gourmet cooking. Miller was many things – but this exhibition proves that, ultimately and above all, she was an artist.At theTate Britain, London, 2 October-15 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsLee MillerPhotographyArtTate BritainreviewsShareReuse this content"

Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley reviewSerpentine North Gallery, LondonThe artist wants to tackle polarisation by strong-arming her audience into stilted debate in a show that seems to mistake social media for real lifeJonathan JonesTue 30 Sep 2025 12.15 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 12.22 EDTShareThis haunted fairground of an exhibition has its heart in the right place. But that is not enough. Called The Delusion, it is a woolly mess of platitudes and phoney dialogue. Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley is worried about the polarisation of online discourse and 21st-century politics. Aren’t we all? But the remedies offered are confused, and the attempt to create a free, open discussion is stymied by its coercive tactics.You can’t say you weren’t warned. A huge text at the beginning explains the artist’s “Terms and Conditions”, including the instructions to “Join others, experience this together”, and to “talk, share, listen and question out loud”. Do I have to? Yes. As I look at an arcade-like machine in a cabinet behind a glass door, someone asks me firmly, “Did you open the door? Well, you should open it.” So I open it, answer some questions in the negative and am told off again, this time by the machine, for holding back.The Delusion uses technology as a cover for artistic paucity, and expects interaction instead of giving anything much itself. It confirms my suspicion that participatory art is a bit lazy, expecting the audience to do the heavy lifting. After reading the rules, you walk around a low-lit space with arcade-style machines among satin drapes leading to ouija-like tables. There are so-so cartoons on the walls in which multi-eyed monsters make comments about hate and oppression. They are the best bit – at least the artist sat down and doodled them.View image in fullscreenRules of the game … The Delusion.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAWords such as “hate”, “polarisation” and “dehumanisation” are thrown around but their meaning is never spelt out. That is your job. One of Brathwaite-Shirley’s team, politely, tried to get me to discuss the question, “Why do we dehumanise people?” I said I can’t debate an abstract proposition, it needs to be more specific. For instance, I reckon Nigel Farage dehumanises migrants. Why? Perhaps because he hates them, but that’s merely my speculation: I don’t know his motives. He may be a completely cynical politician who doesn’t mean a word he says. The answer I got was something about community solidarity. It seemed inadequate and pre-scripted. And the conversation stopped there, as if we had been talking about different things.As a physical exhibition, this isn’t all bad, but the more you do as you are told and interact, the less fun it is. At the press view, there wasn’t much sign of anyone else getting intensely involved in the games and stilted conversational starters – and if you can’t get journalists to mouth off, who will? I don’t think this is what anyone goes to galleries for, to debate with strangers as opposed to, say, being alone with their thoughts looking at art.Another game asks if you need to be dehumanised to commit war crimes. But what does “dehumanised” actually mean? The guards at Auschwitz were still human beings. It’s a way of reassuring ourselves to say they were “dehumanised”. Such sterile use of language strips this art of meaning. Brathwaite-Shirley poses a series of supposed moral and political questions but they are all expressed in the same strings of predefined and loaded terms. “Hate” is a word that needs, to quote Lenin on power, the terms “Who? Whom?” to mean anything.View image in fullscreenSpending to much time online? Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley poses within The Delusion.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAThis artist, I fear, spends too much time online. The insults, aggressions and extremist views that fly on social media create false, ugly, limited world views. This exhibition wants to talk past those views but mistakenly conflates online verbiage with real life. “Hate” is used here in the way it’s used in online forums. You hate. I am hated. While The Delusion wants to combat the “polarisation” of today’s largely digital controversies, it chokes itself on the very rhetoric those arguments spew out.Perhaps in this way it has something to teach. George Orwell argued in his 1946 essay Politics and the English Language that ideology was destroying our language with abstractions and evasions. He imagined this process taken to a totalitarian extreme as 1984’s “newspeak”. If you can’t talk about ideas clearly and critically, how can you have the open, democratic debates Brathwaite-Shirley aspires to unleash?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The jury acquitted him of the more serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.Combs hadpleaded not guiltyto all charges against him.In their sentencing memo on Tuesday, prosecutors urged judge Arun Subramanian to impose a prison term of no less than 135 months and a $500,000 fine.Judge denies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs bail ahead of sentencingRead more“His crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over 10 years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear,” the prosecutors wrote.“A substantial term of imprisonment is also needed in this case because the defendant is unrepentant,” they added.During the trial, federal prosecutors accused Combs of using his power, fame, wealth and influence, as well as violence and threats of blackmail, to coerce two of his former girlfriends into taking part in what were described as drug-fueled sexual encounters with male escorts, referred to as “freak-offs” or “hotel nights”, which they said Combs orchestrated, watched, masturbated to and sometimes filmed.Throughout the trial, the defenseacknowledged past instancesof domestic violence, but denied that any coercion or sex trafficking took place and maintained thatall sexual activity was consensualand part of a“swingers lifestyle”.Combs has beenheld in a Brooklyn federal jailsince hisarrestin September 2024. Last week, his lawyers asked the court to sentence Combs to no more than 14 months in prison. Due to time already served, the sentence put forward by his legal team would enable him to be freed in a matter of months.The defense described Combs’s 13 months behind bars as “life-changing” and “productive” and stated that he has undergone rehabilitation, including “getting clean of all substances”.“It is time for Mr Combs to go home to his family,” they wrote. Alongside their filing, the defense also submitted more than 60 letters ofsupport for Combs, including from members of his family.According toCNN, the US probation department has recommended a sentence ranging between five and seven years in prison.In Tuesday’s filing, the federal prosecutors said: “Incredibly, while the defendant conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout trial, he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.“The defendant tries to recast decades of abuse as simply the function of mutually toxic relationships,” they wrote. “But there is nothing mutual about a relationship where one person holds all the power and the other ends up bloodied and bruised.”Later in the document, they said that Combs “is not the victim”, adding: “The Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant’s conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims.”Along with their sentencing recommendation, the prosecutors also submitted letters to the court on Tuesday from two of Combs’s accusers and several of Combs’s former associates.Among them was one from singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, one of Combs’s former girlfriends who was the prosecution’sstar witnessin this case.During the trial, Ventura testified about their decade-long relationship, which she said wasmarked by physical and emotional abuse. She told the court that she wascoerced and blackmailedinto taking part in the so-called “freak-offs”, and during the trial jurors wereshownthe 2016 hotelsurveillance footageof Combs attacking Ventura in a hotel hallway.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreIn her letter to the judge on Tuesday, Ventura wrote: “While the jury did not seem to understand or believe that I engaged in freak-offs because of the force and coercion the defendant used against me, I know that is the truth, and his sentence should reflect the reality of the evidence and my lived experience as a victim.”She said that she still has “nightmares and flashbacks on a regular, everyday basis, and continue to require psychological care to cope with my past”.“My worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality,” she wrote to the court. “I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial.“If there is one thing I have learned from this experience, it is that victims and survivors will never be safe,” she wrote. “I hope that your decision considers the truths at hand that the jury failed to see.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkUS crimeUS justice systemnewsShareReuse this content"

Brown says the story was inspired by her upbringing in Doncaster in the late 90s and early 00s. An extract of the story can be read below.“From first reading, Colwill Brown’s story leapt from the page, alive and immediately compelling, deeply disturbing, a story we couldn’t forget,” said Di Speirs, chair of this year’s judging panel. “The brio of the dialect, the brilliance of both the second person narration and the handling of the passage of time, and above all the exploration of a life critically damaged in a moment, all made this our unanimous winner.”Brown’s debut novel, We Pretty Pieces of Flesh, was published earlier this year.Reviewing itin the Guardian, Catherine Taylor wrote that the novel “manages to be both boisterous and bleak, life-enhancing and life-denying, familiar and yet wholly original”, adding that “you will probably read nothing else like it this year”.Also shortlisted for this year’s award were Caoilinn Hughes, Edward Hogan, Emily Abdeni-Holman and Andrew Miller, whose novelThe Land in Winteris on the shortlist for this year’s Booker prize. Each of the authors shortlisted for the short story award receives £600. Their stories are published in an anthology, and are available to listen to on BBC Sounds.We Pretty Pieces of Flesh by Colwill Brown review – you’ll read nothing else like it this yearRead more“Brown’s Yorkshire-dialect story is a fast, taut examination of repercussions,” said Bonnie Lander Johnson, fellow in English at Cambridge University. “One messy, half-remembered night in a young woman’s life echoes down the years in bouts of rage and shame, in the need for silence to protect friends and the struggle to find a way to live among dwindling opportunities when the same people still wander the same streets each day.”Alongside Speirs on this year’s judging panel was the novelist William Boyd, previously shortlisted writer Kamila Shamsie, and previous winners Lucy Caldwell and Ross Raisin. Raisin won last year’s prizewith his story Ghost Kitchen.“This year’s winning story demonstrates how seemingly small events can shape our futures, how the thoughtlessness of youth can shadow our adult choices,” said Johnson. “All of this is done in deft, startling prose that opens new possibilities in contemporary literary voice.”The winner of the young writer’s award, open to 14- to 18-year-olds, was also announced at the ceremony. Rebecca Smith, a 17-year-old sixth former from Sheffield, won the prize for Scouse’s Run, a story set in Yorkshire and written in dialect.You Cannot Thread a Moving NeedleNext day, they come round your house to mek sure you’ll never tell.But that’s not what they say when you open door, find them ont step, two dense bodies int daylight. They say, Ey up, and you greet them back, Alreyt. They’re int year above, little un wi dyed black hair all t’goth lasses fancy, and lanky lad, who you’re not sure, but you think might be seeing Rach. Lanky Lad’s alreyt like, but you reckon Rach only fancies him cuz he plays bass in Little Un’s band. You can’t get past his mouth, two fat pink slugs sleeping one below other. His lips, always wet, saliva slick. You don’t know how Rach can snog that mouth, if she is. Little Un, though, proper beaut, barely ever spoke to you till yesterday: mid-afternoon int backyard while your mam wa asleep, you and Kel and Rach, splayed ovver too-long thirsty grass in nowt but string bikinis you all went Primark together to get. Bacardi Breezer Watermelons from offy round corner that’ll serve anyone, long as you’ve gorra backpack to hide it in. Giggle, bottle, clink. Pink liquid tang, swill down quick. Then Lanky Lad and Little Un appeared ovvert fence, surprised your boozy tanning sesh.Now, Little Un grins. You go warm, arse to tit.Little Un sez, “Fancy a walk?”It’s summer so days are borderless, their edges shimmering int heat. Today feels like it’s still part of yesterday, especially since you can’t remember going to bed last neet. You leave your house and stroll between t’lads for ever, or half hour, or five minutes, chatting shit, bouncing on toes while plastic flip-flops go flap flap, thinking,lucky cow, and legs shaky, and Little Un’s grinning at you again. They flank you in a winding too-wide trio dance down slender snicket behind neighbours’ sheds. Nettles and snapdragons poke between fence planks; damp and dog shite sings in your nose. They natter about Sheff Wednesday’s shocking turnout and Donny Rovers’ keggy midfielder, NOFX’s punk purity and reasons Green Day are sellouts, their lips stretched across cheeks into smiles like rubber bands across fingers.You wonder if your tits stick out far enough beyond your belly, if your nipples’ silhouettes are bleeding through your Hello Kitty tank top, if Little Un will get top’s irony, if hot sweat between your thighs is really your period starting, if it’s pooling int seat of your short-shorts, if it’s trickling down a leg. You wish there wa somewier private you could drop your kegs and check. You wonder if your short-shorts are showing too much arsecheek. If they’re not showing any arsecheek at all. You wish you’d brushed last neet’s booze off your breath, and you wish you’d put your Wonderbra on when you crawled out of bed, head banging, to answer t’door, and you can’t think about owt apart from how flat your tits must look wi’out that bra till you notice crumbling corner of a brick, loose and hanging out somecunt’s garage wall.Reminds you of younger days, of graze, of flay, of scramble ovver under through broken off battered fence gate wall. Pegging it ovver knackered train tracks, building sites, rubble piles. Lung-rasping cackle, stop dead when brick cement stone gravel bites, snatches flakes off your top layer, leaves runs in your skin down arms, legs, laddered like tights.You look down now and there’s a new rip across your wrist, dried-blood trail of torn away skin. These days, grazes come from neets ont lash, bottles of voddy downed ont haybales and bench by t’canal. Limbs fall heavy int midnight grass. These days, you wake wi’out memory of cuts and bumps left on fingers, shins. What did you do last neet to get thissun? Warrit brick, or cement, or?Glass: your trio reaches snicket’s end, emerges intut road, straightens, expands sideways intut new space, like a concertina between two palms pulling away, squeeze-box that appears in your mam’s hands when t’gin flows, plays “Gypsy Maiden” and “Stone Outside Dan Murphy’s Door”. Old red phone box stands before you, one pane shattered into craggy diamonds spat across tarmac.

He added that he was warned of possible retribution.“[I’ve been] talking to journalists out there who say, ‘If you’re on the list, your life is made miserable.’” he said. “[The message was], the inland revenue will come calling, you better lawyer up, you will spend the next four years just weighed down by legal issues you have to get through.”While no more details were shared about the project, including whether it would be a TV series or film, he added that he was still determined to make it happen without US funding. “Let’s see what happens,” he said.Trump renews threat of imposing steep tariffs on films made outside the USRead moreIannucci also spoke about Trump’srenewed threatsof tariffs for non-American production. “Nobody knows how it works, but that’s not the point,” he said. “The point is, there will be financiers in America about to give money to a project going: ‘Do you know what? Let’s just see how this plays out before I hand that over.’ And so you’ll have another project sitting there.”Iannucci, whose film credits includeThe Death of StalinandThe Personal History of David Copperfield, was most recently an executive producer on comedy seriesThe Franchise.Last year’s 80s-set dramaThe Apprentice, which features Trump raping his then wife Ivana, was viewed by the president as defamatory and his lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to the producers. “This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalises lies that have been long debunked,” his then spokesperson Stephen Cheungsaid. “This ‘film’ is pure malicious defamation, should not see the light of day, and doesn’t even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store. It belongs in a dumpster fire.”The film went on to receive two Oscar nominations for best actor and best supporting actor.After thebrief suspensionof late-night host Jimmy Kimmel earlier this month overcommentshe made against the far right, the Writers Guild of Americawarnedabout the dangers of censorship. “The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other – to disturb, even – is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people,” a statement read. “It is not to be denied.

Sag-Aftra said it believed creativity was, “and should remain, human-centred. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.”The union added: “To be clear, ‘Tilly Norwood’ is not an actor, it’s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers – without permission or compensation … It doesn’t solve any ‘problem’ – it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardising performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”Tilly Norwood: how scared should we be of the viral AI ‘actor’?Read moreNorwood appears in a short film called AI Commissioner, produced by Particle6, whose CEO, Eline Van Der Velden, said was“100% AI generated”. Van Der Velden, wholaunched Xicoiaat Zurich,issued a statement on Sundaydefending the film, saying: “I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a new tool – a new paintbrush. Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories.”Van Der Velden added: “Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance. It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.”The Smashing Machine star Emily Blunt also added her voice to film industry members aghast at Norwood’s creation,telling a Variety podcast: “Good Lord, we’re screwed. That is really, really scary, Come on, agencies, don’t do that. Please stop. Please stop taking away our human connection.”Natasha Lyonne, the Russian Doll star who is working ona feature film using “ethical” AI, was also vocal in her disapproval,saying on social media: “Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds.

He was 79.His poetry often featured lyrical explorations of love and relationships and he also wrote books for children.With his fellow Liverpool poets Roger McGough and Adrian Henri Patten published The Mersey Sound in 1967, which has sold more than a million copies. It has been credited as the most significant anthology of the 20th century in bringing poetry to a new audience, and is now a Penguin Classic.Patten was born in 1946 in Bootle, a working-class neighbourhood of Liverpool. “I was one of the last children to read at my primary school,” hesaid in 2014. “There was quite a violent, tense background at home … such claustrophobia. I just started writing to get things down, since there was no one to speak to.”Brian Patten obituaryRead moreLeaving Sefton Park secondary school at 15, he worked as a cub reporter on the Bootle Times and wrote occasional columns for the music paper the Mersey Beat. In one of his first pieces, he wrote about McGough and Henri.At 16, he edited a magazine, underdog, which published the work of Liverpool poets and was the first home of many of the poems that would appear later in the Mersey Sound anthology.The magazine also published Allen Ginsberg, the US beat poet who,arriving in Liverpoolin May 1965, called the city “the centre of consciousness of the human universe”. Patten later said he thought Ginsberg “believed the centre of human consciousness to be wherever he was at the time”.Patten left at 18 and lived in Paris, earning money by writing poems on pavements in coloured chalk. In the late 60s he lived in Winchester with Brian Eno while he was at art college. In later life he moved to Devon.In 1967, aged 21, Patten published his first solo collection, Little Johnny’s Confession. His many later collections included Armada, an exploration of grief written in the wake of his mother’s death, and Love Poems, which his fellow poet Charles Causley remarked revealed a “sensibility profoundly aware of the ever-present possibility of the magical and the miraculous, as well as of the granite-hard realities”.Patten wrote many books for children including the poetry collection Gargling With Jelly and the novel Mr Moon’s Last Case. He edited The Puffin Book of Modern Children’s Verse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The book release won’t be affected, Stevens wrote, noting that “books don’t need visas!”Stevens is the latest in a string of international musicians and athletes affected by visa issues, as fees have increased in the past year and processing times have slowed.Stevens wrote that his team waited months for visa approvals, but “at this point, the production logistics necessary for my show cannot be arranged in time”.“I am really upset!” Stevens wrote on social media. “Not least for my fans who have bought tickets and made travel plans to see me perform.”Representatives of Stevens did not immediately respond to the Associated Press’s request for comment.The singer’s tour was set to start 2 October in Philadelphia and had various stops scheduled across the country for the rest of the month. His 8 October tour stop in Toronto, Canada, was also postponed.The British singer-songwriter rose to fame in the 1960s and put his career on hold for two decades after converting to Islam in the late 1970s. He returned to secular music in the 2000s and hada six-city concert tourin North America in 2014.Stevens indicated the tour could be rescheduled if visas are approved, but those dates “would be some time away because of other travel plans”, he wrote.The tour, announced in May, was described as a “portal” into the singer’s universe, offering an in-depth conversation on the memoir and acoustic performances of select songs, according to the website. Stevens began the tour visiting several cities in the UK throughout September.Stevens wrote: “Hopefully, fans will be able to hop on the Peace Train route at some time in the future”.Explore more on these topicsYusuf/Cat StevensUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

And David seemed to welcome this, shying from most opportunities to reveal himself. On talkshows, he likes to retreat behind the same clutch of anecdotes. When former Seinfeld writer Larry Charles made a two-part documentary about David for HBO in 2022, David had it pulled from schedules the day before broadcast. When I interviewed him for a book I wrote about baldness last year, he only agreed on the proviso that the line of questioning never strayed from hair loss.‘Larry’s secretly a lovely man’: Curb Your Enthusiasm stars spill the beans – for their final ever episodeRead moreSo the publication of No Lessons Learned, a new book about the life of Curb Your Enthusiasm (“as told by Larry David and the cast and crew” but written by Lorraine Ali) offered a shot at showing us the machinations of the real David. So, what does it teach us about Larry David the man?He really was that miserable onceThe oft-repeated talkshow anecdote about his pre-fame stint as a blind woman’s chauffeur gets fleshed out in the book. “It was a very, very sad time in my life,” he states. “Bad jobs, no money, living in a dump. By all accounts, I was a failure and the future was bleak.”His first script was also bleakAs Robert Weide, who would later go on to direct Curb episodes, describes, it was a film called Prognosis Negative, about a sour man who begins to date a terminally ill woman, because it meant he could enjoy the possibility of being in a relationship without the pressure of any long-term commitment. “It was very, very dark,” Weide says now.He often gets his wayView image in fullscreenLarry David as Larry, wearing hat and glasses, standing in downpour on a golf course.Photograph: Contract Number (Programme)/CHANNEL 4 PICTURE PUBLICITYAt an early screening of the Curb Your Enthusiasm pilot – then only known as the Larry David Vanity Project – the audience was handed a sheet of paper with potential titles, including The Shame Must Go On, Dead Inside, and Regrets Only. The title Curb Your Enthusiasm received no votes. “Too bad, I like that one,” David said at the time. “That’s what we’re calling it.”Larry andRichard Lewiswere like that all the timeTracey Ullman describes a moment, towards the end of Lewis’s life, when she overheard the pair of them quietly talking while a scene was being shot. Lewis was performing shows in New York, and was angry that David hadn’t been to any. David’s response? “When are you gonna die?” “I turned around, and Richard’s face, he was trying so hard not to laugh,” Ullman says.The glasses were a major source of stressWhen Curb began, David had two pairs of his now-iconic glasses, which were made by Oliver Peoples in the 1990s. Production required more than that, so someone had to literally scour the globe looking for more. Eventually they were able to find someone “in a small cabin in Switzerland” who could make four extra pairs. Props master Rose Leiker describes the glasses as “the property department’s daily heart attack”.Larry David wasn’t above using the show as revengeIn 1998, Roger Ebert gave David’s movie Sour Grapes a thumbs down. And so, in season three, David wrote an episode about a restaurant critic with a passing resemblance to Ebert. David ended up breaking his thumbs.The real Larry is softer than his screen counterpartProducer Erin O’Malley recounts an episode where Larry takes two lesbians to task for adopting an African baby. “‘I’m gay,” O’Malley says. “Between takes, he came up to me behind the monitors and said ‘Hey, is this too offensive?’ He was asking me earnestly. He would be mortified that I’m telling you this right now.”Bryan Cranstonthinks Larry David hates himDuring an appearance in season nine, David asked Cranston if he’d ever appeared on Broadway. Cranston replied positively, and soon David was starring in his own self-written Broadway show, A Fish in the Dark. “I went backstage after the play one night and I said ‘Larry, that was fantastic!’ Cranston recalls. “And he said ‘Oh my god, I’ll never listen to you again. I hate doing this!’”No Lessons Learned is out nowExplore more on these topicsCurb Your EnthusiasmUS televisionTelevisionTV comedyComedyLarry DavidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What a feat!Stuart HeritageTue 30 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 00.01 EDTShareYou don’t have to look too hard at Disney+’s new sitcom to see the stitches. This is a flagrant Frankenstein of a show; a grab bag of elements from things that are already incredibly popular. It’s a good-natured sports comedy in the mould of Ted Lasso. Its star is Glen Powell, a man with the fairly miraculous ability to unite both warring sides of 2025 America. It shamelessly lifts the plot of Mrs Doubtfire (the second highest grossing film worldwide in 1993, fact fans) and, according to the credits, it is based on a funny video of an American football player that went viral in 2022.It is thin gruel indeed, the sort of programme you imagine gets created after a particularly desperate ChatGPT session. And yet, despite this, Chad Powers is actually good. Better than good, in fact. It’s a funny, touching, deliberately uncomfortable character piece with one of the most magnetic central performances in recent memory. How annoying.Obviously, it helps that it was created by Powell (along with writer Michael Waldron, whose current gig is writing the Avengers franchise) because, viewed from afar, it looks like an attempt to marry the two sides of his public persona. Chad Powers follows the explosive bottoming out of a cocky young football player named Russ Holliday. One minute, Holliday has the world at his feet. The next he has lost a championship, punched a fan and injured a young wheelchair-bound cancer patient, all in full view of the wider world.In other words, the show really wants you to hate him. He’s the walking definition of obnoxiousness, all Cybertrucks, crypto talk and chest tattoos. It’s a role Powell knows well, an extension of his swaggeringly unbearable Top Gun character.However, salvation comes when Holliday decides to start afresh, by stealing his dad’s prosthetics, moving to Georgia and passing himself off as a sweetly naive, aw-shucks college player called Chad Powers. Again, given Powell’s uncanny ability to hit Middle America right in its plaid-wearing heart, this also seems deliberate.A premise like this has a lot of heavy lifting to do, so it’s smart that Powell and Waldron have chosen to cut almost every corner imaginable to get to the action faster. The nod to Mrs Doubtfire is as transparent as possible, coming after Russ Holliday (and I promise this is true) looks directly at a poster for Mrs Doubtfire. Similarly, the college team he signs up for under a fake identity is called the Catfish. If there’s one thing the show wants you to hate more than Russ Holliday, it is the concept of subtext.And yet the final result is improbably irresistible. While the early episodes are charmingly goofy – a vast amount of time is given to the problem of how to shower with your teammates when your face is covered in prosthetics – things quickly get deeper as the line between Holliday and Powers starts to blur. Was the Chad Powers persona created to get Holliday back into the spotlight, or because Holliday was sick of himself?View image in fullscreenCharmingly goofy … Powell as Chad Powers.Photograph: Daniel Delgado/DisneyThroughout the season, Holliday blames his demise on circumstance; if he hadn’t messed up in that one game, he’d be king of the world. But there’s a sense that, like Walter White before him, his downfall was entirely caused by a personality flaw. If he didn’t knock the cancer victim out of his wheelchair during that match, his arrogance and egotism would have undone him elsewhere.By the end of the season, we’re left with some unexpectedly complex character work, as nobody involved, himself included, seems to know where Holliday ends and Powers begins. The technical work this must have involved on the part of Powell, whose various accents keep fading and blurring into each other as his identity unravels, is staggering.What we’re left with is about as far from Ted Lasso as you can get. It’s a mutant redemption story with a satisfyingly chewy moral core: can you truly be redeemed if it involves lying to every single person on the planet? All this, plus it manages to be funny and charming. Chad Powers is a rare feat. And remember, they managed to get all this from a viral video. What a magic trick.Chad Powers is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

The homemade bomb connects to the runaway cheese heiress, the cheese heiress to the federal agents, and the feds to the pro‑Nazi leagues at the bowling lanes outside town. Early-30s Milwaukee, in turn, is connected to powder-keg central Europe, where paramilitary groups have pitched camp on the Hungaro-Croatian border and guest speakers wax lyrical about “our immense fascist future”. Most likely it connects to the current moment as well, albeit wryly and slyly, with a nonchalant swing. That’s the implied final move of this merry dance of a book: the point where the past links its hands with the present.Shadow Ticket is a Pynchon novel – the 88-year-old’s first in 12 years; his ninth overall – and so it naturally connects to the man’s back catalogue, too, and its abiding fascination with conspiracy, chaos and the churn of American pop culture. Specifically it relates back to his two previous works –Inherent ViceandBleeding Edge– in that the story comes tailored as a dime-store whodunnit, complete with red herrings, plot twists and reams of hard-boiled dialogue. But classifications, like people, are never entirely to be trusted. Pynchon inhabits the genre like a hermit crab inside a mollusc shell, periodically peeking out from the gloom to remind us that he’s there.Our Bogart-esque hero is Hicks McTaggart, a semi-professional dancer turned strikebreaker turned dogged, compromised private dick, toiling to hold his position against a surge of rascally clowns and unreliable sources. Hicks is on the trail of Daphne Airmont, the missing heiress, but something about the woman smells iffy, and it may not be the cheese. There are Nazi sympathisers in the halls of power and an Austro-Hungarian U-boat running guns across Lake Michigan. Milwaukee contains Italians, Croatians and “more Germans than you can wave a knockwurst at”, which means that the city’s loyalties are conflicted and it could break either way. The New World, Hicks learns, remains umbilically tied to the old.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Pynchon’s livewire prose hops from subject to subject, joins the dots and makes patterns. There is a pleasing logic to patterns, but they rarely provide explanations, never mind neat solutions; every fresh leap kicks up still further questions. And so it is with the widening gyre of Hicks’s investigation, which spins out of Milwaukee to cross the Atlantic, as spies are gazumped by counterspies and the plot gains in flavour what it loses in momentum. Airmont’s millionaire father styles himself “the Al Capone of Cheese” and is wanted for his role in a counterfeit cheese operation. “Cheese Fraud being a metaphor of course, a screen, a front for something more geopolitical,” explains Egon Praediger, the elegant, coke-sniffing Viennese cop who may turn out not to be a policeman at all. Detective mysteries home in, whereas Pynchon stories unravel. The author respects the genre enough to pay lip service to its rules. But he’s geared towards irresolution and leaves his private eye hanging, blindsided and lost.Prime Pynchon – the Pynchon of Gravity’s Rainbow, let’s say, or the jubilantMason & Dixon– might have interrogated this material with more rigour; mined its component parts for more gold. Shadow Ticket, conversely, runs wide but not deep, skipping from inner-city Milwaukee to the forests of Transylvania and from one espionage plot to the next. The tone is jaunty and joking in the manner of a bustling Tintin adventure in which bombs are wrapped as Christmas gifts and the goons look so comical that one assumes they must be harmless. It’s 1932, at least on the page, and so the yarn comes salted with references to contemporary figures: Sacco and Vanzetti, Walter Winchell and the Lindbergh baby. But it also veers from the record and succumbs to sudden scenic detours. In one exuberant set piece, two characters visit the local cinema to watch an entirely fictional gastronomic comedy, Bigger Than Yer Stummick, that stars “child sensation Squeezita Thickly” as the food commissar and Wallace Beery as a chef with “a big soup-soaked moustache”. The movie, the pair agrees afterwards, is altogether too long but somehow not quite long enough.As for Shadow Ticket itself, the book is an antic mixed bag, a diverting tour of old haunts. Pynchon’s yarn sets out with a song in its heart and mischievous spring in its step, but it edges into darkness and its final forecast is bleak. The writer knows what’s to come and where this roll of foul history will eventually lead: towards a clownish world order epitomised by men such as Elon Musk, who recently boarded a Wisconsin stage with a cheesehead hat on his head and the American flag at his back. Cheese fraud is a front and period details provide cover. But the fascist past isn’t dead, it’s stinking up the joint right this minute.Shadow Ticket by Thomas Pynchon is published by Vintage (£22).

In 1975, three weeks after his arrival at the Stratford technical college where he did his A-levels, he put up a notice in the drama department looking for recruits for an acting group he was founding called The Studio Players. The notice explained how their first performance would be a three-act play, written by him, which he would also be directing. But the students didn’t take kindly to Elton’s “grandiose overreach”, refusing to join his acting group and freezing him out. “I had no idea then and still have very little idea of how to play it cool,” he notes.He’s not wrong. What Have I Done? is an exhaustive account of the 66-year-old’s career as a writer and comic, detailing every play, standup show, comedy series, movie and book he’s ever worked on, including multiple projects that never saw the light of day. A 470-page doorstopper, it takes us from his early days at Manchester University where he met Rik Mayall, with whom he would collaborate on the smash hit The Young Ones, to the writing partnership with Richard Curtis that yielded Blackadder and on to Comic Relief and Saturday Live, delivering standup that included the fevered skit“double seat”, which people still quote back at him 40 years later. After that, he digs into the novels, all 15 of them, and the jukebox musicals including the Queen-themed We Will Rock You, which got a critical drubbing but nonetheless ran in the West End for 12 years. Though the focus is mainly on his work, there are diversions into his personal life too, including his marriage to Australian musician Sophie Gare, with whom he has three children.He has no time for the older generation of comics who claim you can’t say anything any moreFrom a man who has written in every format imaginable and must know something about pacing, the writing here is remarkably baggy. Elton’s insistence on not leaving anything out means the pace is slow and the jollier showbiz anecdotes get smothered. And therearejolly anecdotes, such as his account of the Tuscan shoot for Kenneth Branagh’s film Much Ado About Nothing where the British actors (Elton, Brian Blessed, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton) would rowdily repair to a taverna in the evenings while the Hollywood contingent (Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves) coolly kept to themselves. In his short scenes as Verges, the police deputy, Elton received just one note from Branagh: “Don’t act.”He is sharp, too, on the workings of the comedy industry. While those familiar with the oeuvres of Dave Allen, Billy Connolly and Victoria Wood might take issue with his assertion that he pioneered observational comedy, he nonetheless paints a vivid picture of the alternative scene in the 1980s and how it kicked against the openly sexist and racist orthodoxy of the preceding decade.He has no time for the older generation of comics who claim you can’t say anything any more: “In my experience youcansay anything, it just doesn’t hurt to think a bit harder about how you say it andwhyyou’re saying it.”All of which makes What Have I Done? a curious mixture of insight and rampaging ego. Though Elton is capable of self-mockery, he is also master of the humblebrag and doesn’t miss an opportunity to list the superstars who tell him how thrilled they are at meeting him. At a Hard Rock Café anniversary party, he’s sees “a kerfuffle in the crowd” and realises George Harrison is making a beeline towards him to thank him for “keeping us amused in the 1980s”. Midway through an account of the premature birth of his twins, he pauses to let us know George Michael has sent flowers. If there is a recurring theme beyond the fact that everyone from Bono to the Beatles think he’s wonderful, it is Elton’s belief that he has been cruelly maligned. There is much agonising about the critics who, in the post-Blackadder years, have mostly looked dimly on his output. He also recalls unprovoked vitriol from fellow comic Alexei Sayle and presenter Jonathan Ross. He is clearly wounded by the brickbats, but as he recounts the umpteenth critical mauling, you want to gently take him aside and say: “You’ve worked consistently and made a handsome living for over 40 years. Why not just take the wins?”What Have I Done? concludes with its author receiving a Legend award at a comedy festival – for which, naturally, Paul McCartney and Michael Palin send their congratulations – and expressing a desire to keep working for another 10 years. That, he posits, would be sufficient time “to warrant a new extended edition of this memoir”.

Sacré bleu!Peter BradshawTue 30 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 30 Sep 2025 08.02 EDTShareThis truly bizarre film has a substantial reserve of goodwill to draw on: among its blue-chip cast are John Malkovich and Fanny Ardant, and it’s also the final film of the Belgian star Émilie Dequenne, famous for winning the best actress award at Cannes for her nonprofessional debut in Rosetta in 1999,who sadly died of cancer in March at the age of 43. It is a broad and baffling dramedy, directed by the bestselling French author Gilles Legardinier, and adapted from his 2012 novel Complètement Cramé! (Completely Burnt Out!).Malkovich plays a wealthy grieving widower called Andrew Blake, supposedly from England, who, to ease his broken heart, takes a job as a butler in a French chateau whose owner (Ardant) has fallen on hard times. It is a sentimental journey for him, as many years ago he first met his French wife, Diane, in the chateau’s sumptuous grounds. Among the below-stairs gallery of wacky characters is grumpy but golden-hearted housekeeper Odile (played by Dequenne).What makes this film such an ordeal to watch is Malkovich’s amazing line-readings in French, in his laboriously slow and unmistakably American accent. He very rarely snaps out of the language, and it would have been fascinating and horrifying to hear him do an English accent. Be that as it may, audiences will learn to tense and flinch in advance as Malkovich opens his distinctively pursed lips and strangles French word after French word after French word: “Je ne perrrrrrr ploooo res-tayyyyyyy – Dee-ane nay ploooo lahhhh …” He sounds like Dr Hannibal Lecter having smoked a hundredweight of weed, doing a derisive impression of an unctuous French headwaiter he intends to eat.There is one truly terrifying moment. To coach the groundsman in how to prepare for a hot date, Malkovich dresses up in drag and sits opposite him in blond wig and pearls – the most extraordinary drag appearance since Jeremy Irons as the master-of-disguise jewel thief in Claude Lelouch’s And Now … Ladies and Gentlemen. A deeply peculiar misfire.Mr Blake at Your Service is in UK and Irish cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsFilm adaptationsFranceJohn MalkovichComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But even those few years on the shelf have left it feeling uncomfortably out of touch with the urgency of the times when it comes to the way it handles the plight of young immigrants who facing increasing levels of hostility both in France itself and across the world with the rise of far-right activists.In Kitchen Brigade’s universe, almost all a bunch of undocumented teenagers need to help them get leave to remain is a white-saviour lady; in this case it is chef Cathy (Audrey Lamy), who comes to work at a refugee centre after she abruptly quits her job at a prominent high-end restaurant. In care herself as a child, Cathy doesn’t like authority much it seems (unless she’s the one in charge), but she needs the work. The centre’s other two saintly white people, director Lorenzo (François Cluzet) and teacher Sabine (Chantal Neuwirth), guide Cathy to be more understanding of the hardship the (mostly) black kids have been through to make it to France. Soon, she’s teaching them how to chop shallots and man their stations in the Frenchbrigade system, which it’s worth pointing out is derived from military management systems and contains a kind of systematised structure of abuse.The young actors who play Cathy’s charges (who are mostly from Africa) are charismatic performers, especially Yannick Kalombo as GusGus and Mamadou Koita as aspiring footballer Djibril, but they barely get more than a few lines and quick scenes to fill out their personalities, compared with the French characters. Then suddenly the film transitions into a meta commentary on TV reality shows as Cathy enters a competition, involving the boss she insulted when she quit her job at the start, to win a prize and get help setting up a certificate for teaching the kids. The whole thing is just a bit off, even though it’s hard to quarrel too much with the pro-immigrant message.The Kitchen Brigade is in UK and Irish cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRestaurantsFranceRefugeesEuropeFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

What has happened to the female one of their number? It’s the first in a series of questions the three men will face over the course of the tense aftermath of their crime. But the action really gets going at around the midpoint of the film, when three mysterious and beautiful women who claim to have been shipwrecked show up. Being gentlemen, the lads decide to offer them a roof over their comely heads for the night.For all this, the film’s ace card is its location. The pale, low-lying, single-storey house on a shingle beach isn’t your conventional cobwebbed and turreted spooky house – more like quite a nice holiday home – but its isolation and flatness gives a unique sort of strangeness to proceedings. The film is also almost entirely shot during either the first light of the day, the last light of the day, or night-time, which is an effective strategy: the characters feel quite literally shadier and the action unfolds with the off-kilter strangeness of a bad dream.It’s a shame then that for the most part the acting and writing don’t quite come up to the same standard as the technical craft. Other than Michelangelo Fortuzzi, whose turn as Prussian thief Paul is the kind of thing that Peter Lorre might have done back in the day, the characters are evidently a touch underpowered on the page, with the actors resorting to lots of intense glaring and meaningful looks to try to bring a bit of zest to their roles. The juicy hints that an ancient power of some sort has been unleashed are a lot of fun, but don’t expect a massively shocking resolution, it’s absolutely the kind of thing that was set up from the get-go.Still, it’s an impressive production given what was clearly a limited budget (when the credits roll around it is unsurprising to see the names of various crew members doubling up in different roles). Strong on hints and portents, The Drowned prioritises vibes over substance, but at 84 minutes, doesn’t hang about long enough to wear out its welcome.The Drowned is on digital platforms in the UK from 6 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s possibly a bit derivative: there’s a touch of silliness in the Donnie Darko-ish pagan beast-god rustling around in the foliage, and no prizes for guessing who its final victim is going to be. But there are some chills and bad-dream unease as well, effectively delivered by a good cast, well directed.Among an oppressive religious community in the remote countryside, Magpie (Emma Appleton) is a young widow who is concealing the truth about her husband’s death from the congregation led by her stern father, the Pastor (a potent performance from Toby Stephens). She is increasingly resented as a disruptive influence when she challenges the patriarchy’s abuse, in the form of what she suffered at the hands of her late husband and the violence that she can sense is being perpetrated on a young neighbouring girl by her father, a violence ignored by the girl’s pious mother (Jodhi May). Concealment and hypocrisy are all about: she herself is having an affair with her stepson David (Lewis Gribben), and the Pastor has an unusually close relationship with zealot parishioner John (Barney Harris).The awful truth is that Magpie is devoted to an alternative religious force: worshipping a strange pagan deity who can be induced to emerge from the undergrowth to carry out pitiless revenge against the oppressor in return for loyalty. Is the beast Satan? Or is Satan rather the organised savagery of the official church? This is an interesting movie, and a reminder that Arthur Miller’s The Crucible is the great ancestor of the folk-horror genre.Severed Sun is on digital platforms from 6 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a characteristically arresting production directed by Scott Graham, the drawers open to become steps, seats, even a toilet bowl; their contents include photos, golf clubs and glowing lightbulbs.Each one sparks a recollection in Anna Jordan’s two-hander, which recounts a relationship from the couple’s origin story to their implosion and beyond. Framed by Simisola Majekodunmi’s colourful lighting, Jess and Robbie look back at the days and nights that define them as a pair.It’s a memory play in the tradition of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams, who wrote that such dramas “can be presented with unusual freedom of convention”. That’s certainly the case with the set, designed by Andrzej Goulding, featuring a bed that unfolds from the wall of cabinets and serves as both refuge and precipice for these lovers who cling to it.Jordan has written a very modern romance, perhaps reflecting an age in which memories are methodically filtered and curated, often with deceptive results. On their first meeting, Jess lets Robbie share her mobile hotspot in a cafe. She seems carefree but he’s cautious. He slips away … only to unfathomably re-encounter her when he’s grappling with a train station’s wifi and recognises her network name.View image in fullscreenCabinet of curiosities … drawers become steps in Andrzej Goulding’s set design.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianAll of this is relayed with the breeze of a couple’s well-told “how we met” party piece. Each interrupts the other’s memories with a differing account but crucially that never disrupts the flow of a pacy production. Throughout, Jordan prods at the way we purposefully embellish or remould our personal histories, but also how they morph almost on their own with the passing of time – all paralleled by Jess’s research interest in how fairytales lost their grislier elements.This is Frantic Assembly’s 30th anniversary production – those cabinets could easily be filled with their past projects – and their assured brand of physicality is felt within the opening seconds. How many other companies could leave their signature so swiftly? There are moments here that are playful, sweet, sexy and vulnerable, sometimes all at once, as Jordan’s play reveals itself to be a close cousin, in theme and impact, to a pair of two-handers about the nitty-gritty of relationships: Duncan Macmillan’sLungsand Jack Thorne’sThe Solid Life of Sugar Water.A visit to Jess’s parents becomes a squirming, sweaty feat of cringe comedy while a meeting with Robbie’s withdrawn dad is written with painful acuity – the father’s affection for Jess making Robbie furious about the warmth missing from his relationship with him.In remarkable performances, Hannah Sinclair Robinson (Jess) and Joe Layton (Robbie) are both able to evoke what their characters were like as children, which helps the play’s second half hit home. They also convincingly convey how partners present us with the potential to be fuller, perhaps better versions of ourselves.The story has a familiar trajectory but the couple’s compendium of life moments, from cramped flat to cold hospital room, never feels less than authentic. Watching this relationship slowly rounded out and then deflated is incredibly moving.AtCurve theatre, Leicester, until 4 October.

Gimmickry! Intellectual property! – would probably do well to just ignore Masquerade, a new immersive-experience off-Broadway version of The Phantom of the Opera. It has an unavoidable resemblance to next-gen ride experiences like Disney’s Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance or Universal’s Monsters Unchained (the latter of which even features a cameo from the Phantom himself, albeit in a different incarnation) that make patrons feel as if they’re being ushered through a famous fictional world. But a lot of skill goes into high-end theme park attractions, and like those, Masquerade is a lot of fun if you’re in the right mood.Waiting for Godot review – Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter’s unlikely reunionRead moreWhile the gold standard for popular immersive theater is the Macbeth adaptation Sleep No More, which ended its 14-year run earlier this year, Masquerade is a more straightforward treatment of rather less venerated source material. TheAndrew Lloyd Webbermusical, which set a Broadway record with its 36-year run, is itself a kitschy adaptation of Gaston Leroux’s 1910 gothic-horror novel about a disfigured man who lives beneath the Palais Garnier in Paris, studying the arts and meddling in the theater’s productions. (Basically, it’s the story of a particularly bossy critic.) The musical softens some of the more horrific elements, and is known for an insidiously catchy Webber score. Based on the middling reception of the 2004 movie adaptation, it may also be something of a you-have-to-be-there work, a show that depends on live pageantry and, yes, spectacle to fully put across its melodrama.In other words, its shortcomings are ideally suited for an experiential reworking that places the audience in the middle of the action. Creator-director Diane Paulus and producer Randy Weiner have truncated the story and some songs to fit a two-hours-and-change runtime, which also must accommodate a lot of travel time, as the audience shuffles from room to room and floor to floor. (You may not have to stand through the entire thing, but most likely you’ll be on your feet more often than sitting.) As before, chorus girl Christine gets a chance to sing in place of the Paris Opera’s prima donna, after years of coaching from an unseen tutor – the so-called opera ghost who lurks below and around the theater. He reveals himself to Christine, and also threatens the company with violence unless they produce his opera with the object of his obsession in the lead. A love triangle of sorts also forms as Christine reunites with her childhood friend, Raoul.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matthew Murphy and Evan ZimmermanYou may have noticed the lack of credited actors; that’s because the nature of Masquerade involves multiple casts cycling through the show for the multiple groups that walk through the building in staggered time slots. There are six Phantoms and six Christines; my preview performance had Jeff Kready and Anna Zavelson in those two roles, respectively, both good in the midst of potential logistical chaos. Any theater nerds overfamiliar with Phantom of the Opera (or just not that engaged with it) might still be occupied by attempting to clock the mind-boggling dexterity this production requires of its actors and technical crew. One particular marvel is a series of scenes set in a relatively small dressing room, to a crowd of around two dozen people, with the actors sometimes inches away from the audience (depending on your particular vantage). The small of these scenes requires them to be performed multiple times in quick succession, in differing order to juggle the cast.It’s not all technical wizardry, either. The immersiveness lends some moments that might otherwise seem cheesy a striking intimacy, and also lets the performers go smaller in between the more bombastic belt-outs. Zavelson shows particularly impressive range between the Broadway-style emoting and the small-group intimacy, at one point hitting the final word of a famous Webber tune with a tremulous whisper. The lightly interactive walk-through element also recalls a big-budget haunted house, which nudges Masquerade back toward Phantom’s horror roots, particularly for a backstory sequence (not included in the original musical) set at a carnival show – which here includes some Coney Island-style stunt work from a fire-eater and a human blockhead.These changes are admittedly more superficially pleasing than thematically resonant, and the show does involve an awful lot of ushering and re-arranging as the audience moves from a genuine basement to a New York City rooftop. (As my viewing companion noted: Finally, a chance to see the Phantom of the Opera ride an escalator!) But it seems weirdly likely to unite Phantom superfans, who will glory at a new production they can actually live inside for a few hours, and those indifferent to the Webber show, who can enjoy the carnival-like showmanship without needing to buy into the show’s thinner characters. This reconfigured Phantom may be closer to a ride than high art, but it sure gives you a closeup look at a lot of terrific craft.Explore more on these topicsStageAndrew Lloyd WebberMusicalsUS theaterTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Some of the islands are mere skerries – rocky outcrops and reefs so small they can host but a single cormorant drying its outstretched wings – while others, such as our target Bullerön, can be a mile or more in length, with historic fishing huts, summer cottages and wooden jetties sitting among their smoothly weathered rocks and windswept forests.I’m on a two-day sea kayaking tour ofNämdöskärgården, a newly established marine national park, which is a vast 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of protected, mostly blue space – it is 97% covered by water – beginning on the outer reaches of the archipelago and stretching well into the Baltic Sea.Map of Stockholm archipelagoIt is Sweden’s second marine national park, alongside Kosterhavet on the west coast, and its creation was approved by Swedish parliament in June this year, a summer in which the country also banned bottom trawling – the destructive fishing practice that Sir David Attenborough has likened to“bulldozing a rainforest”– from its marine national parks and nature reserves by July 2026. It’s the first European country to do so (the UK appears to haverejected whole-site bansin more marine protected areas, despite its earlier pledge to extend these– much to the dismay of conservationists).One of the challenges in getting people to care about ocean conservation is that it’s hard to engage with what we can’t see or experience directly, and the idea behind Nämdöskärgården is not just to preserve the area’s unique ecological diversity, but also to make it accessible to visitors in a low-impact way. Sea kayaking – a popular pastime for Swedes throughout the archipelago – is the perfect way to do that.View image in fullscreenBullerö, in Nämdöskärgården.Photograph: Länsstyrelsen Stockholms länMy guide Johan Montelius, fromStockholm Adventures, and I get dropped off by taxi boat on Jungfruskär, which, like many isles in the outer archipelago, is uninhabited. We haul our narrow yellow sea kayaks up on to rocks splattered with grey, green and bright orange lichen, and after a quick safety briefing, Johan shows me our route to Idöborg, an island just outside the marine national park, where we’ll spend the night. It’s a journey of around 5 miles, but he assures me the wind will help push us along in parts and we’ll make plenty of stops along the way.The thing that excites me most is the seaweed. It’s a sign of healthy watersWe set off, and after a tricky first 50 metres of paddling into the wind, find ourselves nicely sheltered between two long islands. We settle into an easy, slow rhythm – perfect for tuning into the surrounding natural wonder. There is plenty of birdlife, mostly cormorants, gulls, herons and geese, but we also spot at least five different white-tailed eagles over the two-day trip, as well as a pine marten and a seal. The thing that excites me most, though, is the seaweed, which comes in a host of shades, even the russet colour of autumn leaves. It’s a sign of healthy waters, with the seaweed providing a great nursery for young fish as well as a vital carbon sink – something that absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases.View image in fullscreenSafe from the elements … in a forest cabin on IdöborgWe paddle over wonderful seagrass meadows, which glisten when the sun breaks through the clouds, and extensive belts of bladder wrack, orblåstång,a dark green seaweed with air pockets. Because the water is so clear, I can see it is also home to lots of periwinkles and other shellfish.We see no other boats or kayaks, partly because it’s a slightly wet and windy day in September – sunny days in July and August are a lot busier, Johan says – but also because with kayaks we can navigate narrow passages between islands that sail boats and other watercraft can’t. At times, we paddle through fields of high reeds, our route no more than the width of a footpath.We stop for lunch on another deserted island, feasting on a delicious fish stew made by Johan the night before. Mindful of leaving no trace in an archipelago where I’ve not seen a speck of single-use plastic all day, we check the spot for litter meticulously before we head off.View image in fullscreenEnjoying the peace on BullerönThe islands are beautiful, but they all look the same to me, so I’ve no idea how Johan is navigating so effectively – he only uses the GPS on his phone once, to check our final crossing to Idöborg as the wind picks up. We stash our kayaks in a sheltered sandy bay on the island and check into our cosy forest cabins, which have full A-frame views of the increasingly agitated ocean. Stockholm Adventures offers wild camping when the weather allows, but tonight I’m glad of a roof over my head.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It alsohas a saunafacing the water, with a wooden jetty that invites dipping in the soft, brackish water in between the waves of heat.When we enjoy it at dusk, the sea still has plenty of energy, but the next morning things are calmer. Our 2.5-mile paddle out to Bullerön, the main island of the Bullerö archipelago, and one of the last islands before the open sea, passes in an easy, meditative haze.The sun comes out, and we visit the former cottage and studio of the influential Swedish nature painter Bruno Liljefors, which now serves as an information centre for Nämdöskärgården, and walk the island’s stunning circuitous footpath. From the highest point, looking out east to the expanse of the Baltic Sea, it feels good to know this stretch of glistening ocean and all that lies beneath it will be protected.Steam baths and seaweed safaris on Sweden’s spa islandRead moreOver breakfast on Idöborg, I chat to Ylva Tenselius, a Stockholm resident and consultant here on a work team-building trip. When she was growing up, her grandfather used to go out and catch cod all the time. “We would groan and say, ‘No more cod,’ when it was served at the dinner table,” she says, adding that she used to catch perch easily herself with a line, but now both are far less common. She welcomes the new marine park and its conservation goals. “We’ve seen the changes and now it’s time to protect it.”When I get home to the UK, I call Charles Clover, co-founder ofBlue Marine Foundation, an ocean conservation charity, which is campaigning for bottom trawling to be banned from all UK marine protected areas, to ask what he thinks about Nämdöskärgården. “Anything that protects breeding grounds for fish is a positive step,” he says. “The sea is in such a bad state, particularly the Baltic Sea, so I think these protected areas will bring enormous benefits. They will help repair the sea and help nature help itself.”And he believes low-impact tourism, such as sea kayaking and hiking, can help with that process. “It creates a different use of nature, which is to enjoy it rather than to exploit, and that can only be a good thing.” I couldn’t agree more.This trip was provided byVisit Sweden.

Prop styling: Anna Wilkins.Kitchen aidePastaHow to avoid clumpy cheesy pasta saucesWe asked a wise panel of cheesy pasta perfectionists how they solve the blobby cheese problemAnna BerrillTue 30 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareHow do I prevent the cheese from clumpingin my cacio e pepesauce?Samuel, by emailThe first thing to note, says Feast’s Italian correspondentRachel Roddy, is that it’s “soannoying andsocommon. In fact, a lot of the responsibility lies with recipe writers, because, traditionally, cacio e pepe wasn’t this creamy, emulsified dish that we all make now. It was just cooked spaghetti with cheese on it.”She continues: “People are so good now at using the pasta cooking water, but that means everything is hotter.” And that right there, she says, is the cause of Samuel’s cheese-clumping plight: “When cheese gets too hot, the solids lose their fat and liquid, and turn into these horrid little blobs.” The line between melted and coagulated is a fine one, too: “It’s probably only a couple of degrees.”Tim Siadatan, co-owner ofTrulloandPadella, both in London, and author ofPadella: Iconic Pasta at Home, uses parmesan in hispicicacio e pepe because it’s not that easy to melt: “It’s a very hard, dry cheese with a high protein content, and it’s that combination of characteristics that makes it difficult to melt, especially compared with the likes of mozzarella, which is soft, high in moisture and fat, and low in protein.” To avoid those clumps and potential grainy texture, Siadatan first grates the parmesan (or pecorino) finely (“this will enable it to melt”), but doesn’t then leave it anywhere too warm, “otherwise it will start to sweat, stick together and form little balls even before you try to melt it”.To beat the heat, chefs in Rome often throw grated ice into the pan along with the cheese, Roddy says, although she prefers to play it “really safe” by mixing cold water with the cheese and pepper in a cool bowl to a toothpaste-like consistency. The combination of the cold cheese mix and hot spaghetti gives a “pretty reliable, creamy cacio e pepe, because it never gets too hot”. As in life, it also pays to wait a beat: “You can go from lovely and melty to blobby in a second,” Roddy warns, so she always counts to 10, 20, even 30 before lifting her pasta (plus any residual cooking water) into the sauce: “It will then be just that little bit cooler.”Siadatan’s sauce strategy, meanwhile, involves keeping the pan over a medium-low heat. “If you add all the cheese at once, it will clump before it’s had time to melt, so add a small handful at a time and stir to create a smooth sauce.”But don’t let your cheese fly solo: “To create a velvety sauce, you need liquid, such as water, butter, egg yolks or cream, for the cheese to melt into.” Mateo Zielonka, author ofPasta Pronto, concurs: he grates his cheese into a butter emulsion on a low heat, though if he’s making, say,fettuccine alfredo, he pulls the pan off the heat before adding the parmesan in two batches, “otherwise it goes stringy”.And if disaster does strike, can you rescue it? “Some say you can by adding more cheese, a bit of cold water and really beating it,” Roddy says, but if that doesn’t do the trick, she’d be inclined simply to embrace failure: “Making a mistake and watching that cheese coagulate is the first step, because then you can see what happens when it’s too hot and when it’s colder.” Well, every day’s a school day.Got a culinary dilemma?

It’s a well-known method that I learned while working with Italian chefs to celebrate in-season cavolo nero and new season extra-virgin olive oil, keeping the sauce as simple as possible to let each of them sing. You can serve this sauce however you like: I often stir it through pasta for a quick dinner, but when I have more time, I stir it through a white risotto. Finish with an additional drizzle of good extra-virgin olive oil: heaven.Cavolo nero risottoBoiling the garlic alongside the cavolo nero takes the edge off it, so the resulting puree is nowhere near as punchy as a standard pesto.Prep10 minCook50 minServes4200g cavolo nero, leaves stripped off the stalks3 garlic cloves, peeled1 litre vegetable stock(I use the cavolo nero cooking water)1 large knob butter1 onion, peeled and finely chopped2 celery sticks, trimmed and finely chopped225g risotto rice, such as arborio100ml dry white wineSalt and black pepper75g pecorino, or parmesan2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to finishPut the cavolo nero leaves and garlic in a large saucepan of water, bring to a boil, then cook for five minutes. Using a slotted spoon, lift the leaves and garlic into the jug of a blender, add 100ml of the cooking liquid and set aside. Add boiling water to the liquid left in the pan, to make it up to a litre, and leave it on a low heat.Meanwhile, put a second large pan or casserole on a medium heat, add the butter, chopped onion and celery, and saute for five minutes, stirring often, until the vegetables start to soften. Add the rice, stir for a minute or two, until it turns translucent, then add the wine and stir until it has all evaporated. Season the rice generously.Start adding the hot stock to the rice a ladleful at a time, stirring until all the liquid has been absorbed before adding the next ladleful. The rice will take 22-25 minutes to cook, by which time it should be oozy but still have a slight bite.When the rice is almost done, chop 40g of the cheese, add it to the contents of the blender jug, then pour in the extra-virgin olive oil. Season well, then blitz smooth.When the rice is ready, stir in the green puree, cook, stirring, for a further two to three minutes, then take off the heat, cover and leave to rest for two minutes.Serve with the remaining pecorino grated over the top and a final drizzle of good oil.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkRiceFoodMain courseStarterVegetablesAutumn food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

But even those few years on the shelf have left it feeling uncomfortably out of touch with the urgency of the times when it comes to the way it handles the plight of young immigrants who facing increasing levels of hostility both in France itself and across the world with the rise of far-right activists.In Kitchen Brigade’s universe, almost all a bunch of undocumented teenagers need to help them get leave to remain is a white-saviour lady; in this case it is chef Cathy (Audrey Lamy), who comes to work at a refugee centre after she abruptly quits her job at a prominent high-end restaurant. In care herself as a child, Cathy doesn’t like authority much it seems (unless she’s the one in charge), but she needs the work. The centre’s other two saintly white people, director Lorenzo (François Cluzet) and teacher Sabine (Chantal Neuwirth), guide Cathy to be more understanding of the hardship the (mostly) black kids have been through to make it to France. Soon, she’s teaching them how to chop shallots and man their stations in the Frenchbrigade system, which it’s worth pointing out is derived from military management systems and contains a kind of systematised structure of abuse.The young actors who play Cathy’s charges (who are mostly from Africa) are charismatic performers, especially Yannick Kalombo as GusGus and Mamadou Koita as aspiring footballer Djibril, but they barely get more than a few lines and quick scenes to fill out their personalities, compared with the French characters. Then suddenly the film transitions into a meta commentary on TV reality shows as Cathy enters a competition, involving the boss she insulted when she quit her job at the start, to win a prize and get help setting up a certificate for teaching the kids. The whole thing is just a bit off, even though it’s hard to quarrel too much with the pro-immigrant message.The Kitchen Brigade is in UK and Irish cinemas from 3 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRestaurantsFranceRefugeesEuropeFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"
