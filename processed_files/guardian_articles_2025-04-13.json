British Steel’s UK management team is now scrambling to buy the materials, with help from government officials.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, declined to directly accuse Jingye of sabotaging the plant but it is understood ministers do not expect the company to return to any negotiations. Reynolds said theemergency government steel actionmeant there was now a “high trust bar” for Chinese companies to invest in critical UK industries.“It might not be sabotage, it might be neglect,” Reynolds told the BBC on Sunday. “The conscious decision not just to not order raw materials but to sell existing supplies of raw materials is the significant change that required the government to step in.”Reynolds said there would not be a full ban on Chinese investment in UK industry, with MPs raising questions about whether companies would be allowed to invest in a planned new nuclear site. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been on a charm offensive with Beijing to try to attract investment.But on Sunday the Guardian revealed the government could target parts of China’s security apparatus under new foreign influence rules set to be unveiled in the coming months. China as a whole is not expected to be included on the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme (Firs).Reynolds said the costs to the economy of closing the plant and losing the country’s steelmaking capacity – plus the major job losses it entailed – would have been at least £1bn, more than the losses expected from nationalising the plant.A decision on full nationalisation is expected to be taken in the next fortnight if the plant can continue operation.Reynolds told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg he would not “make my situation or the nation’s situation more difficult” by giving more details on whether the steel blast furnaces would be able to continue operating.If the furnaces run out of raw materials, they could go through an uncontrolled cooling, making it prohibitively expensive to restart production.The government said Tata Steel and Rainham Steel had offered “managerial support and raw materials” to British Steel.Last week Jingye ordered British Steel to temporarily shut down one blast furnace on Monday in order to eke out remaining materials. However, the process – known as a salamander tap – is complicated and is generally avoided unless repairs are needed. British Steel managers are now looking at whether this can be avoided.While some materials at Immingham port on the Humber estuary inLincolnshireare awaiting payment, British Steel is trying to find materials for the coming weeks, with some shipments taking as long as 45 days to arrive.Reynolds said the UK had “given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that”.‘I have spent my life in this corner of Lincolnshire and witnessed how such job losses affect every part of a community’Read moreBut he said it was too commercially sensitive to confirm either way whether the government could guarantee the plant would continue operating.Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2019 – when Boris Johnson was prime minister – had stopped ordering more raw materials and begun selling off the supplies it already had, declining an offer of £500m in support and refusing to guarantee the furnaces could continue operating.“It became clear to me and to the government, no financial offer of any generosity would have been accepted,” Reynolds said. “This was the situation on [Thursday] the 10th of April, on the Friday we had agreement from the cabinet. On Saturday, parliament was recalled, and here we are.”Officials from the Department for Business and Trade arrived at the Scunthorpe plant as soon as the legislation came into force on Saturday, the government said on Sunday.The business secretary told Sky News there was now a “high trust bar” for bringing Chinese investment into the UK and said he would not have allowed a Chinese company to invest in the “sensitive” steel sector.Reynolds said the company had annual losses of £233m and that figure “can be improved upon”. But he said the cost of nationalisation had to be compared with the cost of allowing the plant to go under.He said it would not mean any further borrowing to nationalise the plant. “We’ve got an allocation in the first budget for a steel fund of over £2.5bn.“If we are spending some of that money to support, in the short term, steel, I think that’s better for the taxpayer than spending a greater sum of money on a transition with a company I’m not sure right now I could rely on, or to be frank … the complete collapse of British Steel, with a cost to the exchequer of many multiples [of that].“If that had gone down, that number of jobs, the land remediation, support to those who lost their jobs, that would be well over £1bn.”Reynolds said he would not make accusations of Chinese state interference, but said the company was “not [acting] in the kind of rational way we’d expect a company to operate in a market economy”.The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, accused Jingye of lying about the company’s accounts and said he was “100% certain” the Chinese government had ordered Jingye to buy British Steel in order to close the business. Farage offered no evidence for those accusations and said it was based on his “intuition”.“Why do you think that yesterday morning the trade unions acted to stop the Chinese officials even getting their cars into the plant? Because they feared industrial sabotage,” Farage said.The GMB trade union general secretary, Gary Smith, confirmed workers had acted to stop the company gaining access.“We were worried about industrial vandalism and there was a worry about sabotage on the site, quite frankly,” he said. “And yesterday, workers did prevent executives from the Chinese owners from going on site.“I’m sure that people are still very worried about that, but these people performed heroics yesterday to ensure that we’ve got a fighting chance for the steel industry in this country. They were legitimately concerned about industrial sabotage.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryJonathan ReynoldsManufacturing sectorLincolnshireNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The enhanced tier will cover countries and entities deemed a particular risk, which will require extra disclosures.Ministers have announced that Iran and Russia will be on the enhanced tier, meaning anyone directed by those two countries to carry out activities in the UK will have to declare it or face five years in prison.The government has yet to say anything about China’s place in Firs, a matter which is subject to internal debate by ministers and officials weighing up security concerns against the economic benefits of closer ties with Beijing.Financial services companies have privately argued against including China on the enhanced tier on the basis that they would have to fill out burdensome paperwork to justify business meetings.In an effort to strengthen security without compromising economic ties, ministers are considering including specific parts of the Chinese political system that have beenaccused of interferencein the west on the enhanced tier.Entities under consideration include Beijing’s Ministry of State Security, which is its intelligence service, the United Front Work Department, often referred to as the international arm of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), and the People’s Liberation Army, China’s military. The government could also target the CCP as a whole.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on security matters.”MI5’s director general, Ken McCallum,said in a 2022 speechthat “the Chinese intelligence services, or bodies within the CCP itself – such as its United Front Work Department (UFWD) – are mounting patient, well-funded, deceptive campaigns to buy and exert influence” in the UK.McCallum said the UFWD aimed “to amplify pro-CCP voices, and silence those that question the CCP’s legitimacy or authority”. He said its activities had “very real consequences in communities here in the UK” and that “it needs to be challenged”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four words that belie what this remarkable Northern Irishman achieved on a spine-tingling afternoon at Augusta National. They ignore, too, the torturous process McIlroy endured to realise this lifetime goal.Did he win the 89th Masters the hard way? Too right he did. From a seemingly untouchable position, McIlroy was dragged back into a scrap he was so desperate to avoid. He emerged from it on the first extra hole, where the unlikely adversary ofJustin Rosewas nudged aside. Rory McIlroy, Masters champion.Rory McIlroy relieved to finally lift decade-long ‘burden’ with dramatic Masters winRead moreNo wonder the scenes were so moving as McIlroy battered down the Masters door. McIlroy reduced so many others to tears, let alone himself. Finally, they were of unbridled joy. It almost felt the heartache had been worth it. What a ride. What a gobsmacking, exhausting ride. From 5ft on the last hole of regulation play, McIlroy passed up a chance to claim the Masters. Soon, he would be hugging his lifetime friend and caddie Harry Diamond in a scene of euphoria. This was a success built on sheer guts. Rory, you are immortal now.“I started to wonder if it would ever be my time,” McIlroy admitted in the Butler Cabin. He was not the only one.McIlroy joins Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus as winners of golf’s career grand slam. He also has Tiger Woods, his childhood idol, for company in that special group. We have known about McIlroy’s genius since he flicked golf balls into a washing machine on national television in 1999. He had long since been holing putts outside the family home on the outskirts of Belfast with the dream of winning the Masters. Little did anybody know that his career would be so storied, so dramatic, such compulsive viewing.McIlroy did not exactly sprint into the pantheon of legends. Augusta National tugged upon every dark corner of his psyche, from a point where McIlroy looked like he would enjoy a procession. Rose and Ludvig Åberg had late hope. Rose’s rampaging 66 meant second at 11 under. McIlroy’s 73 tied that. Patrick Reed took third.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy putts the birdie to win the 2025 Masters.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesMore than a decade had passed since McIlroy won the last of his quartet of majors. Near misses had come and gone, none as painful as atlast year’s US Open. It felt appropriate that McIlroy had Bryson DeChambeau, the man who pipped him at Pinehurst, for company here. DeChambeau capsized. He spent Saturday evening watching James Bond movies and Sunday afternoon starring in one: Bogeys Galore.There were moments that implied the golfing gods were on McIlroy’s side. He played a dangerous, low second shot to the 11th which clung on for dear life at the top of a bank leading to a water hazard. Moments later, DeChambeau found the same pond. There were also examples of McIlroy’s jaw-dropping talent, such as the second shot to the 7th, which danced through trees. Those who criticise McIlroy’s propensity to live dangerously should remember the theatre when his audacity pays off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

DeChambeau licked his lips. A DeChambeau birdie to McIlroy’s par at the 2nd and the Californian was ahead.McIlroy jabbed back with a birdie at the 3rd as DeChambeau three-putted. DeChambeau did the same at the next with McIlroy’s birdie earning him a three-stroke lead. It remained that way until the 9th, where McIlroy collected another shot and DeChambeau wasted an opportunity. McIlroy smiled when reaching dry land at the 12th, his playing partner now six back. The danger lay elsewhere; Rose and Åberg.Yet with six holes to play the only person who could beat McIlroy was McIlroy himself. Case in point; the 13th, where McIlroy laid up before astonishingly chipping into Rae’s Creek. Cue McIlroy’s fourth – yes, fourth – double bogey of the week. Åberg made a four at the 15th for 10 under. Rose had birdied the same hole. McIlroy’s five-shot lead after 10 evaporated into a three-way tie as his par putt on the 14th somehow remained above ground. How would he recover from tossing this away?

A birdie ensued. Rose matched 11 under at the 16th. Although he later made a triple bogey at the last, Åberg’s race ended on the penultimate hole. Up ahead, Rose converted for a closing birdie – he had made a bogey on the 17th – to again tie McIlroy. A downhill birdie putt on the 16th gave McIlroy fresh hope but it missed to the right.One birdie from the last two was needed to avoid a playoff. There, Rose would not be lacking in incentive; he lost in extra holesto Sergio García in 2017. McIlroy delivered that three on the 17th but wobbled on the last after finding a greenside bunker from the fairway. Tension, wild tension. Back to the 18th tee they went.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy on his knees after making history.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPALost in this melee will be that McIlroy’s approach in the playoff hole was a thing of utter beauty. This time, it was a putt he could not possibly miss. Rose is due huge credit for his contribution to this major.When dust eventually settles, we will be left to ponder what on earth else McIlroy might fixate on for the remainder of his career.

One hit a trolley bus full of passengers. Footage from the scene showed bodies lying in the street, burning cars, and rescuers carrying bloodied survivors. Two of the dead were children.“My seven-year-old son was running for shelter when the second missile struck. The blast ripped off a door which hit him in the leg. He has a bruise but is OK,” saidVolodymyr Niankin, a film director. “My son said this is the most terrible day of his life.”Niankin said he saw bodies on the ground. “Many of the people who died were sitting on the bus or walking in the road. A lot of people were out and about because it was a religious festival. I think this is genocide.”Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said there were “dozens of dead and wounded civilians”. He accused Russia of carrying out an act of deliberate terror and said tough reaction was needed from the US, Europe and the rest of the world.View image in fullscreenBodies lie on the ground after the Russian missile strike on Sumy.Photograph: Volodymyr Hordiienko/AP“Enemy missiles hit an ordinary city street, ordinary life: houses, educational institutions, cars on the street … And this on a day when people go to church: Palm Sunday, the feast of the Lord’s entry into Jerusalem,” heposted on social media.Zelenskyy said the Kremlin was ignoring a US proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. “Unfortunately, there in Moscow they are convinced they can keep killing with impunity. Action is needed to change this situation,” he said.Officials said 117 people had been injured, including 15 children.There was widespread international outrage. Donald Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the attack “crosses any line of decency”. “As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,”he wrote on X.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was “appalled at Russia’s horrific attacks on civilians”. Vladimir Putin “must now agree to a full and immediate ceasefire without conditions”, he said.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, agreed on the “urgent need to impose a ceasefire on Russia”. “Everyone knows it is Russia alone that wants this war,” he said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the scenes from Sumy as heartbreaking and horrific.The EU’s ambassador toUkraine, Katarína Mathernová, called the strikes a war crime. “Nothing seems to be sacred to the Russians – neither churches, nor Ukrainian children,” she said.Ukrainians contrasted the images of bodies in Sumy with photos of Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, warmly shaking hands with Putin on Friday. The two held four hours of talks in St Petersburg.View image in fullscreenA wrecked bus after the missile attack.Photograph: Sumy region prosecutor’s office/AFP/Getty ImagesPutin’s press spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Sunday that the talks were going very well but that it was “impossible to expect any instant results”.Trump has said he is “pissed off” at Russia’s failure to stop bombing, but has so far not taken any concrete measures against Moscow. Ukraine has signed up to a 30-day ceasefire that Washington proposed a month ago.Since then, Russia has escalated its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, firing 70 missiles and 2,200 drones. Nine children and nine adults were killed earlier this month when a Russian missilehit a playgroundin the city of KryvyiRih.Zelenskyy has been pressing allies to send another 10 Patriot air defence systems to protect Ukraine’s skies. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and air bombs. We need the kind of attitude towards Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said on Sunday.mapSumy is 15 miles (25km) from the border with Russia and is a major Ukrainian military hub. The missiles landed in a central civilian area where many people carrying willow branches for Palm Sunday were on their way to church.Video from a car dashcam shows an orange flash as one of the missiles struck at 10.20am. Plumes of grey smoke can be seen as other vehicles reverse away from the danger and passersby run in panic.The first missile hit aconference centre belonging to Sumy’s state university. Several children were waiting outside for an 11am theatre performance in a basement venue. The second landed 200 metres away, in Pokrovska Street, as the trolley bus rolled past.View image in fullscreenThe conference centre at Sumy’s state university after the missile strike.Photograph: Volodymyr NiankinNiankin said the centre was a unique arts hub and home to a theatre he ran. “I feel like half of my heart has been taken away. It was a place where we could play and create. Everything is destroyed: the stage, costumes, all our stuff. We have no chance to continue our work,” he said.The director, who made afilm about Sumy’s resistanceto Russia’s 2022 invasion, said there were not a lot of people inside the building when it was flattened. “It happened half an hour before the show was due to start. My son was nearby attending a class in a studio.”Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia had launched two Iskander-M missiles from its western territory in the Voronezh and Kursk regions. He identified the army forces responsible as the 112th and 448th missile brigades. “Another proof of the godlessness of the disgusting cursed Moscow,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This could lead to a hat-trick of hold-ups on Thursday, Friday and Saturday as drivers visit family and friends.“Drivers shouldn’t expect to escape the queues if they don’t plan the best time to set off. It’s always best to travel as early as possible in the morning or later in the day when most of the traffic has eased, especially if headed to popular holiday destinations such as the West Country, Scotland or Wales.”The Port of Dover said it expected to process about 5,500 cars embarking on outbound ferry sailings between 6am and 1pm on Good Friday.The traffic management system Operation Brock, which involves narrow lanes and a reduced 50mph speed limit, will be in place in Kent until 22 April. It is designed to manage traffic flows on the M20, with lorries heading for the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel directed to a specific lane.On the railways, Network Rail is conducting engineering work in several locations this weekend, causing disruption to a number of routes. The most significant impact will be at London Euston, where there will be no services to or from Milton Keynes on Easter Saturday and Easter Sunday, and a reduced timetable on Good Friday and Easter Monday.The tourism authority VisitEngland said about 10.6 million British adults were planning to take a holiday in the UK over the bank holiday period.The aviation analytics company Cirium said 11,282 flights were scheduled to depart from UK airports between Good Friday and Easter Monday.Explore more on these topicsTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

It will not involve deployed soldiers collecting bins.Dysfunction worthy of the House of Windsor: the real reasons rubbish is piling up in Birmingham | Kate KnowlesRead moreA government spokesperson said: “The government has already provided a number of staff to support the council with logistics and make sure the response on the ground is swift to address the associated public health risks.“In light of the ongoing public health risk, a small number of office-based military personnel with operational planning expertise have been made available to Birmingham city council to further support in this area.“This builds on a range of measures we’ve supported the council on to date – including neighbouring authorities providing additional vehicles and crews, and opening household waste centres to Birmingham residents.”More than 17,000 tonnes of rubbish has piled up in the streets since the industrial action started intermittently in January and progressed to an all-out strike in March.The dispute is over plans to scrap the higher-paid waste recycling and collection officer role from council fleets, which the council claims risks creating a “huge future equal-pay liability”.Last week Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, urged members of the Unite union to accept an “improved” deal, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the strike had “escalated way out of hand”.The union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, has condemned the “constant attacks and briefings against these low-paid bin workers”, claiming that the long-running dispute was adding further strains between the Labour party and Unite.“It is important to reiterate the truth, as opposed to the lies being peddled in an attempt to distract,” she said.“This dispute is not about greed or increased pay. This dispute is about workers losing up to £8,000 of their pay – which for some is almost a quarter.”Graham added that a partial deal on pay protection for some workers had already been agreed and urged the council to accept a wider offer the union had put forward.The council says only 17 workers will be affected, and they stand to lose much less than Unite has claimed.A further ballot on a deal to end the strike is expected to take place on Monday.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamIndustrial actionMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

No physical altercation took place, according to the PA news agency.Rourke had received a formal warning fromBig Brotherearlier in the week for “unacceptable language and behaviour” directed at another housemate, JoJo Siwa.The 21-year-old US singer accused Rourke of being homophobic after he made comments about her sexuality and said he would “vote the lesbian out real quick”.JoJo Siwa.The Oscar-nominated actor had also asked Siwa if she “likes girls or boys”, and when she replied that she liked girls and her partner was non-binary, he said: “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more.”She responded: “I can guarantee I’ll still be gay and I’ll still be in a very happy relationship.”Hughes, who has presented sports coverage for the BBC and ITV, told Rourke “you can’t say that” after theformer boxersaid he needed “a fag” and gestured to Siwa to add: “I’m not talking to you.”Hughes, 32, comforted Siwa in Wednesday’s episode after the comments.In the diary room, Rourke was given a formal warning and Big Brother said: “Further language or behaviour of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.”Rourke then apologised to Siwa, saying: “I want to apologise.

Rourke had earlier told Big Brother in the diary room that his housemates “seemed happy” that he had not left during Friday’s eviction episode.“They seemed happy, for some reason. I did my hardest to get out of here. You know, I always went against the machine, and I don’t want to go through life, like, with a clenched fist any more,” he said. “I spent my whole life like this, and it gets hard. It wears you out.”A spokesperson for the ITV show said on Saturday: “Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother house this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behaviour.”Rourke won the leading actor Bafta and Golden Globe in 2009 for his role playing retired professional wrestler Randy “The Ram” Robinson in The Wrestler.Explore more on these topicsMickey RourkeBig BrothernewsShareReuse this content"

It aims to provide 10,000 patients in England with personalised cancer treatments in the UK by 2030.The NHS partnered with the life-sciences company Scancell to widen access for patients at hospitals across the country, with seven sites initially registered and the first patients expected to be referred next month.Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, accounting for about 4% of all new cases.Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS national cancer director, said: “Skin cancer can have a devastating impact and we know that cancer vaccines have the potential to revolutionise cancer care for patients in this country and across the world – and to save more lives.“It’s incredibly exciting that the NHS is expanding its world-leading programme so more patients with different types of cancer could benefit from the development ofnew vaccinesthat could stop their cancer coming back.“We want to ensure as many eligible NHS patients as possible have access to these vital trials, which is why we are working with a range of industry partners as more studies get up and running to ensure patients are fast-tracked to a vaccine that could transform lives.”A golden age of cancer treatment? – podcastRead moreThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, said:“This kind of innovation is nothing short of life-saving and I want to see more of these world-leading treatments being developed in the UK. That’s why through our plan for change we’ve taken action to boost our life-sciences sector through steps to fast-track clinical trials and cut red tape for researchers – so that Britain is the best country in the world for medical research.“This will accelerate the discovery of transformative treatments and improve services for patients, driving growth across the country while making sure as many people as possible can benefit from cutting-edge treatments.”Susanna Daniels, the chief executive of Melanoma Focus, said: “Melanoma skin cancer can be deadly and it’s sadly on the rise in the UK. As well as continuing to call for urgent action on prevention, we’re delighted to see progress in innovative treatments and very much welcome the expansion of this vaccine trial.“The use of vaccines to treat melanoma is an exciting development and we will be encouraging eligible patients to take part in these groundbreaking trials with our up-to-date Melanoma TrialFinder so that vaccines can be understood and patients can locate trial centres to discuss with their medical teams.”Explore more on these topicsSkin cancerCancerVaccines and immunisationNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Two high-speed ballistic missiles, armed, Ukraine says, with cluster munitions, slammed into the heart of the border city in mid-morning as families went to church, waited for a theatre performance or were simply strolling about on a mild spring day.The death toll currently stands at 34, including two children. Images from the scene show bodies or body bags on the ground, a trolley bus and cars burnt out, rubble and glass scattered around. It was reckless, cruel and vicious and its consequences entirely predictable to those who gave the order and pressed “launch”.To contemplate a daytime city-centre attack, in the full knowledge that civilians will be present, reflects a Russian culture of impunity that has been allowed to endure without effective challenge. Nevertheless, Washington’s approach, underDonald Trump, has been to try to negotiate an end to the war by talking directly with Moscow, while remaining mostly silent on Russian attacks on civilians.Talks between the US and Russia have continued unabated over the past two months at a time when Russian attacks on Ukraine’s cities appear to have stepped up. Nine adults and nine children were killed whena Russian ballistic missile using cluster bombs struck a children’s playground in Kryvyi Rihat the end of last week.‘People were burned alive in their cars’: As peace talks falter, Ukrainians resign themselves to fighting onRead morePeople were burned alive in their cars and the bodies of children were found dead in the playground, yet the attack was weakly condemned by the US ambassador toUkraine, Bridget Brink, who, toeing the White House line, would not say the deadly missile was from Russia as she tweeted: “This is why the war must end.”Brink has since announced she will step down and been more forthright. On Sunday, the ambassador attributed the Sumy attack to Russia and repeated that it appeared cluster bombs had been used. But now that she is on her way out, it is easier for her to speak her mind while Russia’s Vladimir Putintoys with Trumpand the rest of the US administration in peace talks that have hardly developed in two months.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/APOn Friday, the Russian leader spent four hours in talks with Steve Witkoff, a donor real estate developer who has become a key Trump adviser on Ukraine as well as the Middle East. What they talked about is unclear, but reports suggest Witkoff has been pushing the idea that the quickest way to getRussiato agree a ceasefire in Ukraine is to force Kyiv to hand over the entirety of four provinces that are only partly occupied by Russia’s military, including the cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.The dissonance between the killing and destruction in Sumy on Sunday and the photographed handshake between Witkoff and Putin is all too evident to most observers. It is not clear why it should even be contemplated that Ukraine hand over territory (something that even the US cannot easily force on Kyiv) when Russia is willing to countenance daytime attacks on civilians.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Kremlin will ignore condemnation from European leaders and wait for the news cycle to move on – and will almost certainly continue to attack Ukrainian cities to little military purpose. Not only are drone attacks commonplace, but there are now concerns they are routinely being armed with cluster munitions, while almost every day one or two hard-to-intercept ballistic missiles are thrown into the deadly mix.In Kyiv, PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhopes that gradually Trump will realise Putin is not negotiating in good faith. Certainly, the attack on the centre of Sumy hardly suggests a strong appetite for peace. But it is unclear at what point, if any, the White House is prepared to conclude that killing of civilians means that it needs to put genuine pressure on Russia to negotiate rather than indulge the Kremlin.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaTrump administrationUS politicsVladimir PutinDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Whether she’s discussing menopausal hormone treatment (she’s on it), her libido (“It’s not what it was but [musician husband Ben Lee] and I have a really nice sex life”) or her ex Anthony Kiedis’s fondness for dating teenagers (“Why can’t you be with a grown-up?” she sighs), for 54-year-old Skye, there’s no such thing as too much information too early in the morning.Skye’s aptly named memoir, Say Everything, has been praised as raw, revealing, disarming and horny. “I definitely didn’t want to hurt people,” the actor says when we meet over breakfast at a cafe near her Sydney home. It’s just that between recounting her sexcapades with both male and female celebrities – “Writing a sex scene is so funny because I didn’t want it to be cringy, sleazy or too crass,” she laughs – Skye had a lot of past to surrender and guilt to process. It is, she says, also a cautionary tale for her two daughters.Her droll and self-aware memoir, which dishes on the private lives of heavyweights from Madonna to Gwyneth Paltrow to Robert Downey Jr, has captured the attention of everyone from Miranda July (“I gobbled it up,” she gushed) to 90s-curious gen Zers: “People are fascinated with what life was like out in the world without [smart]phones.”View image in fullscreenSkye with Keanu Reeves in the 1986 film River’s Edge, her first film role.Photograph: Hemdale/AllstarName-dropping comes naturally to this OG nepo baby. Skye, named for the island where she was conceived, is the daughter of the Scottish flower power singer Donovan, who left her mother, the US model Enid Karl, and Skye’s older brother, Dono, before Ione was born. Her mother’s previous boyfriends included Jim Morrison, Keith Richards and Dudley Moore but it was Donovan and his desertion that Karl never really got over as she struggled as a single mother (and occasional pot dealer) in Los Angeles. Skye didn’t meet her famous father until she was 17, in an awkward encounter her book recounts in farcical detail.Father and daughter have since reconciled but she is nervous about him reading the book, in which Donovan’s absence looms large. “I would always be an abandoned daughter, always searching for proof of love,” Skye writes – while explaining how she blew up her first marriage to theBeastie Boysrapper Adam Horovitz (AKA Ad-Rock) by cheating on him repeatedly.View image in fullscreenSkye with John Cusask in the 1989 film Say Anything.Photograph: Allstar/20th Century FoxGrowing up, Skye gravitated towards other daughters of famous fathers, including Karis Jagger, Amelia Fleetwood and the Zappa children. At 15 she quit school and became legally “emancipated”, taking up her first film role oppositeKeanu Reevesin the 1986 teen thriller River’s Edge.Skye always kept detailed personal journals and she has mined the juiciest material for her memoir. Some of her teenage antics read like a gen X schoolgirl’s wildest fantasies: there’s her (ultimately fruitless) pursuit of Reeves, who politely turns her down in his LA apartment one night after filming: “When I reached for his belt buckle, Keanu took my wrist, stopping me.” She canoodles with her good friend River Phoenix, develops a crush on her Say Anything co-star John Cusack (it won’t be consummated until years later), has a fling with theRed Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, then shacks up at 16 with his heroin-addicted bandmate, Anthony Kiedis, eight years her senior.View image in fullscreenWith Anthony Kiedis at the 1989 MTV Video Music awards.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicWhile Skye didn’t consider their age gap problematic at the time, she does now. The self-confessed “helicopter mum” says her “hackles rise” just imagining her 15-year-old daughter, Goldie, in her shoes. She also finds it curious that Kiedis continues to date much younger women. “If someoneneverhas a relationship with a woman their own age, that I do not understand,” she says. Neither Goldie nor Skye’s 23-year-old daughter, Kate, have read Say Everything yet, “but they know about my life,” Skye assures me, “and my destructive way I had sex.”The intense, unprotected sex she had with Kiedis “freaked” her out, as did the rock star’s serial unfaithfulness and jealous rages. She also writes that there was a HIV scare, an abortion Kiedis didn’t accompany her to and many fearful nights driving around LA searching for the singer when he disappeared on drug binges. “The need to save [Anthony] was an addiction in itself,” she writes.Then, at 18, Skye met “the first great love of my life”:Adam Horovitz,a man she describes as “a sweetie pie”. They soon moved in together and, for a while, life was “one long daydream”. The pair tied the knot when Skye was 21, just as the Beastie Boys’ star was rising, pulling Horovitz away on months-long tours. Skye “felt abandoned by his protracted absences”. Alone in LA, she began joyfully – but guiltily – exploring her bisexuality, first with the British model Alice Temple, then with two of Madonna’s exes, Ingrid Casares and Jenny Shimizu. (Strap-on sex with Shimizu, she writes, “made me needy and devoted. I wanted to be her dog, like in that Stooges song.”) Skye’s infidelities became more indiscreet. One day Horovitz arrived home from a tour to find her in flagrante in their back yard pool.Her anguish at hurting Horovitz is still apparent three decades on. “I secretly hope [reading my memoir] helps him and his family but I kind of know their personalities and I almost think it might be doing the opposite, unfortunately,” she says.View image in fullscreenSkye’s brother Dono Leitch, Adam Horovitz and SkyeDespite its promise to say everything, Skye’s memoir ends surprisingly early: in 2006, when she was in the throes of new lust with another “short king”, the Australian singer Ben Lee. They hadmet a decade beforewhen Lee’s band signed to the Beastie Boys’ record label. Skye describes the first time they had sex as “the best sex I’d had since Jenny” – but Lee, who had previously been in a long-term relationship with the actor Claire Danes, felt Skye was coming on too strong. “Whatever you’re feeling, I am not,” he tells her, curtly, after their first night together.‘I just realised at that moment: I want to laugh through life with this person’Read moreSkye and Lee married in 2008 in a Hindu wedding ceremony in India and had Goldie nine months later. “The way you father the girls has practically healed me,” she writes of Lee. Skye has been faithful throughout their marriage – something she felt necessary to include, because “people are going to wonder”.“I don’t feel I’m missing out,” she says. “I think I’m a little more straight than gay but, anyway, all I know is I’m happy and I’m not distracted and looking around.”The fact her memoir speeds over her last two decades with Lee was not due to any demands from him for privacy but because her publisher wanted it to end on “a bit of a cliffhanger”, leaving the door open for a sequel. And anyone craving a closer look at the couple’s life can tune into their weekly podcast,Weirder Together, in which they banter about family life, famous friends and their creative pursuits – from Lee’s music to Skye’s latest film roles.View image in fullscreenIn Sydney the ‘ghosts’ of Skye’s Hollywood past aren’t ‘in my face all the time’, she says.Photograph: Cybele MalinowskiMidway through our conversation, Skye’s megawatt smile lights up. She waves to someone across the courtyard. “Oh, Ben!” she exclaims. “You saw my location!” Lee walks over beaming, trailing the couple’s miniature long-haired dachshund, Gus, who is six months old today. “It’s his half birthday,” Lee coos as Skye scoops up her “baby boy”.Later I ask Skye if Lee’s rigorous touring schedule has ever brought up the same insecurities she felt with Horovitz.“Oh my god, yes!” she says. “When [Ben] would [leave LA and tour Australia] and especially when Goldie was little, I almost would have a full breakdown inside. It triggered so much for me. Luckily at that point I had emotional maturity and I knew to go to therapy and I knew to get help, and to communicate with Ben and other people about my feelings.”View image in fullscreen‘I was just like, “Oh my god, I might lose him”’ … Skye with her husband, musician Ben LeeAnother challenge early in their relationship was Lee’senmeshment in spiritual cults. There was an Indian guru (“I was really trying my hardest to be supportive but it was like having a whole other person [in the relationship],” recalls Skye), then a “more rigid” group involving a Peruvian leader and ayahuasca ceremonies. “That was scary, because I was just like, ‘Oh my god, I might lose him’ … not physically – but losing his mind into something.”There were parallels, Skye says, in trying to extricate Kiedis from heroin addiction and Lee from “fanaticism”. She was relieved when internal ructions in the ayahuasca group finally “snapped” her husband out of it.The couple live in Australia, where their daughters are studying. Sydney’s natural beauty inspires Skye to paint and she likes that the “ghosts” of her Hollywood past aren’t “in my face all the time”.But Hollywood hasn’t moved on just yet. Her friends are having fun imagining who might play Ione in a film adaptation of Say Everything, with Sofia Coppola suggesting the Saltburn actor Alison Oliver. I ponder, half-jokingly, whether the film wouldpass the Bechdel test. “Maybe not,” Skye muses. “Even when I’m in my big lesbian phase, I’m always thinking about Adam [Horovitz].”And nearly 40 years after he turned her down, there is one Hollywood ghost Skye hopes her memoir resurrects. “I would love for Keanu to [read it] and think it’s great,” she says, grinning.Say Everything by Ione Skye is out now in Australia (A$24.99 HarperCollins Australia), the UK (£22.00, HarperCollins) and the US (US$29.99 Simon & Schuster)Explore more on these topicsAutobiography and memoirKeanu ReevesJohn CusackRed Hot Chili PeppersCelebrityBeastie BoysinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They fascinated me because they were so different from the buildings around my home. One day, I asked my mom why they were so different. “They were built a long time before our home,” she said simply. I wasn’t satisfied. “But Grandpa’s house was built before ours, and it is in our same style. Why is that?!” Being a curious girl, I continued with my “why and how” questions. I wouldn’t stop until I understood.My mom had no other choice but to teach me a bit about Gaza’s architectural history, including how buildings differed from one era to another. As expected, it was difficult for a little girl to understand the new words. My mom tried using metaphors so I could grasp new ideas. “Gaza is like a human being, a person. A person begins small, then grows up over time to become old. It’s sort of the same with buildings; they are ‘born’ in one form, but their size and condition changes with time, until they are old and worn.” For me, that was clearer and more convincing!My fascination with historic, castle-like buildings grew. I was overwhelmed with joy whenever my class went on a school trip to visit these vestiges of our history. These school trips offered rare opportunities to walk inside the buildings and get to know them more intimately. The building that most fascinated me as a child was Qasr al-Basha, which local legend says was built by the 13th-century Mamluk sultan Zahir Baybars for a Gazan woman whom he fell in love with and married. Romantic, right?View image in fullscreenAspiring architect Eman Shawwa.Photograph: WANNWhile I was flipping through TV channels one day, I stumbled upon a documentary explaining how archaeologists study ancient buildings and try to prevent them from collapsing or eroding away. It seemed to me that these archaeologists were like surgeons, trying to prolong the lives of their elderly patients. They clean the worn stones and inject substances that prevent corrosion. The buildings embody the world’s history and so we must care for them. I couldn’t stop wondering why I didn’t see similar methods used to protect and preserve the historic buildings in Gaza City.As the days passed, I learned that, in Gaza, it’s the architects who care for old buildings. (I’ve since discovered that in more well-resourced countries, preservation is the province of specialists called conservators, with architects designing new or remodelled buildings.) I decided to become what I like to think of as a “surgeon for historic buildings”. So I started my studies at the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) in 2008 and I became an architectural engineer.While studying, I enrolled in every programme and organisation I could that was relevant to the preservation of Gaza’s architectural heritage. One of these is Iwan Center for Cultural Heritage at IUG that works to restore and preserve Gaza’s historic urban sites, trains professionals in the art and educates the public. As a member of the team there, I collected social and economic data for residents living in historic buildings, such as the number of family members and their employment status. When donor funds become available for renovation, we prioritise by need and the condition of the building.There are so many buildings falling down, with the walls eroding due to moisture and threatening to make residents homeless and with no protection from the cold of winter and the searing summers. I see now the need to spread awareness of the value of these structures to our heritage and what we can do, as a people, to save them. To be fair, there are quite a lot of renovated residential buildings, but sadly, the techniques have not always made them better; instead, sometimes erosion of the stone accelerates.View image in fullscreenThe Qasr al-Basha, or Pasha's palace, before it was damaged in the present conflict.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesOther buildings have been demolished by their owners who are unaware of, or don’t care about, their historic value. They do this to replace them with bigger houses that can accommodate a family’s expansion in one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Two million people live on 365 square kilometres. That’s 5,479 people per square kilometre. Our government is too poor to offer any financial support to owners of historic buildings. Something else I came to realise is that there is not enough experience in the field of architectural heritage preservation in Gaza. With so many life-or-death crises here, protecting buildings always ends up at the bottom of the government’s priority list.It’s also important to note that Gaza’s ancient buildings and heritage suffer first and foremost due to the Israeli blockade. The blockade prevents many construction materials from entering the Strip and any that make it in are immediately used to rebuild houses and essential public buildings destroyed by the Israelis’ relentless bombing. The siege is also the main obstacle to communicating and collaborating with any international experts and organisations.Sometimes I wonder how close we are to losing the architectural heritage of Gaza. If still-living souls, crying out from Gaza to the outside world, are barely heard, how will ancient stones fare any better before they erode away, taking with them the history of a city and a people? Will anybody hear their silent cries before it is too late? If you want to erase a nation, start with its history. Gaza City’s history is a big part of the history of Palestine, the Fertile Crescent and the Holy Land. We all need to care because it is a part of our human history.Eman remains in Gaza, and has been forced to relocate three times. She had been pursuing her master’s degree in business administration before the genocide began, but has been unable to complete her thesis (on entrepreneurship and the sustainability of startups in the Gaza Strip) due to the internet blackouts. She hasn’t felt safe enough to venture out to see what has happened to the historic buildings she loves so much, but she is aware of the statistics: “More than 60%of our buildings here have been destroyed. The rest are damaged to some degree.”Lubna AbuhashemA Palestinian woman takes chargeEvery morning, Amani Shaat starts her day at 9am by shopping for all the ingredients she needs for the day. Then she heads to her little street kiosk to cook beefburgers for the customers who keep her busy until almost midnight. Amani, 25, is the first woman in Gaza to work in a street kiosk. After she started her business, named Salt3 Burger, in January 2023, she was soon noticed by journalists and curious customers. “They were astonished to see a girl standing and cooking in a kiosk on the street. The number of burger patties I had prepared for two days finished after two hours,” she recalled happily.View image in fullscreenLubna Abuhashem.Photograph: WANNAmani’s route to her little kiosk overlooking the sea on al-Rasheed Street took a number of twists and turns. She started out working in a wedding dress shop, where the pay was poor. Four years ago, Amani and her husband travelled to Turkey, looking for better work. First, Amani worked in several factories, but then she found work that was more fulfilling: waitressing and cooking in different restaurants that offered western dishes. This is how she learned the recipe for beefburgers.While she prepared a burger meal for a customer in Gaza, Amani told me: “My life was stable enough in Turkey. I wasn’t planning to come back to Gaza. But my mother is very sick, and I wanted to be with her. Her treatment will last for a long time, so I started to think of what I could do for a living while staying close to her.” It was her dream to run her own fast-food business. She thought about starting up in a retail store in the university district, but there was a big problem: the rent was expensive and she had no money. And most of her customers would be university students who don’t have much money to spend. The situation looked hopeless until one day, when she was walking on al-Rasheed Street, she spotted an abandoned kiosk.She managed to locate the owner, Mahmoud Almuhtadi, who was running another kiosk next door. “I told him I want to rent this abandoned kiosk. He said he used it for storage,” recalled Amani. “Then he said, ‘You are a girl. What would a girl do in a kiosk?’ I told him the idea and he was impressed and said, ‘I will give you the kiosk and I will be your business partner.’” Not everyone in Amani’s life believed in her and many tried to discourage her from pursuing her fast-food dream. “People surrounding me told me I would fail in this as I had failed in everything else. So I was worried that all my efforts would be in vain because I wouldn’t be able to do it alone without support, especially since I didn’t have enough capital.”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian family prepare to break their fast during the first day of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan amid the ruins of their house in the central Gaza Strip in March last year.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesBut Amani was determined to give it a try. She knew she had two things on her side: one, in Gaza, beefburgers are only offered in restaurants where they are relatively expensive; and two, she could prepare the burger patties herself, according to her own recipe. Amani sells a burger without chips for seven shekels (£1.50) and a burger with chips for 10 shekels (about £2). Amani cannot contain her excitement about how successful her small business has become. “I was stressed out when the first customer came on opening day,” she recalled with a smile. “I work all day. I am exhausted. But when a customer tells me, ‘It is delicious’, I forget all the tiredness and I feel as if I am over the moon. I don’t know what my next step is. I don’t even have time to think about it. All that matters is that I am achieving what I have always dreamed of.”Lubna, her parents and sister were able to leave Gaza for Egypt three months into the war. Three siblings and their families remain in Gaza.Aya ZaqoutGaza, my homeland, we will rebuild you one dayMy name is Aya, and I am 23 years old. I have been an artist for 10 years. I also graduated as a dentist from Al-Azhar University in Gaza, in June 2023. I have long pursued both of my dreams. I now have an extensive collection of my artwork, in the hope of opening my own gallery. I already have participated in many exhibitions, but my dream was to “star” in a major solo show.Meanwhile, I spent five years studying dentistry, which also is a form of art. Enhancing someone’s smile, and thus making a difference in their life, has been incredibly fulfilling for me. However, the war on Gaza has drastically altered those plans. On 7 October, just two months into my year-long, postgraduate dental training, the Israeli occupation forces forced me to evacuate my home in northern Gaza and flee on foot to the south. Along the way, we were forced to pass through many army checkpoints. Israeli soldiers stood in a line along the path we walked, calling out names on microphones. They forced us to raise a white flag and show our IDs. They randomly selected young men and ordered them to strip off their clothes. I saw burned bodies strewn in the middle of the street.Aspiring artist Aya Zaqout.Photograph: WANNI will never forget that traumatic experience. I left behind all my paintings, along with the tools and supplies I need to create art. I also have had to halt my dental training, putting my entire career on hold. My university, the hospitals and the clinics where I trained are all destroyed. There is no life left to return to. My family and I were displaced twice more since then. Despite claims by the Israeli army that southern Gaza was a safe area, this was not true. Basic necessities were nearly impossible to find. Clean water was scarce, and aid from other countries was blocked by the Israeli army at the Rafah crossing, preventing it from reaching the general public.But the most painful reality for me was that it was the longest period I had ever gone without drawing. I desperately needed to create, but I could not find art supplies. All I had at hand was a pen and some white paper. I urgently needed to draw to relieve my stress, so I settled for those. To my surprise, the resulting drawing is the most beautiful art I had ever created! But it is also the most painful. It is a drawing of a woman’s face peering through a hole in the shape of Palestine, as if ripped in the paper, her eyes lifted to the heavens in agonised prayer.The woman is me. I titled itSearching for Homebecause, at that moment, what I yearned for most was home. And finding it felt like the most difficult, if not impossible, task. In April 2024, I talked with my family about the possibility of leaving Gaza to resume what the war had forced me to pause. My family have always been my biggest supporters. They love my artwork and eagerly await each new creation. They were also thrilled about my graduation from the faculty of dentistry and looked forward to being my patients. Thus, they wholeheartedly supported my decision to leave Gaza to complete my dental training and continue my artistic pursuits, believing I could then fulfil my dream of bringing smiles to others.You might wonder why we couldn’t all leave together. Leaving the Gaza Strip costs about £3,800 per person (to pay the “coordination fee” required by the Egyptians to cross the border). To save my family of eight, the total would be £30,000. This is an unachievable amount given the circumstances of the war and the halt in economic activity. Leaving my family behind was the hardest decision I’ve ever faced. So, I travelled to Egypt to save myself, while leaving my family behind in Gaza amid the ongoing war. I didn’t fully grasp the implications of this decision until I left, and my thoughts have been conflicted ever since.View image in fullscreenPalestinians with foreign passports wait for permission to leave Gaza, at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, 2023.Photograph: Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/ReutersI am considered a survivor, but what does survival mean if I am not with my family? What is the value of surviving if it means leaving them behind? Should anyone have to make that kind of sacrifice? It seems that to learn and build a future, a Palestinian must give up a great deal. Every day, I wake up feeling guilty. Was my decision the right one? When will the war end? Do I have the right to live a decent life while my family in Gaza endures such hardship? A Palestinian begins to question whether they have the right to a normal, “human” life. Nevertheless, I hold on to the hope that I can eventually bring my family here to join me. I’ve enrolled in a university and started to rebuild an artistic life. My painting,Searching for Home, travelled with me.Today marks three months in Cairo for me. I feel guilty and helpless every day. My communication with my family is very limited due to their weak internet connection. The lack of constant connection with them is difficult to bear. However, I remind myself that I travelled for their sake. My future is intertwined with theirs. I hope I can someday repay them for all they’ve done. Despite losing the paintings I spent 10 years creating, I remain committed to my dream of opening my own gallery. I believe I still have a lifetime ahead of me to achieve my goals, and I will make it happen. This is the nature of the Palestinian people. We are accustomed to losing, but also to surviving. Gaza, my homeland: it breaks my heart to see you in this state. You have always been the warm embrace that nurtured us, no matter the adversity. We love you in all your conditions – whether in peace or in war. We are committed to rebuilding you into a loving home once again. You deserve our loyalty, and we will remain steadfast. Your freedom is near, so do not fear.Aya is now in Egypt and is exhibiting her art at galleries abroad. Her family remain in Gaza but have not yet been able to return to the north. When they finally do, they know that there is really no home to return to. Their house, like so many others, no longer exists. Her goalis to reunite with her family in Cairo. But to bring them out of Gaza once the border opens, she needs a minimum of $10,000.Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaCreative writingextractsShareReuse this content"

Collaborating with the Rolling Stones in the early 1980s, he later opened a recording studio at his home in the Jamaican countryside, helping a younger generation of artists to come to prominence, including his daughter Xana and son Azizi.Born Maxwell Smith in 1944 in Alexandria, a hillside hamlet below Browns Town in northern Jamaica, he moved to Kingston at 10 years old to live with his father following his mother’s emigration, but clashed with his stepmother and absconded; moving between the disparate homes of extended family members, he was partly raised by strangers after enduring periods of homelessness. In the rocksteady era he began working as a record salesman for Ken Lack’s Caltone label and made his first set of recordings for the label fronting the Emotions harmony trio, the love song I’ll Buy You a Rainbow reaching the Jamaican Top 10 in March 1967.View image in fullscreenMax Romeo performs in Chicago, Illinois, August 1981.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesHis determined courtship of a local girl earned him the nickname Romeo and after the Emotions disbanded, he got his first taste of international fame through the ribald Wet Dream, produced by Bunny Lee, which hit the UK Top 10 in November 1969, despite a BBC ban for its suggestive lyrics. The saucy hit brought Romeo to London for his first overseas performances, including at the Caribbean Music Festival held at the Empire Pool with Desmond Dekker and Johnny Nash, the bulk of Romeo’s innuendo-laden debut album A Dream recorded in London with the Rudies backing band.Back in Jamaica, Romeo began focusing on social commentary, sometimes setting his lyrics to adapted folk songs or spirituals. Macabee Version referenced his newfound Rastafari faith and Black Equality attacked the Eurocentric mindset of postcolonial Jamaica; Chi Chi Bud used coded metaphors to decry the island’s pervasive inequalities. Appearing on the bandwagons that helped bring Michael Manley of the leftist People’s National party to power in 1972, Romeo recorded songs like Let the Power Fall and Press Along Joshua to signal his support for Manley’s vision, but when change was slow to come after Manley took office, Romeo responded with the critical No Joshua No.After working on the Revelation Time album with arranger Geoffrey Chung atLee “Scratch” Perry’s Black Ark studio in 1975, Romeo began working more concertedly with Perry, the single War Ina Babylon attracting Chris Blackwell’s interest; the resultant album of the same name was released by Island Records overseas, introducing Romeo to a broader international audience. The follow-up, Reconstruction, was self-produced, with the censorious Melt Away its most outstanding number, but the album was rapidly deleted after financial disputes and the momentum further interrupted when Romeo moved to New York to star in a musical called Reggae, which flopped at the box office. He was an uncredited backing vocalist on the Rolling Stones’ album Emotional Rescue in 1980 and Keith Richards subsequently appeared on Romeo’s Holding Out My Love To You, a crossover attempt that broadened his fanbase in Japan, but failed to ignite in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It was a fallow period for each of them and the meeting sparked a new determination to get back on track. Romeo abandoned the courier service he had run in New York for several years to make ends meet and returned to Jamaica shortly before the sensational success of the Prodigy’s Out Of Space, which sampled Chase the Devil, sparking renewed interest in his work; a decade later, Kanye West mined Chase the Devil for Jay Z’s Lucifer, cementing Romeo’s original in the global consciousness. In the interim, albums for Jah Shaka, Mafia & Fluxy and Mad Professor made him a regular on festival stages throughout Europe and North America; the studio he opened at his home in Treadways, near Linstead, enabled his children to launch their own musical careers.Max Romeo undertook his final tour in 2023, performing in 56 cities throughout Britian and Europe, shortly after he filed a $15m lawsuit against Universal Music Group and Polygram Publishing for unpaid royalties (the companies later sought to have it dismissed). I remember Max as pragmatic, politically engaged and open minded, a thoughtful person with a strong sense of humour whose obvious intelligence and drive belied a lack of formal education. He is survived by his wife, Charm, and several children.Explore more on these topicsReggaeJamaicaLee 'Scratch' PerryDance musiccommentShareReuse this content"

Some viewers thought it was a documentary, while others argued its harrowing depiction of post-apocalypticSheffieldshould not have been aired at all.View image in fullscreenA scene from Threads. Warp Films is developing an episodic TV drama based on the 1984 film.Photograph: Bbc/SportsPhoto/AllstarHowever, Mark Herbert, Warp’s chief executive, who grew up near South Yorkshire city and remembers the impact Threads had on the country, said he hoped the remake would highlight “the best of humanity and the worst of humanity” – which he regarded as another contemporary talking point.“I was born in Doncaster,” he said. “I grew up in a mining community, and Sheffield was about 15 miles away. I was 14, and I remember walking into school and everybody had seen it. People thought it was real. It had this real public-safety film vibe to it. They had budget limitations, so they had to use real public service and news footage.“It’s a different time now – we’re 40 years on – but it feels like the time is right for it. There’s also a bit of what people have brought up about our previous work, likeThis is England. Even the darkest stuff, it’s got a huge heart to it. And I think there is a huge heart in Threads that we can explore. It feels like enough time has passed that we can take that original and do something a bit bold, original and fresh with it.”It is early days for the project. No writer, director or cast have been signed up or announced. But the Warp team believe Threads provides echoes of Adolescence, in the story’s ability to display authenticity and heart in the most desolate of situations.With increasing concerns thatBritish stories may be squeezed outof TV drama as broadcasters search for hits that work worldwide, the Warp team also believe Threads can be another project set in a British city capable of drawing global audiences.“The way the original film was written and made, it absolutely had that voice of Sheffield,” Feller said. “And I think that’s the kind of place, again, where you find that very rounded heart to the storytelling.”There is no doubt taking on the project is a challenge. Jackson, who also produced the original film, said he suspected Threads was not enjoyable for most viewers – and should not have aimed to be. “I feel very strongly that it shouldn’t be entertaining,” he said. “To use something as important as nuclear war as a vehicle for entertainment is quite, quite wrong.”Herbert said projects focusing on realistic characters in a recognisable urban setting would attract and challenge viewers. “It’s that authenticity,” he said. “It really has to come from the page, from the characters. It’s a bit like my favourite gangster series,Gommorah, which is so specifically Naples. Yet it’s just mind-blowing – and then has characters that are different.“I’m quite attracted to slightly outsider stories.

I had arranged to go to an opera with a friend. She’s normally a chatty person but, when I got to our seats, she wasn’t saying anything. I asked her a few questions but she was monosyllabic in response.During the intermission we went out to the balcony. Again, I was trying to talk to her but she just wasn’t looking at me. I asked if she was OK – had I offended her in any way? That’s when she let go on a tirade. She didn’t like a comment I had made at a dinner party a few weeks earlier and told me she’d never invite me to her home again – or come to mine. I was so shocked because she was very angry and said some things that I thought were quite cruel. I had never been spoken to like that by anyone, let alone a friend. To make matters worse people were turning around to look at us, wondering what these two ladies were arguing about.Kindness of strangers: a woman lay on the road beside me, holding my hand until the ambulance cameRead moreI was obviously about to start crying so I put my drink down and walked away. I went into the toilet and, of course, once I got in there, I was in a flood of tears. I was really hurt. I thought, I’ll just have to get myself together and go home in disgrace, which was a shame because we were halfway through the opera – and I was really loving it!The venue staff must check the toilets at the end of the intermission to hurry people back to their seats, because an usher came in, heard me crying and asked through the cubicle door if I was OK. I said, look, I’ve just had a fight with a friend and I’m not going to go back in, but thank you very much. She left and I stayed there crying. A few minutes later she came back in and said she was worried about me. Then she made me an offer: she could take me to a seat in a different section of the theatre upstairs so that I wouldn’t have to go back to sitting with my friend. I said OK, yes, that would be really lovely.When I came out, I was still sniffling. This woman was so gentle and kind; she said, the opera has a very sad ending and I’m taking you to a very private section of the theatre so you can cry your heart out there!When someone gets stuck into you like that friend of mine did you feel a bit worthless. So to be cared for by this usher is something I’ll always remember. She could have been efficient in moving me along but she chose kindness.I’ve been back to the venue since and have looked out for that usher so that I can thank her. I hope to one day see her again so I can tell her I’ll always think of her fondly. It wasn’t the fact that she got me a seat in the theatre. It wasn’t the fact that I did get to see the second half of the opera. It was just the fact that she knew I was upset and cared enough to help.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

That creates a meteor shower, which is seen in the same part of the sky each year. The Lyrids appear to come from near the constellation Lyra, the harp, from which the shower gets its name.It is thought to be the oldest recorded meteor shower, with sightings documented in China in 687BC.When is it visible?The Lyrid meteor shower lasts for several days, with Bloomer noting the greatest period of activity is expected to be between 19 and 25 April, although meteors might be visible from early this week.The shower is best viewed in the northern hemisphere but can be seen in the southern hemisphere where the constellation of Lyra is visible.What’s the best way to look for meteors?Grab a blanket or deck chair, find somewhere dark, and set up your spot. Then glance up.Bloomer said the best time to view the shower in the UK is about 4-5am. He recommended facing east and then turning about 30 degrees towards the north-east, allowing the meteors to cut across your field of vision.You can also use star map apps on your phone to help locate the constellation of Lyra.What should I expect?As Bloomer noted, the Lyrids do not look like fireworks, but rather transient sparks of light – although occasionally larger pieces of debris burn up in the atmosphere resulting in bright, longer-lasting meteors known as fireballs.“There’s no real shortcut to it. You’ve got to let your eyes adjust to the dark, and you’ve got to keep at it,” he said. “The rate might only be 18 per hour.”Bloomer added that the meteors can come in fits and starts, and a flurry can be followed by several minutes without any. “And if you blink at the wrong time, you might miss that one,” he said. “So it’s quite a personal experience because you’ve no time to alert anybody to it.”Indeed, when it comes to viewing the skies, it seems the most important tool is patience.“You just have tobliss out a little bit, or be a bit Zen and just look at the sky,” said Bloomer.Explore more on these topicsMeteorsAstronomySpaceexplainersShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Tim Grist Photography/Getty ImagesA stroll around historic buildings, cemeteries and winding back streets can lift your spirits just as effectively as communing with nature, according to author Annabel Streets. Let’s put that to the test …ByAnita ChaudhuriSun 13 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTShareWhen I arrange to meetAnnabel Streets, the appropriately named author of a new book, The Walking Cure, I’m presented with a challenge. She wants me to choose a London location I am unfamiliar with, so I can experience her ideas about the upsides of urban landscapes. In the book, Streets contemplates the powerful impact walking can have on our mood, thoughts and emotions, and how this can differ according to where and how we walk. While most people are aware of the benefits of walking in nature, Streets makes the case for urban environments, known as “brown spaces” by developers. Surprisingly, churches, convents and cemeteries, all of which are found in cities, often offer a superabundance of wildlife. A study in one Berlin cemetery found 604 species, 10 of which were rare or endangered.Streets believes it is in cities that our collective ingenuity is most obvious. I haven’t exactly been basking in astonishment lately, unless you count feeling astonishingly grumpy.The trouble is, I have lived and worked in central London for decades and so I struggle to come up with anywhere new. Streets suggests we start at St Mary Aldermary, a City of London church I am unfamiliar with, near Mansion House tube station. The Christopher Wren edifice, rebuilt in 1682 following theGreat Fire of London in 1666, looks unremarkable as I approach along a narrow street, fighting through hordes of City workers on their lunch breaks.When I step across the threshold, I am astonished. Not only is it an architectural gem, it is also a cafe and community hang-out. People sit in the pews, typing away on laptops or contemplating the glorious stained glass.“Isn’t it amazing?” says Streets. She looks pleased when I say I used to work a 10-minute walk away and never noticed the church. In fact, she has chosen it for a reason. Researchers have identified a wellbeing boost known as “the cathedral effect” which occurs when we have a lot of space above our heads. “That could be an expanse of sky, when you’re in a remote location or at the top of a hill,” says Streets. “But it could also be a cathedral or high-ceilinged church like this one. Researchers found that people had more empathy and compassion, and think more creatively, in such environments.” As we chat, I feel my shoulders drop and my mood lift.View image in fullscreenPeople relax in the cafe at St Mary Aldermary church in the City of London.Photograph: Godong/AlamyStreets’ last book was called52 Ways to Walk. It came about almost by accident when she was working on another project,Windswept, in which she explored the effect of landscape on creative women includingGeorgia O’KeeffeandGwen John. In the process, she unearthed a trove of scientific research devoted to the benefits of walking.What is it about walking that is so good for us? “Human beings were designed to walk and not just a stroll on a sunny day in a beautiful landscape,” she says. “When we walk, we produce biochemicals which are so powerfully life-affirming that scientists have described them as ‘hope molecules’”. You can gain the same effects from any other kind of brisk movement, but the great benefit of walking is you can do it pretty much anywhere and it doesn’t usually end in injury (I write as someone who has only recently completed running-related ankle rehab).When Streets was growing up in rural Wales, neither of her parents drove, so walking miles was a necessity. Small wonder then that she now encourages people to consider walking in less than ideal conditions: in the cold, the rain, mud and – unthinkably – while hungry.As a teenager, she rebelled and bought a Fiat which she drove everywhere, even to the gym.Walkingwas abandoned until her first year at university in Norwich. “I nursed my grandfather through cancer. I had barely settled into university and everyone else was out partying. After he died, it was really hard. And suddenly I found myself yearning for mountains. I had hardly been up a hill in my life. I took a year out and went walking in the Himalayas, the biggest mountains I could think of.”After three months she came home, ready to return to her old life. “But why was I so desperate for mountains and why did they do me so much good? Some people say you yearn for the landscape you grew up in during times of trouble, but I grew up beside the sea. Then, when I was researching the book, I discovered that when we are at high altitudes, we produce a hormone called erythropoietin . That hormone is now being investigated as an antidepressant. So I look back at that period and wonder: did my body know what it needed?”Does Streets have any theories about why walking outdoors should have a particular impact on our mental state? “Evolutionary biologists think it was once a survival mechanism – when we ran from danger, our brain had to be as efficient as our body. We needed to recognise our location, recall places of refuge, rapidly determine whether to climb a tree, change direction, pick up a rock, slow down or speed up. Escape has always required as much brain as brawn, as much intellect as speed.”As part ofsocial prescribing, some NHS Trusts now prescribe walking in nature as a way to help people improve their mental and physical health. But Streets is keen to raise awareness about the virtues of built-up environments.View image in fullscreenAnnabel Streets … ‘Cities relax us because they distract us from our own ruminating minds.’Photograph: Kate Peters/The Observer“I love the opportunities for surprise,” she says, leading me out of the church, down winding backstreets. We walk past a bronze statue of The Cordwainer by Alma Boyes, its panel explaining the ward’s medieval roots as a centre for shoe-making. Further along, we see the dome of St Paul’s Cathedral looming up ahead. “Urban spaces are often much more stimulating and energising than more remote landscapes,” says Streets. “Unless marred by too much noise, pollution and traffic, cities can perk us up, pique our curiosity and trigger our imagination. Yes, you can walk in a park or through mountains and feel wonderfully calm, but there are few signs of human endeavour. Cities relax us as much, if not more, because humans are fascinated by each other and the things we have created. They encourage us to get out of our own heads and distract us from our own ruminating minds.”We duck down a side street and peer through the window of Khops in Bow Lane. Founded in 1845, it claims to be London’s oldest barber. The patrons look back at us, bemused, so we beat a retreat, pausing to examine an intriguing sign outside a defunct bar. “The Four Sisters,” reads Streets. “I wonder who they were? That’s the thing about city walks – they are full of mysteries and adventures.”She leads me down into the 11th-century crypt of another Wren church, St Mary-le-Bow. We linger, reading ancient inscriptions about the long deceased. It’s unnerving to contemplate these long-ago lives while the city thrums above our heads.“Now open that door,” urges Streets. I push hard and stumble into a brightly lit room, narrowly avoiding a collision with a waiter bearing a tray of lunch. We are in the bustling Cafe Below and Streets looks gleeful. “You weren’t expecting that, were you?” she says, laughing. I begin to see what she means about the energising benefits of surprise. I experience a childlike thrill, like stepping into Narnia. It’s a feeling I haven’t had for a long time. When you have lived in the same place for ages, you can become jaded.I go to cemeteries a lot because you don’t always want to be in a happy place or moodStreets tells me abouta studywhich found that historical walks are as psychologically restorative and calming as green walks, if not more so. The research focused on the particular benefits of cultural heritage sites and how their aesthetics impact the brain.She also flags up a related paper, which I find later. Sam Cooley, a psychologist at the University of Leicester,co-authored a studywhich echoed the finding that walks in green spaces do not appear to provide more benefits than urban walks. Rather, these walks provide different benefits at different times. “For example, two people may be wandering through a beautiful and remote nature reserve,” writes Cooley, “while not connecting with any of the surrounding wildlife, instead focused on the benefits of their social interaction. At the same time, another person may be walking the busy city streets and experience a connection with a single, resilient weed they spot growing in the concrete.”This is all marvellous, of course, and I’m glad there is science to back up the fun we are having. But it is hard to imagine how I might allow myself the time and space to repeat the exercise regularly. What does Streets do herself? “I start each week by thinking, OK, what do I need this week? Do I need space? Do I need the comfort of trees? Do I need to be in a more enclosed space? Do I need to be near water? The more you learn to listen to your body, the more you will learn where your body wants to be. Do you want to be somewhere green, do you want to be somewhere historic? Do you want to be in the cemetery? I go to cemeteries a lot because you don’t always want to be in a happy place or mood.”View image in fullscreenTunnel vision … a study has shown that any kind of walking boosts creativity by 60%.Photograph: coldsnowstorm/Getty ImagesThere is a whole chapter in Streets’ book devoted to walking in cemeteries. In any new place, she says, her first visit is usually to the local graveyard because they are a window into the culture and history of a community. “Among the headstones of history, we see ourselves as we are – a fleeting moment in the endless passage of time, a cluster of cells that, like everything else, will one day return to the earth. Whether we return from a cemetery walk with a feeling of gratitude, awash in gentle melancholy or with a fresh sense of purpose, is up to us,” she writes.We take a quick look inside St Mary-le-Bow and marvel at how one person, Christopher Wren, could lay claim to the design of so many buildings. Then Streets leads me into the glass and chrome nightmare of the One New Change shopping centre, before we skirt round the gorgeous blossoms outside St Paul’s Cathedral and stroll down Fleet Street.After an afternoon with Streets, I have experienced for myself the upside of a relaxed urban walk. Not only is this a gentler way to hit your daily step count than running, I do feel genuinely energised.The good news is that if, like me, you are a fair-weather walker or unable to get outside for a stroll for any other reason, indoor walking still has clear benefits. Marily Oppezzo, now a behavioural and learning scientist at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, compared how walking on a treadmill or outdoors affects our creativity. Crucially,her studyalso compared walking with sitting still both inside and outside. Walking on a treadmill in a small room still achieved good results. In fact, any type of walking boosted people’s creativity by an average of 60% compared with not moving, no matter the location.Streets and I end our walk on a bench in a tranquil square in the Inner Temple, one of the four Inns of Court. And yes, you guessed it,there is a studythat reveals the cognitive benefits of strolling round urban squares …The Walking Cure by Annabel Streets is published by Bloomsbury, £14.99.

Mary, Vicky, Annie and Bessie are the mighty blast furnaces, though only two are still in action. Jubilation broke out in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire council leader Rob Waltham told me, still exhausted from striving to keep the steelworks open. “I’ve just been talking to a family with three generations all working there,” he said. “It’s all the family’s earnings, all about to lose their jobs at once. The eldest retires next week, really afraid his pension might have gone.”Such was the suspicion of Chinese owners Jingye that workers blockaded the plant on Saturday morning to stop executives entering; they were reportedly worried that they might sabotage the works as theemergency bill in parliamentwas stripping away their power. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told the Commons how negotiations with the owners had come to naught: he said it had become “clear that the intention of Jingye was to refuse to purchase sufficient raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running.” In the Lords, John Reid, former defence and home secretary, blamed Boris Johnson for recklessly allowing British Steel to be sold to a company in a hostile state. “Did it never occur to anyone,” he asked sardonically, “that it may be, in a competitive world, in the interest of the Chinese government to purchase and then close down the British steel industry?”Waltham says 20,000 Scunthorpe peopleare dependent on the plant. As the Commons debated the bill, he was talking to the owner of a firm with 200 people working inside it on a maintenance contract. “It might have finished a small company,” he said. Full nationalisation of British Steel is near-certain, but couldn’t be done in one parliamentary day.Eight years leader of the council, Waltham is theConservative candidatein next month’s elections for the new Greater Lincolnshire mayoralty. But he has no ideological qualms about nationalisation, a word that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown never dared utter,using euphemismswhen they were forced to nationalise Railtrack, the precursor to Network Rail, in 2002. Waltham says: “Government intervention here was inevitable, I always said so. When a market fails, there’s no choice and other essential heavy industries under pressure may need the government too.” That echoes Reynolds telling the Commons that most of Britain’s “foundation industries” were in “substantial difficulty” when Labour took office. While Tories postured loudly in the Commons about needing a one-year sunset clause to end these unwelcome emergency powers, Waltham was telling me the government needs to run the plant for three years or more to transition to electric arc furnaces.‘I have spent my life in this corner of Lincolnshire and witnessed how such job losses affect every part of a community’Read moreThis government is not allergic to the notion of public ownership. Blair had madeditching clause IVhis emblem of “newness”, abandoning the Labour party’s commitment to “the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange”. The Starmer government will say it’s “pragmatic”, quite rightly. But the dilemmas are hard, even if not ideological. The epic failure of Margaret Thatcher’s privatisations are plain for all to see, but she’s not here to castigate. Public support hassoaredfor bringing rail, mail, electricity and buses back into public ownership, reaching 82% for water. Privatisation has left Thames Water£16bn in debtand withdecrepit machinery. Should the state really take on heavily indebted, loss-makers that swallow up funds for public services, if a company will shoulder some of the risk? Yet there should be a healthy suspicion of any company stepping forward: private equity group KKR istop of the bidding for Thames, so someone clearly thinks there’s money in our sewage. Ditto any other bidder for British Steel after a series of short-lived, dud owners.What is the “pragmatic” solution whenScunthorpe is reported to be losing £700,000 a day? As in their manifesto,Labour has £2.5bn set asideto revive the steel industry, but that could be drained fast. Rousing patriotic words rang through the Commons on the need for a “sovereign” steel industry to defend us from a wildly uncertain world:speaking on Sunday, Reynolds admittedthe raw materials might not arrive in time to save it.“At the heart of this debate is actually a very simple question – can we entrust a critical national asset to a company that we do not trust? … In a world where threats to our economic security multiply each day, we cannot allow that risk to fester at the heart of our industrial core,” wentLiam Byrne’s eloquent tub-thumper,as chair of the Commons business and trade select committee. Just before the debate, reading the emergency steel bill’s wording, he said to Reynolds, only half-joking, that he would add an amendment removing the word “steel” so these commanding powers could be used for any industry in the national interest.Our nationalisation phobia has handed state assets over to foreign governments to make handsome profits that should have been ours. The French and Italian statesown chunks of our railway companies, while nearly half our offshore wind capacity iscontrolled by foreign state-owned entities, including Denmark and Norway. If they can make them turn a profit, why not our own government? Thatcher’s mystical belief that private is always more efficient died long ago.The world has indeed changed and the government needs to be alert to all the shifting moods in the air. It must stop respecting outdated shibboleths, speed up a radical industrial strategy – and urgently reopen the trade routes to Europe that would support many more workers. Reynolds ended his speech with “Take back control!” A clear signal of intent for a newly activist, interventionist state.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBritish SteelOpinionLabourSteel industryManufacturing sectorcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s what fuels support for even incompetent regimesSun 13 Apr 2025 07.20 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 12.39 EDTShare“He’s really gone and done it this time. Now everyone can see what a disaster he is.” How many times have we heard this about Donald Trump? And how many times has it been proved wrong? Well, maybe this time he really has overstepped. After all, his clowning around with tariffs, sparking trade wars, then suddenly reversing his position, couldprovoke a global recession, perhaps even a depression. Surely his supporters will disown him? But I’m not banking on it, and this is why.Already, Trump has waged war on everything that builds prosperity and wellbeing: democracy,healthy ecosystems, education, healthcare, science, the arts. Yet, amid the wreckage, and despite some slippage, his approval ratingsstill hold between 43 and 48%: far higher than those of many other leaders. Why? I believe part of the answer lies in a fundamental aspect of our humanity: the urge to destroy that from which you feel excluded.This urge, I think, is crucial to understanding politics. Yet hardly anyone seems to recognise it. Hardly anyone, that is, except the far right, who see it all too well.Inmany parts of the world, and theUS in particular, inequality has risen sharply since the late 1970s. (The UKtracks this trend.) The world’s billionairesbecame $2tn richerlast year, while the number of people living below the global poverty line is more or less unchanged since 1990.There isstrong evidenceof a causal association betweengrowing inequality and the rise ofpopulist authoritarian movements. A paperin the Journal of European Public Policyfound that a one-unit rise in the Gini coefficient (a standard measure of inequality) increases support for demagogues by 1%.Why might this be? There are various, related explanations:feelings of marginalisation,status anxietyandsocial threat, insecurity triggeringan authoritarian reflexand aloss of trust in other social groups. At the root of some of these explanations, I feel, is something deeply embedded in the human psyche: if you can’t get even, get mean.In the US, a high proportion of the population is excluded from many of the benefits I’ve listed. Science might lead to medical breakthroughs, but not, perhaps, for people who can’t afford health insurance. A university education might open doors, but only if you’re prepared to carry tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. Art and theatre and music improve our lives: good for those who can buy the tickets. So do national parks, but only if you can afford to visit them.Democracy, we are told, allows people a voice in politics. But only, it seems, if they have a few million to give to a political party. As the political scientist Prof Martin Gilensnotes in his book Affluence and Influence: “Under most circumstances, the preferences of the vast majority of Americans appear to have essentially no impact on which policies the government does or doesn’t adopt.” GDP growth was strong under Joe Biden, but as the economics professorJason Furman points out: “From 2019 to 2023, inflation-adjusted household income fell, and the poverty rate rose.” GDP and social improvement are no longer connected.All those good things? Sorry, they’re not for you. If you feel an urge to tear it all down, to burn the whole stinking, hypocritical, exclusive system to the ground, Trump is your man. Or so he claims. In reality his entire performance is both a distraction from and an accelerant of spiralling inequality. He can hardly lose: the more he exacerbates inequality, the more he triggers an urge for revenge against his scapegoats: immigrants, trans people, scientists, teachers, China.But suchkiller clownscan’t pull this off by themselves. Their most effective recruiters are centrist parties paralysed in the face of economic power. In hock to rich funders, terrified of the billionaire media, for decades they have been unable even to name the problem, let alone address it. Hence the spectacular uselessness of the Democrats’response to Trump. As the US journalistHamilton Nolan remarks: “One party is out to kill, and the other is waiting for its leaders to die.”In the UK, Labour, like the Democrats, has long assured itself that it doesn’t matter how wide economic disparities are, as long as the poorest are raised up. Now it has abandoned even that caveat:we can cut benefits, so long as GDP grows. But it does matter. It matters very much. A vast array of evidence, brought together in 2009 inThe Spirit Levelby Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett andupdated in 2024, shows that inequality exerts a massive influence on social, economic, environmental and political outcomes, regardless of people’s absolute positions.If there is a such a thing as Starmerism, it collapses inthe face of a paperpublished by the political scientists Leonardo Baccini and Thomas Sattler last year, which finds that austerity increases support for the radical right in economically vulnerable regions. Austerity, they found, is the key variable: without it, less-educated people are no more likely to vote for rightwing demagogues than highly educated people are. In other words, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are busily handing their core constituencies to Nigel Farage.Of course, they deny they’re imposing austerity, using a technical definition thatmeans nothing to those on the sharp end. Austerity is what the poor experience, while they must watch the rich and upper middle classes, under a Labour government, enjoy ever greater abundance.Starmer and his minions suggest there’s nothing they can do: wealthy people are already taxed to the max. As private jets and helicopters cross the skies,anyone can see this is nonsense. Of all the remarkable things I stumbled across while researching this column, the following is perhaps the most jaw-dropping. Onthe most recent (2022) figures, once benefits have been paid, the Gini coefficient for gross income in the UK scarcely differs from the Gini coefficient for post-tax income. In other words, the gap between the rich and the poor is rougly the same after taxes are levied, suggesting that taxation has no further significant effect on income distribution. How could this possibly be true, when the rich pay higher rates of income tax? It’s because the poor surrender a much higher proportion of their income in sales taxes, such as VAT. So much for no further options. So much for Labour realism.The one thing that can stop the rise of the far right is the one thing mainstream parties are currently not prepared to deliver: greater equality. The rich should be taxed more, and the revenue used to improve the lives of the poor. However frantically centrist parties avoid the issue, there is no other way.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistThe Invisible Doctrine: The Secret History of Neoliberalism, by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, was published in paperback earlier this monthExplore more on these topicsInequalityOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

The suffering of the women and babies – an estimated 170,000 of them – who were incarcerated and abused in the Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes that housed “fallen women” is one such story. It is a scandal that is difficult to read about without experiencing an overwhelming feeling of disgust, from the testimonies of abuse and forced adoption, to themass graveat the former St Mary’s mother-and-baby home near Tuam, County Galway, which contained 796 bodies of babies and children. The nuns put many of them in a septic tank. There were no burial records.The efforts of survivors, campaigners and historians to bring these stories to light in the face of obstruction and indifference has beenthe work of decades. The Irish government made a formal apology in 2021 after a judicial commission report. Yet this story, and the human misery it has caused, is not over: the last home closed in 1996. There are living survivors, and people who are descended from the victims. The exhumation of the children’s remains, so that they can be identified if possible and given a proper burial, is continuing. And then there is the question of redress.This week, it was reported that, of the eight religious organisations linked to Ireland’s mother-and-baby homes,only twohave offered to contribute to a survivor redress scheme. The Sisters of Bon Secours – the order that presided over the septic tank mass grave – offered €12.97m (about £11m), while the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul has proposed contributing a building to the scheme. A third religious body – the Sisters of St John of God – declined to contribute, saying there was “no legal or moral” basis to do so as there was “no evidence that our sisters there acted in any untoward manner”, but offered a donation to survivors.The other five – the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, the Legion of Mary and the (Anglican) Church ofIreland– made no offer. They gave various reasons – or excuses, depending on your viewpoint. Ireland’s children’s minister, Norma Foley, expressed her disappointment, saying that, while the state had admitted its role in the scandal, more should have been done by the church and the religious organisations.While public expression by the state of its culpability has been explicit and categorical, the remorse expressed on the religious side has been less clear-cut. Past statements from the orders involved such as “with deep regret … we acknowledge that there are women who did not experience our refuge as a place of protection and care” and “it is regrettable that the Magdalene homes had to exist at all” lack a certain tone of regret, shall we say. The Good Shepherd Sisters, as they are now known, have made particularly impressive use of grammatical gymnastics over the years (“We sincerely regret that women could have experienced hurt and hardship”). Perhaps most shocking was this: “It was part of the system and the culture of the time.”Nothing from the nuns, or the Catholic church, has really come close to expressing true remorse. A “definitive” apology in 2021 from Eamon Martin, Ireland’s most senior church figure, was worded thus: “I accept that the church was clearly part of that culture in which people were frequently stigmatised, judged and rejected. For that, and for the longlasting hurt and emotional distress that has resulted, I unreservedly apologise.”Yet the church wasn’t just part of that culture. Itwasthe culture, saturating every aspect of life in Ireland, shaping public attitudes towards women and their babies, encouraging their shaming and ostracising. Some campaigners have called for church assets to be seized unless the institution contributes to a state-run redress scheme.Without a true acknowledgment of the pain that has been caused, how do you begin to move on from something so traumatic? Yes, there have been memorial events and gardens – in Dublin, a journey stone monument was unveiled in 2022, and the National Centre for Research and Remembrance is to hold records related to the institutional trauma, with a museum and exhibition space. Culturally, the scandal has been intelligently and sensitively revisited, from the novella and film Small Things Like These to the BBC drama The Woman in the Wall, and Sinéad O’Connor’s previously unreleased The Magdalene Song. Liam Neeson is collaborating with Catherine Corless – the amateur historian who devoted many hours to painstaking research into St Mary’s, and who battled on heroically despite widespread indifference when she tried to make the mass grave public – on a film, The LostChildrenof Tuam.There is no chance of these children and their mothers being forgotten now, and that is meaningful. I was too young when I saw in 2002 The Magdalene Sisters, a drama which gave me a lifelong aversion to Irish nuns, so repugnant and sadistic was their behaviour towards the vulnerable women in their control. Being the granddaughter of a woman who was once tarred as “illegitimate” – the bald cruelty of this term, of the thought of labelling a baby thus, is enough to bring tears to your eyes – perhaps led to my interest in this dark chapter of Irish history. My grandmother was born in a mother-and-baby home, but in Wales. It was no picnic, but had she been in Ireland – the country of her suspected father – even greater miseries would have awaited her.The treatment of children born out of wedlock in Ireland as “an inferior subspecies” – then taoiseach Enda Kenny’s words in 2014 – and the humiliation to which they were subjected is a stain on the church’s history. Corless said in interview at the time that she had lost respect for the Catholic church. She is by no means alone in that.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How long will the world tolerate this?Arwa MahdawiWhat is happening is, quite simply, annihilation. Yet our politicians keep funding it and media outlets normalize itSun 13 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 05.01 EDTShareWhere do I even start? In recent weeks I’ve sat down to try and write aboutGazaand, every time I steel myself to write about one atrocity, another atrocity is committed. Palestinian journalists have beenburned alive, babies havefrozento death, medics have beenexecutedand buried in mass graves, kids are being killed in their sleep. Meanwhile, in the US andGermany, speaking out about dead Palestinian babies can land you on adeportation list. Arguing that international human rights law should be respected can put you at risk of beingsnatched off the streetand stuck in a detention centre.I don’t know where to start and I don’t know what is really left to say at this point. After 18 months of endless carnage, it should be clear to everyone that this is not a war. That this is not self-defence. What is happening in Gaza is, quite simply, annihilation. A litany of genocideexpertshave stated this. Respected international organizations likeAmnesty Internationalhave concluded that Israel is committing genocide – and yet our politicians are still funding this.Palestinians aren’t just being exterminated with US-supplied bombs. The more insidious killer now is disease and starvation. On 2 March – more than a month ago – Israel cut off supplies to Gaza in an attempt to change the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Calling this an “aid blockade”, as headlinestend to do, doesn’t do justice to the horror of what is happening: this is not an “aid blockade” so much as it is a starvation campaign.Gaza, after all, has been reduced to rubble; it’s not like there is food growing in the strip that people can rely on. An analysis of satellite imagery by the UN in November found that more than 90% of cattle had died and about 70% of land for crops in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged since the beginning of thisiteration of the war in the territory.Water is also being used as a weapon of war. In early March, a week after stopping any food or other humanitarian supplies from getting into Gaza, Israelcut off the electricity supplyto Gaza’s main operational desalination plant. The situation now could not be more desperate. “Gaza is a killing field, and civilians are in an endless death loop,” the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said onTuesday.This is not an ‘aid blockade’ so much as it is a starvation campaignEmboldened byDonald Trumpand his visions of building hotels and casinos on top of these killing fields, Israel is not even trying to hide its aims any more. It wants to rid Gaza of Palestinians andannex the West Bank. And it will starve, kill and terrorize Palestinians until they “voluntarily” agree to leave en masseto somewhere like Sudan or Somalia– those being a couple of the countries the US and Israel have recently floated as potential relocation areas.“We will see to the general security in the Gaza Strip and will allow the realization of the Trump plan for voluntary migration,” Benjamin Netanyahurecently said. “This is the plan. We are not hiding this and are ready to discuss it at any time.”The deputy parliament speaker Nissim Vaturi, meanwhile, recently went on Kol BaRama radio, to call for the Gazafication of the West Bank. “We need to separate the children and women and kill the adults in Gaza. We are being too considerate,”Vaturi said. “We will soon turn Jenin [in the West Bank] into Gaza,” he added.If this is the first time you’ve seen this statement, by the way, it’s because it wasn’t covered by the same mainstream western outlets that have devoted thousands of words to asking if a college student saying “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is a call for genocide. Although, to be fair, if the western media did cover every publicincitement to genocidemade by Israeli politicians and thought leaders, then there would be no space to cover anything else.View image in fullscreen‘I’m writing this not because I hope to change any minds, but because the only power I have – the only power that many of us have – is to continually raise our voices and say that we do not consent to this.’Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesRather than calling out these incitements, certain elements of the media seem keen to normalize the people making them. Last month, for example, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s former defense minister, joined the ADL for a fireside chat in New York withCNN’s Bianna Golodryga. The international criminal court, let me remind you, hasissued an arrest warrantfor Gallant for war crimes. The court found “reasonable grounds” to believe Gallant and Netanyahu “bear criminal responsibility for the following crimes as co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”. CNN, I should note, has done some excellentreportingon Gaza. But for the network to sit down for a cozy “fireside chat” with Gallant – while Palestinian journalists are being burned alive, no less – is appalling.One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This by Omar El Akkad review – a cathartic savaging of western hypocrisy over GazaRead moreNormally, when I write an opinion piece, it feels like I’m having a little tete-a-tete with the reader. But I don’t really know who I’m writing this piece for. If you’ve read up to here then there’s a good chance you already agree with me, that you’re already appalled by what’s happening and that you’re using your own voice as best you can. And if you are not devastated at this point, then there is simply no convincing you to care.I have written a lot of op-eds where I’m essentially just begging people – including some of my colleagues in the western media – to give a damn about Palestinian suffering. To remember that Palestinians are humans too. To remember that starving civilians is a war crime, one which should not be sanitized with the passive voice and obfuscating language. To understand that this isn’t some distant foreign policy issue: this genocide is US-taxpayer funded. Meanwhile,unprecedented attemptsto suppress free speech in the US on Palestine have turned this into a domestic issue.I’m done begging people to care about Palestinians now. I’m writing this not because I hope to change any minds, but because the only power I have – the only power that many of us have – is to continually raise our voices and say that we do not consent to this.“One day, when it’s safe, when there’s no personal downside to calling a thing what it is, when it’s too late to hold anyone accountable, everyone will have always been against this,” thejournalist Omar El Akkadwrote. When that day comes, nobody can pretend they didn’t know.Explore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationBenjamin NetanyahuWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

You had to go to the cinema to see films in those days, when small boys ran barefoot on a conveyor belt to turn the reels, and it’s possible I watched its depiction of a family torn apart by violence, resentment, alcoholism and sexual abuse in horror while crunching popcorn, eating hotdogs and drinking a big bucket of Fanta ™ ®. No wonder I was sick on the old Danish woman next to me. Luckily, in Denmark, being vomited on by a stranger is considered good luck, and we began a torrid affair.But I watchedFestenagain in my 50s and found it hilarious, laughing out loud at its grim affirmation of bleak inevitability. But the film hadn’t changed. So what had the world done to me in the intervening years to make my sense of humour so black? Or had all that bacon and pastry I ate in the 00s somehow made me more sensitive to the Danish sensibility? Similarly, once I drank only Yorkshire Tea for a week and briefly became both resentful and ingenious.On Monday night, I made my once-a-decade attempt to enjoy Sam Peckinpah’s flawed 1973 revisionist westernPat Garrettand Billythe Kid, in which all the women are semi-naked prostitutes or ex-prostitutes in clothes, and yet it’s the morals of all the respectable and fully clothed men that are really up for sale. Get it? Screenwriter Rudolph Wurlitzer is asking, who are the real prostitutes?Meanwhile,Bob Dylanwanders about as a character called Alias, who doesn’t seem to know where he is, who he is, or what he ought to do. The teenage me found this frustrating, but to this 57-year-old man Alias’s blank-faced acceptance of fate seems like a rational response to 2025. Is it possible to get post-traumatic stress disorder by looking at a succession of internet memes of penguins complaining about tariffs?Indeed, this time around Peckinpah’s mangled masterpiece made the most sense to date. Billy the Kid represents American freedoms under attack from big business, namely the cattle barons to whom people’s rights and lands are dispensable. And the lawman Pat Garrett has to decide whether to do the right thing, or bend the knee to tyranny to survive, like Keir Starmer, and to get rich, like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Snoop Doggy Dogg.(Now there are no ideals or ethics in American politics, if there ever were, and everything is nakedly transactional, where once geopolitical powerplays were disguised as altruism. Here. Have these Jackson Pollock paintings. They will invalidate socialist realism. Here. Have these blankets. They contain smallpox spores and it’s cold on the reservation. Sleep well.)When I wrote my current standup show last autumn it seemed pessimistic. Now it seems prescientAnd if, like Billy the Kid, you stand up to avaricious authoritarians, you end up dead on the porch in just some brown trousers while Rita Coolidge weeps, or detained at customs like a French intellectual. Peckinpah’s once reviled film is now almost too on the nose for 2025! ButThe Handmaid’s Taleseemed like science fiction back in the 80s, when you had to read it if you wanted to get a date with an attractive feminist.But given that Donald Trump’s domestic and foreign policies seem based on the same narcissistic notions of manifest destiny that forged the old west, maybe it isn’t surprising thatPat Garrettand Billythe Kidsuddenly speaks volumes. There’s a new sheriff in town and he’s working for the modern-day cattle barons, who are farming engagement on vast digital plains with great globs of porn and racism, and pushing out the people who went west to post pictures of cats and sad things about Palestine.Pat Garrettand Billythe Kidat least has the edge musically on the Trump administration because it gave us Dylan’s three-chord classic Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door, as opposed to a degraded version of YMCA, sung by an inauthentic manifestation of the Village People, still dressed as gay-friendly archetypes of the American collective subconscious, but stomping on a human ear – for ever!The central conceit of my current tour show,Stewart Lee vsthe Man-Wulf, is that the bullies are taking over politics and comedy and we’re somehow seduced by their cruelty. World events currently approach the show head-on at such velocity that the jokes in it buffet around like ball-bearings in a pinball machine and bash into different news stories daily, while I flap the flippers like a blind idiot Brexiter.Some throwaway yuks inlast week’s column, and last week’s live show, about Russell Brand, another of the comic flatulists currently flourishing in the court of King Donald, underwent hasty last-minute rewrites as allegationscoalesced into criminal charges, inconveniencing me enormously.Playwrights write their plays only once and then walk away from the scenes of their crimes, even as their storylines are overtaken by world events. I, however, am required to retool my work nightly, while losers like William Shakespeare, Samuel Beckett or Alan Ayckbourn benefit from the notion that their hastily tossed-off and then simply abandoned works are somehow “timeless”, when in fact they are just the products of lazy and careless minds.When I wrote the current standup show last autumn it seemed pessimistic. Now it seems prescient. By the time it closes next year I am worried it will seem nostalgic. Will the newly enslaved Indigenous people of Greenland look back fondly on the2025 tariffsand theSignal scandalas they mine mobile phone parts from rapidly thawing permafrost, while YMCA booms endlessly out of a subterranean speaker system?

It can’t be long before Jeff Bezos personallyextends his thanks, as he did when we – Amazon employees and Amazon customers – paid for his flight to sub-orbital space, but let’s not wait. As soon as Monday, when his fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, is due with five friends on a rocket trip, Amazon givers could be witness, again, to the kind of unfettered excess that is only possible if everyone, at every level, contributes, even if it’s only via permanent surveillance and asurrendered toilet break.But no one puts it better than Jeff, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, did himself, after he took his inaugural Blue Origin space trip in 2021. “You guys paid for all this.” More recently, we provided funds – that might not exist without the company’s pitiless working conditions – for Sánchez’s pink diamondengagement ring, proudly exhibited, estimated value, $3m. The billionaire delivered it, an enchantedVoguewriter reported, in the sweetest way, on his massive new yacht, “hiding the ring under her pillow after a starlit dinner à deux”. Few passions have been as exhaustively documented as that between these seasoned lovebirds. (Favourite saying: “Love you to space and back.”) And this week, prior to funding the solemnisation of that love – a June wedding in Venice – it will duly be our privilege to watch Lauren’s hen flight slip the surly bonds of Earth.Everyone on this pointless excursion will,Ellemagazine confirms, wear full makeup. “We are going to put the “ass” in astronaut,” says the singer Katy Perry. “Little girls and little boys are going to be more curious about space and what else is out there because we’re bringing attention to it,” says Sánchez. Already the trip is advertising, to all ages, ticket availability on Bezos’s exclusive Blue Origin rocket tours.How Venetians, however, are to benefit from their bit parts in the forthcoming Sánchez-Bezos exploit,The Blings of the Dove, is less readily understood. Only last year, the city was so overwhelmed by tourism it introduced an entry fee, though one so small itreportedly made little difference. But its mayor,Luigi Brugnaro, who actively welcomed the Bezos wedding, is reassuring residents that a three-day invasion by the Trump ally, his bride, a retinue of celebrity guests, their countless attendants and media being groomed into a frenzy, is nothing the city can’t deal with. And as much as it might look unappealing, the tradition of US plutocrats Venice-washing their loot dates back at least to the time when Henry James’s friends were crowing about palazzos and treasures you could buy for a song. “The common Italians are not at all aware of the artistic value of such a unique specimen of decoration of 17th century as ourgran sala,” wrote the US banker’s wife, Ariana Curtis, after snapping up the Palazzo Barbaro in 1885. “We, however, do not intend to be tied to it – regarding it as a good investment.”The wedding plan is, reportedly, for the celebrations to centre on the Bezos yacht, a craft famous for its rivalrous mast dimensions, enormous support vessel (or garage/helicopter pad), andcustom figurehead, one thought to be modelled on Sánchez until she indicated toVogue, with the utmost delicacy, that its breasts were too small for that to be true. Tourist crowds will judge for themselves but the briefest comparison of the wooden figurehead and Ms Sánchez wearing, for instance, the corset she picked for Trump’s inauguration, confirms, as do her many candid selfies, that the effigy hardly does her justice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a while since the International Trade Union Federation named Bezos “the world’s worst boss”, but last year the European parliamentbanned Amazon’s (14) lobbyists, citing that company’s repeated refusal to engage with itsEmployment and Social Affairs committee. Should Sánchez be made aware of what also tends not to feature in magazine tributes to her new career in philanthropy, that the European section of the UNI global union considers Amazon, known for“bombarding” workerswith anti-union messaging, as “hostile to the European model”? Or does Sánchez know this, yet still insist on hailing Venice, or the parts of it able to accommodate an Amazon flotilla, from the Bezos substitute for a burnish’d throne? Her brother talks ofroyal-level spectacle.While there is every chance, with no Amazon warehouses nearby, that many spectators will simply enjoy the evidence of colossal waste and any amount of fillers, with the chance to glimpse a waterborne Kardashian or Trump, there can be no guarantee others will not react to the provocation. You do not have to be familiar, after all, with thehuman-cage contraptionthat Amazon once patented (to allow its human assets to mix with actual automatons) to conclude that a couple intent on Venetian profligacy has learned nothing, not even with the help ofThe White Lotus, since his “you guys paid for all this” triggered international disbelief.As we can’t be sure thatVenicedidn’t demand a fortune in return, it’s possible the city has made Bezos’s late-life bid to look classy, financially worth its trouble. But still: the city offers something that is irreplaceable and desired by the second richest – or thereabouts – man in the world. Isn’t the least Venice could do for the numberless exhausted workers whose dignity Amazon has denied, to show Bezos there’s one thing he can’t buy?Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Breathless outfit details. Her cooking something unexpectedly indulgent for the interviewer, or appearing more laid-back than her image suggests. Spacey pronouncements. What I don’t expect to read is: “I need to optimize EBITDA” (that’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, for the non-business-speaking people) or “impacting my P&L” (profit and loss). These quotes come from Paltrow’s recentVanity Fair profile, in which she also referred to recent layoffs from her wellness empire, Goop, as a “reorg” and described its sexual wellness clients as: “Not the best customers from an LTV perspective,” which I learn means “lifetime value” – having bought the notoriousvagina eggfor a laugh, they don’t come back for cashmere andcasserole dishes.Tempting as it is to linger in the Goop-verse – so fragrant, so self-actualised – I’m mostly interested in Paltrow’s uninhibited adoption of biz-speak. It was unexpected in a glossy feature with her looking a billion dollars, accessorised with two equally fabulous borzois. Normally, if I wanted to hear someone talk about EBITDA, I’d turn off my noise-cancelling headphones and eavesdrop on my husband’s work calls. But Paltrow has always had a shrewd eye for the zeitgeist, so I’m wondering: does this herald the second coming of the out-and-proud girlboss?Exhibit B is the Duchess of Sussex callingher new podcast“Confessions of a Female Founder”. While it’s more fluff than hardcore hustlebro, entrepreneurship is the hook, and there’s plenty of business speak: ideation, incubation, metrics, the fact that she’s “ab-so-lutelyconsumed with packaging”.View image in fullscreenThe Duchess of Sussex at a conference in Austin, Texas.Photograph: Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP/Getty ImagesIs there a female celebrity out there who isn’t leveraging her personal brand into an actual brand? Besides the Kardashian industrial complex, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Scarlett Johansson and Selena Gomez have beauty lines; Jessica Alba and Courteney Cox have homeware brands; Blake Lively and Eva Longoria sell booze; Drew Barrymore has a multichannel empire. Yes, male stars are doing it too, but it seems to me the women have taken the world’s intense interest in how they look and what they consume – and found ways of capitalising on that.Theoriginal girlboss movementhas a deservedly bad rap: its sparkly, “yay, female empowerment” rhetoric did little to address the structural obstacles to women’s professional success. But when it comes to the 2025 version, I respect the hustle, because times are tough. Spotify hasstripped awaymusicians’ ability to make money, and while Hollywood’s A-list women make megabucks (until they can be satisfactorily deepfaked for a whole feature film), it’s generally less than the men – a gender pay gap mirroredacross the cultural sector. Then there’s the shadow of what Amy Schumer satirised as their“last fuckable day”hanging over all but a handful of Oscar-worthy outliers. Alchemising social media eyeballs and parasocial prurience into a revenue stream over which you have real control seems like solid good sense, and there’s something quite satisfying in hearing Paltrow ditch the woo-woo momentarily, and talk like the steely businesswoman she obviously is.But can civilians girlboss like Paltrow and co? I’m interested because as a gen X creative – recentlysaid by the New York Timesto be an endangered, or at least impoverished, species – my personal P&L has taken a hit recently.On the plus side, like Paltrow, I’m “going through hardcore perimenopause”, navigating an empty nest and waking early to check my email in the dark (though mine mostly come from the indefatigable Royal Dutch Mint from whom I bought one coin as a joke in 2015, making me a poor LTV proposition). But with no marketable personal brand, ability to read a balance sheet or even Meghan’s jam-making skills, my earnings forecast remains pessimistic.The one thing I’m good at is words, so, inspired by Paltrow, I’ll start by talking the talk: entrepreneurship is a confidence game, right? Looking forward, my key deliverable for Q3 is ensuring adequate working capital (chicory) for my cost centres (pet tortoises). To achieve that, KPIs include rationalising core spend (ditching pilates), seeking synergies (nicking my husband’s clothes) and exploring diversified revenue streams (TBC: does my bunion mean sellingfoot picsis out?). As the vintage girlboss-era phrase has it, perhaps I can fake it till I make it.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Under Donald Trump, that scramble may be back. If news reports are right, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is offering the US abluntdeal: minerals for military help – a slice of sovereignty traded for a shot at stability.The concern is this isn’t a return, it’s a sequel. For three decades, Washington supportedJoseph-Désiré Mobutu, a cold war ally and brutal dictator who looted the Congo until his 1997 fall. That history of power politics still casts a long shadow. The Trump administration openly favours muscle over diplomacy. Fadhel Kaboub, an associate professor of economics at Denison University,notesthat Biden-era talk of partnering for clean energy has been shelved, with the US driven less by green goals than by copper and cobalt for missiles and microchips.The logic is bleak but clear. Since 1996, the Congo’s wars have drawn in foreign armies and proxies, leaving over 5.5 million dead. The DRC faces a worsening security crisis driven by armed groups likeM23, allegedly backed byRwanda and other regional powers. Western governmentslamentthe violence, but focus on securing access to minerals vital to theirindustries. Kinshasa, seeing appeals to multilateraljusticeachieve little, has turned to dealmaking. If dependency is inevitable, it might as well be leveraged.The DRC’s leadership is not naive. They know Mr Trump sees Africa not as a partner but as a warehouse of strategic materials, andUkraineas proof that he will turn weakness into American gain. They know China won’t send troops – citing non-interference – even as its firms dominate Congolese mining. WithRussiaand Gulf states offering assistance, Kinshasa pushes for US bases to guard “strategic resources” – like cobalt,70%of which comes from the DRC and is essential tosmartphonesand Nato’sdefence industry. Congo may want boots; Washington prefers business.The proposeddealwith the US seems desperate and strategic: security support in exchange for mining rights. Don’t call it protection money. After Mr Trump’s Africaenvoysignalled a deal was coming, the DRC repatriated three Americans tied to a failed coup, and a tin mine, which iscontrolledby US investors, began reopening as M23 rebels pulled back – a fragile win in a volatile landscape. Kinshasa hopes either to have Washington broker a peace that forces the rebels into retreat or to gain the firepower to crush them outright.It might also unlockIMF fundingand widen access to western capital markets. But at what cost? The likeliest outcome is that the DRC will receive just enough to remain dependent. Its mineral sector will be dominated byforeign firms, its fiscal autonomy eroded by conditional loans and its economylocked into the old patternof subservience – supplier of cheap inputs, consumer of expensive outputs.Calling this colonialism isn’t quite right. Empires ruled by decree, with no pretence of consent. Today’s coercion ismore subtle: a sovereign state cornered, at a weak moment, into accepting colonial-style terms without soldiers or flags. The tools are different –security deals, trade exemptions, private investment. But the logic is familiar. The irony is that this is being pursued voluntarily by a government with few alternatives. What will history say about that?Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoOpinionDonald TrumpAfricaMiningeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But the police will have to work hard to regain public trustSun 13 Apr 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 19.49 EDTShareIt is difficult to square last week’s announcement of thefirst trancheof 13,000 extra neighbourhood police, across England and Wales, with the threat of job cuts that also looms over the 43 forces. As in other public services, there is a risk that launching new projects at a time of overstretched budgets will shift resources rather than increase capacity. That said, an approach to policing that stresses local connectedness has had good results in the past. Labour is right to follow through on its manifesto pledge on neighbourhood teams, but delivery alone is not a substitute for strategy.Recent rises inshopliftingandrobbery offenceshave alarmed sections of the public as well as businesses. The Greater Manchester scheme, which the prime minister cites as a model, has hadgood results, with burglaries down by a third between 2021 and 2024 and a renewed partnership with retailers.Evaluating police tactics can be difficult, as changes in approach are concurrent with broader shifts including increases or decreases in crime. But the neighbourhood policing programme rolled out under the last Labour government had a broadlypositive impact on public confidence, and reduced crime and antisocial behaviour in some places. The hope is that an increased police presence, particularly at peak times and in crime hotspots, will have a similar effect now, combining reassurance with deterrence.Everyday policing should be carried out by officers who are embedded in communities and know their way around local services. Particularly in areas where young men are at higher risk of becoming involved in crime, either as perpetrators or victims, it is an advantage when officers are familiar figures. Vulnerable residents can also benefit. At a time whentrust in the police is justifiably lowfollowing multiple horrifying revelations of racism, sexual violence and other failures, rebuilding relationships ought to be a priority.Bobbies on the beat are not the answer to everything. If new targets for arrests are introduced, and prevention is overlooked, there is a danger that the “summer crime blitz” promised by Sir Keir Starmer could lead to people being wrongly criminalised. A heavy-handed approach to antisocial behaviour will only add to existing pressures on courts and prisons.There are crimes – including serious organised crime, online sexual exploitation and financial offences – to which an increased local police presence is unlikely to make much difference. Another set of reforms, aimed at addressing these threats and others including terrorism, is expected in a white paper later this year. One possibility is the creation of anational forceto lead on these areas.There is a case for such a division of labour, with a national body taking over responsibility for counter-terrorism from theMetropolitan police, while local forces renew efforts to build links on the ground. But reorganisations are always disruptive and the latter could end up worse off if the highest-profile crime-fighting is taken out of their purview (the last two Met chiefs both came from counter-terrorism).Crime is expected to be a key issue in next month’s local elections. With its new commitment to neighbourhood police, the government wants to draw a contrast with the Conservatives. But more officers should not be viewed as an end in themselves, especially if they are employed despite cuts elsewhere. Ministers must ensure that extra police play a constructive role in communities.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Working twice as hard as my non-disabled peers. Achieving a senior position at the cost of my own health and wellbeing.Society can’t handle disabled women: the fact that we can have a laugh, get drunk, have a sex life, travel solo, have a job, own a house.

The first wave of 300 new school-based nurseries was announced – with the majority in this phase in cold spots, supporting the communities that need it most. A quick scan of thedistributionhad me smiling over my cornflakes in recognition of policy, practice and provision coming together in my own north Leeds neighbourhood, offering an average of 20 places per site.Joy also that the Guardian isreportingon the expansion’s benefits, not just for helping parents to work but, crucially, for supporting children’s development. A raft of research shows that high-quality, group-based care outside the home can improve children’s physical, cognitive, communication and socio-emotional skills. Ourresearchduring Covid showed that children attending nursery grew stronger vocabularies as the country went in and out of lockdowns. This effect was especially strong in children living with disadvantage.Now we must ensure that these new settings succeed for sustaining children’s readiness for school and beyond. High-quality settings require much more than a classroom – with sufficient funding to match.First,researchshowed that in 2023, 57% of nursery staff were considering quitting the sector. This is a major risk to success. The rollout needs to be underpinned by measures to strengthen staff retention, including better career development, guaranteed access to training on special educational needs and disabilities, safe adult-to-child ratios and concomitant pay.Second, school readiness involves families, schools and children alike. Nursery families must be re-engaged to enable them to take up their offer of a place and to ensure regular attendance.Third, this rollout depends on collaboration between industry, academia, charities and the government. To safeguard that, we need to establish a dedicated scientific advisory subcommittee on early years to ensure the government’s opportunity mission can not only be delivered but also built on in the long term.Dr Catherine DaviesProfessor of language development, University of LeedsDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Calm and controlled throughout, this was a champion’s drive from Piastri that has made it abundantly clear he is in contention to return the championship this season.Tom Stallard, a 2008 Olympic rowing silver medallist for Great Britain, is Piastri’s engineer but the Australian, unflappable, barely needed so much as a gentle nudge from him all race, such was the ease with which he drove from pole to flag to take McLaren’s first victory at the Sakhir circuit.Lando Norris left searching for answers after disappointing Bahrain GPRead moreHis lead when the flag fell was 15 and a half seconds from Mercedes’s George Russell, who was followed home in a fight to the last by Piastri’s McLaren teammate,Lando Norris. The Australian and the McLaren had been in a class of their own ­throughout, but behind him his rivals dashed hither and thither in what at times was an enthralling scrap that ebbed and flowed. One enlivened not least by the magnificent drive by ­Russell and a feisty comeback by ­Norris, for whom it was a rollercoaster that had begun before the lights had even gone out and was the least he needed to cling on to his title lead.Russell’s drive would have felt familiar to anyone who has kicked the tyres of a second-hand car and confidently driven off only to ­discover they have been sold a pup. In the final third he was clinging on to second and given soft tyres to make it to the end, which he said was an “audacious” decision by his team. This would have been task enough, only for the car to add to the jeopardy by slowly but surely withdrawing its labour.First he had a DRS problem and was then warned he might lose the dash display too, which duly did fail. “As long as the steering wheel doesn’t fall off,” he observed with no little nonchalance as the transponder on his car also gave up the ghost. Then he had a brake by wire failure, the pedal first going long then short, an ­alarming situation on the one component the drivers have to trust most. “No brakes, no steering wheel, what more do we need,” he said.F1 standingsThe car was clearly struggling and at one point the DRS opened to his shock when he pushed a button not associated with it. He closed it and backed off to allow for it having opened when not in range of Piastri, an offence for which he was investigated after the race but exonerated as he had gained no advantage.By the close, he had Norris clam­bering all over his gearbox as the Mercedes, beset with issues, creaked onwards toward the line. Russell held it together admirably and just held off the assault.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell holds off a challenge from Lando Norris.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesNorris in turn also delivered a fine run to be in that position. Poor qualification meant he started from sixth on the grid and when he lined up, he edged one wheel outside the limits of his grid box. It was an inarguable false start for which he was swiftly given a five-second penalty, after he had made a bravura start to climb up to third. Penalty taken, he found himself in a fierce to and fro with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who finished fourth, one place in front of his teammate Lewis Hamilton, which lasted for the second half of the race before the British driver finally made a decisive pass to take the place and hared off after Russell.All of which drama sat in stark contrast to Piastri, who was barely noticeable out front. His biggest headache was a malfunctioning drinks bottle and handling a safety car restart, which he handled thirstily but with aplomb and after which he was simply gone.For Norris, as an exercise in ­damage limitation, it was enough. But he knows that weekends like this are not those that make championships and that his lack of connection with the car at the moment sits in comparison with the ease his teammate is enjoying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is something of the Alain Prost about the smooth ease and precision with which he puts in these perfectly executed laps, the Aussie Professor.The result leaves the world championship finely poised. Norris now leads Piastri by just three points.Max Verstappen– who toiled round in a Red Bull car with which the world champion was once more very dissatisfied and finished only sixth – is third, five points further in arrears.Flawless at the front then, McLaren have the upper hand and without doubt a championship-winning car.

Tindall said he had not spoken to his longstanding friend for a few days but had been communicating by text message.“Eddie and I have been working together for 17 years and I don’t think he’s ever missed more than a day or two in that time,” he said.“I had a text message from Eddie before the game that he put his trust in myself to do what I thought was right. I sent him a couple of messages today to say that he was hugely missed. He’s one of the best managers there is.“It’s at times like this when the manager’s not there that the players have to step up and they did.

Get the job done up north and they will face either Lyon or Racing 92 in the final a week before the league playoffs get going. There is a lot of rugby still to be played, but a team full of confidence, one stacked with superstar talent and strength in depth, have given their fans enough evidence to be hopeful of adding more silverware before the summer.Northampton set up Leinster rematch after Henry Pollock batters CastresRead more“I’m just glad it’s finished,” the Bath head coach, Johannvan Graan, said. “Gloucester are tough to beat and we know the game is never done. We keep saying to each other that it’s the best defence against the best attack.“It’s the seventh game in a row where we’ve scored 40 points or more. But the most important thing is can we keep the opposition down. Our attack and our defence are working pretty well at the moment.”This one was never in doubt and had the feel of an exhibition match. Under warm sunshine and with the stands not quite full, it did not match the gravitas of the French derby between Toulon and Toulouse in the Champions Cup quarters a few hours earlier. Eight first-half tries underlined the lighthearted tone.Some came off the back of well‑worked plays such as Bath’s opener from Tom de Glanville, who put the finishing touches on a move sparked by Finn Russell’s spiralling pass to Ciaran Donoghue, as well as Gloucester’s immediate response where Gareth Anscombe’s inch‑perfect cross-kick found a leaping Santiago Carreras in the corner. Too many scores, though, came courtesy of meek defending.Quick GuideChampions Cup: Toulouse's Ramos holds nerve to down ToulonShowThomas Ramos sent Toulouse into the semi-finals of the Champions Cup with a last-gasp penalty to down Toulon 21-18. Ramos had a mixed day from the tee and had already missed three kicks when he took the chance to break the deadlock and send his side through at the expense of their Top 14 rivals.The boot of Melvyn Jaminet was responsible for all of the home side’s points, while Toulouse clawed back a 12-3 first-half deficit courtesy of tries from the Englishman Jack Willis and Pita Ahki.Toulouse face another French side, Bordeaux, for a place in the final next month. Leinster meet Northampton in the other semi-final.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Gloucester’s lack of heft up front led them to ship a rolling maul try to Tom Dunn and cough up possession at the back of their own lineout before Ross Molony set up tighthead Archie Griffin for a simple run-in. Then Donoghue was too easily stepped by Gloucester’s hooker Jack Singleton before shambolic organisation from the visitors made it too easy for Ben Spencer to round off a blindside move.Even elite operators were succumbing to mistakes. An inept kick from Russell gifted away possession that ended with a Jacob Morris try in the left corner before Anscombe’s boot returned the favour, merely handing the initiative back to Bath who duly obliged with Alfie Barbeary, the player of the match, scampering on to his own hack ahead to dot down on the stroke of half-time.View image in fullscreenJaco Coetzee surges clear to touch down Bath’s seventh try.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty ImagesGloucester’s head of rugby, George Skivington, promised before the match that his team had “something up their sleeve”, and he unloaded six forwards off the bench four minutes after the restart. It did not make a difference. The visitors lost a lineout and missed three tackles as Barbeary cantered over for his second. His replacement, Jaco Coetzee, kept the scoreboard ticking by scything through the line and brushing off two tacklers under the poles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While about 20 seconds clear on a cobbled section, a bottle thrown from low down in a throng of spectators struck him in the face.“Who on earth comes to a bike race to do that? What are you playing at?” said Rob Hatch on TNT Sports. “Just scumbags,” added his colleague Adam Blythe. “I can’t believe someone is doing this. It’s just beyond belief. The good news is it didn’t affect him – but yeah, disgusting. Just do one. Don’t bother coming out.”Despite his light weight – a big disadvantage on the cobbles – and a scare on Van der Poel’s first offensive move, Pogacar dealt several blows until making a fatal mistake.Van der Poel’s brutal attack 87km from the finish left Pogacar gasping for air and prompted the Slovenian to request his team’s assistance for glucose gels. After recovering, Pogacar accelerated with 71km left as Denmark’s Mads Pedersen, another pre-race favourite, suffered an untimely puncture.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar gets back up after a fall during  Paris-Roubaix.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPAVan der Poel again attacked in the cobbled section of Mons-en-Pevele and his teammate Jasper Philipsen could not follow, leaving the Dutchman and Pogacar in a tight battle.It fizzled out, however, when Pogacar made his costly mistake on a sharp bend and after a change of bike for the Slovenian in the finale, there was no reason to panic for Van der Poel when he punctured a tyre.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Matt [Heywood] and Tom [Ford] are fantastic guys, really great indivi­duals. They’ve supported the team all the way through.

They were two lengths in front by Barnes Bridge but Katy Hempson, the Cambridge bow, was not the only athlete reduced to tears of joy as the winning boat drifted towards a gaggle of cheering teammates on the riverbank.“It definitely pops into your mind,” Pinsent said of the possibility of a disqualification for Oxford. “But the rules express that in the event of a foul, you can see if it affects the outcome of the race.“In the end Cambridge won so it becomes a bit of a moot point. The rules allow you to do it [disqualifi­cation] and the rules allow you to wait and see. You’re considering all and any options from that moment on, but in the end they got to race the full track. That’s the best outcome – that their speed does the talking.”Annie Anezakis of Oxford told the BBC: “I’ve lost two prior to this. The most meaningful things are the friendships I make and the memories I make along the way.

Credit to the players, we dominated. It should’ve been more.”City bowed out of the tournament with a whimper, their last hope of a trophy over within 22 minutes but written off by many before a ball was kicked at a windswept Academy stadium. Nick Cushing’s squad, torn apart by injuries, is so threadbare that only four outfield players were named on the bench, including the 17‑year‑old Sacha Lewis, who joined Derby on a dual registration in January to get playing minutes in the National League Northern Premier Division.Manchester City v Manchester United: Women’s FA Cup semi-final – liveRead moreKicked out of the Champions League by Chelsea, 13 days after they endured a League Cup final defeat against Sonia Bompastor’s side, and seven points adrift of third-placed United in the Women’s Super League, for City the FA Cup had offered a chance to salvage something from a disastrous injury-crippled season.“In the sense of trophies, the season is over,” Cushing said. “We can still mathematically get into third place. We have to win out now.”There will be an inquest at the end of the season, he added, though who will be in charge remains to be seen: the temporary manager was evasive about his future when he joined on an interim basis after Gareth Taylor’s sacking in March.“The injury crisis needs to be examined, 100%, every team needs to do a post‑season review,” he said. “To do that now is really difficult because you have to go really in depth and have everyone involved and we’re still preparing for games. So many injuries can’t just be bad luck, but it can’t all be down to poor practice.”It took six minutes for United’s aggressive press to reap rewards against the depleted City, Ella Toone’s ball over the top brought down by Celin Bizet who wrongfooted Gracie Prior before firing past Khiara Keating. Furious, Keating booted the ball in the direction of the centre circle, Kerstin Casparij playing Bizet onside probably out of her eyeline.City were already without Vivianne Miedema and Jill Roord, who were added to their heaving injury list during the international break, and lost another key player in the 17th minute, the Australia forward Mary Fowler clutching the knee of her heavily strapped right leg after it seemed to collapse inwards as she extended with her left. After some treatment off the pitch, it had appeared that Fowler might return. By the time Naomi Layzell came on to replace Fowler, City were two goals down, Gabby George’s corner met by Grace Clinton, who turned it in with her head after she escaped some lax marking from Kerolin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They need to build a squad capable of competing in four competitions and weathering injury storms, whether they manage to book a place in next year’s Champions League or not.Their struggle should act as a cautionary tale to the United board, who need to back Skinner in the summer as they probably head into the Champions League and have to attempt to maintain this consistency across four competitions.Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupManchester City WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However, he still imposed 10% tariffs on every country in the world, as well as145% levies on China, which he sees as the cause of the decline of manufacturing jobs in the US.The chief executive of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, said late on Friday that the cumulative effect was that the US faced a 50% chance of a recession this year.Peter Navarro, one of the key architects behind Trump’s trade war, said it was “unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario”, in an interview on Sunday with NBC.He added that the US has “no defence against other than tariffs right now” when confronted with what the US has alleged – with little evidence – are non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation and taxes.The billionaire investor Ray Dalio on Sunday said he feared a tariff war would accelerate the end of post-second world war trading arrangements and generate conflicts across the world.Dalio, the founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, separately told NBC that the reinstatement of higher tariff rates after a 90-day pause could be “highly disruptive to the world economy” and could even cause military conflict.Trump adviser Peter Navarro says ‘we’re great’ after Elon Musk calls him ‘moron’Read moreBrown said that Trump had “weaponised” the interdependence of the global trading and financial systems.Brown served as UK prime minister from 2007 until 2010, with much of his time dominated by the international response to the global financial crisis. He said the trade war would require a similar “synchronised reduction in interest rates” from central banks, with Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan and South Korea among those who could work together.“It’s got to come from Europe or Britain or perhaps from other parts of the world,” Brown said, with the US and China, the world’s two largest economies, locked in a trade war.However, some central bankers are cautious about cutting interest rates because of concerns that existing inflationary pressures will beworsened by price rises to pay for tariffs.Brown acknowledged that inflation could go up, but said the worst effects of the tariff turmoil are yet to filter through from financial markets to living standards.The UK Labour government under Keir Starmer has so far tried to avoid antagonising the US. Brown said he understood his successor’s strategy, and said it was not yet time for the UK to choose definitively to move away from the US and prioritise European relations.However, Brown said the UK needed to find partners other than the US to “rebuild the world order” based on the rule of law, human rights and climate action.More broadly, the world was moving from a “unipolar” order dominated by the US to a “multipolar” one, Brown said.“The way forward can only be for countries in a multipolar order – if there is going to be order – to talk to each other and work with each other and consult with each other.“We have to get back to a situation where people are willing to rebuild those blocks of the world order.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsGordon BrownTariffsDonald TrumpTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK andBangladesh.Siddiq’s representative said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”.The MP for Hampstead and Highgate has deniedallegations of corruptionlinked to her aunt’s collapsed regime and accused the Bangladeshi authorities of a “targeted and baseless” campaign against her.Who is Tulip Siddiq, niece of deposed Bangladeshi PM who quit Treasury role?Read moreSiddiqresigned in Januaryas economic secretary to the Treasury, citing the risk of becoming a distraction and saying the government was being harmed by the furore over her use of properties given to herself and her family by allies of the regime of Hasina.She was not deemed by Keir Starmer’s ethics adviser to have broken any rules over her use of the homes and he found no evidence to suggest that any of Siddiq’s assets were derived from anything other than legitimate means.But Laurie Magnus did find a lack of records and said lapse of time meant he had “not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters”.A Conservative party spokesperson said: “If it is the case that Keir Starmer’schoice for anti-corruption ministeris the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.“It is shocking that Keir Starmer believes ‘the door remains open’ for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position. Keir Starmer must put his close friendship and association with Ms Siddiq aside and take the action he should have months ago.”Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission (ACC) has alleged that Siddiq, 42, received a 670 sq metre plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital, Dhaka, through ties to the former rulers, according to theSunday Telegraph.The allegation is that Siddiq persuaded her aunt to allocate three plots of land in the exclusive enclave for her family members, including her mother, Sheikh Rehana, her brother Radwan and her younger sister Azmina. The family are all based in Britain.The ACC chair, Mohammad Abdul Momen, previously told the BBC the investigations in Bangladesh were “based on documentary evidence of corruption” and Siddiq should return to fight her case in Bangladesh.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scheme was first introduced by a Conservative government 10 years ago this month, targeting overseas visitors and migrants.However, manywomen entitled to free NHS maternity careare being wrongly charged, pregnancy charity Maternity Action said.Kim’s case was complicated by changes in her migration status. She first claimed asylum in the UK in 2017 after a crackdown on government critics in Zimbabwe, her country of birth, but was refused.In 2021 she became pregnant and made a fresh asylum application, having struggled to do so earlier, she said, because of the pandemic.After the birth of her daughter in March 2022, when she had an active asylum claim and should have been exempt, Kim was invoiced for maternity care by Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust (LTHT) for £10,703.23.The trust later told a debt collection agency that she owed an additional £3,450 relating to previous inpatient care for mobility problems that occurred after her first asylum application had been refused.Kim, supported by the early parenthood charity National Childbirth Trust (NCT), wrote to LTHT saying: “I amforbidden by law from workingand do not have a bank account.“I would like to propose repayment of £0.01p a month. I am embarrassed that I cannot offer greater contribution … even this will be a stretch. A requirement to pay more than this will put me under significant pressure to obtain money unlawfully.”LTHT has now apologised to Kim “for any distress caused”, confirming they “cancelled” the invoices once they received “updated information demonstrating her eligibility”.The trust’s chief medical officer, Magnus Harrison, added: “Where a patient has accrued charges for NHS treatment and their eligibility later changes, previous charges still apply. If a patient is deemed destitute or at risk of imminent destitution then the trust may choose not to pursue the debt for the time being.”It is recommended in the UK that pregnant women have an initial antenatal appointment before 10 weeks, but fear of charges meant Kim did not seek antenatal care until four months, encouraged by NCT.“The danger is that incorrect implementation of the rules deters women from seeking appropriate antenatal and postnatal care,” Judith Dennis, Maternity Action’s head of policy, said. “This has serious implications for maternity safety (and) the health of women and babies.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnna Miller, Doctors of the World’s head of policy, said charging migrants meant babies whose parents had been here for years were “born into debt”, with no evidence of the cost-effectiveness of a policy that led to “people avoiding treatment” until crisis.Describing the impact of being charged, Kim said: “I really felt depressed … where am I going to get this money? I was still a new mum, breastfeeding as well … you’re trying to heal from a caesarean and then there’s a bill, there’s a small child as well.”Kim remains in asylum accommodation, where residents have complained of mould and cockroaches, awaiting a decision on her claim and attending college, hoping to study nursing.The NCT is calling for the impact of maternity charging to be examined and for access to interpreters and “secure housing” for pregnant women who are migrants.The NCT head of programmes, Helen Lloyd, said: “The threat of NHS charging creates a hostile environment for pregnant women with unclear immigration status.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Asylum accommodation is required to meet strict standards, and regular inspections are conducted to ensure these are maintained.“The NHS is a residency based system and it is only right that those who are not lawfully settled here, or exempt from charge, should contribute to the cost of their care.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

The family have asked that their privacy is respected at this time, the force added.Kaliyah is said to have been playing on a school inset day when she entered the water near Barge House Causeway, close to London City airport. Barge House Causeway is a concrete slope that goes directly into the Thames and is used to transport boats.Local residents noted that the slope appeared to be covered in moss and was slippery. They said they heard shouts and screams, while other children who were playing said a girl had disappeared in the water and they could not find her.One woman, Kerry Benadjaoud, 62, had taken a life ring to the water but could not see Kaliyah. She later found shoes and a sock, coat and phone by the river, which she passed to police.She said a boy at the scene told her: “The little boy turned around and said: ‘I tried to hold her hand but it slipped.’”Emergency services launched a “large-scale response” on 31 March but it was later scaled down.The Met released Kaliyah’s name and photograph at the start of this month.Explore more on these topicsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A major incident was declared and homes were evacuated after the blast, in which a terraced property was destroyed and significant damage was caused to neighbouring properties.The body of a man in his 50s was discovered in the wreckage.Ch Insp Clive Collings,of Nottinghamshire police, said: “This is an extremely serious incident that has led to a man’s untimely death. The man’s family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.”A police statement said that everyone who could have been in the area at the time was now accounted for and that an investigation to determine the cause of the explosion was ongoing.Collings added: “It is likely that the cordon and road closures will remain in place for some time as we carry out our investigations. I would also like to acknowledge the cooperation of local residents and thank them for their patience.“Officers will remain in the area to carry out inquiries relating to the investigation. It is an offence to fly a drone over or near to an ongoing emergency response without permission and I would ask that people refrain from doing that.“I would also like to thank all partners, including our emergency services colleagues at Nottinghamshire fire and rescue service and East Midlands ambulance service, who have worked throughout the night in response to this incident.”After the explosion, the nearby Crown Place community centre was opened as a place of safety for residents, while police remained at the scene through the night.Images circulated on social media appeared to show the scene, with people reporting hearing a huge bang that shook surrounding properties.In video shared on Facebook, the entire length of the property appeared to have been wrecked, with bricks littering the street.On X, one person asked at about 8.06pm on Saturday: “Did anyone else hear a loud bang/explosion sound in Worksop north Nottingham around 30 minutes ago?”A Facebook user posted at about 8.10pm: “I was driving back from mass this evening, just turned into Gladstone Street from Gateford Road, when there was a terrific bang, like a very loud firework! I thought the back end had blown off my car.”Karolina Ciolko, who lives nearby, told the BBC: “I was lying in bed when I heard an explosion. I quickly looked out the window.

Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into the “serious assault”.A female officer who was injured in the attack was treated in hospital and discharged, while her two male colleagues remain seriously ill in hospital, said Mark Fairhurst, the chair of the Prison Officers’ Association.He said Abedi had produced two homemade knives, adding: “We think that he’s made knives out of a baking tray from that kitchen area.“One [officer] had a severed artery, was stabbed in the neck, and one’s got severe stab wounds in the back, including a punctured lung,” Fairhurst said, adding that the officers also received third-degree burns.The attack took place in a separation centre at HMP Frankland in County Durham, which houses fewer than 10 prisoners and is where those considered to be the most dangerous and extremist are held.“I’m absolutely furious that terrorist prisoners, who pose such a significant risk to national security, are allowed the same freedoms and privileges as prisoners on normal location,” Fairhurst said. “We should not be allowing prisoners in separation centres to access cooking facilities, so they have the resources and implements that can inflict violence on staff.“There’s only one way to reduce the risk and prevent this ever happening again, and to reduce the risk, you have to stop prisoners’ access to kitchens, because we’re worried about copycat incidents. They get prison food, they get three meals a day. Why do they need to cook?”Fairhurst said the incident had highlighted the dangerous realities of being a prison officer and argued that more investment was needed from the Treasury in order to improve conditions for prison staff.“This just highlights how violent our workplace is, that your life is on the line every single shift – every single time you go on duty you’re subject to threats, abuse and violence, every single day, and let’s be honest, we haven’t got the adequate protections in place,” he said.“We deal with exactly the same incidents as police officers, exactly the same violence, the same hostilities, yet we don’t have the same protections. We don’t even have stab-proof vests.”He said the union was requesting an urgent meeting with the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, “to discuss what happened and put our case forward to issue prison officers on the frontline stab-proof vests”.He said that pending the review, access to prison kitchens “should be removed immediately, and it should never be allowed again”.Fairhurst also said the promised review of the incident should be carried out independently.“If they’re serious about improving conditions for staff and clamping down on violence then they will commission that independent review,” he said. “We don’t want it kept in-house, we want an independent expert on terror to look at what went wrong and make recommendations.”The MoJ has not yet said who will carry out the review, or whether cooking facilities for prisoners will be suspended in the interim.An MoJ spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with the two prison officers still in hospital as they recover. There will be a full review into how this attack was able to happen, alongside the separate police inquiry. The government will do whatever it takes to keep our hardworking staff safe.”Responding to the assault,Mahmoodwrote on X on Saturday evening: “I am appalled by the attack of three brave officers at HMP Frankland today. My thoughts are with them and their families.“The police are now investigating. I will be pushing for the strongest possible punishment. Violence against our staff will never be tolerated.”On Sunday, Counter Terrorism Policing North East said its investigation was continuing, with support from Durham constabulary.“Two victims remain in hospital with serious injuries and the third victim was discharged from hospital yesterday,” it said.“Extensive enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances and explore any potential motivation. We are keeping an open mind as we investigate to establish the facts.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationManchester Arena attackUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

We need to do it with the French. There are a lot of other countries sitting back and waiting.”She said that if the west did not act soon, there would be no Palestine left to recognise.Chris Doyle, the chair of the Council on Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), also backed the measure, saying it should have been done long ago and that such a step by two permanent members of the UN security council would send a powerful message.He also said that if the UK did not take this step soon it may be too late sinceIsraelwas clearly intent on pressing ahead with the effective annexation of the West Bank.The CAABU has a strong following among Labour MPs, many of whom are furious with Israel’s behaviour in Gaza. There is also anger that two Labour MPs werebanned by Israelfrom visiting the West Bank last week.The Foreign Office’s formal position is to say it will recognise Palestine at an appropriate moment of maximum impact, but when David Cameron was foreign secretary hemarginally advanced the UK policyby affirming that recognition need not come at the end of a process that leads to a two-state solution. In a reference to Israel, he said no state could have a veto over a UK decision to recognise Palestine.Macron surprised observers last week when he announced he hoped the June conference would act as a trigger for a group of nations to recognise Palestinian statehood, remarks that put clear diplomatic pressure on the UK to follow the French initiative. He told France 5: “We must move toward recognition [of the Palestinian state] and so, in the coming months, we will.”He added in a reference to some Gulf states including Saudi Arabia: “I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.”The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman – who has personally accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinians – has said Saudi Arabia will only recognise Israel as part of a pact that includes an irreversible path to a Palestinian state.Although there is scepticism in some British quarters as to how far Macron is prepared to antagonise Israel, personal and political relations between Keir Starmer and Macron are strong. It will be hard for the Foreign Office to resist a strong French push for Palestine’s recognition, especially if it is seen as part of a European-Gulf peace push.In May last year France chose not to joinSpain, Ireland and Norwayin recognising Palestine following an overwhelming vote in favour by the UN general assembly. At present 148 of the 193 member countries of the UN have officially recognised Palestinian statehood. So far no western G20 country, including Canada, Italy or Germany, has taken the step.The Knesset voted heavily last month against a two-state solution, but the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, still sees a medium-term pathway to it so long as Hamas is not part of any Palestinian government.European recognition would infuriate the US and Israel, but the French argue an alliance with Gulf states may prompt the Trump administration to recalibrate its support for Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on social media: “Unilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state … is a reward for terror and a boost to Hamas.”Faced by the backlash, Macron, writing in Hebrew on the social media site X, claimed he was the victim of a host of unfounded interpretations. He said France’s position was “yes to peace. Yes to Israel’s security. Yes to a Palestinian state without Hamas.”He wrote: “This requires the release of all hostages, a sustainable ceasefire, the immediate resumption of humanitarian assistance, and the promotion of a two-state political solution. There is no other way but a political solution. I stand for the Palestinians’ legal right to a state and peace, just as I stand for the Israelis’ right to live in peace and security, and while both states are recognised by their neighbours.“The two-state solution conference in June must be decisive. I am doing everything I can, alongside our partners, to achieve this goal of peace. We need it so much.”In a sign of the US’s apparent willingness to tolerate the annexation of the West Bank, the US Senate, voting largely along party lines last week, confirmed Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, as US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has referred to the West Bankby its Jewish biblical namesJudea and Samaria. At his confirmation hearing he claimed Donald Trump did not support the enforced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeLabourEmily ThornberryPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

So they naturally nap at different times on different days, depending on whether, for example, they have been for a walk with lots of tiring sensory stimulation, or have been inside.“Putting them down to sleep in a silent dark room at a set time for a prolonged period during the day is great for parents who want some down-time or to get some housework done. But it doesn’t make sense at all for babies who, when they have these mini night-times during the day, are more likely to then be awake during the night.”NHS advice states: “It’s a good idea to teach your baby that night time is different from daytime from the start. During the day, open curtains, play games and do not worry too much about everyday noises when they sleep ... Your baby will have their own pattern of waking and sleeping, and it’s unlikely to be the same as other babies you know.”Babies can wake up at night because they are hungry, teething, processing a new skill they have learned, or struggling with separation anxiety and wanting comfort.Sleeptraining, which means parents allowing babies to cry when they wake at night without going to them, to encourage them to self-soothe, is advised against by Ball, whose bookHow Babies Sleepwill be published next month. She said: ‘This stems from previous generations’ advice that parents had to show babies they were in charge and get them into a routine of sleeping.”She suggests parents catch up on sleep by going to bed earlier, because babies stay asleep for the longest period at the start of the night, allowing parents to get some deep sleep before their child wakes. Older babies’ bedtimes could also be shifted later, so it is later in the night when they first wake crying, she said.The popular advice when it comes to nap times is to watch babies for signs of tiredness, like rubbing their eyes, tugging their ears or yawning.But Ball said: ‘These apparent tiredness cues can just be a sign of boredom, and the need for a change in activity. Even if they are tired, the baby is not necessarily ready for a nap, so a parent could be trying to rock them to sleep for a long time with no luck and for no reason.“If people wait for babies to fall asleep naturally, rather than imposing naps on them, it could save a lot of frustration and time which could be spent doing better things.”Scheduled naps are often encouraged bybaby sleep “consultants”, a growing industry, and social media influencers.Andrea Grace, a sleep consultant who advocates scheduled naps, said: “Wake windows can be useful for parents to feel more confident on when their babies need to sleep. A schedule based on these can prevent infants becoming overtired, which then makes it harder for them to sleep.”Prof Paul Gringras, clinical lead for children’s sleep medicine at King’s College London, and president of the International Paediatric Sleep Association, said: “Psychology and medical sleep professionals tend to appreciate that it’s not always ‘one size fits all’ and that different families might need different approaches.“But in the first three months, I don’t think any would support extremely rigid schedules for baby sleep, as they do not align with natural sleep-wake cycles and can interfere with feeding.“All families are different, and where parents’ mental health and wellbeing is really suffering, they might try to get babies to nap at around the same time, because that rhythm in the day is useful.”He added: “Some studies suggest that controlled crying – when babies are left to self-soothe at night – causes them stress, shown by higher levels of cortisol. However, other studies looking at children after a variety of bedtime routine strategies showed no difference in cortisol levels, so there is still some debate around this.”He advised families to check the qualifications of baby sleep consultants, as the profession is unregulated.Explore more on these topicsSleepThe ObserverParents and parentingChildrenFamilyHealth & wellbeingnewsShareReuse this content"

Obviously if Wera has been denied access because she’s a British MP, that would be something we take very seriously.”Hobhousetold the Sunday Timesher passport was confiscated, she was asked about her job and the purpose of her trip, her luggage was searched and swabbed, then she was escorted to the boarding gate by four immigration officers.Her son, a university academic living in Hong Kong since 2019, was waiting in the arrivals hall. Her husband, William, a businessman, was allowed entry but chose also to return to the UK. She is believed to be the first MP refused entry since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong.Hobhouse, who has never visited Hong Kong, said she was given no explanation but believes it was because she is an MP. She is a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance onChina(Ipac), an international group of politicians that scrutinises Beijing’s approach to human rights and has criticised the crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong.Speaking to the BBC’s Newscast, Hobhouse suggested the decision had probably been an attempt “to shut me up”.She said: “It is very chilling that authoritarian countries can treat us in this way. Until now, I think there had been a diplomatic understanding that we might have different values, different political ideas but there is some sort of basic rule in which we allow politicians into each other’s countries, and that sort of understanding seems to be collapsing.”In a joint statement, other British MPs who are members of Ipac urged the government and the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to “take a very strong stand in addressing this affront to democratic principles and personal freedoms”.They said: “Detained and deported without explanation, Hobhouse’s exclusion appears linked to her criticism of Beijing’s human rights record, and possibly her membership of this network.”The incident coincided with UK ministers visiting China and Hong Kong to develop trade and investment links. “That the Hong Kong authorities felt able to deny entry to a sitting parliamentarian while simultaneously hosting UK ministers is an insult to parliament,” the MPs said.“That they appear to have done so because of an objection to something a UK MP has said in the legitimate exercise of her duties is a challenge to our core values as a nation.”Lammy has said he would raise the issue with the authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing, saying it was “deeply concerning to hear that an MP on a personal trip has been refused entry to Hong Kong”.Hobhouse told the Sunday Times: “When I was given the decision, my voice was shaking and I was just saying: ‘Why, please explain to me.’ They never gave me an explanation. That was so cruel. I just said: ‘I want to see my grandson. I want to cuddle him.’”She added: “I am obviously devastated. Having to fly back, it was so hard. I didn’t cry but I was very close to tears.”The obscure Jimmy Lai ruling that exposed the erosion of Hong Kong’s rule of lawRead moreHobhouse said there were far more outspoken critics of the Chinese Communist party than her, and she had been careful “to ensure that none of my political things would interfere with my private visit”.China has previouslybanned several British MPsfrom entering the country, including the Ipac members Iain Duncan Smith and Nusrat Ghani, and the former security minister Tom Tugendhat.The Foreign Office minister Catherine West is said to be in contact with Hobhouse.The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper,posted on Xquestioning if Kemi Badenoch would “say anything about a British MP arbitrarily blocked from entering Hong Kong?”, adding: “Or will she fail to, like she failed to back MPs blocked from entering Israel. Why won’t she stand up for our parliamentarians?”Cooper’s post is thought to be in response to comments last week when the Conservative leaderfaced criticismafter saying she respected Israel’s decision to deny Labour MPs Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang entry. Badenoch had said ina post on Xthat “unlike China, Israel is our ally”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsHong KongChinanewsShareReuse this content"

There were 59,549 searches of women, a 7% rise from the year before, and 447,952 searches of men, a 4% fall over the same period.StopWatch, a police reform charity that campaigns against the use of stop and search and which analysed the data, also found 10,450 cases of the tactic used against girls.A spokesperson said the rise in searches against women contradicts “persistent evidence” that officers discover “incredibly low” numbers of items, with the search routinely not resulting in further action being taken.The data also showed a 10% increase in the number of arrests of women after a stop and search compared with 2% of men.Jodie Bradshaw, policy and advocacy lead at StopWatch, said: “We don’t think that stop and search is fit for purpose. There are other strategies which are much more likely to bring about fewer crimes and for people to feel safe walking in public spaces and in the communities where they live.”The police argue that stop and search is a key tool in tackling crime, particularly the rise in knife crime. Research published in theJournal of Quantitative Criminologyhas found that the greater use ofstop and search in London areaswith high crime rates could bring down the number of knife attacks.The Home Office data also showed that police forces inEnglandand Wales submitted 747,396 use-of-force reports in the year ending March 2024, a rise of 13% on the year before. Use of force refers to officers using handcuffs, batons, tasers, firearms, limb or body restraints, and irritant sprays, among other measures.Women were the subject of 18% of these incidents, with black women making up about 9% of the total, even though the latest census estimates they make up just 4% of the population.View image in fullscreenPolice officers search activists from Just Stop Oil, during a protest in London.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersBradshaw argued that the police are more likely to patrol areas where a higher proportion of black, minority ethnic and marginalised groups live, and such communities are more likely to be stopped and searched as well as to have force used on them.Deborah Coles, the director ofInquest, a charity concerned with state-related deaths, said: “We know all too well that the use of force on women – particularly those who may have experienced violence and abuse – can be really traumatising.”She said the rising number of stop and searches needs to be understood within the context of “increasing inequality, poverty and criminalisation”, and specifically the crackdown on protests and shoplifting.Shenna D’archeville told theObserverabout an incident when the police stopped her while driving in north London in March 2023. The 40-year-old, a children’s residential worker who shared her story with StopWatch, said a police car pulled over in front of her and put the sirens on but she carried on driving as she did not realise officers wanted her to stop.D’archeville said officers ran towards her car and acted “aggressively”. She recalled an officer “yanking” the car door open and said her 11-year-old son, who was also in the vehicle, had been left shaken by the incident.The police told her they were stopping her as there had been a lot of cars stolen in the area, and they performed routine checks before allowing her to drive off, she said.D’archeville said she felt she had been racially profiled. She has been stopped while driving once before. “I was in a Mercedes,” D’archeville said. “When they see black people and black women in an expensive car, they will stop you for no reason.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Stop and search is a vital tool to tackle crime, but it’s crucial for public confidence in the police that it is used in an appropriate and fair way. The statistics referenced reflect the situation under the previous government.”Assistant chief constable Andrew Mariner, the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council lead for stop and search, said: “Policing recognises that being subject to a stop and search can be traumatising, particularly in the case of a child or vulnerable person.“We have been working with the College of Policing on refining the existing training for officers with a full review of the Authorised Professional Practice in respect of stop and search currently under way. This detailed and wide-ranging review is examining all aspects of stop and search and will make any necessary changes to policing policy and national practices.”It is important that “each police interaction is handled sensitively, in line with policy, and that we learn when we have not got that balance right”, he added.Explore more on these topicsStop and searchThe ObserverUK criminal justicePoliceCrimeHome OfficeWomenMetropolitan policeShareReuse this content"

RSF forces were said to be burning buildings throughout Zamzam on Sunday, claiming they were seeking Sudanese government fighters hiding in the camps.The US has condemned both sides in the war, saying the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur and that the army has attacked civilians.The conflict has essentially divided Sudan in two, with the army holding sway in the north and east while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south.The war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee described as “the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded”.The deaths at the weekend put extra pressure on the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to deliver a decisive response on the issue of civilian protection when he convenes a ministerialconference on Sudanin London on Tuesday. The conference of 20 countries and organisations will inevitably shine a spotlight on the United Arab Emirates, past backers of the RSF, to issue an unambiguous statement of condemnation.Locator graphicThe attacks on Um Kadadah, about 180km (112 miles) east of El Fasher, came one day after RSF fighters said they had taken the town from army forces. The victims appeared to be targeted because of their ethnicity.Lammy tweeted: “Shocking reports are emerging from El Fasher, Darfur, where indiscriminate RSF attacks have killed civilians, including aid workers. This gives added urgency to Tuesday’s Sudan conference in London with international partners. All sides must commit to protection of civilians.”The UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was “appalled and gravely alarmed by reports emerging from Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps as well as El Fasher town in North Darfur”. The two camps protect as many as 700,000 civilians displaced by previous violence and famine.The Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that “arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the Zamzam camp in the centre, south and south-east portions of the camp”.The UN reported that the RSF had launched coordinated ground and air attacks on the camps and El Fasher from multiple directions on 11 April, triggering intense clashes and resulting in catastrophic consequences for civilians.The UN said more than 100 people, including more than 20 children, were feared dead, including nine Relief International personnel. The Sudanese army said more than 70 people had been killed in El Fasher alone. The precise death toll was unverifiable due to deliberate internet shutdowns implemented by the RSF.Last month the armyrecaptured the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, about 1,000km (600 miles) to the east.Adam Regal, a spokesperson for the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, said Zamzam and Abou Shouk remained under artillery shelling and an assault by RSF armed vehicles on Sunday.Relief International said of the loss of its staff: “We understand this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people. We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack – along with other health facilities in El Fasher.”Both the Biden and Trump administrations in the US have said the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur, and that the army has attacked civilians. The Sudanese government last week took the UAE to the international court of justice, the UN’s top court, claiming the UAE was complicit in genocide.Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, said: “It appears that the RSF is attacking Zamzam, Abu Shouk and El Fasher simultaneously for the first time, including a ground assault on Zamzam. This is a significant escalation in violence against civilians in the North Darfur region and requires immediate diplomatic response.”She said she feared such “a coordinated military effort by the RSF would represent the beginning of the assault we have all so long feared – including further acts of genocide and crimes against humanity – and should trigger all emergency diplomatic and other responses.”She added: “In hosting the conference on Tuesday, Lammy holds the heavy responsibility of securing a collective response to the appalling atrocities committed yesterday and this weekend. It is a tough but rare opportunity to bring international commitment to protect civilians in Sudan from strong words to resolute action.“This means sincerely confronting those backing and enabling atrocity crimes, and establishing a serious senior coalition willing to advance at pace the political and technical solutions necessary to halt genocide, crimes against humanity, war and famine.”Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

US retailers import about 80% of all smartphones, many of them fromChina, which Trump has slapped with tariffs totalling 145%.US Customs and Border Protection said items like laptops, hard drives, smartphones, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Vital machines made outside the US that are used to make semiconductors were also excluded.No retreat on tariffs, Trump promised.

Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.”It is not clear how long the exemption will last or whether separate tariffs will be negotiated on the specific products.China has responded with a tariff on allUS exports of 125%.

We can’t be relying on China for fundamental things that we need.”Lutnick dismissed interpretations of Trump’s reprieve that argued it reflected the president’s realisation that his China tariffs were unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US in the near future.On Sunday Trump warned that no country would be getting “off the hook” on his punishing tariffs, again singling out China for criticism. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!”Apple has spent decades building up a finely tuned supply chain in east Asia, including inside China.

The UN has said they were deliberately shot “one by one” and the bodies, along with the rescue vehicles, were then buried with a bulldozer in a sandy pit, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. Witnesses who uncovered the bodies said the workers were found still in their uniforms and some had their hands tied.The Red Crescent called the attack on its workers a “grave violation of international law” and has called for an international investigation.‘I heard them take their last breath’: survivor recounts Gaza paramedic killingsRead moreNsasrah, 47, fromGaza, who had been working for Red Crescent for 16 years, was among the medics in the ambulances caught up in the ambush, and he had not been seen since. In an interview with the Guardian, another survivor, the Red Crescent volunteer Munther Abed, 27, said he had seen Nsasrah being taken away alive and blindfolded by Israeli officers at the scene of the killings.On Sunday, the ICRC said it had “received information that the PRCS medic Assad al-Nsasrah has been detained in an Israeli place of detention”. The ICRC spokesperson gave no further details on where Nsasrah was being held and confirmed that Israel had not granted access to visit him.“The ICRC has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023,” said the spokesperson. “The ICRC continues to call for access to all places of detention and reiterates publicly and privately that all detainees must always be treated humanely and with dignity.”In a statement, PRCS called on the international community to demand the release of Nsasrah, a father of six, stating that he had been “forcibly abducted while carrying out his humanitarian duties”.There was no immediate comment from the Israel military.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have faced mounting pressure over inconsistencies in their account of the attack. They had initially claimed troops opened fire on vehicles that were “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals.However, the IDFhad to backtrackafter mobile phone footage, from a medic who was among those killed at the scene, showed the ambulances – clearly marked with the Red Crescent logo – driving with flashing red emergency lights and headlights on their vehicles.Abed, the medic who survived the attack, described how he was held for several hours by Israeli forces after the ambulances came under fire. He said he was fully stripped, beaten again and interrogated about his past before he was finally released.The IDF said they were now re-examining “operational information” to understand why the initial account had been “mistaken”, and that an investigation was being carried out.They added that a preliminary inquiry had indicated “troops opened fire due to a perceived threat after a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists”. However, none of those killed in the attack were armed and no proof has yet been presented that any of those killed were Hamas militants.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It also said he was up to date on all recommended vaccines – despite his national health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jrhaving spent years sowing doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccination.Trump himself has previously spread debunked claims about links between vaccines and autism ofteninvoked by Kennedy.Barbella’s report is the most detailed information on the health of Trump, 78, since he returned to the White House in January for a second presidency.RFK Jr giving families ‘false hope’ on autism, says outgoing US vaccine officialRead more“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,” Barbella wrote in his report.The report noted that Trump’s high cholesterol is “well-controlled” with two medications addressing it.The medicines are rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, generic names of the branded drugs Crestor and Zetia. They have improved Trump’s cholesterol over time.Ideally, total cholesterol should be less than 200. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223. In early 2019, the reading came in at 196 and it stood at 167 in 2020. In Sunday’s report, it was listed as 140.Trump’s blood pressure was 128 over 74. That is considered elevated. And people with elevated blood pressure are likely to develop high blood pressure – or hypertension – unless they take steps to control the condition.The report also noted that Trump has scarring on his right ear, the result of a gunshot wound he suffered when a would-be assassin fired at him duringa campaign rallyin Pennsylvania last year.A secret service sniper killed the attacker, who fatally shot one spectator while wounding two others.Barbella’s report also references Trump’s history with Covid-19. Trump was hospitalized during a serious bout with the virus in October 2020 during a run for re-election that ended in defeat to Joe Biden.Amid questions about his age and mental acuity, Biden then dropped out of an electoral rematch with Trump in November 2024 and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, to succeed him. Trump won the popular and electoral votes against Harris to return to the presidency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One version available online asks those undergoing the screening to draw a clock, repeat words, name animals and count backwards from 100 at intervals of seven, among other tasks.Trump’s resting heart rate was 62 beats per minute, in line with previous tests.

The US president is due to meet Bukele at the White House on Monday.It comes as US officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obliged to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported,despite a supreme court ruling directing the governmentto “facilitate” his return to the US.Attorneys for theTrump administrationsaid the high court’s order to “facilitate” the return of Abrego García, 29, meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”, not help extract him from El Salvador.The Trump administration has acknowledged that García, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge’s order blocking his removal to El Salvador. Trump administration lawyers wereable to confirmon Saturday that García remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.Trump said on Saturday he was looking forward to meeting Bukele and praised him for taking “enemy aliens” from the United States. He said the two countries were working closely to “eradicate terrorist organizations”.Administration officials have repeatedly made public statements alleging that detained immigrants are gang members that they have not backed up in court.The Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.Lawyers and relatives of the migrants held in El Salvador say they are not gang members and had no opportunity to contest the US government assertion that they were. The Trump administration says it vetted migrants to ensure they belonged to Tren de Aragua, which it labels a terrorist organization.The deportations have been challenged in federal court. The US supreme court said the US government must give sufficient notice to immigrant detainees to allow them to contest their deportations.

And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.”He went on to add: “A recession is two negative quarters of GDP and whether it goes slightly there. We always have those things. We have something that’s much more profound. We have a breaking down of the monetary order. We are going to change the monetary order because we cannot spend the amounts of money.”No retreat on tariffs, Trump promised. Hours later, he blinkedRead moreDalio’s comments come in response to a tumultuous week across the global stock markets following the US president’stariffspolicies thatincludea 145% tariff raise on China. The billionaire also said there are “profound changes in our domestic order … and world order”, comparing current times with the 1930s.“I’ve studied history and this repeats over and over again. So if you take tariffs, if you take debt, if you take the rising power challenging existing power, if you take those factors and look at the factors, those changes in the orders, the systems, are very, very disruptive. How that’s handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession. Or it could be handled well,” he said.Dalio, who correctly predicted the 2008 recession, also said the current economic state of the US is “at a juncture”.“Let’s take the budget. If the budget deficit can be reduced to 3% of GDP, it will be about 7% if things are not changed. If it could be reduced to about 3% of GDP, and these trade deficits and so on are managed in the right way, this could all be managed very well,” he said.He went on to urge congressional members to take what he calls the “3% pledge”, adding that if they don’t, there will be a supply and demand problem for debt with results that will be “worse than a normal recession.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Retaliatory Chinese-imposed tariffs of 125% on US goods took effect on Saturday.Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, who is now a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, said that during Xi’s tour of neighbouring countries, China would probably “try to position itself as the responsible leader of the rules-based trade system while painting the US as a rogue nation intent on taking a sledgehammer to trade relationships”.It was unclear if meaningful, concrete agreements would emerge from the meetings, but they would be symbolically important, Olson added.What does China really think about Trump? They know about humiliation and won’t take it from himRead moreFor officials in Hanoi, the visit will form part of a delicate balancing act between China and the US, both of which are important economic partners.The US is a crucial export market for south-east Asia and a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s assertiveness in the disputed South China Sea. However, trade in the region is closely intertwined with China, with countries from the regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, counting as the biggest recipient of Chinese exports last year, according to China’s customs data.There are concerns in the region that the 145% tariff imposed on China by the US could lead to a flood of cheap Chinese goods to nearby countries, undermining local industry.Vietnam and many others in the region have traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower its 46% tariff.Vietnam, where US exports account for 30% of GDP, had already made several concessions in the run-up to the tariff announcement, and was shocked by the severity of the tariff announced this month.It has since sent the deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, to Washington, offered to remove all tariffs on US imports and promised to buy more US goods, including defence and security products.Vietnam is also preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US and tighten controls on sensitive exports to China, according to a Reuters report. This includes stricter rules relating to the export of dual-use goods such as semiconductors, which can be used for both civilian and military purposes, it was reported.Vietnam was considered by many to be a winner in the trade war that occurred under the last Trump administration, as many companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the US. However, this caused Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US to surpass $123bn (£94bn), leaving it especially vulnerable in the latest tariff announcement.Vietnam, a communist one-party state, has set an ambitious target of becoming a high-income nation by 2045 – a goal driven by its exports, which would be derailed by the 46% tariff.Cambodia and Malaysia are also seeking to negotiate with Trump. The US tariffs could devastate Cambodia’s garment industry, which employs 750,000 workers. Cambodia is especially exposed as exports to the US account for 25% of the country’s GDP.Xi last visited Vietnam in December but he has not travelled to Cambodia and Malaysia in nine and 12 years respectively. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said the visit to Malaysia would mark “an important milestone” for the two countries, while describing Cambodia as an “iron-clad friend”.The Malaysian communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, said Xi’s visit was “part of the government’s efforts … to see better trade relations with various countries including China”.Cambodia is one of China’s strongest allies in the region and it recently announced the completion of a China-backed project toupgrade a major naval base.The country’s prime minister, Hun Manet, who took the reins from hisdictator father Hun Senin 2023, said at the recent inauguration of a Chinese-funded road that “Cambodian-Chinese ties have not changed”.Xi’s visits form part of a wider charm offensive pursued by China in the wake of the trade war. Xi also vowed to deepen China’s strategic partnership withIndonesiain a call with that country’s president, Prabowo Subianto, on Sunday, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported.On Friday, Xi told the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, during a meeting in Beijing that China and the EU should “jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, Xinhua reported.China’s premier, Li Qiang, spoke by phone with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, last week for talks that emphasised the responsibility of both parties to support a “strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field”.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingTrump tariffsTariffsVietnamCambodiaIndonesianewsShareReuse this content"

It had already become increasingly irrelevant asRussia found loopholes to sell its crudeat normal market rates, they added.The Guardian understands that the UK is now working alongside its international partners to find a way to use the price cap to safeguard Ukraine against the Russian war machine while pushing the Kremlin to engage in a peace process in good faith.The UK government was approached for comment.The cap effectively barred allG7and EU nations from buying Russian barrels above $60 – or providing shipping, insurance, brokering, trade finance and other support services for any deals done above this price.But Russia was able to use a series of loopholes including the use ofa shadow fleet of ageing oil tankersto carry cargoes at the usual market rates.The cap applied to about half of Russia’s seaborne oil cargoes when it was first introduced,according to analysisby the commodity data provider S&P Global Platts, but about 80% was sold beyond the reaches of the gap by the end of last year.“The cap is currently meaningless,” said Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. He told the Guardian that the G7 should consider “tightening the screws” on the Kremlin by lowering the price below $60.“There might be a willingness within the G7 to do this to punish Moscow, especially because there are no real fears about leaving the oil market under-supplied,” he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Praising Musk’s role in the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Navarro added: “Everything’s fine with Elon.”Navarro’s evident attempt to be magnanimous came after MuskcriticizedTrump’s proposals for global tariffs, which the president has since set at 10% on all countries, with some nations receiving higher trade levies.Navarro has had a central role in devising the tariffs. And social media posts fromMuskon Monday targeted Navarro, saying he “truly is a moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”. Musk had also previously said Navarro “ain’t built shit”.Navarro, for his part, had called the chief of the electrical vehicle manufacturer Tesla a “car assembler” rather than a maker.Asked by Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker on Sunday about that back-and-forth, Navarro remarked: “Elon and I are great. It’s not an issue.”Musk thinks Trump’s pal Navarro is a ‘moron’. Who are we supposed to root for here? | Dave SchillingRead moreWelker asked Navarro if Musk’s criticism of the tariffs that Navarro helped develop won with Trump given that the president paused higher trade levies for most countries for 90 days on Wednesday.Navarro would not directly answer. Instead, he alluded to his having served four months in prison beginning in March 2024 because he refused to comply with a subpoena from members of Congress who were investigating the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol that was carried out by Trump supporters after his first presidency ended in defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 election.“Nobody should have to come into this government and have that happen or have to go to jail like I did,” said Navarro, who wasreleasedfrom prison in July and then appointed as the senior counselor for trade and manufacturing at the White House after Trump won his second presidency in November’s election.Navarro had also dismissed Musk’s insults in an interview on CNN’s The Arena with Kasie Hunt.“It’s no problem,” Navarro told CNN. “It’s like – it’s no problem.”Musk has not commented.Asked for her input on the feud between Musk and Navarro, the White House spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt,said:“Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskTrump tariffsUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Emergency officialssaidthey rushed to the scene and attempted to revive him.The incident took place at a lookout point known as Postigo del Consuelo, which is tucked into remains of the medieval walls that surround the city. The small viewing platformhas longattracted throngs of tourists and local people for the sweeping views it offers of the city and aqueduct.With two tiers of arches and stretching more than 800 metres in length, the Roman aqueduct is believedto have been built aroundAD50. It was used until the 1970s to channel water to the city from nearby mountains. Declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1985, it stands at more than 28 metres above ground at its highest point.As is customary in Spain with deaths believed to be accidental, judicial officials have launched an investigation and are gathering testimonies and evidence to confirm the circumstances of the death.When contacted on Sunday, a spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Spain, and are in touch with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She was as wise and funny as anyone I ever met, as well as being very pretty and kind, and talented as both an actress and writer.“An instinctively empathetic person who was loved by everyone who met her. We spoke on the phone almost every day for the past 40 years.”Upstairs, Downstairs, covering class relations in Edwardian England, ran for five series from 1971 to 1975 in the UK and was also screened in the US.

Rather than pursuing a traditional career, Marsh went to theatre school – which her parents considered a practical move, according tothe New York Times.In 1972, she told the Guardian: “If you were very working class in those days, you weren’t going to think of a career in science. You either did a tap dance or you worked in Woolworths.”Marsh came up with the idea for Upstairs, Downstairs with her friend the actor Eileen Atkins when the pair were house-sitting at a wealthy friend’s house in the south of France. After explaining that she wished she lived in luxury more often, Marsh got the idea to create a show that explored class relationships within household dynamics.Explore more on these topicsUpstairs DownstairsPeriod drama (TV)TelevisionDramanewsShareReuse this content"

She has a point. Carter, 31, best known asBridgerton’s Prudence Featherington, is 5ft 10 and aquiline, glamorous in a maroon leather coat and silver-studded shoes. Staunton, 69, is barely 5ft tall, quiet and unassuming in slacks and a blouse, short grey hair pinned back.There’s no hint of grandeur to this theatrical dame, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance in Mike Leigh’sVera Drakein 2004, played Dolores Umbridge in theHarry Potterseries from 2007 and was the last iteration of Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix’sThe Crown. Staunton’s stellar stage career in both straight plays and musicals also brought her afifth Olivier awardfor her recent performance inHello, Dolly!at the Palladium. If anything, she seems slightly in awe of her only child with her husband of 41 years, Jim Carter (AKADownton Abbey’s Mr Carson).The week in theatre: Hello, Dolly!; The Hot Wing King; Fangirls – reviewRead more“She’s everything I could never be, this tall, elegant, confident, gorgeous woman,” Staunton says. “I just sit here and think: ‘In God’s name, how did that happen?’” “I’ve got your eyes and dad’s legs,” Bessie comments. (Both women do indeed have piercing blue eyes.) “Fortunately there’s a line in this play about how you can’t tell that the characters are mother and daughter, because you wouldn’t really pick us out in a crowd [as related]. But it’s always been a life dream of mine to work together.”The dread term “nepo baby” hangs in the air for a moment before Staunton exorcises it. “Surgeons’ children become surgeons,” she says. “Should they be penalised because their parents have done the job before them?” Bessie says the acting profession was demystified for her as a child: their West Hampstead home was frequently visited by the likes of Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson, with whom Staunton appeared in the 1992 comedyPeter’s Friends. Also she observed her parents as jobbing actors beforeVera Drake, and thenHarry PotterandDownton, kicked them into a different league of celebrity.Acting, when she was at school, “was all about fun and dressing up, and being able to carry that on as a grownup seemed like the biggest privilege. But I didn’t want any handouts,” she says. “One of my biggest things is that I got into the National YouthTheatreand then Guildhall [School of Music and Drama] without them knowing who my parents were. Of course, if this were my first gig out of drama school it’d be very different.”Staunton says that for her and Carter, it would only have been a difficult decision to let their daughter act if they didn’t believe she could make a success of it: “That would have been hard, because you’ve got to be honest in those situations. But she was fine, and she’s had to make her own way. We didn’t want her to be handed into the business by us because that wouldn’t have shown any respect.”View image in fullscreenImelda Staunton, centre, takes a curtain call for Hello, Dolly! at the Palladium in London with, from left, Tyrone Huntley, Andy Nyman and Jenna Russell.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesAfter parts inCranford,Doc Martin,Howards EndandBeecham House, Bessie landed the role of Prudence, the snooty and sexually unfulfilled older sister of Nicola Coughlan’s Penelope Featherington, AKA Lady Whistledown, inBridgertonin 2020. It’s hard to recall now what a boon that show’s blend of costume drama, ethnic inclusivity and unbridled rumpy-pumpy proved during lockdown. “It gave everyone a hopeful escapism, which we needed so badly at the time,” recalls Bessie. “And I got one of the few funny, awkward sex scenes in it, which I thought was really important, because not all sex is steamy and romantic.”Being in a long-running TV series was a great technical education, comparable in its way to the six years her mother spent in repertory theatre after leaving Rada in 1976 (though Bessie concedes she had a head start in TV, “because I grew up visiting film sets and knew what a first AD did, what a runner and a dresser did”). She proved her stage acting ability in the pivotal role of Fenny in Dodie Smith’sDear Octopusat the National last year and will soon be seen inOutrageous, the forthcoming drama about the aristocratic Mitford sisters, who remain a source of perennial fascination to biographers and producers. She’ll play writer Nancy alongside Joanna Vanderham as fascist sympathiser Diana, with Anna Chancellor as their mother, Sydney.“I know a weird amount about Nancy Mitford,” Bessie says. “I narrated the audiobook of her novelThe Pursuit of Lovea few years ago; she worked in St Mary’s hospital in Paddington, where I was born, and she went to Francis Holland School, which I dipped my toes into for a few years. It’s my first lead role. It’s a brilliant script by Sarah Williams, and it’s a story about six women, all of them totally unique and all of them raised under the same roof. I originally said quite vehemently to my agent that I didn’t want to do another period drama, but he said: ‘I don’t think you’re going to want to say no to this one … ’”Similarly, Bessie characterisesMrs Warren’s Professionas “a play with two women at the helm in a masculine world – which unfortunately we still do live in – and them not wanting to play by the rules”. In Shaw’s 1893 play, Mrs Warren’s Cambridge-educated daughter Vivie discovers that her mother is a sex worker turned madame, setting up a debate where sex, marriage and commerce intersect. “Basically it’s about capitalism and it could have been written in the last two years,” Bessie adds. “It asks how much longer can we all look away before we have to turn and face what’s really going on in the underbelly of the world?”View image in fullscreenBessie Carter, centre, with Harriet Cains and Nicola Coughlan in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixThe genesis of the show came when Staunton was discussing potential projects with director Dominic Cooke, a trusted collaborator. They’d never worked on a play before but a musical wasn’t an option because, as she says without vanity, “I’ve done all the big ones”. She graduated from the chorus ofGuys and Dollsin the National’s groundbreaking production in 1982 – where she and Jim Carter met on the first day of rehearsals – to play Miss Adelaide in the 1996 revival.Thereafter, she steadily knocked off Stephen Sondheim’s major works withSweeney Todd(2012),Gypsy(2014) andFollies(2017). Cooke, who directed her inFollies, finally persuaded her to do Jerry Herman and Michael Stewart’s light 1964 tale of a turn-of-the century matchmaker,Hello, Dolly!, which she initially dismissed as “sugary”.Staunton had reservations aboutMrs Warren’s Profession, too, having played the role of Vivie during her rep days. “I think at that time I didn’t know what it was about,” she says. “Dominic said read it again. I did and realised that the combination of Dominic – knowing the care he takes – and myself and Bessie might be something interesting.”Acting with her daughter will be another first: “The CrownandHarry Potter, they’re two firsts because there’d never been seven books made into eight films [with the same central cast]. And never on television had you had one long story with three casts playing the same characters.”The Crownwas a particular challenge as – following on from Claire Foy and Olivia Colman – she was playing the version of the queen that contemporary viewers knew best.“That body, that shape, that hair…” she says. “Plus I think it was hard for audiences to accept a new queen if they’d been fond of the previous one.” Bessie chips in: “I found that really exciting as an audience member, seeing the new version.” It was, we agree, like getting a new James Bond, except that the queen was allowed to age.Appearing in a straight play afterHello, Dolly!is something of a relief for Staunton. “It’s odd for me to be in a room where we’re not choreographing, but it’s great because I don’t have to worry about my voice or all that technical side of it,” she says. She and her daughter ran lines together before rehearsals started, either in the family home or at Bessie’s flat in Brixton. “If we’d done that in the first day of rehearsal, looking into each other’s eyes, pretending to be another person, that would have been weird,” she says. “What we have no idea of is what it will be like for an audience watching a mother and daughter playing a mother and daughter. We will be doing things that we have no idea we’re doing just because we are genetically connected.”View image in fullscreenImelda Staunton with Bessie and Jim Carter after being made a dame at Windsor Castle in 2024.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesBoth Staunton and Jim Carter were in BBC One’sCranfordwhen a teenage Bessie won a part in it as a maid in 2007-8, but none of them shared scenes together. And Staunton and her husband haven’t acted opposite each other since that fateful meeting inGuys and Dolls. In the past she’s said they avoided working together “so you bring home different things”. They have also famously rarely spent more than two weeks apart for work. Couldn’t she and Bessie have found a part for him in the Shaw play? “Wouldn’t happen,” grimaces Staunton. “Try as you might, he’s had it with theatre. He’d rather be in the garden.” Bessie adds: “He’d better bloody come and see it, though.”At this point it’s probably worth mentioning that Yorkshire-born Carter dropped out of a law degree at the University of Sussex to join a theatre group called the Brighton Combination in 1968, which put him in early plays by Howard Brenton, but also required him to learn circus skills. “He doesn’t unicycle any more, but he can still juggle and he’s still got all his magic gear,” says Staunton. “He still pulls out a card trick or a coin trick now and again,” Bessie adds. In the early years of their marriage, Carter was a more visible face on film and TV than Staunton. I tell her how fondly I remember his role as a French resistance fighter called Déjà Vu (“Haven’t I seen you somewhere before, m’sieu?”) opposite thelate Val Kilmerin the Zucker brothers’ 1984 war spoofTop Secret!. “Jim’s first screen kiss was with Val Kilmer,” she says with a rueful smile.Everyone always goes, ‘Oh, God, you don’t want to date an actor.’ And I say, but my parents are totally happy and they’re both working actorsTalk turns briefly to mortality. Alan Rickman, who died in 2016, was one of Staunton’s contemporaries at Rada and preceded her in theHarry Potterfranchise as Severus Snape. “We weren’t close friends but I miss his presence and his kindness,” she says. “Once 15 of us went to see a show with him and we ended up at [theatre hangout] Joe Allen’s. It was long before I was inHarry Potterbut he must have started in it because at the end he just got the bill and said” – here she does a terrific impersonation of Rickman’s bone-dry drawl – “Harry Potter’s paying.” Bessie, delighted, says that Anna Chancellor recounted a similar story about Rickman during the filming ofOutrageous.A larger absence in Staunton’s life is Stephen Sondheim,who died aged 91in 2021. “He was a great champion of me but he loved all his stars,” she recalls. “The great thing about him is he would never say: ‘When Patti [LuPone, his Broadway muse] did this part…’ He would just be in the now and you were the best one on that day. After we didSweeney Toddin 2012 he insisted I should play Mama Rose inGypsyin London, but I wasn’t famous enough then, and apparently neither was he, which seems inconceivable.”Gypsydid happen at Chichester in 2014 and duly became a smash hit in London. When he died, Bessie gave Staunton a framed photo of Sondheim sitting in their West Hampstead kitchen during rehearsals forSweeney Todd.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Phil Fisk/The ObserverAt the Olivier awards Staunton paid tribute to her late Irish Catholic mother while accepting the award for best actress in a musical forHello, Dolly!. “If I may say something to my late mum, whose name was Bridie McNicholas,” she said. “Great name, must renew [my] Irish passport. Mum, I’m here at the Albert Hall, I’ve got a prize, but more importantly, I’m about to do a play with your granddaughter. I wish you were here.”Bridie, a talented singer and musician who ran a hairdressing salon, and her construction worker husband, Joe, emigrated to Archway in north London from County Mayo in the 1950s.Bridie and Joe split up when Staunton was in her late teens but got on well even when they found new partners. Bridie died in 2004, a week before Staunton received news of her Oscar nomination. Carter and Bessie accompanied Staunton to that Oscars ceremony, and they took ham salad sandwiches to eat in the limo on the way. “We’ve got our packed lunches for rehearsal today,” says Staunton matter-of-factly. “You’ve got to besustained.”Joe died in 2010. I wonder how he and Bridie would have felt about their daughter being made a dame by King Charles in 2024. “I don’t think they’d have believed it but they’d have been extremely proud,” says Staunton. Bessie says: “We toasted them on the day.” Has ennoblement changed her mother, I ask Bessie. “Yeah, dad and I have to bow to her now,” she grins.Those we lost in 2021: Stephen Sondheim remembered by Imelda StauntonRead moreWhat’s the secret of a long marriage? I ask Staunton. “I don’t think there’s one secret but respect, kindness and humour are the secret to ours,” she says. Bessie is now single, having split with herBridgertonco-star Sam Phillips. “Everyone always goes, ‘Oh, God, you don’t want to date an actor.’ And I say, but my parents are totally happy and they’re both working actors.”They’ve given her a romantic and a professional pattern for life, proving it’s possible to move between film, TV, stage drama and musicals. Bessie lets slip she’s been having singing lessons: “I’d love to be inGuys and Dolls, genuinely.” Would she want to play Miss Adelaide, her mum’s old role and the more comic part, or Sarah Brown, the missionary who gets the romantic songs?“Adelaide, because I like the funny,” she says.“Do both,” says Staunton.Mrs Warren’s Professionis at the Garrick theatre, London, 10 May to 16 AugustExplore more on these topicsImelda StauntonThe ObserverTheatreGeorge Bernard ShawMusicalsTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, he wields it to propel his narrative forward in the kind of urgent, endless staccato rush that sometimes requires the reader to look briefly up and away, if only to gulp at some fresh air.Nova Scotia House, the 51-year-old journalist’s first work of fiction after two books on fashion, tells the story of living through the Aids crisis of the 1980s and early 90s, and how those who survived it will be forever accompanied by the ghostly presence of those who didn’t.Johnny is 19 years old when he meets Jerry, 45, the older, wiser guide who introduces his young charge to London, the gay scene, and a sense of community – a queer community – he has long sought. In his first nightclub, for example, Johnny experiences “people more people, noise like I had not known it, a hard wall, relentless, so many bodies, light mostly red, smoke steaming from bodies, smoke from cigarettes, chemical smoke in the air, Jerry grinning maniacal, in my ear he said, follow me, and Jerry took my hand…”Nova Scotia House is intensely claustrophobic, its jittery rhythm an incantation to all that we can lose in lifeJerry, Johnny says, “was the first man I loved, the first man I loved who died. If we normalise Jerry’s death, we eradicate Jerry. If we normalise the nightmare of HIV, we eradicate its victims.”Porter tells Johnny’s story from the sober – and mostly sad – vantage point of 30 years later. He continues to live in Jerry’s flat, No 1, Nova Scotia House, not merely out of sentiment but because he never quite got his act together enough to leave, and move on. We don’t learn what it is he does for a living, but are instead given the sense that life is passing him by, and that most of his connections now come via dispiriting hookups found on his phone. “Will I see anyone. Don’t care. Sounds rude, it’s not rude.” Mostly, he pines for something deeper, but this he feels is impossible in a city ravaged by redevelopment, obliterating existing neighbourhoods and pricing out natives. Still, he tries. “I want a beer and I want that guy to come over and I know he won’t come over so why do I bother when I know he won’t be coming over. The game is the game. Can I get out. Do I want to get out.”Nova Scotia Houseis intensely claustrophobic, its jittery rhythm an incantation to all that we can lose in life, even as we are still busy living it: youth, hope, optimism, alongside the helpless yearning for a better tomorrow. Its pages are steeped in alienation, and soaked in melancholy. What is it like, Porter posits, to be almost 50 and still feel that the world around you remains so cursorily hostile? How do we maintain our tribes?But while the writing style can seem suffocating, there is purpose to it. It pulls you in, then holds you appalled, hypnotised. It is of course the critic’s bad habit to read autobiography into fiction, but Porter has conjured such intensity here, and such tangibly real characters, that it feels like the gospel truth. This is a book that works both as a tribute to those who died of the cruellest disease, and as a more general lament to love, loss and remembrance. It is profoundly, bracingly human.Nova Scotia Houseby Charlie Porter is published by Particular Books (£18.99). To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

A celebrity force for good? Or is he taking the spotlight away from other, vital arts organisations?Jude RogersSun 13 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 08.03 EDTShareCan one star save Welsh theatre? On a spring morning in Cardiff’s Wales Millennium Centre (WMC), 180 people are thronging for the answers. We’re in the Awen bar next to the gorgeous 1,900-capacity Donald Gordon theatre, which last summer staged the hit playNye, about NHS founder Aneurin Bevan. This experience inspired its lead actor,Michael Sheen, to set up the new Welsh National Theatre (WNT), as he tells us today, scruffy-bearded and check-shirted, bouncing around a much smaller, makeshift stage. “Listen,” he says, responding to an apology for this stage’s minuteness, “I’ve acted in Aberavon shopping centre, so I’m used to being on anything.”Sheen’s latest venture arrives after a hell of a few months, as we Welsh people say, for English-language theatre in Wales.In December, the Cardiff-based National Theatre Wales (NTW – a separate organisation, founded in 2009) closed down, stripped of all Arts Council funding. In January came a cross-party Welsh Senedd report,A Decade of Cuts, revealing Wales ranked second to bottom for cultural spending in Europe (at £69 per person, above only Greece; by comparison, the UK received £91, neighbouring Ireland £149 and poll-toppers Iceland £691).Creu Cymru, a body representing performing-arts organisationsacross Wales, published an even gloomiersector snapshot, underlining “the consistent devaluing of arts and culture through cuts to public funding, and the absence of obvious advocacy at a public and political level.” The Arts Council of Waleshas since announcedan extra £4.4m for arts and culture in the country, but redundancies and threats of closure to venues remain rife. Which raises the question: is Sheen’s advocacy enough?In 2016, I moved back to my native Wales, where Sheen is embraced like a national hero. Today, his energetic persona – part everyman poet, part political orator next door – is undeniably infectious. He announces the theatre’s programme: a Wales-set, touring co-production of Thornton Wilder’sOur Town, which inspired Dylan Thomas’sUnder Milk Wood; andOwain & Henry, a WMC-staged epic about Owain Glyndŵr’s battles with Henry IV. But do his plans help or hinder other theatre-makers in a bold, diverse, modern Wales? And can the WNT quieten murmurings of concern among some figures in the industry?To begin at the beginning: English language theatre in Wales doesn’t just happen in Cardiff, a city only two hours from London (although though it also hosts the award-winningSherman theatre, acclaimed pub venueThe Other Room, and dynamic companies such asHijinx, Taking Flight andTheatr Iolo). In the south Wales valleys are the RCT Theatres, and going west, there’s Milford Haven’s producing theatre, the Torch, Neath’s innovative company Theatr na nÓg and busy hubs such as the Aberystwyth Arts Centre, whose summer season attracts 6,000 people every year.View image in fullscreenSheen, centre, in Tim Price’s play Nye, about the Labour politician’s role in the creation of the NHS.Photograph: Johan PerssonHeading north, there’s Bangor’s Pontio, and one of Wales’s premiere producing theatresTheatr Clwydin Mold, which reopens this summer after three years, following a £50m capital development project part-funded by the Welsh government. Recent successes include Laura Wade’s Olivier award-winning playHome, I’m Darling(starring Katherine Parkinson) and 2019’s rapturously received community productionThe Mold Riots.For full disclosure, I’ve been working with Theatr Clwyd this year, interviewing staff, volunteers, locals, actors and directors about its profound legacy within the small town. One retired brickmaker, Philip Jones, brought me all his 1980s programmes and told me how he fell in love with new storytelling. “The theatre stopped me being a bigot, it stopped me being a racist – it changed my life.”A musical, a community-created play and a debut by Welsh writer Chris Ashworth-Bennion all feature in Theatr Clwyd’s opening season under new artistic director Kate Wasserberg. Sheen spoke to her in March. “He was very curious, wanting to help,” she says, “and refreshingly honest about his using his fame for good, going, ‘Would it be helpful if I was in that play?’” He is also excited by artists that he discovers, she adds. “But, of course, it’s early days, so getting to know each other is really important.”One of the resources I have is a celebrity profile, to bring all these people here today to listen and set up co-productionsMichael SheenProjects running in partnership already thrive across the country, according to an Arts Council of Walesreportpublished last week. These include Craidd (meaning “core” or “heart”), a project bringing theatre to deaf, disabled and neurodivergent people, and Open Book, offering theatre freelancers fully paid shadowing work. NTW’s community-focused project Team also continues as a stand-alone entity – and despite being criticised for staging too few productions, and using non-Welsh writers and directors to make plays about Wales, NTW did have some notable successes, including 2011’s three-day epicThe Passion, starring Sheen.On the day of the WNT launch, Sheen announces they are receiving £200,000 from the Arts Council of Wales, transition funding from the closure of NTW. Later, I speak to the council chair, Maggie Russell. “The Welsh NationalTheatreis a bold new initiative and an exciting addition to Wales,” she says. “Michael has stated he’s looking for a wide variety of funding sources, and we’re really excited about him working in partnership.”View image in fullscreenMichael Sheen performs in The Passion in Port Talbot.Photograph: Tim Ireland/PAOn with the show. Sheen introduces his new company in turn, includingNyewriter Tim Price and TV producerRussell T Davies, who directed Sheen in a production ofDavid Copperfieldat theWest Glamorgan Youth Theatrein 1987. (“That was a real turning point for me,” Sheen says, “when I started to take it seriously.”)Four new plays have also been commissioned from emerging writers from diverse backgrounds. They include Francesca Goodridge,a working-class director from Swansea, who studied acting at Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts after working in a call centre for six years. Frustrated by the lack of good parts for young women, she created the musicalShout!. Azuka Oforka, an alumna of the Sherman theatre’s Unheard Voices programme, is also a recent signing. Her hit playThe Women of Llanrumney, a drama set on a Welsh-run Jamaican sugar plantation, is currently receiving rave reviews at theTheatre Royal Stratford East.Down the corridor in a separate studio, I chat toOwain & Henryplaywright Gary Owen about the historic lack of opportunities to present Welsh stories on a large scale. (Owen talks about the volume of Welsh monodramas, such as the recently revivedIphigenia in Splott, “Because monologues are cheap!”) People wonder why there’s never been “a Braveheart for Wales”, he says. “We need to fill that gap.”Then I get my five minutes with Sheen – under spotlights, after he’s done the rounds for TV. I ask him if he’s been concerned that the WNT might be seen as a vanity project. He begins, carefully: “It’s a balance at first to use whatever resources we have now. One of the resources I have is a celebrity profile, to bring all these people here today to listen and set up co-productions.” He smiles his megawatt smile. “Although the co-production model is also useful because we haven’t got any money!”He talks passionately about his youth theatre days. After that came Rada, West End theatre, films includingThe QueenandFrost/Nixon,and TV roles inMasters of Sex,Good OmensandQuiz– not bad work for a boy from Port Talbot. He took that free training for granted, he says: “My pathway has disappeared, but I want people to have even more opportunities.” He also talks about the importance of connecting Wales geographically (“touring is a big priority … we must remember mid Wales and west Wales”) and confirms that his theatre won’t be bilingual. He says that his first chat was with Steffan Donnelly, artistic director of the Welsh-language national theatre, Theatr Cymru (Theatr Cymru, the Welsh language national theatre, already exists.), adding: “There’s already fantastic work going on in Wales on a small and mid-scale. We want to be able to support and work in collaboration with that.”View image in fullscreenSheen with Welsh National Theatre’s new creative associate, Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies, and Francesca Goodridge, who will direct its production of Our Town.Photograph: Working WordA day after the launch, I’m contacted by a seasoned theatre professional who wishes to remain anonymous. Creu Cymru, the performing arts body whose gloomy snapshot of the industry I mentioned earlier, began its annual conference in the WMC corridors an hour after the WNT launch ended, they say. What did the WNT contribute, I ask? “Nobody from it turned up,” they reply.Michael Sheen to play Welsh prince who led rebellion against the English crownRead moreThis professional doesn’t doubt the “right intentions” behind Sheen’s project, and “the brilliant theatre-makers” within it, but also worries there’s “a lack of awareness” of the mentoring and development going on “every single day” across Wales. “And a new entity has just landed, with a Hollywood star fronting it, bestowing a national name upon themselves – and they’re asking for money. That’s a real worry.”They also make another intriguing point: “If the theatre had called itself the Michael Sheen theatre, no one would mind.” It’s early days, but Sheen’s status as a national lodestar will be monitored closely, not least by the many creatives who make Welsh theatre thrive.Explore more on these topicsArts fundingThe ObserverTheatreWalesMichael SheenNational Theatre WalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Premieredat the 1952 Proms, when it was the only music by any female composer that season, the concerto languished until after Carwithen’s death in 2003. Now the 30-minute piece has been recorded twice, received its German premiere last month, and, in the latest step in its reawakening, was the centrepiece of the latest Barbican Hall concert by Sakari Oramo and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.Quartet by Leah Broad review – Britain’s great female composersRead moreCarwithen’s champions, who include the soloist in both this and the German performances, Alexandra Dariescu, make large claims for concerto and composer alike. Despite Dariescu’s unstinting performance, however, Carwithen’s piece does not entirely justify them. The concerto is accomplished for sure, with neatly crafted moods veering between late romantic and neo-classical, but more is hinted at than is achieved, even in the intimacy between the piano and a solo violin in the slow movement. The closest the concerto comes to a crux or a moment of revelation is in the thundering solo cadenza in the final movement.View image in fullscreenUnstinting … Alexandra DariescuPhotograph: Mark AllanIt took only a few bars of Malcolm Arnold’s fifth symphony, which took up the second half of the concert, to encounter the colour and incisiveness missing from the Carwithen. Arnold’s writing memorialises four friends who had all recently died when the symphony was written in 1961. There is undoubtedly darkness in the scoring but, for the most part, the symphony brims with contrast and confidence. There is a serenity in the slow movement and a jauntiness in the two that follow that make a strong case for treating this as Arnold’s most successful orchestral work. Oramohas long been a committed advocate of it,which this performance confirmed, and he brandished the score for its own round of applause at the end.Right at the start of the evening, the BBC Singers joined Oramo and the orchestra for a ravishing performance of Vaughan Williams’s Serenade to Music . The setting of part of the scene between Lorenzo and Jessica in act five of Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice is one of Vaughan Williams’ most transcendent achievements. In today’s grim times it poured even more balm than usual into the soul.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Symphony OrchestraSakari OramoreviewsShareReuse this content"

On 22 July 2011, Norwegian neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb outside the office of the then prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, killing eight people and damaging surrounding buildings, before murdering a further 69 people on the nearby island of Utøya.But now the same site is to be reconfigured by hope. Last week, after a multi-round, three-year-long selection process, a jury of curators, politicians, artists and representatives of the victims and survivors of the attacks announced the winning design for a new Norwegian national memorial to be unveiled in time for the 15th anniversary in 2026.Norwegian artist Matias Faldbakken’s mosaic Upholding, 12 metres high and 15 metres wide, and made of some 500,000 stones, shows a wading bird native to Utøya reflected in the lake. It is a monumental piece that touches on both societal support and nature.And a mosaic, Faldbakken argues, is the perfect symbol for a memorial site. “A fragmented image, every part plays its role. In old literature, it’s called painting for eternity. A mosaic is one of the only image formats that survives fire, earthquakes and floods.”The mosaic will be braced by a steel rig similar to the one that once secured Pablo Picasso’s mural The Fishermen on one of the blast-damaged blocks in the quarter. Faldbakken, who representedNorwayat the Venice Biennale in 2005, explains that he was initially inspired by walking past the rig holding Picasso’s work, which stood in the Government Quarter for almost three years.View image in fullscreen‘I took my artist’s ego out of the equation’ … Matias FaldbakkenPhotograph: Vegard KlevenBut the main purpose of the monument is not to reference the work of another artist but to serve as “a window to the other crime site”, explains Faldbakken. After triggering the Oslo blast, Breivik travelled to the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, a lake 40km northwest of Olso, where he attacked a summer camp for the Labour party’s youth wing (AUF). Most of the 69 victims were teenagers.“I was out on the island many times,” Faldbakken says. “I started to research the birds. And this small wader had a lot of physical traits that I thought worked: a very small, fragile and light bird with its thin legs. But it has this angle to it. It has a gaze. It pushes you a little bit back.”On Faldbakken’s last visit to Utøya, the lake was completely still, the water a mirror, which inspired the bird’s reflection in the design. It is not meant as a clear symbol of life and death. “This is a very peaceful image but it is almost like a Rorschach test. It has this duality,” he notes. “Breivik was a homegrown terrorist, which mystified this country at the time. There’s that serene Scandinavian facade, and yet there’s the terror underneath.”Survivors and the relatives of those killed will be involved in placing the stones into the composition. The names of the 77 people who died will be engraved on the base of the work.View image in fullscreenA model showing the work from behind, in situ in the Government Quarter.Photograph: Vegard KlevenRegitze Schäffer Botnen, who was a 17-year-old participant at the Utøya camp on 22 July, was a member of the jury. Initially she felt that she was representing all the survivors, “And then I realised that is an impossible task. So, I figured out that I had to dig deeper into the subject and listen to other survivors and people who lost their children, and ask the question not what do you like the most but what is a good memorial? To see what kind of conversation that started, and learn from it.”The transparency and public engagement in the selection process was in part a result of the backlash against a rushed commission for a memorial on Utøya island in 2014. The chosen work, Jonas Dahlberg’sMemory Wound, proposed a permanent three-and-a-half metre gap be cut through the island. The concept was considered by many as memorialising one act of violence with another, andthe project was subsequently dropped. “It didn’t have the grounding of what we’re doing now,” Faldbakken says, tactfully. “And it was very much in the backyard of many people who lived close to Utøya, and were the people who took out their boats and saved the kids.”In 2012, Breivik received a 21-year-sentence, the longest that can be handed down in Norway. “He might theoretically walk past the memorial a free man some time in the future, but it is highly unlikely,” says Thomas Ugelvik, a professor of law at Oslo University. Breivik received aforvaringsentence, which is indeterminate. If he still poses a threat to society the sentence can be extended, potentially for the rest of his life.Arguably, the greatest memorial to 22 July would be the impossibility of such an attack happening again. “We have a greater focus on emergency preparedness than we did before the attack, as well as many safety measures around governmental buildings and critical infrastructure,” says Jens Stoltenberg, who went on to become general secretary of Nato and is now finance minister of Norway. “But no measure can serve as a guarantee against terrorism or extremism. In that sense a memorial is important as a constant reminder of something we would never want to experience again, and that our free and open society can never be taken for granted.”In the wake of 22 July, led by a public address from Stoltenberg, Norwegians came together. Thousands of people participated in a “rose march” the following week, walking from the town hall to Oslo Cathedral holding roses in defiance of extremism. Faldbakken was in the US at the time of the attacks, but two of his children were in Oslo. “It had an echo in our family life, because the kids were really shocked by it. I jumped on the first plane and came back.”Having to take so many peoples’ views and feelings into account while designing the memorial was a very different practice for Faldbakken. “I stood on the side as an artist and thought I’d make the best work I can based on this idea. Pretty early on I took myself and my artist’s ego out of the equation. It was not about me any more; it was about them.”Explore more on these topicsArtAnders BreivikNorwayEuropeSculptureInstallationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.You just have to look at social media to see how big an appetite we have for DIY beauty. The trend for “high maintenance to be low maintenance” routines has seen content creators demonstrate ever-more complicated at-home treatments, from lash lifts to 10-step facials. However, is it all as easy as it looks on TikTok? And is it safe to use all those space-age gadgets and high-strength formulations on yourself without the oversight of an expert?Just because you can do them at home doesn’t mean you should – no matter what the algorithm tells you. To sort the fads from the facts, we asked professionals – from dentists and aestheticians to colourists and gua sha specialists – to find out which beauty treatments you should try at home and which ones you shouldn’t. I’ve also shared the products and devices that are worth investing in and could save you money on professional treatments in the long run.Do try these at homeLight therapy facialsView image in fullscreenCurrentBody LED light therapy face mask: Series 2£399.99 at CurrentBody£399.99 at AmazonLight therapy is nothing new, but it has gained pace as an in-salon treatment in the 2020s – and with good reason. The Light Salon co-founder Laura Ferguson says that it has rejuvenating benefits for the skin, as “exposure to therapeutic wavelengths stimulates collagen, boosts circulation and reduces oxidative stress (which leads to inflammation)”.There’s good news for at-home facialists, too. Pamela Marshall, the clinical aesthetician who co-created Mortar & Milk in London, recommends that clients use LED masks (just make sure they’re high quality and safety-tested – they will be marked as EMA-cleared) at home between appointments. Unlike some other treatments, light therapy is backed by clinical trials, she says. “It has been a part of Nasa-funded research since the 1990s and has been proven over and over to be very effective.”The key to seeing results at home? Consistency. Ferguson says that while salon devices are larger, more potent and allow for more targeted treatments: “An at-home LED device allows for regular use, meaning you can integrate it into your routine, maximising cumulative benefits over time.” Try the CurrentBody mask above to help tackle everything fromredness to dullness and lack of elasticity. It’s an investment, but it can be used as often as daily for 10 minutes.Gua sha for lymphatic drainageView image in fullscreenCecily Braden jade gua sha£34 at Mandy PitcherView image in fullscreenJade gua sha£15.50 at Green PeopleThere are many benefits to using gua sha, the traditional Chinese medicine technique where a smooth-edged tool is used to scrape the skin. It canincrease blood circulation, support lymphatic flow (the system that drains leaked tissue fluid back into the bloodstream), ease tension and promote healing. And itissafe to do at home – just be sure to invest time in learning the correct movements over the face and neck. Donna Ryan, a holistic facialist and gua sha specialist in London, says that “proper technique is essential, as poor form can lead to bruising or irritation”.Don’t be put off, though – just go in gently. “Use light pressure, especially around sensitive areas like under the eyes or on active breakouts, or inflamed skin, rashes or compromised skin barriers. It should never hurt,” says Ryan. The key is to use upwards or outwards motions towards the lymph nodes, along the direction of the muscle fibres. Plus, “skin preparation is key: always apply a suitable facial oil to create glide and prevent tugging,” she adds.Try practising for five minutes twice a week, but remember: never use exfoliating devices or products immediately before or after. Ryan rates the Cecily Braden pocket jade gua sha for beginners.EMS facials for lifting and skin healthView image in fullscreenZiip Halo£379.99 at Ziip BeautyEMS (electrical muscle stimulation) devices, which tone your facial muscles, are another gadget gaining pace in-salon and have been popularised by FaceGym salons’ cult “workout” sessions. The Light Salon also uses them, and Ferguson says: “In our salon, we use microcurrent devices designed to deliver low-level electrical currents, which help re-educate facial muscles and support ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the cell’s energy currency) production.”As for at-home versions, Ferguson says they have benefits if used with the “correct technique and frequency” and she thinks they can complement LED treatments. If you’re in the market for a device, the Ziip Halo, co-created by Hollywood aesthetician Melanie Simon, is the one to know. It’s great for beginners because it’s ergonomic, handbag-size and preloaded with a timed routine – or you can use the app to pick from targeted programmes for everything from frown lines to clearing blemishes. It can be used similarly to gua sha, gliding over facial contours.Don’t expect magic or instant results: it’s not as strong as in-salon devices (for your safety). The Halo does, however, have additional benefits for skin condition because it also uses nanocurrent,which the brand says works on a cellular level to promote collagen production and regeneration. Try using the device about three times a week with the conductive gel provided, but no more, as Simon says: “Certain app treatments really work the facial muscles, so it’s important to have a rest day in between.”Hair glossing for glass hairView image in fullscreenGlaze Clear conditioning gloss£15.99 at Superdrug£15.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenK18 Peptide Prep detox shampoo£39 at K18 Hair£39 at Cult BeautyThere’s nothing like that salon-fresh feeling of bouncy, shiny locks that have just been dyed. After about a month, though, you’ll likely find that your hair looks a tad lacklustre. It’s probably because the gloss treatment, which coats the hair cuticles and adds nourishment and shine, has worn off. So, can you DIY between appointments? Amy Fish, a colourist at Larry King salons, gives the all-clear, as long as it has no colour in it. If it contains pigment, it could lead to a patchy finish if you’re doing it solo. “This is best done by a stylist who can take the hair in sections to make sure the product is evenly applied,” says Fish.Glaze’s Clear conditioning gloss is ammonia-free and can be used on dry hair, taking just 10 minutes to develop. Bear in mind that losing the “glass” shine you leave the salon with could also be due to hard-water buildup, which “leaves residue on the hair – especially on blondes – and can, over time, change the tone of the hair”, says Fish. Use a deep cleansing shampoo every few washes to prevent buildup. I like K18’s Peptide Prep detox shampoo.Approach with cautionTeeth whiteningView image in fullscreenOver-the-counter teeth-whitening products can result in uneven results.Photograph: webphotographeer/Getty ImagesIf you want a megawatt, pearly-white smile, at-home treatments might not be the way to get it. Teeth are sensitive so, for safety reasons, at-home treatments are rarely strong enough. Dr Sam Jethwa, president of the British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, says: “In the UK, there is a limit on how much hydrogen peroxide over-the-counter teeth-whitening products can contain.” Hydrogen peroxide “is needed to effectively whiten the teeth by a few shades, with long-lasting results”.Over-the-counter products, such as teeth-whitening strips, pens, powders and whitening mouth guards, are also likely to create an uneven finish. This is because “the canine teeth are typically a darker shade than the rest of the teeth,” says Jethwa. Dentists can provide you with a whitening tray moulded to the shape of your teeth, which means you can control where you put the gel, and even whiten one tooth at a time.Don’t be tempted to buy a product from outside the UK: it could “contain levels of hydrogen peroxide over the legal amount, which can be harmful to teeth and gums, resulting in tooth sensitivity, loss of enamel and inflamed gums”, says Jethwa.If you opt for a treatment with your dentist, whitening kits generally cost from about £200, and you can expect to see results within two weeks. Importantly, as Jethwa says, “the dentist will check the health of the teeth and gums to ensure you’re a suitable candidate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Formulas may have come on leaps and bounds since then, but there are still some pitfalls of doing it at home – rather than getting a professional spray tan – that you should be aware of.Astanning professional James Harknettpoints out: “Your therapist should make the tan bespoke to your skin tone to give you the finish that’s authentic, while with at-home tanning it’s more of a case of trial and error, based on what the packaging promises. You’ll probably have to contort yourself to reach certain areas and even once you’re done, you might need to correct missed areas.”For these reasons, I find gradual tanning products are the smartest choice for home use, as you can build it over time and are less vulnerable to obvious errors and overdoing the depth. Three Warriors makes the creme de la creme of tan in my opinion (and Harknett’s – the brand’s global creative artist). The products have skincare benefits, too, as they’re boosted with skin-nurturing ingredients, such as vitamin E and aloe vera.Try the Three Warriors gradual tan on your body (don’t forget to exfoliate first). And for your face, the brand’s radiant complexion serum is a lovely overnight serum-tan hybrid that’s easy to apply evenly. Just remember: wash your hands immediately afterwards!Leave it to the prosMicroneedlingView image in fullscreenMicroneedling at home without clinical-level cleansing can introduce infections.Photograph: marcinm111/Getty ImagesIt goes without saying that injectables should be left to the pros: there are obvious safety and hygiene concerns over using needles at home. However, it’s commonplace for people to buy dermarollers or microneedling pens on the internet to get the anti-ageing benefits you might see from salon treatments. They’re considered “minimally invasive” as they use tiny needles, but as clinical aesthetician Pamela Marshall says: “They’re on the top of my ‘don’t do this at home’ list.”So why is it liable to go wrong? “Microneedling makes thousands of microchannels in the skin, which equates to microwounds. We do this to get our healing mechanism kicking in so that we build more collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid. But let’s be clear: it is a wounding process where we are inserting needles into our skin,” says Marshall.Without proper training, you’re likely to be “performing these treatments without medically cleansing the face, without using sterile devices and without the correct technique at the correct depth”, says fellow aesthetician Dr Leah Totton. This “can lead to skin irritation, cuts and skin scarring, introduction of infection, irritation to the hair follicles and sensitive skin”.Plus, there’s another possible unsightly side-effect: “You can over-produce collagen, which can give you an orange-peel-like texture. If you don’t understand skin, you really shouldn’t be messing with it,” says Marshall.Lash liftsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: dimid_86/Getty ImagesLash lifts or perms create the appearance of naturally fluttery, full lashes, and can be combined with tinting or even extensions. They last up to two months and rival the results of the best mascaras and curlers, or even falsies. You can buy at-home kits for the semi-permanent treatment, but it’s incredibly difficult to do alone: your eyes need to be closed during tinting, and you should never get the solution in your eyes.There are plenty of other potential pitfalls. Teresa Smith is a London-based lash artist who works with celebrities and prestigious clients, and she knows how painstaking a process it is. “To avoid over-processing or curling the lashes too much, lash lifting requires an extreme level of application accuracy and precision timing of each solution used,” she says.Over-processed lashes will look brittle and sit in the wrong position, possibly hitting the eyelid. And, as Smith says: “Contrary to popular belief, applying castor oil or lash conditioners will not fix over-processed lashes; it can only be remedied by having a lash relaxation treatment with a professional.” So you might end up shelling out even more money to fix a bad DIY job. In short: leave this one to a professional. Smith’s signature and bespokeLazy Lash Look treatmentstarts from £175. In London, a lash lift and tint can vary in price from £90 to £300 at reputable salons.Brow laminationView image in fullscreenInstead use: Refy Brow Sculpt£18 at Refy Beauty£18 at SephoraPerming or “laminating” your brows from your bathroom is also a bad idea. “At-home kits can burn the skin and over-process the brows,” warns Smith. “Even with a really gentle brow-lamination kit, excessive brushing of the brows with too much pressure can cause micro-scratches on the skin, which will open you up to overexposure to the chemicals and irritation, as well as the potential for future allergies.” All of this would be visible on your face.If you want a quick fix – and you have relatively full arches naturally – Refy’s recently relaunched Brow Sculpt is a cult product for a reason. The new formula is excellent for shaping and setting with a double-ended brush. The setting formula is a wax-gel hybrid, so it doesn’t look cakey or leave tell-tale white flecks.Gel manicures and pedicuresView image in fullscreenInstead use: Wonderlayer£12 at Beauty PieJust because you can buy an at-home gel mani kit, doesn’t mean you should. There’s an obvious allure to having long-lasting colour without the salon cost, but even if you’re dexterous and can work at pace, it’s best left to the pros.“We strongly advise against doing gel manicures at home, without proper training,” says Giorgia Cappella, head of education and spa at the GelBottle Inc. “Achieving safe, and professional, results requires specialist training, as improper application and curing (setting the nails with LED), as well as incorrect removal, can lead to issues including skin irritation and nail damage, such as thinning or lifting.”Plus, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to buy the same kit for at-home use. “Salon-grade products are often higher quality and longer-lasting than those available to consumers. And our salon UV/LED lamps are typically more powerful and consistent, ensuring proper curing,” says Cappella. You’re best off sticking to good old-fashioned nail polish at home. Wonderlayer byBeautyPie is a great base coat to achieve vivid colour.Hayley Spencer is a journalist and editor with 15 years of experience in writing on topics spanning style, beauty and wellnessExplore more on these topicsBeautyThe FilterSkincarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sunglasses make you appear soulless. Like a vampire. Vampires are cool.LeonedAny covering of an expressive body part that can easily be taken off creates an interest in what is being hidden. As eyes are so significant in our interactions, when it comes to glasses, the part to a degree stands for the whole.ErbiumBecause cool is the art of not sweating – visibly or emotionally – and sunglasses are a sleek little lie that tells the world: you can’t see me blink. They cloak your eyes, the ultimate betrayers, turning your face into a mask of mystery. AsRoland Barthesmight say, they transform the human into the icon, the expressive into the impenetrable. Behind dark lenses, you’re not a person – you’re a myth.Alex HobanThey make you look Italian, which is, by definition, cool.jingjangleIn my case, it’s because the future’s so bright,I’ve got to wear them.PeteTheBeatCool, in this sense, means “not showing emotion; calm and in control of oneself”. Sunglasses hide the eyes, through which most emotions are consciously or unconsciously expressed. Ergo, sunglasses make you look cool (as, I hope, does using a word such as “ergo”).TangokittyThey lend an air of anonymity, insouciance; a dash of glamour, a hint of mystery …provided they’re not worn at night.mlhoustonDo they?

I was under the impression they made me look like an utter berk …captainslouchYou can see out, but they can’t see in. Like a limousine.bodfishbiker/VegansRuleThePlanetCoolness is a social construct and also highly subjective. Wearing sunglasses with a leather coat was cool in 1999; less so now. Yellow polarised golf sunglasses will never be cool. That said, I think sunglasses can make people look more attractive by creating an exaggerated pastiche of large, dark eyes. We tend to associate attractiveness with coolness. Also, they invariably remind us of being outdoors in summertime, perhaps around a swimming pool or while driving; all markers of desirable social status.FesLerdinand“It’s a hundred and six miles to Chicago. We got a full tank of Gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it’s dark and we’re wearing sunglasses.” (The Blues Brothers.) You can’t get much cooler than that.FallowfieldMy main theory is that what makes people look cool while wearing sunglasses is the emotionally unavailable feature, the distance, the detachment. Not necessarily in a romantic manner, but also in terms of friendship and community. Therefore, when we cannot distinguish the pupil growing or reducing, we cannot distinguish emotions, reactions, attitudes. Humans, when vulnerable themselves, are not hard to read, to understand, to connect with. This aloofness is fascinating, intriguing, mysterious – somehow sensual and appealing. However, let’s be honest, no one can beat the feeling we get when the pupils of someone we are attracted to dilate; as magnetic love or sexual tensions grow; as we let go of our defenses and let ourselves transition into comfort. All that in the presence of someone so dear to us.ClaraSunglasses bring symmetry to your face. They even out all the quirks of symmetry of uneven eyebrows, eyes and nose. Symmetrical people are beautiful and sunglasses trick the viewer into seeing a symmetrical person. On top of that, for the older generation, laughter lines, eye bags and tired eyes are hidden.

A rise in fraudulent orders for luxury foodstuffs has rattled the industry, leaving artisan producers with unpaid bills and a truckload of questions…Will ColdwellSun 13 Apr 2025 01.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 08.09 EDTShareOne day in October 2024, Chris Swales, 54, a smoked-salmon producer with a confident demeanour and a stubbled jaw, stood at the gates of an industrial estate in east London staking out the units. There were teenagers loitering about, knackered cars, XL Bullies; everyone seemed to have more than one phone. It didn’t seem like the sort of place where nine pallets of frozen fish would be delivered, but – he checked the address he had noted down from the courier – this was the place.A couple of months earlier, Swales couldn’t have imagined that he’d be sniffing around Walthamstow on the hunt for £37,000 in missing produce, yet here he was. In August, he’d received an email – subject: “Collaboration” – from a man named Patrick Moulin, who claimed to be the buyer for Match, a French supermarket. Moulin was looking for an ongoing supplier of smoked salmon and hoped that Swales’s company, theChapel & Swan Smokehousein Exning, Suffolk, would provide it.The orders were big. Notcrazybig, but big enough to make Swales reconfigure the production schedule of his 10-person team to meet it. Over the following weeks they worked “hammer and tongs”, loading up the produce in batches to be frozen and stored at a depot in Grimsby until the total order was completed. Soon enough, Swales was notified that it had been collected and the appropriate paperwork signed.Two weeks later, Swales was still waiting to receive payment. He chased, but when Moulin requested he take payment on receipt of the second batch of smoked salmon – worth another £55,000 – Swales put his foot down: “I was never going to say yes to that.” The line went cold.Calls to Moulin now went unanswered. So Swales phoned Match directly and asked to be put through to their buyer. No, a woman on the other end of the line told him, no one by the name of Moulin here. Swales felt a sense of panic rising. He was determined to find out where the goods went, so the next morning he hopped in his car and sped to London. “I knew something was wrong,” he said. “But still I was thinking to myself, this is very, very odd. I mean, I’ve never heard of anyone stealing frozen smoked salmon before. Why would you want it?” Deep down, he still believed that everything would work out.I knew something was wrong. But still I was thinking to myself, this is very, very oddNow, surveying the units in the yard, he was less sure. None of the units seemed refrigerated, but he spotted a shipping container at the back with a condenser attached, which he reckoned could have done the job. He strode in and a man with a dog approached. “You don’t know anything about a frozen distribution point for a French supermarket?” Swales asked. He was met with an icy stare. “Sorry,” Swales mumbled, “I think I’ve got the wrong address.” He hurried out of the yard and got back in his car, heart racing. The cold reality of what had happened finally sunk in. “I was so furious that I’d been duped,” he says. “Then all these other stories started coming out…”In late October 2024, news broke thatNeal’s Yard Dairy, one of the UK’s best-known purveyors of artisan cheese, had fallen victim to a scam of grand proportions. A fraudulent buyer, who posed – much like Moulin – as a representative for a major French retailer, placed an order for 22 tonnes of award-winning cheddar. A total of 950 clothbound wheels of Hafod, Westcombe and Pitchfork worth £300,000 were delivered to a warehouse in London. By the time Neal’s Yard realised that the buyer was not who they said they were, it was too late.The GreatCheeseRobbery struck a chord, making headlines around the world. “That’s a Lot of Cheddar” read one in theNew York Times. Jamie Oliver put out a warning to his 10.5m Instagram followers. “If anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it’s probably some wrong ’uns,” he said in a video posted to the app. “Are they going to unpeel it from the cloth and cut it and grate it and get rid of it in the fast food industry, in the commercial industry? I don’t know – it feels like a really weird thing to nick.”Something about a crime of this nature captured the imagination. It was both shocking – a friendly independent business, defrauded – and comic, evoking the plot of a Wallace and Gromit film.Foodtheft is often thought of as unserious, but the scale of this offence challenged that assumption. Just as rates of shoplifting were reaching a 20-year high, organised criminals were homing in on big busts of luxury fare, reaffirming the value of a commodity too often taken for granted. These were people with a knowledge of the industry, an eye for high-value produce and the means to shimmy it undetected through blackmarket channels. The correspondence Swales had with Moulin contained a detailed negotiation over quantities and logistics; Neal’s Yard described the fraud as “deceptively convincing”, adding that “Conversations with the alleged representative demonstrated a deep understanding of the sector.”View image in fullscreen‘How are they going to get rid of the cheese? It feels like a really weird thing to nick.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The ObserverAccording to a report by the British Standards Institute, food is the commodity “most at risk of theft in global supply chains” and the degree to which it is being targeted has been rising. In 2021, 18% of supply-chain thefts in the UK were related to food and drink. In 2023, this figure had jumped to 24%, with food and drink amounting to a third of all hijacking incidents globally. The price of food rocketed by 25% between 2022 and 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics, and during this period headline-grabbing heists abounded. In Greece, 52 tonnes of olive oil were siphoned from a warehouse in Halkidiki; in Spain, a gourmet food business was robbed of 400 legs of Iberico ham with a total price tag of €200,000. In December 2023, a trailer containing £50,000 worth of cheese was stolen from a service station on the M5 in Worcestershire.Crimes of this sort are not new – £12.5m of maple syrup was stolen from a facility in Canada in 2012 – but in recent years numerous factors have combined to make high-value food far more appealing to criminals. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis all drove up food prices, as has the impact of climate change – drought in Spain caused the price of olive oil to jump by 70% in 2023. A decade ago, Russia banned the import of EU food, creating a lucrative hidden market. Many suspect that the cheddar from the Neal’s Yard heist has gone east, where demand for European delicacies remains high. Custom officers in Russia are known to have busted shipments of Dorblu Classic, Formaggio Retinato Leone, Chèvrano XO and Grana Padano, all being smuggled across the border (it’s impossible, it seems, to sanction one’s desire for a cheese plate).Here in the UK, Brexit created an additional vulnerability for what is sometimes described as “European distribution fraud”. As Alice Rizzuti, a criminologist at the University of Hull with a specialism in food crime, told me: “People might have thought being out of the common market would have meant more controls and checks on the border. But, actually, it was the opposite. And because we’re not part of the EU any more, the cooperation with EU counterparts is not as much as it used to be.”Rizzuti tells me that attention to food crime has risen in the past decade, driven primarily by high-profile crimes. It started in 2013, when the UK was roiled by the horse-meat scandal that led two years later to the formation of the National Food Crime Unit, a law enforcement branch of the Food Standards Agency. The tendency to see food crime as less serious, she explains, is one reason that it has been able to proliferate – it’s a lower stakes racket than, say, drug smuggling – and often the crimes are committed by those within the industry who may be otherwise running a legitimate business. “But it is serious,” she says. “Because of the safety, security and reliability of the food market. And whether it is fraud or theft, there are often links to other crime types – organised criminals might be using the profits to commit other crimes.”Whether it is fraud or theft, there are often links to other crime typesFor John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food, it’s the level of sophistication that has changed. Parmigiano Reggiano, he points out, has always been a commodity targeted by thieves, and in 1998 Jamie Montgomery had £30,000 worth of award-winning cheddar stolen from his warehouse in Somerset.Thatgreat cheese robbery (as headlines at the time also cleverly referred to it) was a relatively straightforward smash-and-grab. “But last year,” says Farrand, “it seems like these thieves stepped up the level by which they operated. What they understood about the food that they were stealing and the way they communicated with these small food and drink producers was – dare I say – quite clever. They spoke in the language of a buyer, they provided fake paperwork… I think [this crime] has always been here but it’s got smarter – probably because there’s more money in it for the robbers.”When word got out that Swales had fallen victim to a fraud, his phone started ringing. He began to hear from many other small food producers, some with far worse experiences than his own. There was another smoked salmon producer, he told me, who was bankrupted after losing £80,000 in a similar fashion and had to remortgage his house. Swales was also contacted by a haulage company that had been left with unpaid invoices after delivering huge quantities of alcohol from Ukraine to France over the summer. In that particular case, the name of the customer was familiar: Patrick Moulin.Another producer who got in touch was John Gill fromCoston Hall Dairy, in Norfolk. While he hadn’t been defrauded out of any produce himself – in fact, the farm really only sold small quantities of raw milk from an on-site vending machine – he had fallen victim to an identity theft in which criminals co-opted Coston Hall’s details in order to place dozens of orders for cheese, fruit and meat with different producers around the country. One of the biggest orders, he says, was for a container of salmon for £150,000.Gill only became aware of this, he tells me, when he began receiving phone calls from suppliers who wanted to confirm an order. He came out of a meeting in late November 2024 to find a dozen missed calls. Every day for the next two weeks he’d get several more, each time he’d have to explain and the supplier would cancel the order. He still has no idea how many people got fooled; the scammers, he later discovered, had changed the contact details on Coston Hall’s searchable Google profile, so that if someone used that number to verify an order, they would have been directed right back to the criminals (only those who used the number on their website got through to John). All he could do was try to get the word out through their network – posting on social media and putting a banner on their website. But it was a nerve-racking experience. “It really got in your head,” Gill said. One worry was that they might start hearing from producers expecting them to pay up. His sleep was affected, his ability to trust. “I mean, I don’t even know if you’re who you say you are,” he tells me when we speak over the phone.View image in fullscreenScene of the crime: the police are often left scratching their heads and looking for clues.Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The ObserverAgain, it was a sophisticated operation. The fraudsters took Coston Hall’s details from Companies House, and used a photograph of Gill’s wife in communications, to appear more trustworthy. One producer Gill spoke to was contacted by the scammers several weeks earlier – priming him for a future order – and others were told to prepare for up to £1m worth of future trade. The fraudsters requested 30-day payment terms, or they’d try to pay by credit card and if the supplier did a credit check it would come up fine, since they were using Coston Hall’s details. Gill is certain that during this period the fraudsters themselves phoned the farm, in order to suss out how to evade detection for longer, which he still finds chilling.Just like Swales, Gill believes he was dealing with specialists. According to producers he spoke to, the people on the other end of the line “sounded very genuine. They knew what they were talking about. They knew the industry.” There was a group of around four or five people, he believes, all with Essex accents. The food was all being directed to Southend. Gill suspects the food might be destined for Christmas markets. For smaller quantities, perhaps. But Swales and the cheesemakers affected by the Neal’s Yard theft believe that it would be very difficult to shift this kind of food in the UK once restaurants and retailers were on alert. As Swales points out, it’s a small community. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, so I know most,” he says. “I started sending out warning emails to say if you get offered some frozen smoked salmon without a brand label for the French market, let me know straight away. “I expected someone to go, ‘Yeah I saw some of this at the market last week.’” The fact that they didn’t was another strong indicator that the salmon had left the country.Swales believes that the police could be doing far more to hunt down the perpetrators. He reported the offence to Action Fraud and several weeks later received a response informing him that “It has not been possible to identify a line of enquiry which a law enforcement organisation in the United Kingdom could pursue.” To Swales, this was staggering. There was, he says, a CCTV camera outside the entrance to the industrial estate. All the police would need to do is spot the delivery truck, track the licence plate and they’d be on the tail of his stolen fish. “I was just so angry and upset,” he said. “Inertia and inaction is something I just can’t handle.”When I put this to Action Fraud I was told that “Over 850,000 reports are made to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau every year and not all cases can be passed on for further investigation. Reports are assessed against a number of criteria, but not every case of fraud will result in a judicial outcome.” I also raised it with the National Food Crime Unit, which told me that it takes food crime very seriously and had put out an alert to the industry about last year’s incidents, but that theft and distribution fraud was primarily a police matter. In a statement it said: “Although it’s our view that food fraud in the UK remains at a low level, the drivers and motivations for food fraud are evolving… Food businesses can help ensure they don’t become a victim of theft or fraud by doing their due diligence with suppliers and customers.”Food businesses can help ensure they don’t become a victim of theft or fraud by doing their due diligenceThe investigation into the Neal’s Yard theft, however, has shown some promise. Last October, police in the Met’s Specialist Command Centre arrested a 63-year-old man on suspicion of fraud by false representation and handling stolen goods. In January this year three more men were arrested, all on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and handling stolen goods. “We’re all waiting for the outcome of this,” says Swales.What is certain, though, is that last year’s crime spree has been a wake-up call for artisan and independent food producers. “We’d like it to be taken more seriously by the police,” says Farrand, “because it is theft and it can ruin businesses, and therefore it can ruin people’s lives. But from the other side, the industry needs to be probably a bit more savvy and a bit more aware of these things. There is this lovely trust within our end of food and drink. People transact and try to source from local producers and you do just expect to receive some goods and get an invoice. And that shouldn’t go away because 99.9% of the time everyone is a decent human being. But equally you do need to be on your guard.”It has changed how Swales operates. “I’ve learned to be much more cautious,” he says. “To take things slowly.” Recently he had an inquiry from someone who wanted to buy straight away and he declined. “I could end up putting someone off… especially with fish, where everything is straight away, straight away and there’s this energy, electricity in the business… but now I’m just very suspicious,” he says. “I know it will cost me some money and some opportunities, but I would much rather do that than go through what I’ve been through before.”There is still, he feels, something to feel optimistic about, proud even, as a fine-food producer. After we speak, he sends me a follow-up email. “The rash of fine-food fraud recently points to the quality of food production in the UK these days,” he writes. “Clearly highly valued.”Explore more on these topicsFoodThe ObserverCrimeCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every month in recent years, I’ve taken between £2,500 and £3,000 out to live off it. Then, at 67, I could have bought a decent annuity. It was fine, untilthe tariffs on Trump’s ‘­liberation day’.”Within a few days, Fraser’s pension pot had lost £32,000 in value, a drop of nearly 23%. The markets reversed some of their losses afterTrump paused most of his “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days on Wednesday, but have been volatile amid thetit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijingand are still well down on the start of the month.The stock market scares me, but it’s my only chance of living a comfortable retirementRachel, 60sAlthough this had not been the first market shock Fraser’s retirement ­savings had been exposed to, the impact on his savings was so severe that he has been thinking about returning to work.Having made total contributions of £198,000 to his pension over 30 years, Fraser’s stock market investments have netted him more than £50,000 in just three years. Even thoughLiz Truss’s mini-budgetand Trump’s tariffs have reduced these returns sharply, his overall gains are still substantial.“It was really good while it lasted, I still got 22 grand out of those three years,” Fraser said. “The question is now: is this sustainable? It could go horribly wrong. Trump’s presidency has cost me a hell of a lot. I’m currently down to £108,000 and considering a supermarket part-time job. It’s crazy, but I’m staying in [the stock market], I just don’t feel like I’ve got a lot of choice.”Fraser was among a host of people from around the globe who shared how their invested pensions had been faring in recent months and years, with many reporting unprecedented gains over the past two years and then devastating losses since Trump’s ­tariff war began. Many said their ­pension pots had reduced by 10% or more since the beginning of April, with some – especially younger respondents who were invested in funds with higher risk exposure – reporting that up to 50% of their overall all-time gains had been wiped out.Some said their financial plans were now in tatters, as they had been in the process of taking out their tax-free pension lump sum in the UK to pay off their mortgage, but now no longer had the funds they had wanted to draw down. Among them was Xenofon Schizonikas, a 55-year-old vet from Omagh, Northern Ireland.View image in fullscreenFraser, 63, said he was considering getting a part-time job.“Before Trump took over, my slightly conservative stakeholder pension was doing extremely well, at some points gaining £7,000 in one day,” he said. “Since he took over I have lost a lot. As of today, I’m down £35,000 from a peak of £357,000. I turned 55 on 1 April and was planning to retire and draw down money to pay off my mortgage, but disaster struck in March.“I have pancreatic cancer and was hoping to retire on my pension fund and spend the time I have left with my children, but that is no longer possible. I now have to work until I drop or they medically retire me.”Although scores of those who got in touch expressed shock and existential anxiety about the effects of extreme market volatility on their life savings, most said they would keep their money invested. The typical reason given for hunkering down was a worry that their savings were simply too meagre to withstand ­decades of inflation.“I’ve worked all my life, but I’ve never earned enough to save enough for retirement,” said Rachel, a nurse in her 60s from Philadelphia.“The stock market scares me, but it’s my only chance of living a comfortable retirement. If I get out now, what’s left of my funds may be ‘safe’, but they are too small to last me until the end anyway, so I have to stay in and gamble.”Others, however, have come to a different conclusion in recent months. Christopher Gallivan, 75, a retired engineer from New Hampshire, felt he could not afford to expose his retirement fund to a global market meltdown caused by tariffs and geopolitical upheaval.“Normally a good portion of my IRA [individual retirement account] is invested in stocks,” he said. “However, when the market began to show signs of uncertainty approximately six to eight weeks ago, I sold all my stock and instead bought CDs [certificates of deposit]. Not as much of a return, 4.5%, but not a loss either.“At my age I have to be careful with my nest egg and feel that the best way to do that is by going self-directed. I don’t have time to wait for a market rebound. Inflation is a certainty.”Others said they were mulling whether to ditch investments in stocks, shares and bonds and buy an annuity instead for more security.Every time a politician tries to make a point I lose money in my pension potAndrew, 74Many people in their 50s and 60s who had been planning to retire imminently said the uncertainty of the past two weeks had caused them to postpone their plans, although people in physically demanding jobs feared they would not be able to carry on for as long as needed. Various retirees said they were pondering returning to work.Most alarmed were, unsurprisingly, those who had been retired for some time, typically in their 70s and 80s, for whom returning to work was not an option.“Every time a politician tries to make a point I lose money in my pension pot,” said Andrew Gale, a 74-year-old retired electronics engineer from Ruthin, Wales. “Liz Truss lost me 25% of the pot: God alone knows how much the manic Trump will cost me.”Various people who were already retired or were about to retire said they simply did not have time to wait for their funds to regain value and would have to draw out money from their diminished pensions, even though that meant their so-far-theoretical “paper losses” would crystallise.Colin, a 63-year-old university lecturer from Bradford in the UK, felt that people like him should have been warned to act before their pensions got decimated.“I didn’t have a large pension, and courtesy of Donald Trump’s policies, that’s dropped by 9% since mid-February,” he said. “I was looking to retire in August, [but now] I will probably have to keep working. It’s soul-destroying when you’re desperate to finish work and you can’t.People try to time the market and get burned, and I don’t want to be one of themCharlie, 59“What annoys me is the way financial advisers ignore short-term threats to pension investments. They repeat their mantra about ‘time in the market’ bringing a better return than trying to ‘time’ the market. But if there is an out-of-control train hurtling towards you, it makes sense to step off the tracks until it’s passed by.”His financial adviser, he said, had invested £50,000 cash in mid-February in funds that had now all plummeted in value. “It’s just a system that feels fraught with dangers for ordinary people.”Charlie, 59, a tech professional from North Carolina, agreed that the blanket advice to “stay the course and buy the dip” was risky for older people.On the other hand, he was among those who felt they had no choice but to continue to follow the advice of fund managers and financial advisers.“My partner and I had a discussion, when Trump got elected, about whether to pull our money out,” Charlie said. “We decided not to. People try to time the market and get burned, and I don’t want to be one of them.”He said Wednesday’s tariff pause had reversed a 13% drop into positive territory, adding: “What happens in 90 days? I have to trust that the people managing my money know what they’re doing.”Explore more on these topicsPensionsThe ObserverTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsGlobal economyInvestmentsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Small plates £19-£65; large plates £37-£145; desserts £8.50-£12; wine from £50I’m going to tell you a story. This is a story about that which shall not be named. A word that is rarely dissected or discussed in polite society. Yes, occasionally it’s muttered casually – between close friends, in an Islington townhouse. You may even hear it whispered along the hallowed streets of London’s Broadway Market – if you’re lucky. But rarely do we take this beast apart. Not often is the brute hung, cut along its middle, for us to follow the grain of its connective tissues.I doubt many of us even know the origins of this polemic word. Fewer still of the German-born sociologist, Ruth Glass, who coined the phrase, after moving to London and observing the displacement of working-class residents of its neighbourhoods, by middle-class newcomers. We are, of course, talking about that uninvited guest, the ghost at the feast…gentrificationnn!View image in fullscreen‘Many of the current residing members of Notting Hill arrive at this restaurant for just this’: côte de boeuf steak.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAhhh, good old gentrification. This is a word derived from “gentrify”, as coined by Samuel Laing in the 19th century. He argued that one could attain upper-class status through conduct rather than birth.I was born in west London in 1984, and raised on Notting Hill’s Powis Terrace by my mother,Andi Oliver,when she was 20 years old. Across the following 40 years of my life, I have lived with 23 flatmates in 15 different flats within west and east London. And because of this, I was lucky enough to bear witness to the foreshadowing of the mass-gentrification pilgrimage that was to come to Notting Hill in 1998, and again to Hackney in 2009.View image in fullscreenComfort food: smoked pink fir potatoes.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverOn a Friday night, not long before the beginning of spring, I sat in a restaurant with my mother on the street that grew us both. Dorian sits on a quiet, unassuming road in Westbourne Park, Notting Hill. Beside it isthe Globe– a basement club that has been open since the 1960s and was run by my stepfather throughout the 1990s. As well as being where she met him, it is the first place my mother was paid to cook food.Dorian, which now resembles a 1930s European bistro, was once Coins Coffee Store, run by a family friend and the first place I was ever employed. For three months in 1996 I washed dishes and made scrambled eggs in the very same kitchen where Max Coen and his exquisite team today present a menu of truly refined decadence. The room is warm, the lights are low and, upon entering, a quasi holy feeling is felt within, telling you that yes, you are in fact exactly where you are meant to be – which as we all know is what makes a great restaurant a truly great restaurant.View image in fullscreen‘A welcome fattiness’: wild mushroom liquor.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverDorian also understands the power of the front-of-house. Nadena – proficient, relaxed, adept – was a total pleasure to accompany us throughout a dinner full of clarity and intention. And, as Mum said, “not fancy for the sake of it”. With its tremendous glass wine fridge, marble counter and metallic lamps resembling smartly dressed gentlemen observing the room’s checkerboard floor – which itself evokes a modern Versailles (or perhaps Westminster Abbey?) – there is a satisfying air of grandiosity in the room.Our only concern for the evening continued to be the inappropriately loud, relentless thrum of mediocre dance music, a melody befitting neither Mum’s nor my taste, nor the predilections of my predecessor, Jay Rayner.If I can be so bold, I think we all would have preferred some gentle jazz. (I must stress, this is not a Dorian-specific problem, bad music in good restaurants is a consistent institutional failing.)View image in fullscreen‘Smart and privileged’: Crab and pomelo rostiPhotograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThis was not our first Dorian rodeo – so we began with the rostis, which arrived smart and privileged. Max has a superb way with a potato and crème fraîche and caviar. I’d love to tell you about the other dewy, cheesy, truffly situation that sat to my right, but my mother ate it. This is probably a good time to mention that a few years ago my mother went from seafood enthusiast to a person with a seafood allergy (after a particularly violent episode in Antigua with a lobster). It’s all been very upsetting. She has described it as “being broken up with by the best boyfriend you’ve ever had for no reason”. So when fish can be safely enjoyed, my mother’s euphoria is evident.Our tuna crudo, sharp and cleansing, harked back to the lauded tuna tartare of Park Lane’sNobuin the early noughties. Here, too, at Dorian, you feel as if it were sliced from the belly of the beast a mere moment before.Ever since I can remember, my starting point on a menu is the fish. When we step into a restaurant, we are essentially looking for the sublime and rarely do I not find it. Case in point, the turbot. Oh the turbot… if a truly multisensory experience is required for ultimate happiness, this dish was it – my nirvana. Fat steaks of butter-soft fish and verdant green herbaceous sauce. This dish made me happy, it made me want to write poetry. With this dish, one could feel the passion of Caravaggio in Max’s cooking.I’m not sure why neither Mum nor I ordered the steak. Many of the current residing members of Notting Hill arrive at this restaurant for just that. This is a côte de boeuf that has attained that which many of the clientele cannot, Instagram fame combined with a word-of-mouth reverence. It’s decadent, it gleams and it shines as it shows up for our neighbours, a table of four – who ordered the beef and a bottle of barolo – showing the room they knew who they were and the night they wanted to have.Mum and I also know who we are. We’re people who like a gentle broth, one that heals. The wild mushroom liquor, with charred greens and smoked potato, had a welcome fattiness and was inventive and delicious.It was truly lovely to have dinner with my mother at Dorian, at the end of Powis Terrace, the place we called home for so long. We talked about when things around here changed. Something so intangible to begin with. Unfriendliness is what she noticed first. Something so small, that as we all know, can become something so big. I, like so many others, have feared change in my life and tried to hold on to old things. But what I’ve always known is that fundamentally, we are here to share space together, with grace and patience and love. Mum calls it “breaking bread”. Sharing food with each other is love without words and eating together creates space for conversation. Gentrification is not something that we usually talk about. But sometimes, just sometimes,you cantalk about it. Go on, I dare you.This article was amended on 13 April 2025 to replace some words that were omitted during the editing process.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsThe ObserverFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

Certainly it’s not for everyone. Some find it too bleak, depressing even. Others lean into it, the endless stretch of shingle and the looming presence of a nuclear power station at the southern end that lends a distinctly apocalyptic feel. Throw in the surreal afterthought of a miniature railway that runs across the beach and there really is nowhere else quite like it.The place has long been an inspiration for artists, photographers, architects and writers, drawn by the otherworldly atmosphere, the strange clash of styles and the shifting blue-grey light.It drew me a couple of years ago, when I decided it would make a great setting for a key scene in my psychological thriller. My two main characters end up at the Metropole, an entirely fictional hotel that I wish existed: a forlorn art-deco gem crouching on the shore near the lighthouse. As the fog sets in, a mysterious widower confesses more than he should to his ghostwriter about the mysterious circumstances of his wife’s death. It felt like the right place to dial up the romantic suspense.Our brief stay is distinctly less gothic. We start with lunch at the Dungeness Snack Shack on the beach: fat juicy prawns, fried fish in flatbread, red cabbage slaw, fried potatoes (nothing so obvious as chips here), scallops and halloumi taste sublime in the sea air, even more so at less than a tenner a head.View image in fullscreenPerfect escape: West Cottage, once a lighthouse keeper’s home.Photograph: Katie PankowskiWe walk past the mishmash of cottages and cabins – everywhere you look it’s Martin Parr meetsArchitectural Digest; next to the bright green bungalow with a St George flag and washing line out front, there’s a black, midcentury cube with floor-to-ceiling glass.Found objects, pebble sculptures, piles of fishing nets, rusting machinery and boats abandoned far from sea all add to a sense of mystery; what has been left to gently decay, and what has been lovingly curated?Everywhere you look it’s Martin Parr meets Architectural Digest - a bright green bungalow with a St George flag next to a black cube with floor-to-ceiling glassWe head to the Pilot Inn for a pint, its retro pine-clad interior already packed by 6pm with locals tucking into generous portions of fish and chips, “the best in England”, according to the late filmmakerDerek Jarman, whose rustic former home, Prospect Cottage, overlooks the beach.As we walk across the shingle, the rolling fog I imagined in my book puts in an appearance. Ahead of us is the flashing beam of the lighthouse shrouded in sea mist. We follow the straight line of the miniature railway track, slightly spooked by the eerie whistling sound and a low hum from the nuclear power station.We make it back across the marshland to our home for the night, West Cottage, one of two former lighthouse keepers’ homes, at the foot of the original Dungeness lighthouse which was built in the 18th century.View image in fullscreenWork of art: Prospect Cottage, with stones sculpture by Derek Jarman.Photograph: Lynn Hilton/AlamyLike most of the properties around here, there’s an interesting history. West Cottage, dating back to 1843, was bought by artist, sculptor and photographer Martin Turner in the 1990s. When his daughter, Kathryn, inherited it, she embarked on a meticulous renovation. There are lovely touches throughout the house, from the reclaimed floorboards to the brass taps and the striking Spanish floor tiles in the kitchen and bathroom. We cook a meal and cosy up for the evening with a roaring wood-burning stove.The next day, we pack up and head to Camber Sands. Less than 20 minutes along the coast it could be a different state, like leaving Arizona for the Hamptons. Here the coastline softens, the sea is bluer, the surf whiter and the shingle turns to swirls of creamy sand dunes, overlooked by pretty clapboard houses.Just nearby is Harry’s, a restaurant that opened a few months ago and is part ofthe Gallivant, a boutique hotel a few yards from the beach.View image in fullscreen‘A pretty, conservatory-style dining room’: Harry’s restaurantA pretty, conservatory-style dining room with white wicker chairs and walls lined with framed vintage swimwear looks out on to a small courtyard. The lunch menu feels like good value at £29 for two courses, but we’ve worked up an appetite after a walk on the beach and opt for three courses at £35.With ex-Bibendum chef Matthew Harris as lead chef here, we can’t resist the Maldon oysters, suitably elemental with a zing of sauce mignonette (vinegar, minced shallots and pepper). The local fish – hake today – caught from Rye Bay is the perfect foil to the anise of the fennel and spiced red cabbage purée.There’s also an impressive range of English wines on the menu including a crisp, dry East Sussex sparkling white from Oxney Organic Estate. The highlight is sharing an old-school Armagnac prune crème brûlée and vanilla ice-cream served as it should be, in a silver coupe with chocolate sauce to pour over.Before we leave, we walk into Rye and its picture-perfect Mermaid Street, a steep incline of cobbled lanes and half-timbered houses. It’s undeniably pretty, but for me it doesn’t quite pass the Marmite test. Give me the ghostly fog and bleak desolation of Dungeness any day.West Cottage sleepsfour in two bedrooms and is available from £981 forfive nights.

I know this even as I write, it sounds impossible, like a weird lie you tell kids to show them how good they have it, but listen: in the late 1990s and early 2000s when I worked in a fancy underwear shop, I had to wear heels that were at least 3in high every day, no sitting down allowed. And then, andthen, in my leisure time, instead of easing myself into, say, a bath of Uggs, I also wore a heel. “Eva,” I hear you say, “Did somebody hurt you? I hope you have someone to talk to.” But – it was normal. It was normal! I wore a spike-heeled boot, a massive platform, or sometimes for comfort, as a treat, a 1940s mule.It was about fashion, yes, but it was also about growing up, and about authority, and about swagger. Also, I lived at the top of a very steep hill and the angle of a heel was sometimes helpful when walking home. Heels have never been about just one thing. Their meaning, pain and politics, move and merge.When I started working in offices what women would do was wear tights and trainers on their commute, then slip into a heeled court shoe (often nude, often patent) on the pavement outside, so shameful was it to be seen in flats, so unprofessional. Under our desks would hide a menagerie of shoes, stacked among the computer cables to be worn in case of emergency – years later, leaving that desk, I pulled them out, these objects that once held so much power and, after weighing them in my hands for a good second, dropped them in the bin.The pandemic almost killed the heel for good – sales of high heels dropped by 65% during the second quarter of 2020, when women, as one, removed their bras, ditched stiff denim, unfurled their toes as if monstera leaves. When life restarted, heels stayed off – on the front row of fashion shows, editors wore a clean white sneaker. “Athleisure” was inescapable. A line was drawn in the sand when Sarah Jessica Parker, she of running through Manhattan in her Manolos and talking to stilettos as if pugs, shut down her shoe line last year. But then, a stumble.The politics of heels span gender, wealth, identity and power, reappearing like migraines at moments of political unrestThe politics of heels span gender, wealth, identity and power. They reappear in the culture like migraines at moments of political unrest. And so it is that, as the year unfolds, we are seeing heels rise again. “Bring Back the High Heel” begged a Gen Z writer on Slate, and fashion obliged. In the US, “Republican style” (huge blowdries, white teeth and patent stilettos) is enhanced by what they’re calling “Maga makeup” (“matte and flat”). On TikTok the “Loub job” has gone viral – this is Botox injected into the balls of the feet to allow women to wear heels all day. The “mob wife” aesthetic (a swing away from the “clean girl”, with her sneakers or clogs) prepared us for what trend forecaster Sean Monahan has labelled “Boom Boom”, which is brash, moneyed glamour – there were thigh-high boots at Armani, and at Versace, heels in the shape of a perfume bottle and champagne coupe stem.All of which insists we ask: what does the heel mean today? Why, when we have seen comfort, when we have run for buses and calmed our bunions, why when we have adjusted the culture sufficiently to allow (below the ankle anyway) a certain level of gender equality, are we blithely going backwards? An unbidden image now of us as Cinderella’s ugly sisters, forcing our misshapen hooves into her size-three stiletto and insisting it fits, wobbling back to work in goddamnglassshoes, the decades ahead spent in a complex coercive marriage with a confused prince who was sure we didn’t smell like this that first time we danced.What’s going on? While the Maga gals are surely embracing the heel as a marker of retrogressive femininity, those of us that lean lefter, perhaps, are wearing heels in a performance of protest. In their explainer of Boom Boom last week,theGuardianquoted Stella McCartney, backstage after showing her new “laptop to lapdance” collection (patent boots, bright red heels), talking about the end of the world. “Instead of going: I’m anxious and I’m scared of all the feelings which we’re attached to, I’m like: fuck fear. I’m flipping it.” And doing so by dressing like she’s going to battle – a fantasy costume that speaks to the anxiety and disconnect right now between the world we want and the world we have.Today, I am wearing a heel for the first time in months. I’m wearing a whole little look, in fact, sitting at my desk after stomping to drop off my kids at school in a Miu Miu platform sandal and lip gloss, and picking my way slowly back home. I’d forgotten the frustration that comes with moving in heels, the sense you’re walking underwater, carrying the effort of getting where you need to go as if a tantrumming child. And the horrible awareness of the pavement, the knowledge that, as time has passed, what might have been a trip last time you wore heels could now be “a fall’. But now, seated, I can savour the benefits of remaining in slight discomfort – it’s a constant reminder that I have a body. A reminder, too, to sit up, to think about how to get to where I’m going, to pay attention.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Eva Wiseman columnHigh heelsWomencommentShareReuse this content"

But is it more than just a stunt?Edward Helmorein New York  andRobin McKieSun 13 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 17.27 EDTShareJeff Bezos is blasting his bride-to-be Lauren Sánchez and her “guests” to space on Monday – a plan that might, under other circumstances, contain mixed messages.A crew of six women – Amanda Nguyen, a civil rights activist who will become the first Vietnamese woman to fly to space; the CBS Morningsco-host Gayle King; the pop star Katy Perry; film producer Kerianne Flynn; entrepreneur and former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe; and Sánchez, a journalist and philanthropist – will blast off on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket from the company’s launch site, 30 miles north of Van Horn, Texas, on an 11-minute, suborbital flight to the edge of space and back.Though billed as the first all-female crew to reach the Kármán line, the internationally recognised boundary of space at an altitude of 62 miles, it is not technically so: the cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova flew a solo mission to space in 1963.But Tereshkova didn’t blast off with the accoutrements afforded the new ladies of space. “We’re a crew!” they reportedly shouted in unison at a photoshoot forEllemagazine, each rocking “an all-black power look”. The magazine noted that this will be the first time anyone has been to space with their hair and makeup done.“Who would not get glam before the flight?” Sánchez remarked. Perry added: “Space is going to finally be glam. Let me tell you something. If I could take glam up with me, I would do that. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.”But trips like these raise questions: are they anything more than joy rides – and do they need to be? King said she “had a lot of trepidation – I still do – but I also know it’s very interesting to be terrified and excited at the same time. I haven’t felt like this since childbirth. Because I knew childbirth was going to hurt. But it’s also stepping out of your comfort zone.”View image in fullscreenKaty Perry: ‘Space is going to finally be glam.’Photograph: Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe actor William Shatner, aka Captain James T Kirk of the Starship Enterprise, took one of thefirst flights on Bezos’s rocketat the age of 90 in 2022. He said he was surprised by his own reaction to the experience – and moved to tears. “When I looked in the opposite direction, into space, there was no mystery, no majestic awe to behold ... All I saw was death. I saw a cold, dark, black emptiness. It was unlike any blackness you can see or feel on Earth. It was deep, enveloping, all-encompassing. It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered,” he added.For Bezos, however, the all-female trip may be more than a curated joyride in a rocket that flies itself. The Amazon co-founder is locked in a competitive commercial space launch industry battle withElon Musk. Rockets from Musk’s Space X Falcon 9 family have launched 469 times. By contrast, Blue Origin has completed a mere 31 successful launches of its New Shepard vehicle, including 11 crewed suborbital flights.Earlier this year,Blue Origin launched its larger, reusable rocket, New Glenn (named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth)from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The company says this operates like a “commercial airliner (but with cleaner fuel)”, will lead to “significantly less waste and cost” and can carry 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit and 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit.Nevertheless, Blue Origin remains in second place in this space battle. The leader, SpaceX, currently builds and launches two rockets: the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. A feature of these rockets has been the development of booster stages that return to Earth for refurbishment, a revolutionary process which saves money and has helped SpaceX undercut competitors.The company also builds and flies Dragon, the space capsule that can carry crew and cargo to the International Space Station, and is working on a large rocket and spacecraft system called Starship that will be able to carry massive payloads to space. Starship may even carry astronauts to Mars and set up colonies there, if Musk gets his way.“As it stands, Musk’s SpaceX is the competition’s undisputed leader: it regularly sends astronauts into orbit, while Bezos’s Blue Origin has yet to launch anyone beyond the outer edge of space,” Politico recently noted.No union and forget staff toilet breaks, but hey, at least Bezos can buy Venice for his wedding | Catherine BennettRead moreSpaceX and Blue Origin have clashed in court over billions of dollars in government funding, and the billionaires themselves traded barbs on the Musk-owned X, with Musk rivals worried that he is aiming to create a monopoly in the private space industry.“People are concerned what’s in place to stop it,” said one space industry lobbyist. “You’re talking about two of the most unpredictable people in the world getting together. It’s not [a case of] chocolate and peanut butter, and you get a great combination. You’re talking about world dominance here.”Blue Origin is trying to raise alarms about potential unfair advantages in the space race, Politico reported. “Elon wants a monopoly in space,” argued a person familiar with Blue Origin’s Washington strategy.All of which means that Monday’s launch may have more at stake than six women and their pre-flight beauty regimens.Explore more on these topicsSpaceThe ObserverJeff BezosElon MuskKaty PerrynewsShareReuse this content"

Those values change daily because they depend on estimates of future sales and prices.Rinehart became the richest person in Australia in 2011 when her fortune was estimated at $10bn. She lost the crown in 2015 but resurgent iron ore prices have put her back on top since 2020.The second-richest Australian, Harry Triguboff, has a fortune of about $26.5bn. Elon Musk (US$369.7bn) is 13 times wealthier than Rinehart and Jeff Bezos (US$202bn) is about seven times wealthier.For a brief moment in 2012, Rinehart was also estimated to be the richest woman in the world, knocking off Christy Walton, the widow of the founder of the US shopping chain Walmart. The richest woman now is Alice Walton, also a Walmart heir.Where does Rinehart’s wealth come from?Rinehart’s company Hancock Prospecting reported more than $40bn in assets in 2024 and has made $5bn in annual profit for the last six years.She first appeared on the BRW (later Australian Financial Review) rich list in 1992 after her father, Lang Hancock, died and left her in control of his company.Gina: Love and money – episode 3 - podcastRead moreShe has said Hancock Prospecting was practically bankrupt when she took over, with few assets and massive debts, though it did have an estimated $20m annual income from some of Rio Tinto’s iron ore mines in Western Australia.That income stream has handed Rinehart more than $3bn in the three decades since, but the bulk of Hancock Prospecting’s earnings now comes from its mines at Roy Hill and Hope Downs, which respectively earn about $3bn and $1bn every year.View image in fullscreenRinehart’s Roy Hill mine earns roughly $3bn a year.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesRinehart has billions of dollars in other resources projects including lithium, copper, gas and coal, plus an estimated $500m in cash.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterOnly part of the profits from Hancock Prospecting are paid out as cash to Rinehart personally. She owns a 76% stake in the company, which reported providing dividends of $553m last financial year.How long did it take her to get to $40bn?Rinehart was left with $75m after her father died, according to contemporary estimates.That figure edged up in the 1990s but soared in the early 2000s, as the mining boom kicked in and Rinehart announced her first Hancock Prospecting-owned mine. She was a billionaire by 2006.A graph displaying Gina Rinehart’s net worth rising over time to $40bn by 2024Her wealth dipped in the 2010s and is likely to have slidamid the chaos resulting from Donald Trump’s tariffs– wealth estimates bounce around as predicted sales and iron ore prices rise and fall.Hancock Prospecting made nearly $5.6bn in profit last financial year, about as much money as Greenland’s entire economy. That’s more than $600,000 an hour, after tax, pouring into the company coffers.What does Rinehart spend her money on?She has bought up plenty of real estate around her Perth mansion plus a reported five waterfront homes in Queensland. Rinehart’s companies also own huge swathes of land: more than 9.2m hectares – totally an area bigger than Tasmania – and the largest private landholding in the country, according toGuardian Australia’s 2021 estimates.She also throws lavish parties, including ariverboat cruiseduring the Paris Olympics for the manyswimmers and rowers she has sponsoredand her own70th birthday party, which featured a horse show and pyrotechnics.GinaGina: Love and money – episode 3Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2025/04/13-37581-GINA_E3_LOVE__MONEY.mp300:00:0001:09:01Rinehart has cash to burn for travel, flying the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, out to her birthdayand other engagements, and travelling to the US herself tocelebrate Donald Trump’s re-election and inauguration.And she has splashed out $2bn onUS companies, including $35m in the Rupert Murdoch-founded Fox Corp and $12m in Tesla – though these investments have taken a serious hit amid the tariff uncertainty.Back home she has bought up Australian staples including the beef company S Kidman and Co and the country fashion labels Driza-Bone and Rossi Boots. She has also bought and sold stakes innewspapersand Channel 10.What could she spend her money on?There’s a lot you could do with $40bn if it could be converted to cash.She could buy a $3m mansion every day for the next 30 years.As an avowed supporter of nuclear energy, she couldfund the construction of four nuclear reactors, taking the optimistic assumption each would cost less than $10bn (though experts say just one could be double or triple that cost).And as a Trump fan, she could put in an openingbid for Greenland, which has anestimated valueof at least A$20bn.The extent of Rinehart’s philanthropy is not known or declared but in the last decade she has donated millions to the Australian swimming team and in 2022 was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia, in part for her contribution to “philanthropic initiatives”.If she put aside $10bn a year, she could raise everyone on jobseeker above the poverty line, according tocalculations by the Australia Institute.It costs about $500,000 to build a house on average – so Rinehart’s wealth could fund the construction of 80,000 homes.Listen to episode three ofGina: Love and moneyExplore more on these topicsGina RinehartGina: power, privilege and influenceBusiness (Australia news)MiningWestern AustraliaPhilanthropyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Now, the US is planning to cut off main entrance access to CanadiansLeyland Ceccoin Stanstead, QuebecSun 13 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 11.04 EDTShareThere is only one building in North America, probably in the world, where one can browse bestsellers and children’s books by crossing an international border and then sit for an amateur theatre troupe in a regal opera house with each half of your body in two different countries.Standing near the Tomifobia River, a rushing body of water swollen from the spring melt, the Haskell Free Library and Opera House straddles the border ofCanadaand the US. Constructed more than a century ago as a deliberate rebuttal to borders and division, the imposing building split between Quebec and Vermont has become a beloved and fiercely protected part of communities in both countries.But in recent months, the library has become the latest casualty in the trans-border feud that has strained relations between the two nations.US blocks Canadian access to cross-border library, sparking outcryRead morePeter Lépine began volunteering at the library 15 years ago after moving from Montreal, drawn to the creaky warren of rooms, each constructed from different types of wood.“I’ve loved it,” he says on an April morning. “I love books, I love the people and I love the quiet. And today, mercifully, it’s quiet.”For weeks, curious onlookers, outraged supporters and gaggles of media have descended on both Stanstead, Quebec, and Derby Line,Vermont, after US officials announced the main entrance to the library, which sits in Vermont, wouldsoon be cut off to Canadians. They cited drug traffickers and smugglers “exploiting” the accessibility and said the closure meant “we are ending such exploitation by criminals and protecting Americans” without providing evidence.mapUnder the new rules which go into effect in October, Canadians will need to go through a formal border crossing before entering the library.The news, met with disbelief from patrons and staff, followed a closely watched visit by the US secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, in March. Touring the library, Noem said “USA number one!” and then hopped over the black tape separating the two countries and said “51st state” when she landed in Canada. She repeated the joke – echoing Donald Trump’s recent fixation on annexing Canada – three times.“It was incredibly disrespectful,” said Lépine. “There’s no other way to describe it. And it really hurt.”Since the start of his second term, Trump has questioned Canada’s viability as a nation, suggesting that it could become the 51st American state, and deriding the outgoing prime minister, Justin Trudeau, as a “governor”. He has also called the border an “imaginary line” and threatened to use economic force to crush Canada’s economy.View image in fullscreenThe Haskell Free Library and Opera House on 1 April 2025.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAThe political theatre comes in stark contrast to a building meant to celebrate friendship and cooperation. Opened in 1904, before rules took effect that barred trans-border structures, the library and opera house were gifted by Martha Stewart Haskell, a Canadian philanthropist, and her son Horace. The aim was to gift something artistic to citizens of both countries for generations to come.When finished, the building housed a 500-seat opera house, complete with a dazzling chandelier and a curtain painted to resemble Venice’s grand canal – original items still in use today. Like the library below, the worn black tape running through the opera marks the international border.“There are seats up there where, when you’re sitting, you’ve got each cheek in a different country,” said Lépine. The Haskell hosts movie nights, poetry readings and theatre performances for a loyal following.For the first 120 years of its existence, the conceit of the structure worked, mirroring a way in which the two communities largely shrugged at the notion of a border. Residents would cross over without ever showing paperwork as they shopped and visited friends.Those halcyon days ended in 2001 after the attacks of 9/11, prompting border officials to begin requiring identification to pass. In recent years, US officials have grown increasingly wary about a sliver of the border that feels even more unprotected than the other 5,000 miles.In 2018, Canadian Alexis Vlachos was sentenced to 51 months in an American prison for his role inusing the library to smuggle more than 100 handgunsin backpacks into Canada.View image in fullscreenUS and Canadian flags in the library.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAIn recent years, the Haskell has served as a meeting point for families separated by the cold realities of visas. In 2018, Iranians facing a travel ban into the US would embrace relatives between the stacks of books. Other nationals living in America on single entry visas and unable to leave the country would also use the library for reunions frowned upon by border officials.“There are times we have to tell, you know, a father and son who are crying and hugging because they haven’t seen each other in 10 years to leave the building because they’re not allowed to do that,” said Lépine. “It was tough.”While border officials see the library as something more than a collection of books, so too do staff.“Books are secondary to a space like this. It’s really a place for people to have access to services. Kids can come to play games and learn French. People who might not have computers can some here. Books are good, but we offer a safe space,” said Mélanie Aubé, the head librarian. “People want to turn this place into something political. But all we want to do is to offer a service for both communities. We just want to stay open.”The intense scrutiny on the library has left staff exhausted. “You can’t sit at your desk for two seconds because you have two doors to watch now, and we don’t have enough staff to give tours to all the people who ask” said Aubé. “And I’ve fallen behind in my actual job.”Of the thousands of books tucked into the library’s stacks, one author has emerged as a patron favourite: Louise Penny, the bestselling Canadian novelist and creator of the detective Armand Gamache. Her novels are by far the most borrowed and the celebrated writer, whose works have repeatedly topped the New York Times bestseller chart, is also a frequent visitor to the library.“It’s very hard to not go immediately to the dystopian novels. What’s the first thing a despot or a tyrant does? They target libraries. They target writers. It targets books. Targets anyone who could read and think and become a dissenting voice,” she said. “Nothing good is going to come of this. It would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious.”The tour for Penny’s forthcoming book Black Wolf, which coincidentally imagines plans to force Canada into becoming the 51st state was due to start at the Kennedy Center in Washington. But a recent decision by Trump tofire the previous board of the Kennedy Centerfor its support of “woke” programming, and to install himself as board chair, has prompted widespread artistic backlash.That move and a broader call for Canadians to boycott travel to the United States amid annexation threats and tariffs from the president, led Penny to scrap all of her American tour dates. She plans to conclude her book tour at the Haskell.Penny made headlines in recent weeks after donating C$50,000 (US$36,000) to helpfund a new entrance to the library, an “elegant” solution to the diplomatic snafu created in wake of new restrictions.In recent days, US border officials installed a sign that warned only library card holders could cross and access the main entrance. Anyone else “will be arrested and face prosecution” at the hands of US officials.View image in fullscreenBarriers mark the location of the border between the US and Canada outside the Haskell Free Library and Opera House in Derby Line, Vermont.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPACurrently, to enter the library, Canadians must trek over mats placed atop a muddy lawn, following a set of arrows that lead the building’s former emergency exit. But the library’s management envisioned an accessible entrance along with sidewalks and a larger parking lot.“I have the resources to help because of the support of American and Canadian readers. The least I could do is give back,” Penny said. “Plus, it’s like giving the finger to the current administration: you close one door, we will open another one.”At the Haskell, patrons returning books throughout the morning all cite the shared sense of history, culture and values that have long undergirded the friendship between the two nations.“In places where community spaces are disappearing, libraries like this matter. They’re more than just books. And here, it’s a place for people from both countries to gather. With how things are, that’s needed now more than ever,” said Gordon Dubois, a Vermont resident. Joined by his wife Nancy, the two had driven to the library to donate funds for the construction of a Canadian entrance.As the couple leave, they pass by a bookshelf, placed perpendicular to the border. Inside is a copy of Between Friends/Entre Amis. Published in 1976, the book was Canada’s gift to the US on its bicentennial, hand delivered to President Gerald Ford at a ceremony in Washington by the prime minister, Pierre Trudeau.“Because Haskell was built by people working together, it’s really a powerful symbol and a testament to shared values. And it’s hard not to feel that one side has taken a nail and quite deliberately scarred something beautiful,” said Penny. “But the honesty, decency, goodness, fairness and reason that have long defined this friendship will triumph. This, I believe.”This article was amended on 13 April 2025. An earlier version converted C$50,000 to US$6,000 instead of US$36,000.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump administrationAmericasLibrariesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For years, it has been pushing the extreme notion that wealthy, tax-averse people should up and start their own high-tech fiefdoms, whether new countries on artificial islands in international waters (“seasteading”) or pro-business “freedom cities” such asPróspera, a glorified gated community combined with a wild west med spa on a Honduran island.Yet despite backing from the heavy-hitter venture capitalists Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, their extreme libertarian dreams kept bogging down: it turns out most self-respecting rich people don’t actually want to live on floating oil rigs, even if it means lower taxes, and while Próspera might be nice for a holiday and some body “upgrades”, its extra-national status is currently beingchallenged in court.Now, all of a sudden, this once-fringe network of corporate secessionists finds itself knocking on open doors at the dead center of global power.The first sign that fortunes were shifting came in 2023, when a campaigningDonald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, promised to hold a contest that would lead to the creation of 10“freedom cities”on federal lands. The trial balloon barely registered at the time, lost in the daily deluge of outrageous claims. Since the new administration took office, however, would-be country starters have been on a lobbying blitz, determined to turn Trump’s pledge into reality.“The energy in DC is absolutely electric,” Trey Goff, the chief of staff of Próspera, recentlyenthusedafter a trip to Capitol Hill. Legislation paving the way for a bevy of corporate city-states should be complete by the end of the year, he claims.Inspired by the political philosopher Albert Hirschman, figures including Goff, Thiel and the investor and writer Balaji Srinivasan have been championing what they call “exit” – the principle that those with means have the right to walk away from the obligations of citizenship, especially taxes and burdensome regulation. Retooling and rebranding the old ambitions and privileges of empires, they dream of splintering governments and carving up the world into hyper-capitalist, democracy-free havens under the sole control of the supremely wealthy, protected by private mercenaries, serviced by AI robots and financed by cryptocurrencies.View image in fullscreenPeter Thiel in Tokyo in 2019.Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesOne might assume that it is contradictory for Trump, elected on a flag-waving “America first” platform, to lend credence to this vision of sovereign territories ruled over by billionaire god-kings. And much has been made of the colorful flame wars between the Maga mouth-piece Steve Bannon, a proud nationalist and populist, and the Trump-allied billionaires he hasattackedas “technofeudalists” who “don’t give a flying fuck about the human being” – let alone the nation state. And conflicts inside Trump’s awkward, jerry-rigged coalition certainly exist, most recently reaching aboiling pointover tariffs. Still, the underlying visions might not be as incompatible as they first appear.The startup country contingent is clearly foreseeing a future marked by shocks, scarcity and collapse. Their high-tech private domains are essentially fortressed escape pods, designed for the select few to take advantage of every possible luxury and opportunity for human optimization, giving them and their children an edge in an increasingly barbarous future. To put it bluntly, the most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world, an end they themselves are frenetically accelerating.That is not so far away from the more mass-market vision of fortressed nations that has gripped the hard right globally, from Italy to Israel, Australia to the United States: in a time of ceaseless peril, openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers. These bunkers are brutal in their determination to expel and imprison unwanted humans (even if that requires indefinite confinement in extra-national penal colonies from Manus Island to Guantánamo Bay) and equally ruthless in their willingness to violently claim the land and resources (water, energy, critical minerals) they deem necessary to weather the coming shocks.Though it builds on enduring rightwing tendencies ... we simply have not faced such a powerful apocalyptic strain in government beforeInterestingly, at a time when previously secular Silicon Valley elites aresuddenly findingJesus, it is noteworthy that both of these visions – the priority-pass corporate state and the mass-market bunker nation – share a great deal in common with the Christian fundamentalist interpretation of the biblical Rapture, when the faithful will supposedly be lifted up to a golden city in heaven, while the damned are left to endure an apocalyptic final battle down here on earth.If we are to meet our critical moment in history, we need to reckon with the reality that we are not up against adversaries we have seen before. We are up against end times fascism.Reflecting on his childhood under Mussolini, the novelist and philosopher Umberto Eco observed in a celebratedessaythat fascism typically has an “Armageddon complex” – a fixation on vanquishing enemies in a grand final battle. But European fascism of the 1930s and 1940s also had a horizon: a vision for a future golden age after the bloodbath that, for its in-group, would be peaceful, pastoral and purified. Not today.Alive to our era of genuine existential danger – from climate breakdown to nuclear war to sky-rocketing inequality and unregulated AI – but financially and ideologically committed to deepening those threats, contemporary far-right movements lack any credible vision for a hopeful future. The average voter is offered only remixes of a bygone past, alongside the sadistic pleasures of dominance over an ever-expanding assemblage of dehumanized others.And so we have the Trump administration’s dedication to releasing its steady stream of real andAI-generatedpropaganda designed solely for these pornographic purposes. Footage of shackled immigrants being loaded on to deportation flights, set to the sounds of clanking chains and locking cuffs, which the official White House X accountlabeled“ASMR”, a reference to audio designed to calm the nervous system. Or the same accountsharingnews of the detention ofMahmoud Khalil, a US permanent resident who was active in Columbia University’s pro-Palestinian encampment, with the gloating words: “SHALOM, MAHMOUD.” Or any number of homeland security secretary Kristi Noem’s sadism-chicphoto ops(atop ahorseat the US-Mexican border, in front of a crowdedprison cellin El Salvador,slinginga machine gun while arresting immigrants in Arizona …).View image in fullscreenKristi Noem speaks during a tour of an El Salvador prison in March.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APThe governing ideology of the far right in our age of escalating disasters has become a monstrous, supremacist survivalism.It is terrifying in its wickedness, yes. But it also opens up powerful possibilities for resistance. To bet against the future on this scale – to bank on your bunker – is to betray, on the most basic level, our duties to one another, to the children we love, and to every other life form with whom we share a planetary home. This is a belief system that is genocidal at its core and treasonous to the wonder and beauty of this world. We are convinced that the more people understand the extent to which the right has succumbed to the Armageddon complex, the more they will be willing to fight back, realizing that absolutely everything is now on the line.Our opponents know full well that we are entering an age of emergency, but have responded by embracing lethal yet self-serving delusions. Having bought into various apartheid fantasies of bunkered safety, they are choosing to let the Earth burn. Our task is to build a wide and deep movement, as spiritual as it is political, strong enough to stop these unhinged traitors. A movement rooted in a steadfast commitment to one another, across our many differences and divides, and to this miraculous, singular planet.View image in fullscreenNot so long ago, it was primarily religious fundamentalists who greeted signs of apocalypse with gleeful excitement about the long-awaited Rapture. Trump has handed critical posts to people who subscribe to that fiery orthodoxy,includingseveral Christian Zionists who see Israel’s use of annihilatory violence to expand its territorial footprint not as illegal atrocities but as felicitous evidence that the Holy Land is getting closer to the conditions under which the Messiah will return, and the faithful will get their celestial kingdom.Mike Huckabee, Trump’s newly confirmed ambassador to Israel, hasstrong tiesto Christian Zionism, as doesPete Hegseth, his secretary of defense. Noem and Russell Vought, the Project 2025 architect who now leads the office of budget and management, arebothstaunchadvocates for Christian nationalism. Even Thiel, who is gay andnotoriousfor his party lifestyle, has been heardmusingabout the arrival of the antichrist of late (spoiler: he thinks it’s Greta Thunberg, more on that soon).But you don’t need to be a biblical literalist, or even religious, to be an end times fascist. Today, plenty of powerful secular people have embraced a vision of the future that follows a nearly identical script, one in which the world as we know it collapses under its weight and a chosen few survive and thrive in various kinds of arks, bunkers and gated “freedom cities”. In a 2019papertitled Left Behind: Future Fetishists, Prepping and the Abandonment of Earth, the communication scholars Sarah T Roberts and Mél Hogan described the longing for a secular Rapture: “In the accelerationist imaginary, the future is not about harm reduction, limits or restoration; rather it is a politics driving toward an endgame.”View image in fullscreenMike Huckabee touring Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem in 2008.Photograph: David Silverman/Getty ImagesElon Musk, who dramatically grew his fortune alongside Thiel at PayPal, embodies this implosive ethos. This is a person who looks up at the wonders of the night sky and apparently sees only opportunities to fill that inky unknown with his own space junk. Though he burnished his reputation warning about the dangers of the climate crisis and AI, he and his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) henchmen now spend their days escalating those same risks (and many others) by slashing not only environmental regulations but entire regulatory agencies, with the apparentend goalof replacing federal workers with chatbots.Who needs a functioning nation state when outer space – now reportedly Musk’s singular obsession – beckons? For Musk, Mars has become a secular ark, which he claims is key to the survival of human civilization, perhaps via uploaded consciousnesses to an artificial general intelligence. Kim Stanley Robinson, the author of the sci-fi Mars Trilogy that appears to have partially inspired Musk, is blunt about the dangers of the billionaire’s fantasies aboutcolonizing Mars. It is, hesays, “just a moral hazard that creates the illusion we can wreck Earth and still be okay. It’s totally not true.”Much like religious end-timers who long to escape the corporeal realm, Musk’s drive for humanity to become “multiplanetary” is made possible by his inability to appreciate the multispecies splendor of our only home. Evidently uninterested in the vast bounty that surrounds him, or in ensuring Earth can continue buzzing with diversity, he instead deploys his vast fortune to bring about a future that would see a handful of people and robots eke out survival on two barren orbs (a radically depleted Earth and a terraformed Mars). Indeed, in a strange twist on the Old Testament tale, Musk and his fellow tech billionaires, having arrogated god-like powers to themselves, aren’t content to just build the arks. They appear to be doing their best to cause the flood. Today’s rightwing leaders and their rich allies are not just taking advantage of catastrophes, shock-doctrine and disaster-capitalism style, but simultaneously provoking and planning for them.What of the Maga base, though? Not all are sufficiently faithful to earnestly believe in the Rapture, and most certainly don’t have the cash to buy a spot in a “freedom city” let alone on a rocket ship. Fear not. End times fascism offers the promise of many more affordable arks and bunkers, these ones well within reach for lower-level foot soldiers.Listen to Steve Bannon’s daily podcast – which bills itself as Maga’s premier media outlet – and you will be barraged with a singular message: the world is going to hell, the infidels are breaching the barricades, and a final battle is coming. Be prepared. The prepper message becomes particularly pronounced when Bannon switches to hawking his advertisers’ products. Buy Birch Gold, Bannontellshis audience, because the over-leveraged US economy is going to crash and you can’t trust the banks. Stock up on ready-to-eat meals fromMy Patriot Supply. Sharpen your target practice using a laser-guided at-home system. The last thing you would want to do is depend on the government during a disaster, he reminds listeners (left unsaid: especially now that the Doge boys are selling off the government for parts).End times fascism is a darkly festive fatalism – a final refuge for those who find it easier to celebrate destruction than imagine living without supremacyBannon doesn’t only urge his audience to make their own bunkers, of course. He also advances a vision of the United States as a bunker in its own right, one in which Ice agents stalk the streets, workplaces and campuses, disappearing those deemed enemies of US policy and interests. The bunkered nation lies at the heart of the Maga agenda, and of end times fascism. Inside its logic, the first job is to harden national borders and expunge all enemies, foreign and domestic. This ugly work is now well under way, with theTrump administration, enabled by the supreme court, having invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to Cecot, the now infamous mega-prison in El Salvador. The facility, which shaves prisoners heads and packs up to 100 people into a single cell, stacked with bare bunks, operates under the civil liberties-destroying “state of exception” first declared over three years ago by the country’s crypto-loving, Christian Zionist prime minister, Nayib Bukele.Bukele has offered to provide the same fee-for-service system for US citizens the administration would like to drop into a judicial black hole. “I love that,” Trumpsaidrecently, when asked about the proposal. No wonder: Cecot is the sick if logical corollary of the “freedom city” fantasy – a zone where everything is for sale and due process does not apply. We should expect much more of this sadism. In a chillingly candid statement, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons,toldthe 2025 Border Security Expo that he wanted to see a more “business”-oriented approach to these deportations, “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings”.If policing the boundaries of the bunkered nation is end times fascism’s job one, equally important is job two: for the US government to lay claim to whatever resources its protected citizens might need to get through the tough times ahead. Maybe it’s Panama’s canal. Or Greenland’s fast-melting shipping routes. Or Ukraine’s critical minerals. Or Canada’s fresh water. We should think of this less as old-school imperialism than super-sized prepping, at the level of the national state. Gone are the old colonial fig leaves of spreading democracy or God’s word – when Trump covetously scans the globe, he is stockpiling for civilizational collapse.This bunker mentality also helps explain JD Vance’s controversial forays into Catholic theology. The vice-president, who owes his political career in no small part to the largess of the premier prepper Thiel, explained to Fox News that, according to the medieval Christian concept ofordo amoris(translated both as “order of love” and “order of charity”), love is not owed to those outside the bunker: “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” (Or not, as the Trump administration’s foreign policy would indicate.) In other words, we owe nothing to anyone outside our bunker.Though it builds on enduring rightwing tendencies – justifying hateful exclusions is hardly new under the ethno-nationalist sun – we simply have not faced such a powerful apocalyptic strain in government before. The “end of history” swagger of the post-cold war era is rapidly being supplanted by a conviction we are in the actual end of times. Doge may wrap itself in the banner of economic “efficiency”, and Musk’s underlings may evoke memories of the young, US-trained “Chicago Boys” who designed the economic shock therapy for Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorial regime, but this is not simplythe old marriage of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. It’s a new, money-worshiping millenarian mashup that says we need to smash the bureaucracy and replace humans with chatbots in order to cut “waste, fraud and abuse” – and, also, because the bureaucracy is where the Trump-resisting demons hide. This is where the tech bros merge with theTheoBros, a real group of hyper-patriarchal Christian supremacists with ties toHegsethand others in the Trump administration.View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon advances a vision of the United States as a bunker in its own right.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAs fascism always does, today’s Armageddon complex crosses class lines, bonding billionaires to the Maga base. Thanks to decades of deepening economic stresses, alongside ceaseless and skillful messaging pitting workers against one another, a great many people understandablyfeel unable to protect themselves from the disintegration that surrounds them (no matter how many months of ready-to-eat meals they buy). But there are emotional compensations on offer: you can cheer the end of affirmative action and DEI, glorify mass deportation, enjoy the denial of gender-affirming care to trans people, villainize educators and health workers who think they know better than you, and applaud the demise of economic and environmental regulations as a way to own the libs. End times fascism is a darkly festive fatalism – a final refuge for those who find it easier to celebrate destruction than imagine living without supremacy.It’s also a self-reinforcing downward spiral: Trump’s furious attacks on every structure designed to protect the public from diseases, dangerous foods and disasters – even totellthe public when disasters are headed their way – strengthen the case for prepperism at both the high and low ends, all while creating myriad new opportunities for privatization and profiteering by the oligarchs powering this rapid-fire unmaking of the social and regulatory state.View image in fullscreenAt the dawn of Trump’s first term, the New Yorker investigated a phenomenon that itdescribedas “doomsday prep for the super-rich”. Back then, it was already clear that in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, the more serious high-end survivalists were hedging against climate disruption and social collapse by buying space in custom-built underground bunkers and building escape homes on high ground in places like Hawaii (where Mark Zuckerberg has downplayed his 5,000 sq ft underground pad as a “little shelter”) and New Zealand (where Thiel purchased nearly 500 acres but found his plan to build a luxury survivalist compound rejected by local authorities in 2022 for being an eyesore).This millenarianism is bound up with a suite of otherSilicon Valleyintellectual fads, all premised on an end-times-inflected belief that our planet is headed towards a cataclysm and it’s time to make some hard choices about which parts of humanity can be saved. Transhumanism is one such ideology, encompassing everything from minor human-machine “enhancements” to the quest to upload human intelligence into a still illusory artificial general intelligence. There is also effective altruism and longtermism, both of which skip over redistributive approaches to helping those in need in the here and now in favor of a cost-benefit approach to doing the most good in the long term.Though they can appear benign at first glance, these ideas are shot through with dangerous racial, ableist and gender biases about which parts of humanity are worth enhancing and saving – and which could be sacrificed for the supposed good of the whole. They also share a marked lack of interest in urgently addressing the underlying drivers of collapse – a responsible and rational goal that a growing cohort of figures now actively shun. Instead of effective altruism the Mar-a-Lago regular Andreessen and others have embraced “effective accelerationism”, or the “deliberate propulsion of technological development” without guardrails.Meanwhile, even darker philosophies are finding a wider audience, like the neoreactionary pro-monarchy rants of the coder Curtis Yarvin (another one of Thiel’s intellectual touchstones), or the “pro-natalism” movement’s obsession with dramatically increasing the number of “western” babies (a Musk fixation), as well as the exit guru Srinivasan’s vision of a “tech zionist” San Francisco where corporate loyalists and police join forces to politically cleanse the city of liberals to make way for their networked apartheid state.View image in fullscreenMarc Andreessen and Balaji Srinivasan speak during a panel discussion about bitcoin in San Francisco in 2014.Photograph: Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty ImagesAs the AI scholars Timnit Gebru and Émile P Torres havewritten, though the methods may be new, this “bundle” of ideological fads “are direct descendants of first-wave eugenics”, which also saw a small subset of humanity making decisions about which parts of the whole were worth continuing and which needed to be phased out, cleared out, or terminated. Until recently, few paid attention. Much like Próspera, where members can already experiment with human-machine mergers such as having their Tesla keysimplantedinto their hands, these intellectual fads seemed to be the marginal hobby horses of a few Bay Area dilettantes with money and caution to burn. No longer.Three recent material developments have accelerated end times fascism’s apocalyptic appeal. The first is the climate crisis. While some high-profile figures might still publicly deny or minimize the threat, global elites, whose ocean-front properties and datacenters are intensely vulnerable to rising temperatures and sea levels, are well-versed in the ramifying perils of an ever-heating world. The second is Covid-19: epidemiological models had long predicted the possibility of a pandemic devastating our globally networked world; the actual arrival of one was taken by many powerful people as a sign that we have officially arrived at what US military analystsforecastedas “the Age of Consequences”. No more predictions, it’s going down. The third factor is the rapid advancement and adoption of AI, a set of technologies that have long been associated with sci-fi terrors about machines turning on their makers with ruthless efficiency – fears expressed most forcefully by the same people who are developing these technologies. All of these existential crises are layered on top of escalating tensions between nuclear-armed powers.None of this should be written off as paranoia. Many of us feel the imminence of breakdown so acutely that we cope by entertaining ourselves with various versions of life in a post-apocalyptic bunker, streaming Apple’sSiloor Hulu’sParadise. As the UK analyst and editor Richard Seymour reminds us in his recent book, Disaster Nationalism: “The apocalypse is no mere fantasy. We are living in it, after all, from deadly viruses to soil erosion, from economic crisis to geopolitical chaos.”The forces we are up against have made peace with mass death. They are treasonous to this world and its human and non-human inhabitantsTrump 2.0’s economic project is a Frankenstein’s monster of the industries driving all of these threats – fossil fuels, weapons and resource-ravenous cryptocurrency and AI. Everyone involved in these sectors knows that there is no way to build the artificial mirror world that AI promises to construct without sacrificing this world – these technologies consume too much energy, too many critical minerals, and too much water for the two to coexist in any kind of equilibrium. This month, the former Google executive Eric Schmidt admitted as much,tellingCongress that AI’s “profound” energy needs are projected to triple in the next few years, with much of it coming from fossil fuels, because nuclear can’t come online fast enough. This planet-incinerating level of consumption is necessary, he explained, to enable an intelligence “higher” than humanity, a digital god rising from the ashes of our relinquished world.And they are worried – just not about the actual threats they are unleashing. What keeps the leaders of these entangled industries up at night is the prospect of a civilizational wake-up call – of serious, internationally coordinated government efforts to rein in their rogue sectors before it’s too late. From the perspective of their ever-expanding bottom lines, the apocalypse is not collapse; it’s regulation.The fact that their profits are predicated on planetary devastation helps explain why do-gooder discourse among the powerful is giving way to open expressions of disdain for the idea that we owe each other anything by right of our shared humanity. Silicon Valley is done with altruism, effective or otherwise. Meta’s Mark Zuckerbergpinesfor a culture that celebrates “aggression”. Alex Karp, Thiel’s business partner at the surveillance firm Palantir Technologies,rebukesthe “losing” “self-flagellation” of those who question American superiority and the benefits ofautonomous weapons systems(and, by association, the lucrative military contracts that have made Karp’s vast fortune). Musk informs Joe Rogan that empathy is “the fundamental weakness of western civilization” and hevents, afterfailingto purchase a supreme court election in Wisconsin: “It increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence.” Meaning we humans are nothing but grist for Grok, the AI service he owns. (He did tell us he was “dark Maga” – and he’s not the only one.)In arid and climate-stressed Spain, one of the groups calling for a moratorium on new datacenterscallsitself Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “your cloud is drying my river”. The name is fitting, and not just for Spain.An unspeakably dismal choice is being made before our eyes and without our consent: machines over humans, inanimate over animate, profits over all else. With stunning speed, the big tech megalomaniacs have quietly rolled back their net-zero pledges and lined up by Trump’s side, hellbent on sacrificing this world’s real and precious resources and creativity at the altar of a vampiric, virtual realm. This is the last great heist, and they are getting ready to ride out the storms they themselves are summoning – and they will try to defame and destroy anyone who gets in their way.Consider Vance’s recent European sojourn, where the vice-president harangued world leaders for “handwringing about safety” in relation to job-destroying AI while demanding Nazi and fascist speech go uncurtailed online. At one point he made a telling aside, expecting a laugh that never came: “If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg’s scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk.”View image in fullscreenJD Vance speaks at the Munich Security Conference in February.Photograph: dts News Agency Germany/REX/ShutterstockHis comment echoed those made by his equally humorless patron Thiel. In recent interviews focused on the theological underpinnings of his far-right politics, the Christian billionaire has repeatedly compared the indefatigable young climate activist to the antichrist – a figure he warns was prophesied to come bearing a misleading message of “peace and safety”. “If Greta gets everyone on the planet to ride a bicycle, maybe that’s a way to solve climate change, but it has sort of this quality of going from the frying pan into the fire,” Thiel intoned.Why Thunberg, why now? In part, it’s clearly the apocalyptic fear of regulation eating into their super-profits:accordingto Thiel, the science-based climate action Thunberg and others demand could only be enforced by a “totalitarian state”, which he claims is more dire a threat than climate breakdown (most distressingly, the taxes under such conditions would be“quite high”). There may also be something else about Thunberg that frightens them: her steadfast commitment to this planet and the many life forms who call it home – not to simulations of this world generated by AI, or to a hierarchy of those deserving of life and those who are not, nor to any of the various extra-planetary escape fantasies the end times fascists are selling.She is committed to staying, while the end times fascists have, at least in their imaginings, already left this realm, ensconced in their opulent shelters or transcended to the digital ether, or to Mars.Shortly after Trump’s re-election, one of us had the opportunity tointerviewAnohni, one of the few musicians who have attempted to make art that wraps its arms around the death drive that has gripped our world. Asked about what connects the willingness of powerful people to let the planet burn and the drive to deny bodily autonomy to women and to trans people like her, she responded by drawing on her Irish Catholic upbringing: it’s “a very long-held myth that we are enacting and embodying. This is the culmination of their Rapture. This is their escape from the voluptuous cycle of creation. This is their escape from Mother.”View image in fullscreenHow do we break this apocalyptic fever? First, we help each other face the depth of the depravity that has gripped the hard right in all of our countries. To move forward with focus, we must first understand this simple fact: we are up against an ideology that has given up not only on the premise and promise of liberal democracy but on the livability of our shared world – on its beauty, on its people, on our children, on other species. The forces we are up against have made peace with mass death. They are treasonous to this world and its human and non-human inhabitants.Second, we counter their apocalyptic narratives with a far better story about how to survive the hard times ahead without leaving anyone behind. A story capable of draining end times fascism of its gothic power and galvanizing a movement ready to put it all on the line for our collective survival. A story not of end times, but of better times; not of separation and supremacy, but of interdependence and belonging; not of escaping, but staying put and staying faithful to the troubled earthly reality in which we are enmeshed and bound.This basic sentiment, of course, is not new. It is central to Indigenous cosmologies, and it lies at the heart of animism. Go back far enough and every culture and faith has its own tradition of respecting the sanctity of here, and not searching for Zion in an elusive ever-distant promised land. In eastern Europe, before the fascist and Stalinist annihilations, the Jewish socialist Labor Bund organized around the yiddish concept ofDoikayt, or “hereness”. Molly Crabapple, who has written a forthcoming book about this neglected history,definesDoikaytas the right to “fight for freedom and safety in the places where they lived, in defiance of everyone who wanted them dead” – and rather than be forced to flee to safety in Palestine or the United States. Perhaps what is needed is a modern-day universalization of that concept: a commitment to the right to the “hereness” of this particular ailing planet, to these frail bodies, to the right to live in dignity wherever on the planet we are, even when the inevitable shocks forces us to move. “Hereness” can be portable, free of nationalism, rooted in solidarity, respectful of indigenous rights and unbounded by borders.View image in fullscreenAnti-Trump protesters march against the administration in New York in January.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianThat futurewould require its own apocalypse, its own world-ending and revelation, though of a very different sort. Because as the scholar of policing Robyn Maynard hasobserved: “In order to make earthly planetary survival possible, some versions of this worldneedto end.”We have reached a choice point, not about whether we are facing apocalypse but what form it will take. The activist sisters Adrienne Maree and Autumn Brown touched on this recently on their aptly named podcast, How to Survive the End of the World. In this moment, when end times fascism is waging war on every front, new alliances are essential. But instead of asking: “Do we all share the same worldview?” Adrienne urges us to ask: “Is your heart beating and do you plan to live? Then come this way and we will figure out the rest on the other side.”To have a hope of combating the end times fascists, with their ever-constricting and asphyxiating concentric circles of “ordered love”, we will need to build an unruly open-hearted movement of the Earth-loving faithful: faithful to this planet, its people, its creatures and to the possibility of a livable future for us all. Faithful to here. Or, to quote Anohni again, this time referring to the goddess in which she now places her faith: “Have you stopped to consider thatthismight have been her best idea?”Spot illustrations by Sophy Hollington"

This month saw the publication of two books containing explosive reporting on Biden’s downfall, and coming months will bring two more: so far the picture emerging is a damning one for Biden, his top aides and the Democratic party.The books have detailed a president increasingly unfit for the task of taking onDonald Trumpin the 2024 presidential election and his top aides in denial about it, or actively seeking to cover it up, even as the administration warned about the existential threat Trump posed to American democracy.Journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes were first out of the gate withFight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House. Revelations included how Biden aidesplannedfor his withdrawal in 2023, then when his disastrous June 2024 debate against Donald Trump supercharged calls for him to quit, “aggressively”arguedthat he should not, given Harris would be a “disaster”.Then Chris Whipple, author of a bookaboutBiden’s 2020 win, released Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History. Whipple’s book is slim, at just 204 double-spaced pages. But it hits hard. Ron Klain, a former White House chief of staff, describes debate preparations in which Biden seemed “out of it”, unable to “grasp … the back and forth”, and also says that after the debate disaster, Biden declinedto do political work necessary to survive, preferring to enjoy the trappings of power.Responding to Guardian reporting on Whipple’s book, Klainsaidhe “never doubted the president’s mental acuity”, and had merely expressed concern that Biden made tactical errors, such as thinking “being a great foreign policy president was enough”.In his interview with Whipple, Klain also describes his opposition to calls for Biden to drop out and anguish when he did so. Observersaskedwhy Whipple did not challenge Klain on this, given his unsparing depiction of Biden’s aged state.Biden dropped outon 21 July. That gave Harris a near-impossible task, just 107 days to put together a campaign to beat Trump. Nonetheless, Allen, Parnes and Whipple report extensive shortcomings in the vice-president’s own approach, including the flawed selection of the untested Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate, as well as infighting between Harris staffers and Biden aides who maintained campaign control.Democrats should read these books and go, ‘Oh my God, we need people to retire at normal ages’Molly Jong-FastThe result was a crushing defeat, and Trump’s return to power.Molly Jong-Fast, host of theFast Politicspodcast, said Parnes, Allen and Whipple had shown Biden’s aides to be chiefly at fault: “Had Harris not had thePrecision Strategiescrew, think of what she could have done. I think that had she had a little more time and a little bit better advising, she could have won it.”Reed Galen, a Republican strategist turned anti-Trump campaigner and host ofThe Home Frontpodcast, was more blunt: “Anyone who knew [about Biden’s decline] and did nothing, or knew and went to work for Kamala Harris’s campaign and didn’t let her run her own race, should never be given a position of responsibility again.”For Biden, worse could yet be to come. In May, Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios will release the starkly titled Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.Announcing their book, the two reporters pointed to widespread reporting, including by Parnes, Allen and Whipple, that family members including Jill Biden and Hunter Biden, eventually pardoned by his father, persuadedJoe Bidento seek a second term.“Biden, his family and his team let their self-interest and fear of another Trump term justify trying to put an at times addled old man in the Oval Office for four more years,” Tapper and Thompson said. “What was the extent of it?

It comes out in July.If journalism is the first draft of history, books by journalists may just be the second. Nobody yet owns the narrative and debate will run on.

Chuck Schumer, whose role in pushing Biden out is described inanother recent book, Mad House by Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of the Times, is 74 and shows no sign of quitting as Democratic leader in the Senate.“This should be a call to action,” Jong-Fast said. “Democrats should read these books and go, ‘Oh my God, we need people to retire at normal ages and not stay on and on. You’re not an airline pilot at 85. I don’t have an 87-year-old doing eye surgery on me. That doesn’t mean you’re not worthy and wonderful and valuable.

Now the price of crude has collapsedJillian AmbroseAt its AGM this week, the company will face not only the activist investor at its heels, but a global economy being changed from the White HouseSun 13 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareAfter Donald Trump’s “liberation day” on Wednesday last week, BP lost almost a quarter of its market value in a share price rout even deeper than the oil giant endured in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The collapse in global oil prices in the wake of the US president’s ­tariff blitz may have wiped billions from its ­market value – but Trump isn’t BP’s only problem.The oil company will face shareholders this week for the first time since it bowed to investor pressure to abandon its green energy ambitions in favour of a return to fossil fuels, and its chair, Helge Lund,agreed to step down from the board.The twin retreats were considered the only defence against the advance of an aggressive activist investor fund that could spell the breakup of the 115-year-old company, which has been haemorrhaging value for years.Elliott Asset Management, a feared New York hedge fund notorious for shaking up laggard companies, amassed a substantial stake inBPearlier this year. It has reportedly been in talks with key investors over the future of BP after its ill-fated plan to become a green energy company.The resignation of Lund will not spare the board the embarrassment of a bloody nose from shareholders, many of whom arelikely to protest by voting against the chair’s reappointmenteven though he has already decided to leave.The board may also take some relief in knowing that its greatest climate activist foe, the shareholder campaign group Follow This, hasdecided not to put forward a resolutioncalling for greater emissions cuts at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting amid growing investor antagonism over ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues.BP set out the plan to reduce its fossil fuel production under former chief executive Bernard Looney in late 2020, the year before its industry rivals began raking in bumper profits from rocking global oil and gas markets.Worryingly, the company revealed that net debt has surged by £3bn in the first three months of the yearAt the same time, BP’s plan to invest in low-carbon energy ­projects, including two giant offshore ­windfarms in UK waters, were dealt a blow by the soaring cost of borrowing and post-pandemic supply chain ­bottlenecks that pushed costs higher across the industry.After Looney’s humiliating exit from the company in late 2023, his successor, former finance chief Murray Auchincloss, began to water down the green plans. He set out a “fundamental reset” of BP’s strategy,blaming the company’s “misplaced” optimismin the green transition.But BP’s pivot back to fossil fuels may already be floundering. The oil company told investors on Friday that its first-quarter results for the year would include lower than expected gas production figures and a “weak” trading result.Worryingly, the company revealed that net debt surged by $4bn (£3bn) in the first three months of the year, as fears over the global financial uncertainty reached fever pitch.BP is considered more exposed to the fallout ofTrump’s tariffs, which caused market prices for oil to plummet from almost $75 a barrel to under $60 for the first time in almost four years, due to fears that a trade war will tip the global economy into recession and shrink the world’s appetite for crude.Already, the company appears to have been harder hit by the sell-off than its rivals in the US and Europe. Since the start of the year its share price has plummeted by almost 17%, while Shell has lost just over 8% and US rivals ExxonMobil and Chevron have lost about 7% each.Equity analysts at investment bank UBS downgraded their view of the company from “buy” to “neutral” after warning that the fall in oil and gas prices could slash BP’s earnings over the coming years by as much as a fifth.BP’s strategic reset “was an important first step to restore investor confidence, in our view”, said UBS equity analyst Joshua Stone. “The next steps, including a reduction of net debt and replenishment of the reserves base, were always going to take longer to achieve, but the level of ­financial uncertainty in the market makes delivery harder in our view, ­especially as it relates to BP’s ability to grow earnings and sell assets.”Explore more on these topicsBPObserver business agendaDonald TrumpEnergy industryFossil fuelsEnergyOilOil and gas companiesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Given the time gap, my recollection was hazy. To be honest, it was almost non-existent. So I was intrigued – and then astonished when I read the feature.I had written about the British glaciologist John Mercer, author of a1978Naturepaperin which he warned that continuing increases in fossil fuel consumption would cause amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide to soar. Global temperatures could rise by 2C by the mid-21st century, causing major ice loss at the poles and threatening a 5-metre rise in sea levels, he warned.Today temperatures are1.5C warmerthan they were in ­preindustrial times andsea ­levelsare rising at an accelerating rate. And, as Mercer also predicted, global warming is having its greatest impact at the poles. Ice is disappearing, threatening to inundate Earth’s populated coastal zones with meltwater and compromising the planet’s ability to reflect solar radiation back into space. Further temperature rises are likely to ensue.Mercer was not the first scientist to warn that our world faced a greenhouse future, but his paper, with its highly specific forecasts, was my earliest exposure to a detailed examination of the concept. In the late 70s, most climatic fears were focused in the media on the arrival of a new ice age. Mercer – then based at the Institute of Polar Studies at Ohio State University – predicted the opposite. Ours would be a hot and humid future, he insisted. That grim forecast has since been echoed by swelling numbers of scientists who have added their own, increasingly urgent warnings about the ­dangers posed by ourchanging climate. I have been at pains to record these in theObserver– often to orchestrated choruses of hostile responses from climate-change deniers – and to make it clear that our addiction tofossil fuelsis going to have dangerous consequences for our planet.View image in fullscreenRobin McKie in the laboratory of the Royal Institute in 2015.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianIt remains the most striking ­scientific story that I have coveredas the paper’s science editorover the past 42 years, although I should also give credit to the multitude of other remarkable developments that have occurred in that period and which have been subjects of my reporting. These include our growing mastery of DNA science, the creation of mobile phones and computers, our improving ability to tackle the scourge of cancer, and the discovery thatHomo sapienshave anAfrican origin. I have listed highlights below this piece, and each demonstrates how dedicated researchers have transformed our understanding of our universe and our place in it since the 1980s.Their impacts nevertheless look insignificant compared to the one that will occur if our interference with our planet’s climate ­continues at its present rate. This is, quite ­simply, the greatest scientific experiment ever undertaken by humans. Our continually rising emissions of greenhouse gases are altering Earth – with our own species destined to be the prime test subject.Melting ice caps, flooding coastal plains, droughts, severe storms and heatwaves threaten to displace ­hundreds of millions of people from their homelands as large chunks of our planet become ­uninhabitable. “In such a future, we will bring about nothing less than the collapse of the living world – the very thing that our civilisation relies upon,” statesSir David AttenboroughinA Life on our Planet.Our scientific creativity and ingenuity could surely help us face down the coming devastation, it might be expected. We certainly have the intellectual capacity to halt the changes that lie ahead. Sadly, my experiences as science editor suggest otherwise – for just as I have watched breathtaking advances in science unfold, I have witnessed large parts of society turn their heads and deliberately reject the truths that have been presented to them. The rise of unreason has been the unwelcome partner to our growing scientific sophistication.View image in fullscreenMobile phones are among the amazing developments that have occurred in the past 40 years.Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/BloombergMy first serious encounter with anti-science denial came with the arrival of Aids in the 80s. Scientists traced the cause: a virusnow known as HIVwhich, they pointed out, is sexually transmitted. This point was disputed by many individuals who claimed it was caused by “flawed” lifestyles and denied that Aids was caused by a virus. This was to have a devastating international impact after South Africa’s president Thabo Mbeki asked several Aids deniers to join his presidential advisory panel on the disease. Widespread withholding of treatments for Aids ensued in South Africa, where the death toll from the disease reached hundreds of thousands of people.An even more startling example is provided by Covid. Our understanding of the disease gradually changed after its appearance in late 2019, and advice was altered as scientists learned more about its causes. Washing hands was dropped as a mantra and staying outdoors became acceptable. This uncertainty was fed upon by social media.Then came the vaccines, and the internet went into overdrive. Immunisation against Covid was linked to exaggerated numbers of deaths, and the subject was politicised, particularly in the US, where many Trump-supporting Republicans decided to shun the vaccine. The result was a grim distortion of responses to Covid infections in the US, with many fervently Republican counties showing significantly higher death rates compared with strong Democrat counties.This affront to reason has continued. The US now has an outspokenvaccine sceptic as its health secretarywhile cases of measles, a disease once vanquished by vaccines, are returning in increasing numbers, along with reports of early deaths, as the influence of anti-vaxxers takes a grip of the country.In the case of the climate ­crisis, denial has been long-lasting, pernicious and highly inaccurate. Claims that scientists have fiddled with facts have been shown to be unfounded while the warnings of climate experts, from John Mercer onwards, have proven highly accurate. As a result, we now stand at the threshold of a continuing rise in global temperatures – because deniers have been so effective in blocking progress towards the introduction of international agreements for limiting fossil fuel emissions.Anti-science movements have always been with us, of course – from the rise of the flat Earthers to the early establishment of groups opposed to evolution. However, the present trajectory is now ­becoming extremely ­worrying, with the US providing the most ­worrying examples.“It is undoubtedly political and connected with the rise of the right in the US,” says Sir Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Society. “That is partly because Trump and many Republicans have a major down on elite universities in the US, and these are places where big science takes place.“On the other hand, the recent rise of rightwing parties in European countries has not been mirrored with abuse of science, and so far the worst of this awfulness has not yet hit the UK. It is not something to take for granted over the coming years, however.”The breakthroughsDNAIn 1982, when I joined theObserver, research into deoxyribonucleic acid, the material from which our genes are made, was in its infancy. Today we can sequence the entire genomes of individual men and women, revealing treasure troves of biological data that have revolutionised medical practice. Forensic science has also been transformed through the development of DNA fingerprinting while our understanding of our own evolution has been turned on its head by our ability to sequence DNA from tissue scraps left behind by our predecessors. Among the breakthroughs made this way has been the discovery that we once interbred with our extinct evolutionary cousins, theNeanderthals, and that their DNA makes up 1-2% of the genomes of people of European or Asian ancestry.Gravitational waveswere predicted by Albert Einstein, who nevertheless thought they could not be detected on Earth. He argued that these ripples in the space-time continuum – although generated by enormously energetic events – would be dissipated to a tiny fraction of their original magnitude by the time they reached Earth. Nevertheless, in 2015, researchers – in Louisiana and Washington – succeeded in detecting gravitational waves generated by the merger of two black holes by using giant laser interferometers that were capable of measuring wavelengths to an accuracy of a few hundred billion-billionths of a metre. This success has since opened up an entirely new way to study the universe.The webWhen I started work as a reporter, we typed our stories on manual typewriters and, when out of the office, phoned in our stories to human copy takers. The creation of mobile phones, the internet and powerful personal computers has since transformed mass communication thanks to developments in a host of techniques including semiconductor nanotechnology, sensors, fiber optics, satellites and atomic clocks. Today, a mobile phone has a processing power and a memory capacity that are millions of times more powerful than the computer that guided the Apollo 11 mission to the moon.View image in fullscreenA cast of the oldest known skull of a Homo sapien, discovered in Ethiopia in 1997.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyOut of AfricaForty years ago, those who studied human origins were divided into two groups. One side argued that modern humans evolved separately from predecessors found in different areas round the globe. The other group said thatHomo sapiensevolved in Africa before spreading out of the continent to take over the planet. The former theory was known as the multiregional hypothesis while the latter was called the Out of Africa theory. Detailed studies of fossils, ancient DNA and stone tools and other artefacts have since resolved the issue, and we now know the latter theory is correct. Essentially we are all Africans under the skin.The James Webb space telescopeForty years ago, it was expected men and women would soon set up colonies on the moon and Mars. However, human spaceflight has since suffered financial setbacks and dwindling public interest. In contrast, the creation of sophisticated robot probes has transformed the study of the heavens, a trend that culminated in the 2021 launch of the world’s most powerful observatory, theJames Webb space telescope. It is now revealing the universe in unsurpassed detail with early results showing that the universe was already deep into the process of star formation only a short time after its big bang birth 13.8 billion years ago.Explore more on these topicsScienceThe ObserverClimate crisisFossil fuelsSea levelGreen politicsEnergyAids and HIVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

InSally Mann’sAt Twelve: Portraits of Young Women, she captures this special, unstable time of life. In this image, a plaited-haired girl sits in a chair, head in hand like a world-weary grownup. This is Olivia, “with that ruined prayer in her eyes”, as Mann describes her. In the background, a phalanx of dark trousers hangs from two washing lines that cut across the image and lead our gaze towards her grandmother, who dangles the now-empty plastic laundry basket over one shoulder.“This is just half the day’s laundry,” Mann tells us in a loose narrative that runs througha reissueof the well-known 1988 publication by the artist notorious for capturing girls on the threshold of womanhood with unnerving perspicacity. The youthful gamines, locals of Mann’s own back yard of Rockbridge County, Virginia, are by turns funny, glamorous, knowing, evasive, worried, rich, poor, babyish, frighteningly mature – all of the complexities we know girlhood and its projections to hold, but sometimes find difficult tobehold.Like the other 12-year-olds pictured in the book’s arresting black and white photographs, Olivia looks us dead in the eye, as if to ask what we are looking at while quietly ceding to the photographer’s curious lens. She is one of more than 10 children living with her grandmother, her father unknown, her mother gone. Where? “She travels,” grandmother says, conjuring an ethereal, roaming figure, lost somewhere unknown. An unmanned toy car sits battered and unmoving near the centre of the image like a ghostly prop. Olivia may travel, too, someday, but for now she is frozen in place – like the subjects of all photographs – as time telescopes in both directions, promising everything and nothing. “We are their mirror, they are ours,” the short story writer Ann Beattie observes of these girls on the brink in her introductory essay.

RSF forces were said to be burning buildings throughout Zamzam on Sunday, claiming they were seeking Sudanese government fighters hiding in the camps.The US has condemned both sides in the war, saying the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur and that the army has attacked civilians.The conflict has essentially divided Sudan in two, with the army holding sway in the north and east while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south.The war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee described as “the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded”.The deaths at the weekend put extra pressure on the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to deliver a decisive response on the issue of civilian protection when he convenes a ministerialconference on Sudanin London on Tuesday. The conference of 20 countries and organisations will inevitably shine a spotlight on the United Arab Emirates, past backers of the RSF, to issue an unambiguous statement of condemnation.Locator graphicThe attacks on Um Kadadah, about 180km (112 miles) east of El Fasher, came one day after RSF fighters said they had taken the town from army forces. The victims appeared to be targeted because of their ethnicity.Lammy tweeted: “Shocking reports are emerging from El Fasher, Darfur, where indiscriminate RSF attacks have killed civilians, including aid workers. This gives added urgency to Tuesday’s Sudan conference in London with international partners. All sides must commit to protection of civilians.”The UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was “appalled and gravely alarmed by reports emerging from Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps as well as El Fasher town in North Darfur”. The two camps protect as many as 700,000 civilians displaced by previous violence and famine.The Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that “arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the Zamzam camp in the centre, south and south-east portions of the camp”.The UN reported that the RSF had launched coordinated ground and air attacks on the camps and El Fasher from multiple directions on 11 April, triggering intense clashes and resulting in catastrophic consequences for civilians.The UN said more than 100 people, including more than 20 children, were feared dead, including nine Relief International personnel. The Sudanese army said more than 70 people had been killed in El Fasher alone. The precise death toll was unverifiable due to deliberate internet shutdowns implemented by the RSF.Last month the armyrecaptured the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, about 1,000km (600 miles) to the east.Adam Regal, a spokesperson for the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, said Zamzam and Abou Shouk remained under artillery shelling and an assault by RSF armed vehicles on Sunday.Relief International said of the loss of its staff: “We understand this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people. We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack – along with other health facilities in El Fasher.”Both the Biden and Trump administrations in the US have said the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur, and that the army has attacked civilians. The Sudanese government last week took the UAE to the international court of justice, the UN’s top court, claiming the UAE was complicit in genocide.Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, said: “It appears that the RSF is attacking Zamzam, Abu Shouk and El Fasher simultaneously for the first time, including a ground assault on Zamzam. This is a significant escalation in violence against civilians in the North Darfur region and requires immediate diplomatic response.”She said she feared such “a coordinated military effort by the RSF would represent the beginning of the assault we have all so long feared – including further acts of genocide and crimes against humanity – and should trigger all emergency diplomatic and other responses.”She added: “In hosting the conference on Tuesday, Lammy holds the heavy responsibility of securing a collective response to the appalling atrocities committed yesterday and this weekend. It is a tough but rare opportunity to bring international commitment to protect civilians in Sudan from strong words to resolute action.“This means sincerely confronting those backing and enabling atrocity crimes, and establishing a serious senior coalition willing to advance at pace the political and technical solutions necessary to halt genocide, crimes against humanity, war and famine.”Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The US president is due to meet Bukele at the White House on Monday.It comes as US officials said in court filings on Sunday that they were not obliged to help a Maryland resident get out of prison in El Salvador after he was erroneously deported,despite a supreme court ruling directing the governmentto “facilitate” his return to the US.Attorneys for theTrump administrationsaid the high court’s order to “facilitate” the return of Abrego García, 29, meant they should “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”, not help extract him from El Salvador.The Trump administration has acknowledged that García, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, was deported in March in violation of an immigration judge’s order blocking his removal to El Salvador. Trump administration lawyers wereable to confirmon Saturday that García remains confined in a notorious prison in El Salvador.Trump said on Saturday he was looking forward to meeting Bukele and praised him for taking “enemy aliens” from the United States. He said the two countries were working closely to “eradicate terrorist organizations”.Administration officials have repeatedly made public statements alleging that detained immigrants are gang members that they have not backed up in court.The Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.Lawyers and relatives of the migrants held in El Salvador say they are not gang members and had no opportunity to contest the US government assertion that they were. The Trump administration says it vetted migrants to ensure they belonged to Tren de Aragua, which it labels a terrorist organization.The deportations have been challenged in federal court. The US supreme court said the US government must give sufficient notice to immigrant detainees to allow them to contest their deportations.

An energy crisis led to scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours,GDP fell by 1.5%and the poverty raterose from 26% to 28%between 2023 and 2024.“Life has become unbearable,” said María. “You only eat once a day, and then you have to save a little for the afternoon so the children have something to eat. We just want to live with dignity,” she added.View image in fullscreenDaniel Noboa campaigns in Guayaquil on Thursday.Photograph: Mauricio Torres/EPAIn a YouGov survey commissioned by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), 61% of respondents said their economic situation and personal securityhad not improvedsince Noboa took office.“The economy is not doing better, security is not doing better, people are facing blackouts, and they’re also witnessing a deterioration of the rule of law, with growing disregard for the constitution,” said Pedro Labayen Herrera, a researcher at CEPR specialising inEcuador.The political analyst Matías Abad Merchán said: “Despite Noboa having been in power for a short time, a small anti-Noboa segment of the electorate has indeed emerged – one that genuinely feels the president displays certain authoritarian tendencies.”The president refused to step down during the electoral campaign period, as required by the constitution.He also sparked an unprecedented diplomatic crisis by ordering police and military forces tostorm the Mexican embassy in Quitoto arrest Jorge Glas, once a vice-president under the former leftist president Rafael Correa.Correa – who has lived in Belgium since leaving office and was convicted in 2020 by an Ecuadorian court for corruption during his presidency – is González’s political patron.Noboa, on the other hand, has made efforts to showcase support from the US president: the Ecuadorian leader left his country in the middle of the campaign to travel to Florida, where heposed for a photo with Donald Trumpat his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.The incumbent has become embroiled in several controversies in the race’s final stretch.He announced a“strategic alliance” with Erik Prince– the Trump-aligned founder of the controversial private military firm Blackwater – to supposedly reinforce his “war” on crime.In early April, the Brazilian investigative outlet Pública revealed that at least three timescocaine has been foundhidden in banana containers being sent to Europe by a company in which Noboa and his brother are the majority shareholders.During a presidential debate, Noboa denied any wrongdoing and said that the family’s banana company was cooperating with investigators.After the first round, Noboa alleged – without providing evidence – that there had been “irregularities”, a claimpromptly rejected by observersfrom the European Union and the Organization of American States. For the runoff, he stated that he would only accept defeat “if there was no indication of fraud”.“So if things don’t go his way, I think there’s a real risk that he won’t accept the results,” said Herrera.On Wednesday, 14 Democratic members of the US Congresssent a letterto the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, expressing concern that Noboa might not accept the results if he loses: “It’s therefore imperative that you send a clear message to the government of Ecuador and other Ecuadorian leaders emphasising the need for a free, fair and transparent electoral process, and noting that, if electoral observers determine these conditions to be met, the outcome of the election must be respected,” they wrote.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The enhanced tier will cover countries and entities deemed a particular risk, which will require extra disclosures.Ministers have announced that Iran and Russia will be on the enhanced tier, meaning anyone directed by those two countries to carry out activities in the UK will have to declare it or face five years in prison.The government has yet to say anything about China’s place in Firs, a matter which is subject to internal debate by ministers and officials weighing up security concerns against the economic benefits of closer ties with Beijing.Financial services companies have privately argued against including China on the enhanced tier on the basis that they would have to fill out burdensome paperwork to justify business meetings.In an effort to strengthen security without compromising economic ties, ministers are considering including specific parts of the Chinese political system that have beenaccused of interferencein the west on the enhanced tier.Entities under consideration include Beijing’s Ministry of State Security, which is its intelligence service, the United Front Work Department, often referred to as the international arm of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), and the People’s Liberation Army, China’s military. The government could also target the CCP as a whole.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on security matters.”MI5’s director general, Ken McCallum,said in a 2022 speechthat “the Chinese intelligence services, or bodies within the CCP itself – such as its United Front Work Department (UFWD) – are mounting patient, well-funded, deceptive campaigns to buy and exert influence” in the UK.McCallum said the UFWD aimed “to amplify pro-CCP voices, and silence those that question the CCP’s legitimacy or authority”. He said its activities had “very real consequences in communities here in the UK” and that “it needs to be challenged”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Retaliatory Chinese-imposed tariffs of 125% on US goods took effect on Saturday.Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, who is now a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, said that during Xi’s tour of neighbouring countries, China would probably “try to position itself as the responsible leader of the rules-based trade system while painting the US as a rogue nation intent on taking a sledgehammer to trade relationships”.It was unclear if meaningful, concrete agreements would emerge from the meetings, but they would be symbolically important, Olson added.What does China really think about Trump? They know about humiliation and won’t take it from himRead moreFor officials in Hanoi, the visit will form part of a delicate balancing act between China and the US, both of which are important economic partners.The US is a crucial export market for south-east Asia and a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s assertiveness in the disputed South China Sea. However, trade in the region is closely intertwined with China, with countries from the regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, counting as the biggest recipient of Chinese exports last year, according to China’s customs data.There are concerns in the region that the 145% tariff imposed on China by the US could lead to a flood of cheap Chinese goods to nearby countries, undermining local industry.Vietnam and many others in the region have traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower its 46% tariff.Vietnam, where US exports account for 30% of GDP, had already made several concessions in the run-up to the tariff announcement, and was shocked by the severity of the tariff announced this month.It has since sent the deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, to Washington, offered to remove all tariffs on US imports and promised to buy more US goods, including defence and security products.Vietnam is also preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US and tighten controls on sensitive exports to China, according to a Reuters report. This includes stricter rules relating to the export of dual-use goods such as semiconductors, which can be used for both civilian and military purposes, it was reported.Vietnam was considered by many to be a winner in the trade war that occurred under the last Trump administration, as many companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the US. However, this caused Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US to surpass $123bn (£94bn), leaving it especially vulnerable in the latest tariff announcement.Vietnam, a communist one-party state, has set an ambitious target of becoming a high-income nation by 2045 – a goal driven by its exports, which would be derailed by the 46% tariff.Cambodia and Malaysia are also seeking to negotiate with Trump. The US tariffs could devastate Cambodia’s garment industry, which employs 750,000 workers. Cambodia is especially exposed as exports to the US account for 25% of the country’s GDP.Xi last visited Vietnam in December but he has not travelled to Cambodia and Malaysia in nine and 12 years respectively. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said the visit to Malaysia would mark “an important milestone” for the two countries, while describing Cambodia as an “iron-clad friend”.The Malaysian communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, said Xi’s visit was “part of the government’s efforts … to see better trade relations with various countries including China”.Cambodia is one of China’s strongest allies in the region and it recently announced the completion of a China-backed project toupgrade a major naval base.The country’s prime minister, Hun Manet, who took the reins from hisdictator father Hun Senin 2023, said at the recent inauguration of a Chinese-funded road that “Cambodian-Chinese ties have not changed”.Xi’s visits form part of a wider charm offensive pursued by China in the wake of the trade war. Xi also vowed to deepen China’s strategic partnership withIndonesiain a call with that country’s president, Prabowo Subianto, on Sunday, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported.On Friday, Xi told the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, during a meeting in Beijing that China and the EU should “jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying”, Xinhua reported.China’s premier, Li Qiang, spoke by phone with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, last week for talks that emphasised the responsibility of both parties to support a “strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field”.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingTrump tariffsTariffsVietnamCambodiaIndonesianewsShareReuse this content"

They [the conference organisers] very explicitly said, ‘We don’t believe it is safe for everyone to travel to the US, particularly our trans and diverse colleagues.’“Thefocus on that is really troubling. That, if you legitimately have a different passport than you were given at a young age, you could be detained.”The conference’s co-chairs announced the hybrid move on 21 January – a day after Trump began his second term. They said the decision reflected “conversations with disability justice and environmental justice scholars and activists”.“It also comes on the heels of political shifts that have made travel to the US more tenuous for many STS [science, technology and medicine] contributors,” they added.Australian academics are not only cancelling trips to the US for key conferences.

But Smart said she began to hear accounts of people being stopped and “detained or denied” on the basis of their condition.“They are doing things like checking if your medication matches your declared disability,” she said. “If it doesn’t, they can deny you entry.“As an openly disabled person, I would be very hesitant to be entering right now. If the conference hadn’t switched online, I wouldn’t have taken the risk.”In a statementuploaded to its websitein late January, the Society for Social Studies of Science said it was aware that US border control was “unpredictable”.“We … will be watching events closely in the coming months to make sure that we are supporting international attendees to the greatest possible extent,” organisers said. “Attendees are also encouraged to consult their own countries’ travel advice.”Australia’s National Tertiary Education Union said it had received multiple reports from members thatUS policy shiftshave caused academics to cancel travel, while others have had planned research partnerships terminated with little explanation.The union’s national president, Dr Alison Barnes, said members had expressed “deeply concerning impacts on their work and careers”.“Academics are cancelling travel to the US, abandoning valuable research partnerships, and dealing with suddenly terminated grants and contracts,” she said.“One researcher had their five-year USAID-funded conservation program terminated literally within days of the policy changes … another had a 10-year collaboration with the CDC abruptly ended when their US counterpart was sacked by email.“Many academics tell us they’re avoiding US travel entirely due to genuine fears about border detention and visa issues.”Barnes said many LGBTQ+ researchers, in particular, no longer felt safe travelling to the US for conferences, “directly impacting their career progression”.“We’re seeing grant applications go unanswered, contracts for 2025 jeopardised, and researchers facing significant career uncertainty,” she said.“When our academics fear travelling to major conferences or partnering with US institutions, the impacts ripple through the entire global knowledge ecosystem.“These changes threaten to isolate US research from vital international exchange at precisely the time when global collaboration is most needed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two high-speed ballistic missiles, armed, Ukraine says, with cluster munitions, slammed into the heart of the border city in mid-morning as families went to church, waited for a theatre performance or were simply strolling about on a mild spring day.The death toll currently stands at 34, including two children. Images from the scene show bodies or body bags on the ground, a trolley bus and cars burnt out, rubble and glass scattered around. It was reckless, cruel and vicious and its consequences entirely predictable to those who gave the order and pressed “launch”.To contemplate a daytime city-centre attack, in the full knowledge that civilians will be present, reflects a Russian culture of impunity that has been allowed to endure without effective challenge. Nevertheless, Washington’s approach, underDonald Trump, has been to try to negotiate an end to the war by talking directly with Moscow, while remaining mostly silent on Russian attacks on civilians.Talks between the US and Russia have continued unabated over the past two months at a time when Russian attacks on Ukraine’s cities appear to have stepped up. Nine adults and nine children were killed whena Russian ballistic missile using cluster bombs struck a children’s playground in Kryvyi Rihat the end of last week.‘People were burned alive in their cars’: As peace talks falter, Ukrainians resign themselves to fighting onRead morePeople were burned alive in their cars and the bodies of children were found dead in the playground, yet the attack was weakly condemned by the US ambassador toUkraine, Bridget Brink, who, toeing the White House line, would not say the deadly missile was from Russia as she tweeted: “This is why the war must end.”Brink has since announced she will step down and been more forthright. On Sunday, the ambassador attributed the Sumy attack to Russia and repeated that it appeared cluster bombs had been used. But now that she is on her way out, it is easier for her to speak her mind while Russia’s Vladimir Putintoys with Trumpand the rest of the US administration in peace talks that have hardly developed in two months.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/APOn Friday, the Russian leader spent four hours in talks with Steve Witkoff, a donor real estate developer who has become a key Trump adviser on Ukraine as well as the Middle East. What they talked about is unclear, but reports suggest Witkoff has been pushing the idea that the quickest way to getRussiato agree a ceasefire in Ukraine is to force Kyiv to hand over the entirety of four provinces that are only partly occupied by Russia’s military, including the cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.The dissonance between the killing and destruction in Sumy on Sunday and the photographed handshake between Witkoff and Putin is all too evident to most observers. It is not clear why it should even be contemplated that Ukraine hand over territory (something that even the US cannot easily force on Kyiv) when Russia is willing to countenance daytime attacks on civilians.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Kremlin will ignore condemnation from European leaders and wait for the news cycle to move on – and will almost certainly continue to attack Ukrainian cities to little military purpose. Not only are drone attacks commonplace, but there are now concerns they are routinely being armed with cluster munitions, while almost every day one or two hard-to-intercept ballistic missiles are thrown into the deadly mix.In Kyiv, PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhopes that gradually Trump will realise Putin is not negotiating in good faith. Certainly, the attack on the centre of Sumy hardly suggests a strong appetite for peace. But it is unclear at what point, if any, the White House is prepared to conclude that killing of civilians means that it needs to put genuine pressure on Russia to negotiate rather than indulge the Kremlin.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaTrump administrationUS politicsVladimir PutinDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

One hit a trolley bus full of passengers. Footage from the scene showed bodies lying in the street, burning cars, and rescuers carrying bloodied survivors. Two of the dead were children.“My seven-year-old son was running for shelter when the second missile struck. The blast ripped off a door which hit him in the leg. He has a bruise but is OK,” saidVolodymyr Niankin, a film director. “My son said this is the most terrible day of his life.”Niankin said he saw bodies on the ground. “Many of the people who died were sitting on the bus or walking in the road. A lot of people were out and about because it was a religious festival. I think this is genocide.”Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said there were “dozens of dead and wounded civilians”. He accused Russia of carrying out an act of deliberate terror and said tough reaction was needed from the US, Europe and the rest of the world.View image in fullscreenBodies lie on the ground after the Russian missile strike on Sumy.Photograph: Volodymyr Hordiienko/AP“Enemy missiles hit an ordinary city street, ordinary life: houses, educational institutions, cars on the street … And this on a day when people go to church: Palm Sunday, the feast of the Lord’s entry into Jerusalem,” heposted on social media.Zelenskyy said the Kremlin was ignoring a US proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire. “Unfortunately, there in Moscow they are convinced they can keep killing with impunity. Action is needed to change this situation,” he said.Officials said 117 people had been injured, including 15 children.There was widespread international outrage. Donald Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said the attack “crosses any line of decency”. “As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,”he wrote on X.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he was “appalled at Russia’s horrific attacks on civilians”. Vladimir Putin “must now agree to a full and immediate ceasefire without conditions”, he said.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, agreed on the “urgent need to impose a ceasefire on Russia”. “Everyone knows it is Russia alone that wants this war,” he said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the scenes from Sumy as heartbreaking and horrific.The EU’s ambassador toUkraine, Katarína Mathernová, called the strikes a war crime. “Nothing seems to be sacred to the Russians – neither churches, nor Ukrainian children,” she said.Ukrainians contrasted the images of bodies in Sumy with photos of Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, warmly shaking hands with Putin on Friday. The two held four hours of talks in St Petersburg.View image in fullscreenA wrecked bus after the missile attack.Photograph: Sumy region prosecutor’s office/AFP/Getty ImagesPutin’s press spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Sunday that the talks were going very well but that it was “impossible to expect any instant results”.Trump has said he is “pissed off” at Russia’s failure to stop bombing, but has so far not taken any concrete measures against Moscow. Ukraine has signed up to a 30-day ceasefire that Washington proposed a month ago.Since then, Russia has escalated its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, firing 70 missiles and 2,200 drones. Nine children and nine adults were killed earlier this month when a Russian missilehit a playgroundin the city of KryvyiRih.Zelenskyy has been pressing allies to send another 10 Patriot air defence systems to protect Ukraine’s skies. “Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and air bombs. We need the kind of attitude towards Russia that a terrorist deserves,” he said on Sunday.mapSumy is 15 miles (25km) from the border with Russia and is a major Ukrainian military hub. The missiles landed in a central civilian area where many people carrying willow branches for Palm Sunday were on their way to church.Video from a car dashcam shows an orange flash as one of the missiles struck at 10.20am. Plumes of grey smoke can be seen as other vehicles reverse away from the danger and passersby run in panic.The first missile hit aconference centre belonging to Sumy’s state university. Several children were waiting outside for an 11am theatre performance in a basement venue. The second landed 200 metres away, in Pokrovska Street, as the trolley bus rolled past.View image in fullscreenThe conference centre at Sumy’s state university after the missile strike.Photograph: Volodymyr NiankinNiankin said the centre was a unique arts hub and home to a theatre he ran. “I feel like half of my heart has been taken away. It was a place where we could play and create. Everything is destroyed: the stage, costumes, all our stuff. We have no chance to continue our work,” he said.The director, who made afilm about Sumy’s resistanceto Russia’s 2022 invasion, said there were not a lot of people inside the building when it was flattened. “It happened half an hour before the show was due to start. My son was nearby attending a class in a studio.”Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia had launched two Iskander-M missiles from its western territory in the Voronezh and Kursk regions. He identified the army forces responsible as the 112th and 448th missile brigades. “Another proof of the godlessness of the disgusting cursed Moscow,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On 22 July 2011, Norwegian neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb outside the office of the then prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, killing eight people and damaging surrounding buildings, before murdering a further 69 people on the nearby island of Utøya.But now the same site is to be reconfigured by hope. Last week, after a multi-round, three-year-long selection process, a jury of curators, politicians, artists and representatives of the victims and survivors of the attacks announced the winning design for a new Norwegian national memorial to be unveiled in time for the 15th anniversary in 2026.Norwegian artist Matias Faldbakken’s mosaic Upholding, 12 metres high and 15 metres wide, and made of some 500,000 stones, shows a wading bird native to Utøya reflected in the lake. It is a monumental piece that touches on both societal support and nature.And a mosaic, Faldbakken argues, is the perfect symbol for a memorial site. “A fragmented image, every part plays its role. In old literature, it’s called painting for eternity. A mosaic is one of the only image formats that survives fire, earthquakes and floods.”The mosaic will be braced by a steel rig similar to the one that once secured Pablo Picasso’s mural The Fishermen on one of the blast-damaged blocks in the quarter. Faldbakken, who representedNorwayat the Venice Biennale in 2005, explains that he was initially inspired by walking past the rig holding Picasso’s work, which stood in the Government Quarter for almost three years.View image in fullscreen‘I took my artist’s ego out of the equation’ … Matias FaldbakkenPhotograph: Vegard KlevenBut the main purpose of the monument is not to reference the work of another artist but to serve as “a window to the other crime site”, explains Faldbakken. After triggering the Oslo blast, Breivik travelled to the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, a lake 40km northwest of Olso, where he attacked a summer camp for the Labour party’s youth wing (AUF). Most of the 69 victims were teenagers.“I was out on the island many times,” Faldbakken says. “I started to research the birds. And this small wader had a lot of physical traits that I thought worked: a very small, fragile and light bird with its thin legs. But it has this angle to it. It has a gaze. It pushes you a little bit back.”On Faldbakken’s last visit to Utøya, the lake was completely still, the water a mirror, which inspired the bird’s reflection in the design. It is not meant as a clear symbol of life and death. “This is a very peaceful image but it is almost like a Rorschach test. It has this duality,” he notes. “Breivik was a homegrown terrorist, which mystified this country at the time. There’s that serene Scandinavian facade, and yet there’s the terror underneath.”Survivors and the relatives of those killed will be involved in placing the stones into the composition. The names of the 77 people who died will be engraved on the base of the work.View image in fullscreenA model showing the work from behind, in situ in the Government Quarter.Photograph: Vegard KlevenRegitze Schäffer Botnen, who was a 17-year-old participant at the Utøya camp on 22 July, was a member of the jury. Initially she felt that she was representing all the survivors, “And then I realised that is an impossible task. So, I figured out that I had to dig deeper into the subject and listen to other survivors and people who lost their children, and ask the question not what do you like the most but what is a good memorial? To see what kind of conversation that started, and learn from it.”The transparency and public engagement in the selection process was in part a result of the backlash against a rushed commission for a memorial on Utøya island in 2014. The chosen work, Jonas Dahlberg’sMemory Wound, proposed a permanent three-and-a-half metre gap be cut through the island. The concept was considered by many as memorialising one act of violence with another, andthe project was subsequently dropped. “It didn’t have the grounding of what we’re doing now,” Faldbakken says, tactfully. “And it was very much in the backyard of many people who lived close to Utøya, and were the people who took out their boats and saved the kids.”In 2012, Breivik received a 21-year-sentence, the longest that can be handed down in Norway. “He might theoretically walk past the memorial a free man some time in the future, but it is highly unlikely,” says Thomas Ugelvik, a professor of law at Oslo University. Breivik received aforvaringsentence, which is indeterminate. If he still poses a threat to society the sentence can be extended, potentially for the rest of his life.Arguably, the greatest memorial to 22 July would be the impossibility of such an attack happening again. “We have a greater focus on emergency preparedness than we did before the attack, as well as many safety measures around governmental buildings and critical infrastructure,” says Jens Stoltenberg, who went on to become general secretary of Nato and is now finance minister of Norway. “But no measure can serve as a guarantee against terrorism or extremism. In that sense a memorial is important as a constant reminder of something we would never want to experience again, and that our free and open society can never be taken for granted.”In the wake of 22 July, led by a public address from Stoltenberg, Norwegians came together. Thousands of people participated in a “rose march” the following week, walking from the town hall to Oslo Cathedral holding roses in defiance of extremism. Faldbakken was in the US at the time of the attacks, but two of his children were in Oslo. “It had an echo in our family life, because the kids were really shocked by it. I jumped on the first plane and came back.”Having to take so many peoples’ views and feelings into account while designing the memorial was a very different practice for Faldbakken. “I stood on the side as an artist and thought I’d make the best work I can based on this idea. Pretty early on I took myself and my artist’s ego out of the equation. It was not about me any more; it was about them.”Explore more on these topicsArtAnders BreivikNorwayEuropeSculptureInstallationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emergency officialssaidthey rushed to the scene and attempted to revive him.The incident took place at a lookout point known as Postigo del Consuelo, which is tucked into remains of the medieval walls that surround the city. The small viewing platformhas longattracted throngs of tourists and local people for the sweeping views it offers of the city and aqueduct.With two tiers of arches and stretching more than 800 metres in length, the Roman aqueduct is believedto have been built aroundAD50. It was used until the 1970s to channel water to the city from nearby mountains. Declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1985, it stands at more than 28 metres above ground at its highest point.As is customary in Spain with deaths believed to be accidental, judicial officials have launched an investigation and are gathering testimonies and evidence to confirm the circumstances of the death.When contacted on Sunday, a spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British national who has died in Spain, and are in touch with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But it was also the first year that theNational Bee Unitreceived confirmation, via DNA, that the hornets had successfully bred and over-­wintered in the UK.Early warning system to track Asian hornets unveiled by UK researchersRead moreNow experts fear the dry, sunny start to spring this year and the rapid spread of the species inEuropewill lead to a surge in this year’s numbers.“Unprecedented” early sightings of Asian hornets have been recorded inJersey, leading experts to suspect that record numbers could try to establish nests in the UK this year.“The first queens were more than two weeks early this year,” said John De Carteret, a founding member of the Jersey Asian Hornet Group, which has about 550 traps in place this year. “We’re obviously concerned.”There were 262 queen Asian hornets recorded on Jersey by 11 April,a year-on-year increase of 1,090%.“When we reach 266 queens, we will equal the total from 2024 – and that figure wasn’t reached until 25 June,” said De Carteret.Ian Campbell, of the British Beekeepers Association, said: “There’s a strong risk of this year’s numbers being at least as high as in 2023 and the potential to be even higher. It would be a surprise if numbers were not above the 2024 level.”The species is carnivorous, and a typical nest of between 2,000 and 3,000 Asian hornets can devour more than 11kg (about 24lb) of insects a season, according to Campbell – about the weight of 90,000 bees.The public is being urged to “be vigilant everywhere” and learn how to identify and report Asian hornets, which have yellow legs and a distinctive orange band on the fourth segment of their abdomens – alongside entirely black velvety thoraxes, which distinguish them from the native European hornet.View image in fullscreenThis year’s dry and sunny spring is expected to boost the numbers of Asian hornets in the UK.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyLike bees, their stings can cause painful and potentially deadly allergic reactions. Any “sightings of concern” should be reported to the government’s National Bee Unit via theAsian Hornet Watch appor online, using the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH)reporting tool.“Yellow-legged hornets cause significant damage to native pollinators, including our much-loved honeybees,” said Kate Wilson, head of the National Bee Unit. “Thanks to increasing reports to the app and online, it is not unexpected that sightings may occur earlier in the year. We encourage the public to remain vigilant and continue to report any potential sightings to us.”Such sightings can help people working to combat the spread of Asian hornets to understand the national picture. “I collected one from a lady in her 80s after she captured it in a yogurt tub, while the youngest person who reported one was eight,” De Carteret said.Ecology professor Helen Roy of UKCEH and Exeter University said the hornets pose “a major threat” to wildlife and biodiversity: “There isn’t a natural enemy that we’re aware of that could control the Asian hornet.”It is thought that successive generations of the offspring of a single mated queen, which was accidentally introducedto France in a container of Chinese crockeryin 2004, have now reached 15 European countries, including the UK. “In some countries like Spain and Belgium, we’ve seen numbers increase from a handful of nests to 10,000 nests in four years,” said Campbell.France is believed to have more than a half a million nests, which researchers believe could becosting the French economyan estimated €30.8m a year in lost bee colonies and honey revenue, while the invaders have reduced honey productionby 35% in Portugaland50% in Liguria, Italy,in recent years.In March, the first large-scale study of the Asian hornet’s diet, run by researchers at Exeter University,found 1,400 different species in their guts. Of the top 50 invertebrate prey species identified, 43 were known to visit flowers. These includedEurope’s three main crop pollinators: the European honeybee, the buff-tailed bumblebee and the red-tailed bumblebee.De Carteret, a retired police forensic officer, said hornets will typically “butcher” this prey by biting off their heads, wings, legs and abdomens so that their thoraxes – a source of protein – can be fed to the queen’s larvae.So far this year, there have been onlytwo confirmed sightingsof yellow-legged hornets in the UK, but “now is the time for people to be on the lookout”, Roy said.If the government had not destroyed the nests the public has been reporting since 2016,modelling by Exeter University suggeststhat the hornets would already be established in large areas of England and Wales, and entering Scotland.Campbell said it was important to try to take photos of suspected Asian hornets and their nests: last year, frommore than 29,000 reports, only about 70 were deemed accurate enough to beconfirmed sightings. “To be successful with eradication, the National Bee Unit needs to get every single nest,” he said.New hornet queens are constantly buzzing into the UK from Europe to replace those that have been eradicated. “The Asian hornet can arrive in a lot of different ways. It can come in on fresh produce or within someone’s car, across any Channel crossing,” Roy said. “Everyone needs to be vigilant, everywhere.”Explore more on these topicsBeesThe ObserverInsectsWildlifeJerseyEuropeFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The broadcast ofGrønlands hvide guld(Greenland’s white gold), a 55-minute film about the Danish exploitation over several decades of a cryolite mine in southernGreenlandand the vast sums of money it generated, made waves in February in both Greenland and its former colonial ruler, Denmark. But the reaction between the two could not have been more polarised.In Greenland, which remains part of the Danish kingdom, with Denmark still controlling its foreign and defence policies, there were feelings of anger and deep sadness. The country was in the middle of an election being watched by the world thanks to Donald Trump’s threats to take control of the Arctic island. According to a poll for Greenlandic newspaperSermitsiaq, more than a third of voters said the documentary would influence their vote.There was also a sense of long-awaited recognition – that the stories people had heard from their friends and relatives about what happened in the now derelict town of Ivittuut were finally being confirmed by a public institution as big as DR, the public-service Danish Broadcasting Corporation.mapPolitically, it was seen as seismic in the country’s capital, Nuuk. It had the potential, some believed, to change the power dynamic between the territory and the Nordic country, which has long been framed as Greenland being financially dependent onDenmark. “A new documentary film shows that Denmark has earned at least 400bn kroner [£46bn] from just one mine,” Greenland’s then-prime minister, Múte B Egede, said at the time.While there were initially some positive reviews in Denmark, the Danish media quickly flipped to attack, after one of the economists who appeared in the documentary denounced its interpretation of the figures. “It was horrible,” Bévort told theObserver. “It was the worst shit storm, almost ever.”Criticism of the documentary centred on the figure of 400bn Danish kroner, the amount the team calculated was Denmark’s gross income from the mine over 133years, adjusted to today’s value.But Torben M Andersen – an economics professor at Aarhus university and chair of the Greenland Economic Council, who appears in the documentary – put the figure into doubt by urging caution over the calculation, which he said referred to turnover between 1854 and 1987, not profit. The documentary is careful to emphasise that the figure – calculated using logbooks from the Danish national archives – refers to the overall turnover because, as they are advised when dealing with colonial economics, production costs were spent in Denmark using Danish workers and equipment.For 10 days, DR stood by the documentary. Despite criticism from several politicians, including the Danish Moderates’ culture minister, Jakob Engel-Schmidt, who decried its “poor journalistic craftmanship”, and economists, DR’s news director, Sandy French, refused to give in, saying: “There have been no violations of press ethics guidelines, there are no factual errors or reservations that have not been made”.View image in fullscreenThe film’s crew in Ivittuut, where the mine was located.Photograph: Michael BévortBut eventually they changed their minds. They announced that they would withdraw and “depublish” the documentary and that DR’s news editor-in-chief, Tholmas Falbe, was resigning. French said the turning point was new information about a graph of total accumulated sales of cryolite that had been removed from an earlier version of the documentary because it was not accurate.“It may seem like a minor thing compared to the big debate about the documentary, but this new discovery is crucial to me because you have to be able to trust that the presentation is accurate,” said French. Bévort, who is trying to find a new home for the documentary, said the rare move to depublish was political. “It’s nothing to do with the film. They’re going after DR.”Rune Lykkeberg, editor-in-chief of Danish newspaperInformation, agrees. “Not political in the sense ‘we need to censor this message to appease the government’. But corporately political in the sense that ‘we must do this to protect our brand and control the damage’.”He added: “DR is like the BBC, a public-service station whose ultimate executive is the government – the minister of culture appoints the head of its board who appoints the formally independent CEO of DR. He came out with heavy criticism of the documentary, which was also political overreach.”The move to depublish was a “terrible decision”, Lykkeberg added. “The documentary was part of public debate, it was a public fact that people were deliberating and it was in the common interest that everyone could access it. It does not help anyone that you can’t see the film you’re talking about. And the documentary is not dangerous.”Naaja Nathanielsen, who was a minister in the last Greenlandic government and in the current government, which was officially sworn in on Monday, said the move was “an overreaction” from DR. “It has more something to do with the Danish self-interpretation of their actions in Greenland more than what this movie is about,” she told theObserver.While she has not seen the numbers, so cannot comment on whether they are exactly correct, she believes they are fair. “What I do believe is that it’s not an unjust presentation of the economy between Greenland and Denmark,” she said. “I have confidence enough in the numbers to say they represent a correct interpretation of the way things were – even when Denmark started investing more in Greenland.”But to focus so much on the figures alone “derails” the conversation from what should be the real debate, she said. “In Greenland we can have both narratives … yes, there is something in the past with Denmark that has been awry, that was not right, that violated rights. And we can still accept and acknowledge all the good stuff Denmark has done as well. So for us both narratives can exist at the same time.”But in Denmark – or at least Danish media – she says, that seems not to be the case. “There is only one narrative that can exist, and that is that Denmark was good to Greenland and that’s the end of the story.”DR and the Danish minister for culture did not respond to theObserver’s request for comment.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkThe ObserverGreenlandEuropeDocumentaryTelevisionDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The UN has said they were deliberately shot “one by one” and the bodies, along with the rescue vehicles, were then buried with a bulldozer in a sandy pit, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. Witnesses who uncovered the bodies said the workers were found still in their uniforms and some had their hands tied.The Red Crescent called the attack on its workers a “grave violation of international law” and has called for an international investigation.‘I heard them take their last breath’: survivor recounts Gaza paramedic killingsRead moreNsasrah, 47, fromGaza, who had been working for Red Crescent for 16 years, was among the medics in the ambulances caught up in the ambush, and he had not been seen since. In an interview with the Guardian, another survivor, the Red Crescent volunteer Munther Abed, 27, said he had seen Nsasrah being taken away alive and blindfolded by Israeli officers at the scene of the killings.On Sunday, the ICRC said it had “received information that the PRCS medic Assad al-Nsasrah has been detained in an Israeli place of detention”. The ICRC spokesperson gave no further details on where Nsasrah was being held and confirmed that Israel had not granted access to visit him.“The ICRC has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023,” said the spokesperson. “The ICRC continues to call for access to all places of detention and reiterates publicly and privately that all detainees must always be treated humanely and with dignity.”In a statement, PRCS called on the international community to demand the release of Nsasrah, a father of six, stating that he had been “forcibly abducted while carrying out his humanitarian duties”.There was no immediate comment from the Israel military.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have faced mounting pressure over inconsistencies in their account of the attack. They had initially claimed troops opened fire on vehicles that were “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals.However, the IDFhad to backtrackafter mobile phone footage, from a medic who was among those killed at the scene, showed the ambulances – clearly marked with the Red Crescent logo – driving with flashing red emergency lights and headlights on their vehicles.Abed, the medic who survived the attack, described how he was held for several hours by Israeli forces after the ambulances came under fire. He said he was fully stripped, beaten again and interrogated about his past before he was finally released.The IDF said they were now re-examining “operational information” to understand why the initial account had been “mistaken”, and that an investigation was being carried out.They added that a preliminary inquiry had indicated “troops opened fire due to a perceived threat after a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists”. However, none of those killed in the attack were armed and no proof has yet been presented that any of those killed were Hamas militants.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was the only hospital still fully functioning inGazaCity after the destruction of medical facilities in the northern area of the strip.The agency said the bombing “led to the destruction of the surgery building and the oxygen generation station for the intensive care units”.There were no reports of casualties but the Gaza health ministry said one child died during the rushed evacuation as doctors were unable to provide urgent care.The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, was among those who condemned the strike, calling it “deplorable”. “Israel’s attacks on medical facilities have comprehensively degraded access to healthcare in Gaza,” Lammy said.Hospitals, which are protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on 7 October 2023. The Israeli military has accused Hamas of embedding military operations in hospitals and civilian buildings, which the group has denied.Al-Ahli hospital is run by the Anglican church in Jerusalem. In a statement, the episcopal diocese of Jerusalem said it was appalled at the airstrike, and said it was the fifth time the hospital had been targeted.View image in fullscreenPeople inspect the damage after the Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a statement confirming the strike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) alleged the hospital was a command and control centre used by Hamas.“The compound was used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops,” the military said. In a statement in response, Hamas denied the allegations, calling them lies by the IDF “to “justify its savage crimes”.According to witnesses, doctors and patients were given less than 20 minutes’ warning to evacuate the building before the strike. Video footage circulating online appeared to show people fleeing the building as it was engulfed in smoke and flames. The IDF said it had taken steps to “mitigate harm to civilians” and issued “advance warnings”.Dr Moataz Harara, the head of the hospital’s emergency department, said of the evacuation: “The scene was heartbreaking and painful. You could see patients walking out on foot or being carried on beds, all of them filled with terror and fear etched on their faces. Women and children were screaming and crying.”Harara said the hospital had previously been treating between 300 and 500 patients a day, on top of 120 inpatients. But he confirmed Sunday’s attack had left the hospital with a “complete inability to operate” and meant it could no longer accept any new patients. The radiology room and laboratories had also been devastated, he added.Harara said growing numbers in Gaza were facing a “humanitarian disaster and famine” at the same time as medical facilities were coming under attack.Since the breakdown of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in March, Gaza’s health sector has been further crippled by a blockade on humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, by the Israeli government.It has left people facing acute shortages of food, water and medicines, a tactic that rights groups say amounts to a war crime. Israel maintains that enough essential medical supplies have entered Gaza.Israel is ‘seizing territory’ and will ‘divide up’ Gaza, Netanyahu saysRead moreAcross the strip, Israel continued to escalate its military offensive and vowed to seize large parts of Gaza to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages and accept new ceasefire terms. The Gaza health ministry said that 35 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday.On Saturday, Israel said it had completed its takeover of a new “security zone” that cut off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, part of a wider Israeli operation to establish and expand a security buffer zone across southernmost Gaza where Palestinians are banned from entering.The defence minister, Israel Katz, announced that Israel’s military had seized the corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis, which he referred to as the “Morag axis”, giving Israel effective control of the area stretching from the Egyptian border to Rafah. Evacuation orders were also given for several neighbourhoods in Khan Younis on Saturday night.The prewar population of Rafah was about 275,000, which earlier this year expanded to an estimated 1.4 million as Palestinians were displaced from north and central Gaza by Israeli security operations.View image in fullscreenAccording to witnesses, doctors and patients were given less than 20 minutes’ warning to evacuate the building.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesBut last week Israel once again issued sweeping evacuation orders for all those staying in Rafah, displacing swathes of Gaza’s population of 2 million people. In the last three weeks alone, dozens of evacuation orders have been issued and 400,000 Palestinians told to move, according to the UN.On Friday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than two-thirds of Gaza was either under active displacement orders or designated as “no-go” zones, where humanitarian groups cannot operate freely. The areas of Gaza that remain habitable continue to shrink and most people are living packed together in squalid tents or the rubble of their homes.The establishment of Israeli control over crucial corridors in the south and northern areas of Gaza, as well as the expanding security buffer zone, means Israel now controls more than 50% of the strip.Katz vowed to continue to expand operations “vigorously” across the rest of Gaza. “IDF activity will soon expand strongly to additional locations throughout most of Gaza and you will have to evacuate the fighting zones,” he said.The statement by Katz urged Palestinians to stand up and remove Hamas and release the remaining hostages, saying: “This is the only way to stop the war.” There was no immediate Hamas response.Since theHamas-led attack on 7 October 2023on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We need to do it with the French. There are a lot of other countries sitting back and waiting.”She said that if the west did not act soon, there would be no Palestine left to recognise.Chris Doyle, the chair of the Council on Arab-British Understanding (CAABU), also backed the measure, saying it should have been done long ago and that such a step by two permanent members of the UN security council would send a powerful message.He also said that if the UK did not take this step soon it may be too late sinceIsraelwas clearly intent on pressing ahead with the effective annexation of the West Bank.The CAABU has a strong following among Labour MPs, many of whom are furious with Israel’s behaviour in Gaza. There is also anger that two Labour MPs werebanned by Israelfrom visiting the West Bank last week.The Foreign Office’s formal position is to say it will recognise Palestine at an appropriate moment of maximum impact, but when David Cameron was foreign secretary hemarginally advanced the UK policyby affirming that recognition need not come at the end of a process that leads to a two-state solution. In a reference to Israel, he said no state could have a veto over a UK decision to recognise Palestine.Macron surprised observers last week when he announced he hoped the June conference would act as a trigger for a group of nations to recognise Palestinian statehood, remarks that put clear diplomatic pressure on the UK to follow the French initiative. He told France 5: “We must move toward recognition [of the Palestinian state] and so, in the coming months, we will.”He added in a reference to some Gulf states including Saudi Arabia: “I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.”The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman – who has personally accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinians – has said Saudi Arabia will only recognise Israel as part of a pact that includes an irreversible path to a Palestinian state.Although there is scepticism in some British quarters as to how far Macron is prepared to antagonise Israel, personal and political relations between Keir Starmer and Macron are strong. It will be hard for the Foreign Office to resist a strong French push for Palestine’s recognition, especially if it is seen as part of a European-Gulf peace push.In May last year France chose not to joinSpain, Ireland and Norwayin recognising Palestine following an overwhelming vote in favour by the UN general assembly. At present 148 of the 193 member countries of the UN have officially recognised Palestinian statehood. So far no western G20 country, including Canada, Italy or Germany, has taken the step.The Knesset voted heavily last month against a two-state solution, but the leader of the Israeli opposition, Yair Lapid, still sees a medium-term pathway to it so long as Hamas is not part of any Palestinian government.European recognition would infuriate the US and Israel, but the French argue an alliance with Gulf states may prompt the Trump administration to recalibrate its support for Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on social media: “Unilateral recognition of a fictional Palestinian state … is a reward for terror and a boost to Hamas.”Faced by the backlash, Macron, writing in Hebrew on the social media site X, claimed he was the victim of a host of unfounded interpretations. He said France’s position was “yes to peace. Yes to Israel’s security. Yes to a Palestinian state without Hamas.”He wrote: “This requires the release of all hostages, a sustainable ceasefire, the immediate resumption of humanitarian assistance, and the promotion of a two-state political solution. There is no other way but a political solution. I stand for the Palestinians’ legal right to a state and peace, just as I stand for the Israelis’ right to live in peace and security, and while both states are recognised by their neighbours.“The two-state solution conference in June must be decisive. I am doing everything I can, alongside our partners, to achieve this goal of peace. We need it so much.”In a sign of the US’s apparent willingness to tolerate the annexation of the West Bank, the US Senate, voting largely along party lines last week, confirmed Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, as US ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has referred to the West Bankby its Jewish biblical namesJudea and Samaria. At his confirmation hearing he claimed Donald Trump did not support the enforced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeLabourEmily ThornberryPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer must put his close friendship and association with Ms Siddiq aside and take the action he should have months ago.”Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission (ACC) has alleged that Siddiq, 42, received a 670 sq metre plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital, Dhaka, through ties to the former rulers, according to theSunday Telegraph.The allegation is that Siddiq persuaded her aunt to allocate three plots of land in the exclusive enclave for her family members, including her mother, Sheikh Rehana, her brother Radwan and her younger sister Azmina. The family are all based in Britain.The ACC chair, Mohammad Abdul Momen, previously told the BBC the investigations in Bangladesh were “based on documentary evidence of corruption” and Siddiq should return to fight her case in Bangladesh.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No physical altercation took place, according to the PA news agency.Rourke had received a formal warning fromBig Brotherearlier in the week for “unacceptable language and behaviour” directed at another housemate, JoJo Siwa.The 21-year-old US singer accused Rourke of being homophobic after he made comments about her sexuality and said he would “vote the lesbian out real quick”.JoJo Siwa.The Oscar-nominated actor had also asked Siwa if she “likes girls or boys”, and when she replied that she liked girls and her partner was non-binary, he said: “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more.”She responded: “I can guarantee I’ll still be gay and I’ll still be in a very happy relationship.”Hughes, who has presented sports coverage for the BBC and ITV, told Rourke “you can’t say that” after theformer boxersaid he needed “a fag” and gestured to Siwa to add: “I’m not talking to you.”Hughes, 32, comforted Siwa in Wednesday’s episode after the comments.In the diary room, Rourke was given a formal warning and Big Brother said: “Further language or behaviour of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.”Rourke then apologised to Siwa, saying: “I want to apologise.

British Steel’s UK management team is now scrambling to buy the materials, with help from government officials.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, declined to directly accuse Jingye of sabotaging the plant but it is understood ministers do not expect the company to return to any negotiations. Reynolds said theemergency government steel actionmeant there was now a “high trust bar” for Chinese companies to invest in critical UK industries.“It might not be sabotage, it might be neglect,” Reynolds told the BBC on Sunday. “The conscious decision not just to not order raw materials but to sell existing supplies of raw materials is the significant change that required the government to step in.”Reynolds said there would not be a full ban on Chinese investment in UK industry, with MPs raising questions about whether companies would be allowed to invest in a planned new nuclear site. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been on a charm offensive with Beijing to try to attract investment.But on Sunday the Guardian revealed the government could target parts of China’s security apparatus under new foreign influence rules set to be unveiled in the coming months. China as a whole is not expected to be included on the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme (Firs).Reynolds said the costs to the economy of closing the plant and losing the country’s steelmaking capacity – plus the major job losses it entailed – would have been at least £1bn, more than the losses expected from nationalising the plant.A decision on full nationalisation is expected to be taken in the next fortnight if the plant can continue operation.Reynolds told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg he would not “make my situation or the nation’s situation more difficult” by giving more details on whether the steel blast furnaces would be able to continue operating.If the furnaces run out of raw materials, they could go through an uncontrolled cooling, making it prohibitively expensive to restart production.The government said Tata Steel and Rainham Steel had offered “managerial support and raw materials” to British Steel.Last week Jingye ordered British Steel to temporarily shut down one blast furnace on Monday in order to eke out remaining materials. However, the process – known as a salamander tap – is complicated and is generally avoided unless repairs are needed. British Steel managers are now looking at whether this can be avoided.While some materials at Immingham port on the Humber estuary inLincolnshireare awaiting payment, British Steel is trying to find materials for the coming weeks, with some shipments taking as long as 45 days to arrive.Reynolds said the UK had “given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that”.‘I have spent my life in this corner of Lincolnshire and witnessed how such job losses affect every part of a community’Read moreBut he said it was too commercially sensitive to confirm either way whether the government could guarantee the plant would continue operating.Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2019 – when Boris Johnson was prime minister – had stopped ordering more raw materials and begun selling off the supplies it already had, declining an offer of £500m in support and refusing to guarantee the furnaces could continue operating.“It became clear to me and to the government, no financial offer of any generosity would have been accepted,” Reynolds said. “This was the situation on [Thursday] the 10th of April, on the Friday we had agreement from the cabinet. On Saturday, parliament was recalled, and here we are.”Officials from the Department for Business and Trade arrived at the Scunthorpe plant as soon as the legislation came into force on Saturday, the government said on Sunday.The business secretary told Sky News there was now a “high trust bar” for bringing Chinese investment into the UK and said he would not have allowed a Chinese company to invest in the “sensitive” steel sector.Reynolds said the company had annual losses of £233m and that figure “can be improved upon”. But he said the cost of nationalisation had to be compared with the cost of allowing the plant to go under.He said it would not mean any further borrowing to nationalise the plant. “We’ve got an allocation in the first budget for a steel fund of over £2.5bn.“If we are spending some of that money to support, in the short term, steel, I think that’s better for the taxpayer than spending a greater sum of money on a transition with a company I’m not sure right now I could rely on, or to be frank … the complete collapse of British Steel, with a cost to the exchequer of many multiples [of that].“If that had gone down, that number of jobs, the land remediation, support to those who lost their jobs, that would be well over £1bn.”Reynolds said he would not make accusations of Chinese state interference, but said the company was “not [acting] in the kind of rational way we’d expect a company to operate in a market economy”.The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, accused Jingye of lying about the company’s accounts and said he was “100% certain” the Chinese government had ordered Jingye to buy British Steel in order to close the business. Farage offered no evidence for those accusations and said it was based on his “intuition”.“Why do you think that yesterday morning the trade unions acted to stop the Chinese officials even getting their cars into the plant? Because they feared industrial sabotage,” Farage said.The GMB trade union general secretary, Gary Smith, confirmed workers had acted to stop the company gaining access.“We were worried about industrial vandalism and there was a worry about sabotage on the site, quite frankly,” he said. “And yesterday, workers did prevent executives from the Chinese owners from going on site.“I’m sure that people are still very worried about that, but these people performed heroics yesterday to ensure that we’ve got a fighting chance for the steel industry in this country. They were legitimately concerned about industrial sabotage.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryJonathan ReynoldsManufacturing sectorLincolnshireNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This could lead to a hat-trick of hold-ups on Thursday, Friday and Saturday as drivers visit family and friends.“Drivers shouldn’t expect to escape the queues if they don’t plan the best time to set off. It’s always best to travel as early as possible in the morning or later in the day when most of the traffic has eased, especially if headed to popular holiday destinations such as the West Country, Scotland or Wales.”The Port of Dover said it expected to process about 5,500 cars embarking on outbound ferry sailings between 6am and 1pm on Good Friday.The traffic management system Operation Brock, which involves narrow lanes and a reduced 50mph speed limit, will be in place in Kent until 22 April. It is designed to manage traffic flows on the M20, with lorries heading for the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel directed to a specific lane.On the railways, Network Rail is conducting engineering work in several locations this weekend, causing disruption to a number of routes. The most significant impact will be at London Euston, where there will be no services to or from Milton Keynes on Easter Saturday and Easter Sunday, and a reduced timetable on Good Friday and Easter Monday.The tourism authority VisitEngland said about 10.6 million British adults were planning to take a holiday in the UK over the bank holiday period.The aviation analytics company Cirium said 11,282 flights were scheduled to depart from UK airports between Good Friday and Easter Monday.Explore more on these topicsTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

It aims to provide 10,000 patients in England with personalised cancer treatments in the UK by 2030.The NHS partnered with the life-sciences company Scancell to widen access for patients at hospitals across the country, with seven sites initially registered and the first patients expected to be referred next month.Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, accounting for about 4% of all new cases.Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS national cancer director, said: “Skin cancer can have a devastating impact and we know that cancer vaccines have the potential to revolutionise cancer care for patients in this country and across the world – and to save more lives.“It’s incredibly exciting that the NHS is expanding its world-leading programme so more patients with different types of cancer could benefit from the development ofnew vaccinesthat could stop their cancer coming back.“We want to ensure as many eligible NHS patients as possible have access to these vital trials, which is why we are working with a range of industry partners as more studies get up and running to ensure patients are fast-tracked to a vaccine that could transform lives.”A golden age of cancer treatment? – podcastRead moreThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, said:“This kind of innovation is nothing short of life-saving and I want to see more of these world-leading treatments being developed in the UK. That’s why through our plan for change we’ve taken action to boost our life-sciences sector through steps to fast-track clinical trials and cut red tape for researchers – so that Britain is the best country in the world for medical research.“This will accelerate the discovery of transformative treatments and improve services for patients, driving growth across the country while making sure as many people as possible can benefit from cutting-edge treatments.”Susanna Daniels, the chief executive of Melanoma Focus, said: “Melanoma skin cancer can be deadly and it’s sadly on the rise in the UK. As well as continuing to call for urgent action on prevention, we’re delighted to see progress in innovative treatments and very much welcome the expansion of this vaccine trial.“The use of vaccines to treat melanoma is an exciting development and we will be encouraging eligible patients to take part in these groundbreaking trials with our up-to-date Melanoma TrialFinder so that vaccines can be understood and patients can locate trial centres to discuss with their medical teams.”Explore more on these topicsSkin cancerCancerVaccines and immunisationNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It will not involve deployed soldiers collecting bins.Dysfunction worthy of the House of Windsor: the real reasons rubbish is piling up in Birmingham | Kate KnowlesRead moreA government spokesperson said: “The government has already provided a number of staff to support the council with logistics and make sure the response on the ground is swift to address the associated public health risks.“In light of the ongoing public health risk, a small number of office-based military personnel with operational planning expertise have been made available to Birmingham city council to further support in this area.“This builds on a range of measures we’ve supported the council on to date – including neighbouring authorities providing additional vehicles and crews, and opening household waste centres to Birmingham residents.”More than 17,000 tonnes of rubbish has piled up in the streets since the industrial action started intermittently in January and progressed to an all-out strike in March.The dispute is over plans to scrap the higher-paid waste recycling and collection officer role from council fleets, which the council claims risks creating a “huge future equal-pay liability”.Last week Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, urged members of the Unite union to accept an “improved” deal, while the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the strike had “escalated way out of hand”.The union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, has condemned the “constant attacks and briefings against these low-paid bin workers”, claiming that the long-running dispute was adding further strains between the Labour party and Unite.“It is important to reiterate the truth, as opposed to the lies being peddled in an attempt to distract,” she said.“This dispute is not about greed or increased pay. This dispute is about workers losing up to £8,000 of their pay – which for some is almost a quarter.”Graham added that a partial deal on pay protection for some workers had already been agreed and urged the council to accept a wider offer the union had put forward.The council says only 17 workers will be affected, and they stand to lose much less than Unite has claimed.A further ballot on a deal to end the strike is expected to take place on Monday.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamIndustrial actionMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

She was as wise and funny as anyone I ever met, as well as being very pretty and kind, and talented as both an actress and writer.“An instinctively empathetic person who was loved by everyone who met her. We spoke on the phone almost every day for the past 40 years.”Upstairs, Downstairs, covering class relations in Edwardian England, ran for five series from 1971 to 1975 in the UK and was also screened in the US. It won seven Emmy awards and a Peabody award, and Marsh won the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a drama series in 1975 for her portrayal of Rose, the head parlour maid of the elegant Bellamy family that the show centred on.View image in fullscreenJean Marsh in 2012 receiving her OBE.Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PAMarsh also co-created The House of Eliott and appeared in films such as Cleopatra in 1963, Frenzy in 1972, The Eagle Has Landed in 1976, The Changeling in 1980, Return to Oz in 1985, Willow in 1988, Fatherland in 1994 and Monarch in 2000.View image in fullscreenSome of the cast of Upstairs, Downstairs, back row, left to right, Jean Marsh, Christopher Beeny, Angela Baddeley, Gordon Jackson and Jacqueline Tong.

She later portrayed a villain opposite the Seventh Doctor.Marsh was awarded an OBE in 2012 for services to drama.The actor was born as Lyndsay Torren Marsh on 1 July 1934. She was six when the blitz began, and at seven she started ballet classes and took an interest in the performing arts. Rather than pursuing a traditional career, Marsh went to theatre school – which her parents considered a practical move, according tothe New York Times.In 1972, she told the Guardian: “If you were very working class in those days, you weren’t going to think of a career in science. You either did a tap dance or you worked in Woolworths.”Marsh came up with the idea for Upstairs, Downstairs with her friend the actor Eileen Atkins when the pair were house-sitting at a wealthy friend’s house in the south of France. After explaining that she wished she lived in luxury more often, Marsh got the idea to create a show that explored class relationships within household dynamics.Explore more on these topicsUpstairs DownstairsPeriod drama (TV)TelevisionDramanewsShareReuse this content"

He conducted that historic task and exposed egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars,” a senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“We all expect big things are in store for Pete on his next mission,” the official added.Sources told Reuters that Marocco, who was the director of foreign assistance at the state department, may have been pushed out but they declined to give further explanation.Musk’s Doge to fire all local workers and US diplomats from USAID, sources sayRead moreAs recently as Thursday, he held a “listening session” at the state department with nearly two dozen experts to discuss the future of foreign assistance and seek input, according to a source familiar with the event and an invitation to the session seen by Reuters.When he returned to the state department less than a month ago, he said in an internal email: “I am going to return to my post as the Director of Foreign Assistance to bring value back to the American people.”Trump has claimed without evidence thatUSAIDwas rife with fraud and run by “radical left lunatics”, while Musk falsely accused it of being a “criminal” organization.Trump’s administration on Tuesday moved to reinstate at least six recently canceled US foreign aid programs for emergency food assistance.The quick reversal of decisions made just days ago underscored the rapid-fire nature of Trump’s cuts to foreign aid. That has led to programs being cut, restored then cut again, disrupting international humanitarian operations.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUSAIDDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.”He went on to add: “A recession is two negative quarters of GDP and whether it goes slightly there. We always have those things. We have something that’s much more profound. We have a breaking down of the monetary order. We are going to change the monetary order because we cannot spend the amounts of money.”No retreat on tariffs, Trump promised. Hours later, he blinkedRead moreDalio’s comments come in response to a tumultuous week across the global stock markets following the US president’stariffspolicies thatincludea 145% tariff raise on China. The billionaire also said there are “profound changes in our domestic order … and world order”, comparing current times with the 1930s.“I’ve studied history and this repeats over and over again. So if you take tariffs, if you take debt, if you take the rising power challenging existing power, if you take those factors and look at the factors, those changes in the orders, the systems, are very, very disruptive. How that’s handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession. Or it could be handled well,” he said.Dalio, who correctly predicted the 2008 recession, also said the current economic state of the US is “at a juncture”.“Let’s take the budget. If the budget deficit can be reduced to 3% of GDP, it will be about 7% if things are not changed. If it could be reduced to about 3% of GDP, and these trade deficits and so on are managed in the right way, this could all be managed very well,” he said.He went on to urge congressional members to take what he calls the “3% pledge”, adding that if they don’t, there will be a supply and demand problem for debt with results that will be “worse than a normal recession.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Residents as far away as Georgetown – about 28 miles to the north – reported hearing the explosion.Austin fire department hasconfirmedthat six people – including two firefighter – were injured in the blast, which collapsed the house. Two of the injured were from the house, said Shannon Koesterer, spokesperson for Austin-Travis county EMS. One was in critical condition and the other in serious condition.Koesterer said a person in a nearby home was one of the injured and is listed in critical condition as well.Power was out for a time in the surrounding area but has been restored, said Thayer Smith, assistant chief of the Austin fire department.“We’re going to be here for hours,” Smith said on Sunday afternoon. “The main street will probably be opened, you know, probably within the next hour, but this street will be closed for the rest of the day.”Emergency officials were investigating the source but say they think the explosion that caused the house to collapse was caused by a gas explosion, possibly propane, KVUE news reported. The Texas Gas Service confirmed the house did not have natural gas service.Carol Hassell, who lives in the neighborhood, spoke with CBSAustin and said she heard a “loud boom” when the explosion happened.“I thought maybe a branch had fallen down on my roof,” Carol Hassell said. “I went out in the backyard, and the back door had been blown open, and I didn’t see anything on the house. I came out to the front, and then I realized all my windows had been blown out and the front door, and there’s extensive damage to some of the ceilings.”Hassell, who was preparing to list her home for sale later this month, said her garage doors were blown in, as well as the deadbolts on her locks.“I’m just glad I’m OK,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Christopher Paris identified the man in custody as Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg. Paris emphasized at a Sunday afternoon news conference that the investigation is continuing.Francis Chardo, the Dauphin county district attorney, said that forthcoming charges will include attempted murder, terrorism, attempted arson and aggravated assault.Authorities said the suspect hopped over a fence surrounding the property and forcibly entered the residence before setting it on fire.The fire broke out overnight on the first night of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which Shapiro and his family had celebrated at the governor’s official residence in the state capital of Harrisburg. State police said in a statement that, while the investigation was ongoing, they were “prepared to say at this time that this was an act of arson”.In a statement, Shapiro, viewed as a potential White House contender for the Democratic party in 2028, said he and his family woke up at about 2am to bangs on the door from the Pennsylvania state police after the fire broke out.The Harrisburg bureau of fire was called to the residence and, while they worked to put out the fire, police evacuated Shapiro and his family from the residence safely, the governor said.Authorities said the fire caused a “significant amount of damage” to a portion of the residence before the blaze was extinguished.“Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished,” Shapiro said in a statement.Shapiro and his family had been in a different part of the residence, police said.There was a police presence on Sunday as yellow tape cordoned off an alleyway, investigators observed the damage inside and an officer led a dog outside an iron security fence before investigators sawed off a section from the top of the security fence on the residence’s south side. They wrapped it in heavy black plastic and took it away in a vehicle.Shapiro splits his time between the mansion that has housed governors since it was built in the 1960s and a home in Abington, about 100 miles (160km) east. He posted a photograph on social media on Saturday of the family’s Passover Seder table at the residence.Republican Mark Schweiker, the former Pennsylvania governor, called the attack a “despicable act of cowardice” and said he hoped Pennsylvanians joined he and his wife in keeping the Shapiros in their prayers.Republican Tom Ridge, another former governor, said images of the damage to the residence where he lived for eight years with his family were “heartbreaking” and said the attack on the official residence was shocking.“Whoever is responsible for this attack – to both the Shapiro family and our Commonwealth – must be held to account,” Ridge said.State police said they were leading a multiagency investigation into the fire.Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS politicsUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

US retailers import about 80% of all smartphones, many of them fromChina, which Trump has slapped with tariffs totalling 145%.US Customs and Border Protection said items like laptops, hard drives, smartphones, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Vital machines made outside the US that are used to make semiconductors were also excluded.No retreat on tariffs, Trump promised. Hours later, he blinkedRead moreIt means these products will avoid the China tariff and the 10% baseline tariffs applied on other countries caught by the new regime.Speaking on Air Force One on Saturday evening, Trump said he would be more specific about the latest exemption rules on Monday. “We’ve been making a lot of money,” he said. “It’s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.”It is not clear how long the exemption will last or whether separate tariffs will be negotiated on the specific products.China has responded with a tariff on allUS exports of 125%.

We can’t be relying on China for fundamental things that we need.”Lutnick dismissed interpretations of Trump’s reprieve that argued it reflected the president’s realisation that his China tariffs were unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US in the near future.On Sunday Trump warned that no country would be getting “off the hook” on his punishing tariffs, again singling out China for criticism. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair Trade Balances,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!”Apple has spent decades building up a finely tuned supply chain in east Asia, including inside China.

Following the meeting, Whitmer was brought into the Oval Office where she – as the New York Timesdescribed– “stood glumly” during a press conference that saw Trump sign several executive orders thattargetedhis political opponents.In astatementto CNN, a spokesperson for Whitmer said the governor was caught off guard by the media appearance.“The governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office during president Trump’s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,” the Whitmer spokesperson said. “Her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”The Whitmer administration’s efforts to distance her from the press conference came after the president praised her,saying: “We’re honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, great state of Michigan, and she’s been, she’s really done an excellent job, very good person.”The comments marked a shift from his public comments made about the governor five years ago during the Covid-19 pandemic.At the time, Trumpsaidhe had a “big problem” with the “young, a woman governor” in Michigan, adding that “all she does is sit there and blame the federal government”.Whitmer, meanwhile, blamed Trump for a failed plot to kidnap her that was devised by rightwing extremists – a case that led to nine convictions.Speaking toreporters at a college event in Michigan after Wednesday’s press conference, Whitmer said: “It was not where I wanted to be or planned to be or would have liked to have been.“I disagree with a lot of stuff that was said and the actions that were taken. But I stayed in the room because I needed to make the case forMichigan, and that’s my job.”Whitmer nevertheless has been criticized, particularly online, including for blocking her face with binders at one point during the conference whilea picture was snapped.One userwroteon X: “She just stood there as he signed executive orders. Democrats, NO ONE IS COMING TO SAVE YOU.”Another person said: “One of my favorite things about things like this is that she would’ve been better off just having her photo taken. ‘(Normal) Gretchen Whitmer in the White House’ would’ve been a lot less embarrassing than ‘(Hiding) Gretchen Whitmer.’”Someone elsewrote: “Is [Whitmer] hiding from the press here? Or still hiding from the people of Michigan?”Whitmer’s state is one of the most crucial electoral battlegrounds in the US.With base Democratic voters increasingly criticizing members of their party for not taking a harder line against theTrump administration, Whitmer has said publicly that she does not regard herself as “the leader of the opposition”.In January, shetoldthe Associated Press: “I have shared with some of my colleagues from some of the very blue states that my situation here in Michigan is very different than theirs. I’ve got a Republican House of Representatives – majority-Republican House – now to work with.“I’ve got to make sure that I can deliver and work with folks of the federal government, and so I don’t view myself as the leader of the opposition like some might.”Echoing similar sentiments, Adrian Hemond, the chief executive of the political consulting firm Grassroots Midwest, recentlytold: “She’s been trying to work with Trump since he got back in office, which is appropriate.“She’s a swing-state governor.”Meanwhile, David Dulio, a political science professor at Michigan’s Oakland University, told the outlet: “It is more a reflection of the state of the Democratic party that a popular Midwestern governor can go to Washington, get some wins on bipartisan issues and get attacked for it by her own people.”Whitmer was first elected as Michigan’s governor in 2018 and then re-elected in 2022 by a wider margin than her first victory.Explore more on these topicsMichiganUS politicsTrump administrationDemocratsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Known as the “de-minimis” rule, packages under $800 do not qualify for any taxes or tariffs on the goods and are inspected minimally at the border.Conceived as a means to allow Americans to bring back low-cost goods to the US from abroad, fast fashion giants includingSheinand Temu have used the rule to send low-cost e-commerce purchases to the US with few expenses.$2,150 for an iPhone? Trump tariffs are ‘category 5 price storm’Read moreAlon Rotem, the chief strategy officer for ThredUp, an online thrift store, welcomed the executive order.“With the proliferation of fast fashion, this is something we’ve really supported because it creates an unfair competitive advantage,” he said.Ending the de-minimis rule has been a target of bipartisan legislators in recent years as the value of goods entering the US under the rule soared from about $5.5bn in 2018 to $66bn in 2023, according to a congressionalreport. Nearly two-thirds of packages under the rule were shipped from China and Hong Kong,saida US International Trade Commission briefing.ThredUp has pushed for legislation to end the de-minimis rule through the American Circular Textiles, a trade group it helped found that advocates for strengthening domestic supply chains. Other members include the RealReal, Reformation and H&M.“This change was coming,” said Derek Lossing, the founder of Cirrus Global Advisors, a global logistics firm. “Maybe it’ll catch consumers by surprise, but it’s ultimately not catching the brands significantly by surprise.”Some companies have already begun diversifying their production outside ofChina. Others have evolved their business model to begin stocking more inventory in the US as well as moving some production here and then fulfilling orders domestically, Lossing added.Trump first announced the rule change in February, but then recanted in order to give border agents time to figure out how to address an influx of so many packages that will require more extensive inspection.It is currently expected to take effect 2 May. After that, the packages will be subject to a tariff rate of 30% or $25 an item, rising to $50 an item on 1 June. When China responded with retaliatory tariffs this week, Trump hit back and then tripled the rates for previously exempt packages to 90% or $75 an item, rising to $150 on 1 June.“Everyone’s just pulling up their pants and bracing for impact,” said Jason Wong, who works in product logistics for Temu in Hong Kong. “We know it’s going to be a mess.”Wong said one plan is to make more of a push into Europe as well as Australia, which has its own de-minimis rule that goods under $1,000 can enter the country without taxes or tariffs.“We know for a fact that the demand from the US and North America will significantly decrease,” he said.Shein and Temu did not respond to requests for comment about any shifts to their business model in response to the forthcoming rule change.Rotem, the ThredUp executive, said the rule change creates an opening for consumers to consider other options, including buying secondhand clothes. While he acknowledged that shoppers care about sustainability, he said it’s a secondary decision of consumers to price.“All of a sudden, if ultra fast fashion is now 30% or so more expensive, it really does make the value proposition that much more compelling for resale,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Wednesday, Trump ordered a90-day freeze on tariffs, though kept a 10% flat rate tariff intact and then raised tariff rates for China.‘It’s going to be messy’: Americans on how Trump’s tariffs are shaping their spendingRead more“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” Trump wrote.On Friday, China responded by raising its tariff rate to 125% as well. An official said it would not raise the tariff rate any further than that.Wong, who works in Temu logistics, said that there have been so many changes to the policies, that partly the move will be to simply keep watching for now.“We don’t know how long this de-minimis thing is going to last,” he said, adding that backlash from consumers could lead to yet another policy shift.Goldberg echoed that sentiment, calling it “a dynamic situation”.“It may be different tomorrow,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationChinaUS foreign policyUS politicsAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Flint Assembly remains an economic cornerstone of a Rust belt region filled with working-class swing voters who helped propelDonald Trumpto his second term.The president did well here in part because he promised an industrial revival that will regenerate towns like Flint. On the campaign trail he promised tariffs would achieve this goal. This week thetariff warkicked into a higher gear. The reviews are mixed.US gunmakers scrambling to adapt to Trump’s uncertain tariff threatsRead moreAutoworkers, small business owners and residents here say tariffs could help Flint, but many aren’t comforted by what they characterized as Trump’s haphazard approach, higher prices on everyday goods and the prospect of middle-income folks becoming “collateral damage”.“Trump is playing poker, but he’s playing poker with people’s lives at this point,” said Chad Fabbro, financial secretary of United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 538 in Flint. Even the union is a house divided. The UAW president,Shawn Fain, supports tariffs, but Fabbro said many of the 5,000-strong rank and file at Flint Assembly see them as “bullshit”.Onshoring industry is a good idea, if well planned, Fabbro added, but an abrupt, full-scale tariff war is “not good for anyone because middle America is going to suffer”.Before Trump partly pulled back on Wednesday, his unprecedented trade warenactedat least 10% tariffs on nearly every country in the world last week, while hitting China, Taiwan and Vietnam with much higher rates. The war with China has escalated.There’s little disagreement about whether the tariffs would cause prices to increase for everyday goods like clothing, electronics and groceries – someestimateit could cost the average US household $3,800.In Flint, the debate seems to be: “Is the president’s political and economic gamble worth it?”The president’s supporters say “yes”, and have pushed variations of a message: any economic pain will be worth the benefits of a restructured world economy. Among them is Brian Pannebecker, a retired Ford employee who started Auto Workers for Trump.“It’s going to cause a little short-term pain, but we’re going to have to endure it for six months or a year, however long it takes,” he said last week. “The workers of this country have been enduring pain for decades as they closed plants down.”But among small business owners in downtown Flint, there’s some doubt about the idea of more pain in one of the nation’s poorest big cities – about 35% live in poverty.“The person who said that must be coming from a place of privilege because it is obvious that they’re going to be OK for the next year or so, but I think a lot of people are not in the same boat, so we have to be mindful of that,” Rebekah Hills, co-owner of Hills’ Cheese, said on Tuesday.Her shop imports about half of its product from countries such as the Netherlands, France and England – the cost of those products would go up 10% under Trump’s latest plan, or more if he changes his mind. “It really sucks because it’s small businesses that suffer the most,” Hills added.If businesses are not quick enough to adapt, then it’s going to be a death blowRestaurateur Tony VuFrustration with stubbornly elevated prices – especially among foods – was largely behind a relatively strong Trump showing in 2024 in Genesee county, where Flint is located. He had lost to Biden and Hillary Clinton here by about 10% in the two previous elections, but closed the gap to 4% last year. Just north, in Saginaw county, also part of Michigan’s auto industry heartland, the president edged out Kamala Harris.Democrats in Michigan, some of whom are fiercely critical of free trade agreements, are calibrating their messaging with these things in mind. Among those who support tariffs is US representative Debbie Dingell, whose district near Detroit is home to many rank-and-file autoworkers.“I think tariffs are a tool in the toolbox so that we are competing on a level playing field with China, who subsidizes production, owns the companies and doesn’t pay a decent wage,” Dingell recentlytold WDET. “But it can’t be done chaotically.”Trump’s approach was damaging the economy, she said, but she also noted that 90% of the nation’s pharmaceuticals are imported, and onshoring that kind of production was a good idea. But, Dingell added, “you can’t do it overnight”.On Wednesday, just after Trump pulled back on most tariffs, the conservative-leaning Michigan political analyst Bill Ballenger said he wasn’t surprised by the abrupt announcement. The tariff rollout wasn’t going well for Republicans in Michigan or nationally, he said. It was more “too much, too soon” from the administration.“The public understands the tariffs and they get his overall goal and mission, but the way he’s implementing them seems incoherent,” Ballenger said. However, what that may mean in 19 months when the next elections happen is anyone’s guess, he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWill Flint be OK?Alan Jackson, a retiree from an auto supplier, echoed the president’s line. “Why does China and everyone else get to take advantage of us? Why do they get to screw us? I’m glad someone is standing up to that.”Jackson dismissed the fears of higher prices and economic damage. “People will be fine – it’s worth it,” he added.But polls showed a major drop in Trump’s approval rating, and in downtown Flint people are worried.The Flint farmers’ market, in a repurposed newspaper printing press building, is a local economic hub where a half-million people annually shop for everything from locally grown produce to local jerky.But many here partly rely on imports. Tony Vu, a restaurateur and leader in the local food system, is about to reopen his Vietnamese restaurant, MaMang. The uncertainty is generating fear of supply chain shortages, Vu said: “It seems like deja vu, but with no end in sight.”The tariffs especially take a toll on south-east Asian, Latino and other chefs of color importing goods that can’t be produced here – avocados don’t grow in Flint, Vu noted, and Michigan’s growing season is only five months long. Imports are essential.A case of fish sauce, a staple of Vietnamese cuisine, went from about $82 to $100 just on the speculation that tariffs were increasing, highlighting another problem – some companies use disruptions to the economy as an excuse to raise prices, even if they don’t need to.“It’s going to take an industry that already operates on thin margins and is really hard, and it’s going to create more pressure,” Vu said. “If businesses are not quick enough to adapt, then it’s going to be a death blow.”At d’Vine Wines, with shelves full of bottles from France and Italy, manager Aaron Larson said on Tuesday he was not totally sure what to make of the tariffs yet, but he doesn’t trust Trump. Fabbro, of the UAW, pointed to massive increases in Canadian aluminum prices that were a threat to Michigan’s robust craft brewery industry. Meanwhile, his neighbors where he lives in rural Vassar, a few miles north of Flint, grow soybeans they sell to China.About 40% of US soybean exports go to China, which just hit them with an 84% tariff on all US goods (later raised to 125%). They’re scared, Fabbro said.‘That’s how capitalism works’Auto Workers for Trump’s Pannebecker said that corporations should “absorb” some increased costs, and added that the unions are trying to have it both ways – they want higher wages but they want cars to be affordable. Something might have to give, he said.“The market will settle itself out because that’s how capitalism works,” he said.The president’s supporters trust his judgment.“He’s a shrewd businessman, right? That’s why people vote for him, so I say let’s give it a chance, but if the cost of everything goes up then maybe he has to pull back at some point,” said Russ, an autoworker at the farmers’ market who would only give his first name.At the UAW local hall across from the Flint Assembly plant, Fabbro isn’t convinced, and fears layoffs. “It’ll only be a few years? OK, don’t feed your kids for a few years. Sell your boat and home and everything you’ve worked for because you’re willing to be a bargaining chip,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsMichiganAutomotive industryDonald TrumpTariffsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It had already become increasingly irrelevant asRussia found loopholes to sell its crudeat normal market rates, they added.The Guardian understands that the UK is now working alongside its international partners to find a way to use the price cap to safeguard Ukraine against the Russian war machine while pushing the Kremlin to engage in a peace process in good faith.The UK government was approached for comment.The cap effectively barred allG7and EU nations from buying Russian barrels above $60 – or providing shipping, insurance, brokering, trade finance and other support services for any deals done above this price.But Russia was able to use a series of loopholes including the use ofa shadow fleet of ageing oil tankersto carry cargoes at the usual market rates.The cap applied to about half of Russia’s seaborne oil cargoes when it was first introduced,according to analysisby the commodity data provider S&P Global Platts, but about 80% was sold beyond the reaches of the gap by the end of last year.“The cap is currently meaningless,” said Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. He told the Guardian that the G7 should consider “tightening the screws” on the Kremlin by lowering the price below $60.“There might be a willingness within the G7 to do this to punish Moscow, especially because there are no real fears about leaving the oil market under-supplied,” he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whatever anyone might say, it doesn’t really seem to be working.”Global oil market prices tumbled by almost a fifth in the days since the US president set out sweeping global trade tariffs amid fears that a trade war could trigger a global economic recession which would sap demand for energy.The international oil benchmark fell from almost $75 a barrel last week to under $60 on Wednesday. The price climbed to above $65 on Thursday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, aside from those levelled against China.Explore more on these topicsOilG7Trump tariffsInternational tradeTariffsCommoditiesRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Four words that belie what this remarkable Northern Irishman achieved on a spine-tingling afternoon at Augusta National. They ignore, too, the torturous process McIlroy endured to realise this lifetime goal.Did he win the 89th Masters the hard way? Too right he did. From a seemingly untouchable position, McIlroy was dragged back into a scrap he was so desperate to avoid. He emerged from it on the first extra hole, where the unlikely adversary ofJustin Rosewas nudged aside. Rory McIlroy, Masters champion.Rory McIlroy relieved to finally lift decade-long ‘burden’ with dramatic Masters winRead moreNo wonder the scenes were so moving as McIlroy battered down the Masters door. McIlroy reduced so many others to tears, let alone himself. Finally, they were of unbridled joy. It almost felt the heartache had been worth it. What a ride. What a gobsmacking, exhausting ride. From 5ft on the last hole of regulation play, McIlroy passed up a chance to claim the Masters. Soon, he would be hugging his lifetime friend and caddie Harry Diamond in a scene of euphoria. This was a success built on sheer guts. Rory, you are immortal now.“I started to wonder if it would ever be my time,” McIlroy admitted in the Butler Cabin. He was not the only one.McIlroy joins Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus as winners of golf’s career grand slam. He also has Tiger Woods, his childhood idol, for company in that special group. We have known about McIlroy’s genius since he flicked golf balls into a washing machine on national television in 1999. He had long since been holing putts outside the family home on the outskirts of Belfast with the dream of winning the Masters. Little did anybody know that his career would be so storied, so dramatic, such compulsive viewing.McIlroy did not exactly sprint into the pantheon of legends. Augusta National tugged upon every dark corner of his psyche, from a point where McIlroy looked like he would enjoy a procession. Rose and Ludvig Åberg had late hope. Rose’s rampaging 66 meant second at 11 under. McIlroy’s 73 tied that. Patrick Reed took third.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy putts the birdie to win the 2025 Masters.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesMore than a decade had passed since McIlroy won the last of his quartet of majors. Near misses had come and gone, none as painful as atlast year’s US Open. It felt appropriate that McIlroy had Bryson DeChambeau, the man who pipped him at Pinehurst, for company here. DeChambeau capsized. He spent Saturday evening watching James Bond movies and Sunday afternoon starring in one: Bogeys Galore.There were moments that implied the golfing gods were on McIlroy’s side. He played a dangerous, low second shot to the 11th which clung on for dear life at the top of a bank leading to a water hazard. Moments later, DeChambeau found the same pond. There were also examples of McIlroy’s jaw-dropping talent, such as the second shot to the 7th, which danced through trees. Those who criticise McIlroy’s propensity to live dangerously should remember the theatre when his audacity pays off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

DeChambeau licked his lips. A DeChambeau birdie to McIlroy’s par at the 2nd and the Californian was ahead.McIlroy jabbed back with a birdie at the 3rd as DeChambeau three-putted. DeChambeau did the same at the next with McIlroy’s birdie earning him a three-stroke lead. It remained that way until the 9th, where McIlroy collected another shot and DeChambeau wasted an opportunity. McIlroy smiled when reaching dry land at the 12th, his playing partner now six back. The danger lay elsewhere; Rose and Åberg.Yet with six holes to play the only person who could beat McIlroy was McIlroy himself. Case in point; the 13th, where McIlroy laid up before astonishingly chipping into Rae’s Creek. Cue McIlroy’s fourth – yes, fourth – double bogey of the week. Åberg made a four at the 15th for 10 under. Rose had birdied the same hole. McIlroy’s five-shot lead after 10 evaporated into a three-way tie as his par putt on the 14th somehow remained above ground. How would he recover from tossing this away?

A birdie ensued. Rose matched 11 under at the 16th. Although he later made a triple bogey at the last, Åberg’s race ended on the penultimate hole. Up ahead, Rose converted for a closing birdie – he had made a bogey on the 17th – to again tie McIlroy. A downhill birdie putt on the 16th gave McIlroy fresh hope but it missed to the right.One birdie from the last two was needed to avoid a playoff. There, Rose would not be lacking in incentive; he lost in extra holesto Sergio García in 2017. McIlroy delivered that three on the 17th but wobbled on the last after finding a greenside bunker from the fairway. Tension, wild tension. Back to the 18th tee they went.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy on his knees after making history.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPALost in this melee will be that McIlroy’s approach in the playoff hole was a thing of utter beauty. This time, it was a putt he could not possibly miss. Rose is due huge credit for his contribution to this major.When dust eventually settles, we will be left to ponder what on earth else McIlroy might fixate on for the remainder of his career.

The Warriors fell to No 7 and will host No 8 Memphis on Tuesday, with the winner earning the No 7 seed.Had Golden State won, the Clippers would have fallen to seventh. But James Harden prevented that with 39 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds to cap an All-Star season for the formerNBAMVP and give the Clippers an eighth straight win and a 50-32 record.“We’re a good team and we’re excited to show the world, but we’re a good team,” Harden said in a postgame interview with ESPN on the court.The West bracket wasn’t set until a final day that had numerous teams in the running for multiple positions after the top three of Oklahoma City, Houston and the Los Angeles Lakers was already determined.The Denver Nuggets regrouped after their chaotic final week thatincluded the firing of coach Michael Maloneand general manager Calvin Booth to secure the No 4 seed and home-court advantage in the first round against the Clippers by beating the Rockets 126-111. The Lakers, Nuggets and Clippers all finished 50-32, with Los Angeles having the tiebreaker to finish No 3 and start a series in Los Angeles for the first time since 2012.The Timberwolves — who could have slipped all the way to eighth in some scenarios – instead landed in the No 6 spot at 49-33 following their 116-105 victory over Utah. Anthony Edwards scored 43 points after stressing to his teammates the urgency to avoid having to play at least one more game.“Like, we don’t want to play in the play-in, because I’ve been in both situations,” the All-Star guard said. “We want to be fully prepared going into the playoffs. We want that whole week.”So did the Warriors, who have never won a game in the play-in tournament. They would have finished sixth to set up another marquee matchup between Stephen Curry and LeBron James in the postseason. They now have just two days to shake off the disappointment.“We’re right where we want to be,” forward Jimmy Butler said. “We’ve still got an opportunity and we control our own fate. We’re going to be just fine.”Sacramento are No 9 and Dallas No 10 in the West. They will play on Wednesday in Sacramento, with the winner having to beat the loser of the Golden State-Memphis game to face the top-seeded Thunder in the first round.There was no final-day drama in the East, where everything had already been decided.Cleveland are No. 1 and Boston No.2, and they will await the two teams to advance from the play-in. The No 3 New York Knicks will face the No 6 Detroit Pistons, and No 4 Indiana will meet No 5 Milwaukee.Orlando are No 7 and will host eighth-seeded Atlanta on Tuesday, with the winner advancing to face the Celtics. The loser will get another shot against the winner of the game between No 9 Chicago and No 10 Miami.Explore more on these topicsNBALos Angeles ClippersGolden State WarriorsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

One enlivened not least by the magnificent drive by ­Russell and a feisty comeback by ­Norris, for whom it was a rollercoaster that had begun before the lights had even gone out and was the least he needed to cling on to his title lead.Russell’s drive would have felt familiar to anyone who has kicked the tyres of a second-hand car and confidently driven off only to ­discover they have been sold a pup. In the final third he was clinging on to second and given soft tyres to make it to the end, which he said was an “audacious” decision by his team. This would have been task enough, only for the car to add to the jeopardy by slowly but surely withdrawing its labour.First he had a DRS problem and was then warned he might lose the dash display too, which duly did fail. “As long as the steering wheel doesn’t fall off,” he observed with no little nonchalance as the transponder on his car also gave up the ghost. Then he had a brake by wire failure, the pedal first going long then short, an ­alarming situation on the one component the drivers have to trust most. “No brakes, no steering wheel, what more do we need,” he said.F1 standingsThe car was clearly struggling and at one point the DRS opened to his shock when he pushed a button not associated with it. He closed it and backed off to allow for it having opened when not in range of Piastri, an offence for which he was investigated after the race but exonerated as he had gained no advantage.By the close, he had Norris clam­bering all over his gearbox as the Mercedes, beset with issues, creaked onwards toward the line. Russell held it together admirably and just held off the assault.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell holds off a challenge from Lando Norris.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesNorris in turn also delivered a fine run to be in that position. Poor qualification meant he started from sixth on the grid and when he lined up, he edged one wheel outside the limits of his grid box. It was an inarguable false start for which he was swiftly given a five-second penalty, after he had made a bravura start to climb up to third. Penalty taken, he found himself in a fierce to and fro with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who finished fourth, one place in front of his teammate Lewis Hamilton, which lasted for the second half of the race before the British driver finally made a decisive pass to take the place and hared off after Russell.All of which drama sat in stark contrast to Piastri, who was barely noticeable out front. His biggest headache was a malfunctioning drinks bottle and handling a safety car restart, which he handled thirstily but with aplomb and after which he was simply gone.For Norris, as an exercise in ­damage limitation, it was enough. But he knows that weekends like this are not those that make championships and that his lack of connection with the car at the moment sits in comparison with the ease his teammate is enjoying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is something of the Alain Prost about the smooth ease and precision with which he puts in these perfectly executed laps, the Aussie Professor.The result leaves the world championship finely poised. Norris now leads Piastri by just three points.Max Verstappen– who toiled round in a Red Bull car with which the world champion was once more very dissatisfied and finished only sixth – is third, five points further in arrears.Flawless at the front then, McLaren have the upper hand and without doubt a championship-winning car.

The report said Lacy had apparently taken his own life.“It is with profound sorrow that we confirm the tragic passing of Kyren Lacy. First and foremost, we ask that the public and the media give his family the space and time they need to grieve this unimaginable loss in peace,” Lacy’s attorney, Matthew Ory,told ESPN.Lacy, who led LSU in receiving touchdowns with nine last season, had declared for this month’s NFL draft. But his sports career had been overshadowed by his alleged involvement in a incident in December that killed a 78-year-old man inLouisiana. Lacy was allegedly driving recklessly – speeding and passing in a no-passing zone – when a motorist who was swerving to avoid Lacy’s Dodge Charger crashed head-on into another vehicle. Herman Hall, who was involved in the head-on crash, died after being taken to hospital. Authorities said Lacy fled the scene of the crash without calling for help. Lacy was charged with negligent homicide, felony hit-and-run and reckless operation of a vehicle. He was released on $151,000 bail.On Sunday, Ory told ESPN that he was “very confident the evidence, after being fully collected and reviewed, would lead to a declination of charges”. He added that “we will be demanding a full and transparent review of how this investigation was conducted and why.”In a Facebook post on Sunday, Lacy’s father, Kenny, encouraged parents to monitor their children’s mental health.“Our lives have changed forever and this will never be ok, but God needed my baby more than he was needed here,” Kenny Lacywrote. “This has to be the biggest pill our families have had to swallow but I know the love and compassion in our families will get us through.”Lacy played in 12 games for LSU last season and was second on the team in catches with 58 and yards receiving with 866. He declared for theNFLdraft just days after December’s incident, but slipped down many teams’ draft boards after the fatal crash, and did not play in LSU’s victory over Baylor in the Texas Bowl on 31 December.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

And it was an emotional day, because of the Hillsborough anniversary.“The main focus was to get three points, and get a little closer to all of our dreams. Everyone knows how much I love this club, and let’s see what next week will look like.”Slot played down talk on another important contract extension for Liverpool, however, and insisted the focus is entirely on the pitch.The Liverpool head coach said: “I think he means let’s see what next week brings when we play Leicester City because that, at this moment in time, is by far the biggest thing this club is looking at.“Two more wins and the first 32 games have shown us how difficult it is – not only for us but for every team – to win a game of football. The competition has never been as strong as it is this season and that’s what makes it so hard to win a game of football.“We still have to win two, so we should be completely focused on that. If in the meantime a contract extension happens [then fine] but my full focus is on Leicester and I’m sure Virgil’s is as well.”Slot admitted Van Dijk’s winner came as “a big relief”, with Liverpool indebted to Alisson for keeping West Ham at bay until Andy Robertson’s late own goal. “After West Ham scored and the way the second half went it felt to me that West Ham could score again,” the head coach said. “But our fans and players thought differently.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While about 20 seconds clear on a cobbled section, a bottle thrown from low down in a throng of spectators struck him in the face.“Who on earth comes to a bike race to do that? What are you playing at?” said Rob Hatch on TNT Sports. “Just scumbags,” added his colleague Adam Blythe. “I can’t believe someone is doing this. It’s just beyond belief. The good news is it didn’t affect him – but yeah, disgusting. Just do one. Don’t bother coming out.”Despite his light weight – a big disadvantage on the cobbles – and a scare on Van der Poel’s first offensive move, Pogacar dealt several blows until making a fatal mistake.Van der Poel’s brutal attack 87km from the finish left Pogacar gasping for air and prompted the Slovenian to request his team’s assistance for glucose gels. After recovering, Pogacar accelerated with 71km left as Denmark’s Mads Pedersen, another pre-race favourite, suffered an untimely puncture.View image in fullscreenTadej Pogacar gets back up after a fall during  Paris-Roubaix.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPAVan der Poel again attacked in the cobbled section of Mons-en-Pevele and his teammate Jasper Philipsen could not follow, leaving the Dutchman and Pogacar in a tight battle.It fizzled out, however, when Pogacar made his costly mistake on a sharp bend and after a change of bike for the Slovenian in the finale, there was no reason to panic for Van der Poel when he punctured a tyre.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He watched from the stands as Real were managed by his son and assistant coach, Davide Ancelotti.With the Spain coach, Luis de la Fuente, present, the defender Asencio thought he put Real in front after 19 minutes, nodding home from a corner.His goal was chalked off after a VAR review showed that Asencio supported himself on an Alavés defender when scoring, while Antonio Rüdiger knocked down the goalkeeper Jésus Owono seconds earlier.Camavinga gave Real the lead 15 minutes later, scoring inside the left post after a smart one-two with Federico Valverde. It was the midfielder’s first league goal since March 2022.However, things got tricky for the visitors in the 38th minute when Mbappé was shown a straight red for taking down Blanco as the referee overturned his initial decision of booking him with a yellow after consulting with the VAR.Alavés managed to swing possession in their favour after the restart, and the forward Carlos Martín put Thibaut Courtois to work with his low strike from outside the area during a threatening spell by the hosts.It was, however, 10 v 10 after the Alavés defender Sánchez also saw red for fouling Vinícius, and Owono denied Jude Bellingham late on from close range.“Kylian is certainly not a violent guy, he is a guy who has apologised and is aware of the mistake he has made,” Ancelotti said.“Surely it was a clear red card and he has paid the consequences. I think that the many small fouls that were committed against him have made him react in this way, which is the wrong way to react.

We have to win out now.”There will be an inquest at the end of the season, he added, though who will be in charge remains to be seen: the temporary manager was evasive about his future when he joined on an interim basis after Gareth Taylor’s sacking in March.“The injury crisis needs to be examined, 100%, every team needs to do a post‑season review,” he said. “To do that now is really difficult because you have to go really in depth and have everyone involved and we’re still preparing for games. So many injuries can’t just be bad luck, but it can’t all be down to poor practice.”It took six minutes for United’s aggressive press to reap rewards against the depleted City, Ella Toone’s ball over the top brought down by Celin Bizet who wrongfooted Gracie Prior before firing past Khiara Keating. Furious, Keating booted the ball in the direction of the centre circle, Kerstin Casparij playing Bizet onside probably out of her eyeline.City were already without Vivianne Miedema and Jill Roord, who were added to their heaving injury list during the international break, and lost another key player in the 17th minute, the Australia forward Mary Fowler clutching the knee of her heavily strapped right leg after it seemed to collapse inwards as she extended with her left. After some treatment off the pitch, it had appeared that Fowler might return. By the time Naomi Layzell came on to replace Fowler, City were two goals down, Gabby George’s corner met by Grace Clinton, who turned it in with her head after she escaped some lax marking from Kerolin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They need to build a squad capable of competing in four competitions and weathering injury storms, whether they manage to book a place in next year’s Champions League or not.Their struggle should act as a cautionary tale to the United board, who need to back Skinner in the summer as they probably head into the Champions League and have to attempt to maintain this consistency across four competitions.Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupManchester City WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Tindall said he had not spoken to his longstanding friend for a few days but had been communicating by text message.“Eddie and I have been working together for 17 years and I don’t think he’s ever missed more than a day or two in that time,” he said.“I had a text message from Eddie before the game that he put his trust in myself to do what I thought was right. I sent him a couple of messages today to say that he was hugely missed. He’s one of the best managers there is.“It’s at times like this when the manager’s not there that the players have to step up and they did. Our mentality was fantastic.” Tindall was unsure whether he would be in charge again when Crystal Palace visit Tyneside on Wednesday night.Bruno Guimarães, the Newcastle captain who scored the fourth goal in a win that lifts the side to fourth place in the Premier League and on course for Champions League qualification, dedicated the victory to his manager. “We won it forEddie Howe,” the Brazil midfielder said.It leftManchester United14th and needing to pick up the pieces before their vital Europa League quarter‑final second leg against Lyon on Thursday night.

Our position in the table is not where this club belongs. But we have a big game coming up and we have to clear our heads and go for it.”At times Fernandes cut an irritated figure. “I only get frustrated with my teammates because I know how good they can be,” he said. “And because I know how tough it is to play for this club.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweRuben AmorimManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Kelly’s long kick was headed on by Curtis and Igamane wriggled away from Alexander Jensen before drilling home a low finish from just inside the box.Just as Aberdeen – who had a Kevin Nisbet goal ruled out for handball – looked set to close out a vital three points in their quest for third place, Hagi silenced Pittodrie when he curled home with virtually the last kick of the game, seconds after fellow substitute Cyriel Dessers had struck the post.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipAberdeenRangersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Vertu Trophy final rolled out a not-yet-lost tradition, a Ferguson heist at Wembley, as Darren Ferguson, in his fourth spell atPeterborough, collected the lower league trophy for the third time as manager.If ambitions are set far higher at big-spending Birmingham, failure to collect the trophy to accompany promotion was a dark disappointment for their fans. League One’s champions were beaten by two superb Posh goals. The side with 47 fewer points, still not clear of relegation danger, became the first club to retain the trophy.“We deserved to win,” said Ferguson, who also won the trophy as a player. “We weren’t lucky today, we fully deserved to win. Given the opposition, it has to be the best one. You could argue they’re the best team League One has ever seen.”Peterborough have still never lost at Wembley. If Brady guided the New England Patriots to regular-season NFL London wins there, this was 90 minutes-plus of agony for his soccer club, pre-match fun long forgotten once kick-off arrived. Brady’s pre-match duties had involved serenading fans from an open-top bus and, alongside the majority owner, Tom Wagner, a TV meeting of alpha-male minds with Troy Deeney.“Suffering is part of life, part of football, we will grow from it,” the Birmingham manager, Chris Davies, said. “All today proves is what they’ve done in the league. It will hurt for a long time but it shows the consistency we have had.”Newcastle v Manchester United: Premier League – liveRead moreThe national stadium was dominated by second city citizens. Peterborough, despite the wide-boy charisma of their octogenarian director of football, Barry Fry, who went through agonies as full time approached, despite Ferguson being a son of football royalty, were very much in the minority. Blues could not repeat Fry’s lower-league double of 1995 when he managed them.As the game began amid an April shower for which only Brady, in a reassuringly expensive raincoat, seemed to have planned, Davies’s team went straight for the throat, their fans urging on a quick kill of opposition beaten 2-1 on Tuesday to confirm promotion.Jay Stansfield, the £15m man, fired wide as Birmingham sought an early breakthrough before Peterborough, despite being 16th in League One, threatened with their speed on the counter. Another fear factor: the dead-ball ability of Harley Mills. After 15 minutes, the one-time Aston Villa trainee’s left‑foot beauty clattered beyond Ryan Allsop to billow the net: Declan Rice, take note. “I fancied myself,” said a scorer who had spent the first half of this season at Enfield.When Abraham Odoh sped through seconds later, only for Ethan Laird’s last-ditch tackle to deny the Peterborough forward, the West Midlands contingent’s previous confidence appeared to shatter. A set of fans who have lived out all sorts of disappointment began to seethe.View image in fullscreenHector Kyprianou fires in Peterborough’s second goal.Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty ImagesBirmingham’s players were as tight with tension as their fans while Peterborough flushed with confidence. Their captain, Hector Kyprianou, completed a sweeping move, cracking home after Mills’s surge down the left and Kwame Poku’s flick. That piece of true Wembley wizardry plunged the majority of the stadium into deep depression. “They were high moments of quality that were missing from our game,” Davies said. “Two worldies.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

May was booked for dissent within six minutes. Whether attacking a wall of mounting anguish was a help or hindrance was a significant question. Ferguson’s team were comfortable in playing a low block and picking off their opponents’ growing raggedness. The closest anyone came to a third goal was when Posh’s Ricky Jade-Jones burst through before being tripped by Tomaki Iwata. No video assistant referee, no foul. Technology would surely have ruled in the attacker’s favour.With 10 minutes to play, Davies was booked for barracking Ben Speedie, the referee, from the sidelines, the occasion now getting to players and manager alike. More agony came as Stansfield poked in a rebound, before offside was correctly flagged. A lone, blue smoke bomb launched in celebration appeared symbolic of extinguished hopes, only for 11 minutes of time to further prolong agonies.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There, the outstanding Steer denied Lukas Jutkiewicz, the Birmingham seats beginning to empty. A lonesome, befuddled Davies stood shaking his head on the touchline. A last‑seconds melee after another Steer save proved the end, tempers fraying before disappointment – and relieved joy for Posh – took full hold. Ferguson said: “We have to celebrate these moments.

If it did not do so already, then it increasingly feels like win or bust in the Europa League for Ange Postecoglou. After this defeat, a sixth in seven away games in all competitions, it is plausible to think Spurs could finish as low as 17th in thePremier Leagueand the numbers suggest they should; only the bottom three have lost more matches in the division than them this season.Spurs did not recover from con­ceding after 85 seconds and a comical own goal by Djed Spence and a Jørgen Strand Larsen tap-in – after an error by their captain, Cristian Romero – were in keeping with a careless and dreadful display. Wolves’ fourth goal, courtesy of Matheus Cunha, was arguably the worst of the lot from a Spurs perspective, Lucas Bergvall punished for daydreaming close to halfway. It all surely made unedifying viewing for Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman watching in the stands.Postecoglou made six changes with the bigger picture in mind, Micky van de Ven and Destiny ­Udogie among those rested, but the manner of this defeat will surely dent confidence for the trip to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday. The body language as Spurs’ players traipsed off the pitch said as much.“They shouldn’t be in a bad headspace,” Postecoglou said. “We need to recover physically and mentally ... The game on Thursday is massive for us.”Spurs struggled to penetrate a Wolves defence tightened by Vítor Pereira and the reality is Mathys Tel’s strike to halve the deficit ­approaching the hour stemmed from a Nélson Semedo mistake, a lazy attempt at a clearance. Until Richarlison’s close‑range header with five­minutes of normal time to play, after Romero headed against the crossbar, their only other effort on target was a first‑half strike by Yves Bissouma.The positives for Spurs were ­limited largely to those not here, though Dejan Kulusevski has his first minutes since ­February, as a substitute. Wilson Odobert and Son Heung-min, who was missing because of a foot injury, are expected to be fit for Thursday. It remains to be seen whether a vulnerable side can cope with the pressure of such a significant game, for club and manager.Nobody in blue emerged with any real credit. Tottenham were overpowered in midfield, easy to curb in attack. ­Guglielmo Vicario was shaky in goal and he seemed to transmit nerves to the rest of his defence. Ben Davies struggled all game and was even­tually booked for taking out Marshall Munetsi. After Cunha pinched possession from Bergvall, Davies dived in to stop Cunha but the Brazilian nicked the ball past him and seconds later he was pointing towards his ear as the South Bank sang his name. Just like Postecoglou against Chelsea, his intention was obvious.View image in fullscreenWolves players swarm Rayan Aït-Nouri after the Algerian’s early goal, his fourth in the Premier League this season.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockSpurs were in trouble from the moment Pape Matar Sarr sent Jean‑Ricner Bellegarde tumbling with a soft but clumsy early foul. Vicario punched Bellegarde’s cross towards Rayan Aït-Nouri. His strike was not the cleanest but beat Vicario. A check by the video assistant referee cleared the offside Munetsi, to Vicario’s right, of ­affecting play. That goal seemed to unsettle Spurs and Vicario apologised a few ­minutes later after his sloppy pass led to Strand Larsen scrambling a shot wide.Wolves’ second goal was laughable from a Spurs point of view. Aït‑Nouri’s cross looped into the air off Brennan Johnson and into the box. Vicario saved the weakest of headers from Munetsi but the rebound bobbled in off Spence. Postecoglou cussed on the sidelines, shaking his head. Soon it was Romero looking to the skies after he failed to deal with a routine ball into the channel. The ­Argentina defender lost concentration and Aït‑Nouri seized the ball before­picking out Strand Larsen towards the back post for an easy ­finish. Postecoglou bemoaned a stream of individual errors. “It’s not like they’re doing it on purpose,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Wolves made it four top-flight wins in a row for the first time since 1972, the thoughts of Pereira, whom ­Postecoglou faced while the pair were working in Asia, turned to joining supporters at the pub. “Every time,” Pereira said, smiling, having been spotted at the local Wetherspoons and the Giffard Arms in recent weeks.“My life here is very simple: either I stay at home or I go to be with the supporters and get the energy from them to recharge me.”Even if Postecoglou triumphs in Europe, his bond with Tottenham supporters feels beyond repair.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They remain the only side to have lost at Portman Road in the league this season and their fallibility under pressure was again the theme when they failed to find a way past Kieran McKenna’s defiant but doomed team in the return fixture.Enzo Maresca later talked ruefully of Chelsea’s struggle to cope with “the environment” at Stamford Bridge being a key factor in this pulsating 2-2 draw. The disconnect with the crowd lingers. Supporters who question Maresca’s patient style of play are quick to turn in trying times. “You’re boring, Enzo,” came the cry from one dissenting voice at the back of the East Stand’s lower tier when Ipswich, surgical in the way they punished Chelsea’s early disarray, swept into a 2-0 lead after 31 minutes.Virgil van Dijk’s header sinks West Ham to edge Liverpool closer to titleRead moreBoth sides finished with regrets. Ipswich were courageous but could not see out a famous win and are 14 points off 17th place with six games left. Chelsea, meanwhile, left it too late to complete a turnaround that would have lifted them one point behind third-placed Nottingham Forest.A thrilling equaliser from Jadon Sancho, who stepped off the bench to bend in his first goal since December, was lost once the dust settled and the focus switched to Maresca’s side stumbling towards a draw that leaves their hopes of finishing in the top five in increasing peril.Victory felt imperative given that Chelsea have not won on their travels since December and still have to visit Fulham, Newcastle and Forest. It made the initial inertia baffling. It was startling to watch Chelsea lose composure after Julio Enciso put Ipswich ahead. The panic was underlined by how readily they lost faith with Maresca’s philosophy and acceded to the home crowd’s demands to be more direct, a development that ultimately proved key to the visitors’ second goal.“We conceded and they decided to play long ball,” Maresca said. “The second goal, we decide to play long because the environment is there – and we concede. You have to continue with the things that you are doing. We are stronger with our fans. It’s up to them to decide the way.”Chelsea were almost back to full strength after using their second string tobeat Legia Warsawin the Conference League. Maresca did not repeat his rotation from last weekend’s0-0 draw at Brentfordand there were encouraging signs at first. Nicolas Jackson hit the woodwork, Noni Madueke volleyed wide and Levi Colwill drew the first of several superb saves from Alex Palmer.Yet the atmosphere deteriorated after Ipswich dispensed with their unconvincing attempts to pass out from the back.

Feeling the heat, Robert Sánchez infuriated Maresca by hitting a goal-kick long moments after Jens Cajuste had gone close from 20 yards. Ipswich came straight back. Hirst, who bullied Adarabioyo, flicked the ball on, Jack Clarke released Enciso and the Paraguayan turned provider, crossing for Johnson to nod in his first goal for the club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marc, who had taken his fourth successive pole with a lap record as well as a fourth sprint victor on Saturday, won at the Lusail International Circuit for the first time since 2014.Red Bull KTM’s Maverick Viñales was second, pending an investigation for tyre-pressure infringements, while Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia came third ahead of VR46 Racing’s Franco Morbidelli, who briefly led the race early on. Victory moved Marc Márquez up to 123 points at the top of the rider’s standings, 17 points ahead of Gresini Racing’s Alex, while Bagnaia is third on 97 points.“I needed to manage the front tyres, so for that reason in the first part of the race I was quiet,” the victorious Ducati rider said. “Morbidelli was going [ahead] but I predicted or I understood yesterday with the rhythms that he will be not fast in the second part of the race.“Big surprise when Maverick overtook me. I thought it was [Pedro] Acosta because normally he is the fastest on KTM. He was super-fast, but I had that margin for the end. Victory in Qatar is amazing.”Marc Márquez had another perfect start off the line to take the lead into turn one but contact with his brother led to damage on the back of Marc’s bike and Morbidelli, who had started fourth on the grid, capitalised to surge into the lead.View image in fullscreenMarc Márquez leads Francesco Bagnaia and Maverick Viñales at the Lusail International Circuit in Qatar.Photograph: Noushad Thekkayil/EPAAlex Márquez did not fare any better and the Spaniard was involved in another collision, this time with VR46 Racing’s Fabio Di Giannantonio which led to both riders losing positions. Alex Márquez immediately put his hand up to apologise and the stewards gave him a long lap penalty that dropped him down to 12th, putting an end to any hopes of a podium having finished second in every sprint and race this season.Bagnaia and Marc Márquez then swapped positions while battling for second, using each other’s slipstream to overtake, while Maverick Viñales on the Red Bull KTM also moved up to third. But Marc Márquez was clearly struggling without one fin and another flapping loosely in the wind as Viñales out-braked the six-time champion at turn one to take second place.Viñales then set his sights on Morbidelli and the KTM rider took the lead on the main straight with 12 laps left while Marc Márquez and Bagnaia also found their way past the yellow VR46 bike.The defending champion, Jorge Martín, was competing in his first race of the season after returning from injuries but the Aprilia rider went down at the kerb on turn 11 and did not finish.Up front, Marc Márquez finally regained the lead for the first time since lap one when Viñales ran wide and allowed his compatriot to move up a place with seven laps left.That was all Marc Márquez needed in the business end of the race as he decided there was no more need to conserve his tyres, setting back-to-back fastest laps to open up a gap on Viñales before cruising to the chequered flag.Explore more on these topicsMotoGPMotorcyclingMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The British driver, soundlybeaten at he Bahrain Grand Prixby his teammate Oscar Piastri, said he is hurt by the frustration he feels.Norris finished third at the Sakhir circuit, behind Piastri who took the flag a full 15 seconds up the road from Mercedes’George Russellin second. After qualifying poorly in sixth, a performance he admitted left him “clueless”, an exasperated Norris felt he was no closer to getting to grips with the car after the race.F1 standings“I wish I knew the answer,” he said. “I don’t have an answer honestly, even for myself. I don’t know. You just know when you’re an athlete, when you’re a driver, you just know when things click, when you feel confident, when you feel comfortable. I’m just nowhere near the capability that I have, which hurts to say.”Norris has managed to hold his lead in the world championship by three points from Piastri but the Australian now has two wins to his teammate’s one and notably looks entirely at ease with the MCL39. He won with a dominant drive from pole to flag, demonstrating theMcLarenis very much the class of the field this season.Norris said he had no doubts about his ability but was at a loss as to why he could not make the most of what is a championship-winning car. “I’m confident I have everything I need, I have got what it takes,” he said.McLaren’s Oscar Piastri surges to dominant victory at Bahrain F1 GPRead more“I have no doubt about that, that I am good enough. But something’s just not clicking with me in the car. I’m not able to do any of the laps like I was doing last season. I knew every single corner, everything that was going to happen with the car, how it was going to happen. I felt on top of the car.“This year, I could not have felt more opposite so far. Even in Australia, where I won the race, never felt comfortable, never felt confident. The car was just mega and that’s helping me get out of a lot of problems at the minute.”Russell also elaborated on the host of issues which had beset his car in the final third of the race. “It was exceptionally difficult towards the end,” the Mercedes driver said.“I had all sorts of problems with the car. The steering wheel, I was losing all my data and the brake pedal went into a failure mode, so I had to do all these resets. One minute the brakes were working properly, the next they weren’t.

Multiple sources have confided during the Masters thatPGA TourEnterprises, a commercial body set up almost two years ago, is seriously considering an offer to take part ownership of the United States element of the Ryder Cup. That domain is controlled by the PGA of America, which also runs the US PGA Championship. Any such deal would cost PGA Tour Enterprises hundreds of millions of dollars.PGA Tour designs on the Ryder Cup are nothing new. Indeed, it has been a longtime frustration of the PGA Tour that the five key elements in the sport – the four majors plus the biennial joust between Europe and the US – are run by other organisations. PGA Tour Enterprises now offers an avenue to do something about that.Bernhard Langer keeps the faith right to the end of a classy Masters farewellRead moreThe Strategic Sports Group (SSG), a US-based conglomerate of investors, ploughed $1.5bn into the new venture months after a framework deal was announced between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund in the summer of 2023. The plan at that point was for PIF to match the investment; a notion that has beendelayed or perhaps rendered impossibleby the failure of various parties to agree terms. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of PIF, was spotted in the clubhouse at Augusta National on Friday, but the unification of golf looks no closer.The PGA Tour did not respond to requests for comment about potential Ryder Cup plans. A transaction is neither inevitable nor imminent. Any negotiation will be far from straightforward. The PGA of America has underlying responsibility for more than 30,000 professional players in the US. They recently appointed a new chief executive, Derek Sprague. His predecessor, Seth Waugh, was widely viewed as more aligned to the PGA Tour and corporate America. Sprague’s appointment suggested PGA professionals were looking to take back control of the organisation.There is precedent for this sort of deal. The Ryder Cup scene in Europe, formerly Great Britain and Ireland, was originally the responsibility of the Professional Golfers’ Association. As the Ryder Cup grew exponentially, theEuropean Toureffectively assumed control. That made sense partly on a practical level, with the Tour more experienced in handling elite players and their competitions.It is likely the PGA Tour will make precisely the same case, decades on. Next month’s US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow will inevitably include executives being questioned on the future of the Ryder Cup.View image in fullscreenThe European Tour – now DP World Tour – has effective control of the European Ryder Cup scene, unlike the current arrangement in the US.Photograph: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesThe purchase of real estate is among the other options that have been looked at in respect of using the $1.5bn from SSG. Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour’s commissioner, was pressed at last month’s Players Championship on how that money could be spent. “We haven’t invested any of that capital but we’ve stood up an investment committee,” he said.“We’re looking at opportunities and I would summarise those opportunities as investments we can make to enhance the PGA Tour for our fans, strengthen our tournaments. Then there are bigger opportunities that take time that we’re looking at.“But the Tour has never been in this position. We’re fortunate to be in this position. It’s not just the capital, it’s the intellectual strength that we have that’s representing our organisation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

LIV’s sceptics would have had their thoughts boosted by some of the names to miss this Masters cut; Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Sergio García, Cameron Smith and Phil Mickelson. Seven of an initial 12 LIV players survived for the closing 36 holes.Tyrrell Hatton’s prominence at Augusta National is pertinent with this year’s Ryder Cup in mind. Hatton’sdefection to LIVearly last year affected his chances of making the team. “The majors this year are the only opportunities that I have to earn points,” he said. “One thing that I’m proud of for the last three Ryder Cups that I’ve been a part of is that I’ve qualified automatically and I’ve made it a bit harder for myself now.“I would love to qualify without needing a pick. Hopefully, I can play really well in the majors this year. I’d love to be on that team again in Bethpage.”The Masters form of Justin Rose also matters in the Ryder Cup context, but for a different reason. Rose would push himself strongly towards a Bethpage berth with a good finish here. Should the 44-year-old not be in the team for Europe’s defence, the likelihood is he will take on a vice-captaincy role with eyes towards potential captaincy at Adare Manor in Ireland in 2027.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersThe ObserverEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For years, it has been pushing the extreme notion that wealthy, tax-averse people should up and start their own high-tech fiefdoms, whether new countries on artificial islands in international waters (“seasteading”) or pro-business “freedom cities” such asPróspera, a glorified gated community combined with a wild west med spa on a Honduran island.Yet despite backing from the heavy-hitter venture capitalists Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, their extreme libertarian dreams kept bogging down: it turns out most self-respecting rich people don’t actually want to live on floating oil rigs, even if it means lower taxes, and while Próspera might be nice for a holiday and some body “upgrades”, its extra-national status is currently beingchallenged in court.Now, all of a sudden, this once-fringe network of corporate secessionists finds itself knocking on open doors at the dead center of global power.The first sign that fortunes were shifting came in 2023, when a campaigningDonald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, promised to hold a contest that would lead to the creation of 10“freedom cities”on federal lands. The trial balloon barely registered at the time, lost in the daily deluge of outrageous claims. Since the new administration took office, however, would-be country starters have been on a lobbying blitz, determined to turn Trump’s pledge into reality.“The energy in DC is absolutely electric,” Trey Goff, the chief of staff of Próspera, recentlyenthusedafter a trip to Capitol Hill. Legislation paving the way for a bevy of corporate city-states should be complete by the end of the year, he claims.Inspired by the political philosopher Albert Hirschman, figures including Goff, Thiel and the investor and writer Balaji Srinivasan have been championing what they call “exit” – the principle that those with means have the right to walk away from the obligations of citizenship, especially taxes and burdensome regulation. Retooling and rebranding the old ambitions and privileges of empires, they dream of splintering governments and carving up the world into hyper-capitalist, democracy-free havens under the sole control of the supremely wealthy, protected by private mercenaries, serviced by AI robots and financed by cryptocurrencies.View image in fullscreenPeter Thiel in Tokyo in 2019.Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesOne might assume that it is contradictory for Trump, elected on a flag-waving “America first” platform, to lend credence to this vision of sovereign territories ruled over by billionaire god-kings. And much has been made of the colorful flame wars between the Maga mouth-piece Steve Bannon, a proud nationalist and populist, and the Trump-allied billionaires he hasattackedas “technofeudalists” who “don’t give a flying fuck about the human being” – let alone the nation state. And conflicts inside Trump’s awkward, jerry-rigged coalition certainly exist, most recently reaching aboiling pointover tariffs. Still, the underlying visions might not be as incompatible as they first appear.The startup country contingent is clearly foreseeing a future marked by shocks, scarcity and collapse. Their high-tech private domains are essentially fortressed escape pods, designed for the select few to take advantage of every possible luxury and opportunity for human optimization, giving them and their children an edge in an increasingly barbarous future. To put it bluntly, the most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world, an end they themselves are frenetically accelerating.That is not so far away from the more mass-market vision of fortressed nations that has gripped the hard right globally, from Italy to Israel, Australia to the United States: in a time of ceaseless peril, openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers. These bunkers are brutal in their determination to expel and imprison unwanted humans (even if that requires indefinite confinement in extra-national penal colonies from Manus Island to Guantánamo Bay) and equally ruthless in their willingness to violently claim the land and resources (water, energy, critical minerals) they deem necessary to weather the coming shocks.Though it builds on enduring rightwing tendencies ... we simply have not faced such a powerful apocalyptic strain in government beforeInterestingly, at a time when previously secular Silicon Valley elites aresuddenly findingJesus, it is noteworthy that both of these visions – the priority-pass corporate state and the mass-market bunker nation – share a great deal in common with the Christian fundamentalist interpretation of the biblical Rapture, when the faithful will supposedly be lifted up to a golden city in heaven, while the damned are left to endure an apocalyptic final battle down here on earth.If we are to meet our critical moment in history, we need to reckon with the reality that we are not up against adversaries we have seen before. We are up against end times fascism.Reflecting on his childhood under Mussolini, the novelist and philosopher Umberto Eco observed in a celebratedessaythat fascism typically has an “Armageddon complex” – a fixation on vanquishing enemies in a grand final battle. But European fascism of the 1930s and 1940s also had a horizon: a vision for a future golden age after the bloodbath that, for its in-group, would be peaceful, pastoral and purified. Not today.Alive to our era of genuine existential danger – from climate breakdown to nuclear war to sky-rocketing inequality and unregulated AI – but financially and ideologically committed to deepening those threats, contemporary far-right movements lack any credible vision for a hopeful future. The average voter is offered only remixes of a bygone past, alongside the sadistic pleasures of dominance over an ever-expanding assemblage of dehumanized others.And so we have the Trump administration’s dedication to releasing its steady stream of real andAI-generatedpropaganda designed solely for these pornographic purposes. Footage of shackled immigrants being loaded on to deportation flights, set to the sounds of clanking chains and locking cuffs, which the official White House X accountlabeled“ASMR”, a reference to audio designed to calm the nervous system.

But it also opens up powerful possibilities for resistance. To bet against the future on this scale – to bank on your bunker – is to betray, on the most basic level, our duties to one another, to the children we love, and to every other life form with whom we share a planetary home. This is a belief system that is genocidal at its core and treasonous to the wonder and beauty of this world. We are convinced that the more people understand the extent to which the right has succumbed to the Armageddon complex, the more they will be willing to fight back, realizing that absolutely everything is now on the line.Our opponents know full well that we are entering an age of emergency, but have responded by embracing lethal yet self-serving delusions. Having bought into various apartheid fantasies of bunkered safety, they are choosing to let the Earth burn. Our task is to build a wide and deep movement, as spiritual as it is political, strong enough to stop these unhinged traitors. A movement rooted in a steadfast commitment to one another, across our many differences and divides, and to this miraculous, singular planet.View image in fullscreenNot so long ago, it was primarily religious fundamentalists who greeted signs of apocalypse with gleeful excitement about the long-awaited Rapture. Trump has handed critical posts to people who subscribe to that fiery orthodoxy,includingseveral Christian Zionists who see Israel’s use of annihilatory violence to expand its territorial footprint not as illegal atrocities but as felicitous evidence that the Holy Land is getting closer to the conditions under which the Messiah will return, and the faithful will get their celestial kingdom.Mike Huckabee, Trump’s newly confirmed ambassador to Israel, hasstrong tiesto Christian Zionism, as doesPete Hegseth, his secretary of defense. Noem and Russell Vought, the Project 2025 architect who now leads the office of budget and management, arebothstaunchadvocates for Christian nationalism. Even Thiel, who is gay andnotoriousfor his party lifestyle, has been heardmusingabout the arrival of the antichrist of late (spoiler: he thinks it’s Greta Thunberg, more on that soon).But you don’t need to be a biblical literalist, or even religious, to be an end times fascist. Today, plenty of powerful secular people have embraced a vision of the future that follows a nearly identical script, one in which the world as we know it collapses under its weight and a chosen few survive and thrive in various kinds of arks, bunkers and gated “freedom cities”. In a 2019papertitled Left Behind: Future Fetishists, Prepping and the Abandonment of Earth, the communication scholars Sarah T Roberts and Mél Hogan described the longing for a secular Rapture: “In the accelerationist imaginary, the future is not about harm reduction, limits or restoration; rather it is a politics driving toward an endgame.”View image in fullscreenMike Huckabee touring Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem in 2008.Photograph: David Silverman/Getty ImagesElon Musk, who dramatically grew his fortune alongside Thiel at PayPal, embodies this implosive ethos. This is a person who looks up at the wonders of the night sky and apparently sees only opportunities to fill that inky unknown with his own space junk. Though he burnished his reputation warning about the dangers of the climate crisis and AI, he and his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) henchmen now spend their days escalating those same risks (and many others) by slashing not only environmental regulations but entire regulatory agencies, with the apparentend goalof replacing federal workers with chatbots.Who needs a functioning nation state when outer space – now reportedly Musk’s singular obsession – beckons? For Musk, Mars has become a secular ark, which he claims is key to the survival of human civilization, perhaps via uploaded consciousnesses to an artificial general intelligence. Kim Stanley Robinson, the author of the sci-fi Mars Trilogy that appears to have partially inspired Musk, is blunt about the dangers of the billionaire’s fantasies aboutcolonizing Mars. It is, hesays, “just a moral hazard that creates the illusion we can wreck Earth and still be okay. It’s totally not true.”Much like religious end-timers who long to escape the corporeal realm, Musk’s drive for humanity to become “multiplanetary” is made possible by his inability to appreciate the multispecies splendor of our only home. Evidently uninterested in the vast bounty that surrounds him, or in ensuring Earth can continue buzzing with diversity, he instead deploys his vast fortune to bring about a future that would see a handful of people and robots eke out survival on two barren orbs (a radically depleted Earth and a terraformed Mars). Indeed, in a strange twist on the Old Testament tale, Musk and his fellow tech billionaires, having arrogated god-like powers to themselves, aren’t content to just build the arks. They appear to be doing their best to cause the flood. Today’s rightwing leaders and their rich allies are not just taking advantage of catastrophes, shock-doctrine and disaster-capitalism style, but simultaneously provoking and planning for them.What of the Maga base, though? Not all are sufficiently faithful to earnestly believe in the Rapture, and most certainly don’t have the cash to buy a spot in a “freedom city” let alone on a rocket ship. Fear not. End times fascism offers the promise of many more affordable arks and bunkers, these ones well within reach for lower-level foot soldiers.Listen to Steve Bannon’s daily podcast – which bills itself as Maga’s premier media outlet – and you will be barraged with a singular message: the world is going to hell, the infidels are breaching the barricades, and a final battle is coming. Be prepared. The prepper message becomes particularly pronounced when Bannon switches to hawking his advertisers’ products. Buy Birch Gold, Bannontellshis audience, because the over-leveraged US economy is going to crash and you can’t trust the banks. Stock up on ready-to-eat meals fromMy Patriot Supply. Sharpen your target practice using a laser-guided at-home system. The last thing you would want to do is depend on the government during a disaster, he reminds listeners (left unsaid: especially now that the Doge boys are selling off the government for parts).End times fascism is a darkly festive fatalism – a final refuge for those who find it easier to celebrate destruction than imagine living without supremacyBannon doesn’t only urge his audience to make their own bunkers, of course. He also advances a vision of the United States as a bunker in its own right, one in which Ice agents stalk the streets, workplaces and campuses, disappearing those deemed enemies of US policy and interests. The bunkered nation lies at the heart of the Maga agenda, and of end times fascism. Inside its logic, the first job is to harden national borders and expunge all enemies, foreign and domestic. This ugly work is now well under way, with theTrump administration, enabled by the supreme court, having invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to Cecot, the now infamous mega-prison in El Salvador. The facility, which shaves prisoners heads and packs up to 100 people into a single cell, stacked with bare bunks, operates under the civil liberties-destroying “state of exception” first declared over three years ago by the country’s crypto-loving, Christian Zionist prime minister, Nayib Bukele.Bukele has offered to provide the same fee-for-service system for US citizens the administration would like to drop into a judicial black hole. “I love that,” Trumpsaidrecently, when asked about the proposal. No wonder: Cecot is the sick if logical corollary of the “freedom city” fantasy – a zone where everything is for sale and due process does not apply. We should expect much more of this sadism. In a chillingly candid statement, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons,toldthe 2025 Border Security Expo that he wanted to see a more “business”-oriented approach to these deportations, “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings”.If policing the boundaries of the bunkered nation is end times fascism’s job one, equally important is job two: for the US government to lay claim to whatever resources its protected citizens might need to get through the tough times ahead. Maybe it’s Panama’s canal. Or Greenland’s fast-melting shipping routes. Or Ukraine’s critical minerals. Or Canada’s fresh water. We should think of this less as old-school imperialism than super-sized prepping, at the level of the national state. Gone are the old colonial fig leaves of spreading democracy or God’s word – when Trump covetously scans the globe, he is stockpiling for civilizational collapse.This bunker mentality also helps explain JD Vance’s controversial forays into Catholic theology. The vice-president, who owes his political career in no small part to the largess of the premier prepper Thiel, explained to Fox News that, according to the medieval Christian concept ofordo amoris(translated both as “order of love” and “order of charity”), love is not owed to those outside the bunker: “You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” (Or not, as the Trump administration’s foreign policy would indicate.) In other words, we owe nothing to anyone outside our bunker.Though it builds on enduring rightwing tendencies – justifying hateful exclusions is hardly new under the ethno-nationalist sun – we simply have not faced such a powerful apocalyptic strain in government before. The “end of history” swagger of the post-cold war era is rapidly being supplanted by a conviction we are in the actual end of times. Doge may wrap itself in the banner of economic “efficiency”, and Musk’s underlings may evoke memories of the young, US-trained “Chicago Boys” who designed the economic shock therapy for Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorial regime, but this is not simplythe old marriage of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. It’s a new, money-worshiping millenarian mashup that says we need to smash the bureaucracy and replace humans with chatbots in order to cut “waste, fraud and abuse” – and, also, because the bureaucracy is where the Trump-resisting demons hide. This is where the tech bros merge with theTheoBros, a real group of hyper-patriarchal Christian supremacists with ties toHegsethand others in the Trump administration.View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon advances a vision of the United States as a bunker in its own right.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesAs fascism always does, today’s Armageddon complex crosses class lines, bonding billionaires to the Maga base. Thanks to decades of deepening economic stresses, alongside ceaseless and skillful messaging pitting workers against one another, a great many people understandablyfeel unable to protect themselves from the disintegration that surrounds them (no matter how many months of ready-to-eat meals they buy). But there are emotional compensations on offer: you can cheer the end of affirmative action and DEI, glorify mass deportation, enjoy the denial of gender-affirming care to trans people, villainize educators and health workers who think they know better than you, and applaud the demise of economic and environmental regulations as a way to own the libs. End times fascism is a darkly festive fatalism – a final refuge for those who find it easier to celebrate destruction than imagine living without supremacy.It’s also a self-reinforcing downward spiral: Trump’s furious attacks on every structure designed to protect the public from diseases, dangerous foods and disasters – even totellthe public when disasters are headed their way – strengthen the case for prepperism at both the high and low ends, all while creating myriad new opportunities for privatization and profiteering by the oligarchs powering this rapid-fire unmaking of the social and regulatory state.View image in fullscreenAt the dawn of Trump’s first term, the New Yorker investigated a phenomenon that itdescribedas “doomsday prep for the super-rich”. Back then, it was already clear that in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, the more serious high-end survivalists were hedging against climate disruption and social collapse by buying space in custom-built underground bunkers and building escape homes on high ground in places like Hawaii (where Mark Zuckerberg has downplayed his 5,000 sq ft underground pad as a “little shelter”) and New Zealand (where Thiel purchased nearly 500 acres but found his plan to build a luxury survivalist compound rejected by local authorities in 2022 for being an eyesore).This millenarianism is bound up with a suite of otherSilicon Valleyintellectual fads, all premised on an end-times-inflected belief that our planet is headed towards a cataclysm and it’s time to make some hard choices about which parts of humanity can be saved. Transhumanism is one such ideology, encompassing everything from minor human-machine “enhancements” to the quest to upload human intelligence into a still illusory artificial general intelligence. There is also effective altruism and longtermism, both of which skip over redistributive approaches to helping those in need in the here and now in favor of a cost-benefit approach to doing the most good in the long term.Though they can appear benign at first glance, these ideas are shot through with dangerous racial, ableist and gender biases about which parts of humanity are worth enhancing and saving – and which could be sacrificed for the supposed good of the whole. They also share a marked lack of interest in urgently addressing the underlying drivers of collapse – a responsible and rational goal that a growing cohort of figures now actively shun. Instead of effective altruism the Mar-a-Lago regular Andreessen and others have embraced “effective accelerationism”, or the “deliberate propulsion of technological development” without guardrails.Meanwhile, even darker philosophies are finding a wider audience, like the neoreactionary pro-monarchy rants of the coder Curtis Yarvin (another one of Thiel’s intellectual touchstones), or the “pro-natalism” movement’s obsession with dramatically increasing the number of “western” babies (a Musk fixation), as well as the exit guru Srinivasan’s vision of a “tech zionist” San Francisco where corporate loyalists and police join forces to politically cleanse the city of liberals to make way for their networked apartheid state.View image in fullscreenMarc Andreessen and Balaji Srinivasan speak during a panel discussion about bitcoin in San Francisco in 2014.Photograph: Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty ImagesAs the AI scholars Timnit Gebru and Émile P Torres havewritten, though the methods may be new, this “bundle” of ideological fads “are direct descendants of first-wave eugenics”, which also saw a small subset of humanity making decisions about which parts of the whole were worth continuing and which needed to be phased out, cleared out, or terminated. Until recently, few paid attention. Much like Próspera, where members can already experiment with human-machine mergers such as having their Tesla keysimplantedinto their hands, these intellectual fads seemed to be the marginal hobby horses of a few Bay Area dilettantes with money and caution to burn. No longer.Three recent material developments have accelerated end times fascism’s apocalyptic appeal. The first is the climate crisis. While some high-profile figures might still publicly deny or minimize the threat, global elites, whose ocean-front properties and datacenters are intensely vulnerable to rising temperatures and sea levels, are well-versed in the ramifying perils of an ever-heating world. The second is Covid-19: epidemiological models had long predicted the possibility of a pandemic devastating our globally networked world; the actual arrival of one was taken by many powerful people as a sign that we have officially arrived at what US military analystsforecastedas “the Age of Consequences”. No more predictions, it’s going down. The third factor is the rapid advancement and adoption of AI, a set of technologies that have long been associated with sci-fi terrors about machines turning on their makers with ruthless efficiency – fears expressed most forcefully by the same people who are developing these technologies. All of these existential crises are layered on top of escalating tensions between nuclear-armed powers.None of this should be written off as paranoia. Many of us feel the imminence of breakdown so acutely that we cope by entertaining ourselves with various versions of life in a post-apocalyptic bunker, streaming Apple’sSiloor Hulu’sParadise. As the UK analyst and editor Richard Seymour reminds us in his recent book, Disaster Nationalism: “The apocalypse is no mere fantasy. We are living in it, after all, from deadly viruses to soil erosion, from economic crisis to geopolitical chaos.”The forces we are up against have made peace with mass death. They are treasonous to this world and its human and non-human inhabitantsTrump 2.0’s economic project is a Frankenstein’s monster of the industries driving all of these threats – fossil fuels, weapons and resource-ravenous cryptocurrency and AI. Everyone involved in these sectors knows that there is no way to build the artificial mirror world that AI promises to construct without sacrificing this world – these technologies consume too much energy, too many critical minerals, and too much water for the two to coexist in any kind of equilibrium. This month, the former Google executive Eric Schmidt admitted as much,tellingCongress that AI’s “profound” energy needs are projected to triple in the next few years, with much of it coming from fossil fuels, because nuclear can’t come online fast enough. This planet-incinerating level of consumption is necessary, he explained, to enable an intelligence “higher” than humanity, a digital god rising from the ashes of our relinquished world.And they are worried – just not about the actual threats they are unleashing. What keeps the leaders of these entangled industries up at night is the prospect of a civilizational wake-up call – of serious, internationally coordinated government efforts to rein in their rogue sectors before it’s too late. From the perspective of their ever-expanding bottom lines, the apocalypse is not collapse; it’s regulation.The fact that their profits are predicated on planetary devastation helps explain why do-gooder discourse among the powerful is giving way to open expressions of disdain for the idea that we owe each other anything by right of our shared humanity. Silicon Valley is done with altruism, effective or otherwise. Meta’s Mark Zuckerbergpinesfor a culture that celebrates “aggression”. Alex Karp, Thiel’s business partner at the surveillance firm Palantir Technologies,rebukesthe “losing” “self-flagellation” of those who question American superiority and the benefits ofautonomous weapons systems(and, by association, the lucrative military contracts that have made Karp’s vast fortune). Musk informs Joe Rogan that empathy is “the fundamental weakness of western civilization” and hevents, afterfailingto purchase a supreme court election in Wisconsin: “It increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence.” Meaning we humans are nothing but grist for Grok, the AI service he owns. (He did tell us he was “dark Maga” – and he’s not the only one.)In arid and climate-stressed Spain, one of the groups calling for a moratorium on new datacenterscallsitself Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “your cloud is drying my river”. The name is fitting, and not just for Spain.An unspeakably dismal choice is being made before our eyes and without our consent: machines over humans, inanimate over animate, profits over all else. With stunning speed, the big tech megalomaniacs have quietly rolled back their net-zero pledges and lined up by Trump’s side, hellbent on sacrificing this world’s real and precious resources and creativity at the altar of a vampiric, virtual realm. This is the last great heist, and they are getting ready to ride out the storms they themselves are summoning – and they will try to defame and destroy anyone who gets in their way.Consider Vance’s recent European sojourn, where the vice-president harangued world leaders for “handwringing about safety” in relation to job-destroying AI while demanding Nazi and fascist speech go uncurtailed online. At one point he made a telling aside, expecting a laugh that never came: “If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg’s scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk.”View image in fullscreenJD Vance speaks at the Munich Security Conference in February.Photograph: dts News Agency Germany/REX/ShutterstockHis comment echoed those made by his equally humorless patron Thiel. In recent interviews focused on the theological underpinnings of his far-right politics, the Christian billionaire has repeatedly compared the indefatigable young climate activist to the antichrist – a figure he warns was prophesied to come bearing a misleading message of “peace and safety”. “If Greta gets everyone on the planet to ride a bicycle, maybe that’s a way to solve climate change, but it has sort of this quality of going from the frying pan into the fire,” Thiel intoned.Why Thunberg, why now? In part, it’s clearly the apocalyptic fear of regulation eating into their super-profits:accordingto Thiel, the science-based climate action Thunberg and others demand could only be enforced by a “totalitarian state”, which he claims is more dire a threat than climate breakdown (most distressingly, the taxes under such conditions would be“quite high”). There may also be something else about Thunberg that frightens them: her steadfast commitment to this planet and the many life forms who call it home – not to simulations of this world generated by AI, or to a hierarchy of those deserving of life and those who are not, nor to any of the various extra-planetary escape fantasies the end times fascists are selling.She is committed to staying, while the end times fascists have, at least in their imaginings, already left this realm, ensconced in their opulent shelters or transcended to the digital ether, or to Mars.Shortly after Trump’s re-election, one of us had the opportunity tointerviewAnohni, one of the few musicians who have attempted to make art that wraps its arms around the death drive that has gripped our world. Asked about what connects the willingness of powerful people to let the planet burn and the drive to deny bodily autonomy to women and to trans people like her, she responded by drawing on her Irish Catholic upbringing: it’s “a very long-held myth that we are enacting and embodying. This is the culmination of their Rapture. This is their escape from the voluptuous cycle of creation. This is their escape from Mother.”View image in fullscreenHow do we break this apocalyptic fever? First, we help each other face the depth of the depravity that has gripped the hard right in all of our countries. To move forward with focus, we must first understand this simple fact: we are up against an ideology that has given up not only on the premise and promise of liberal democracy but on the livability of our shared world – on its beauty, on its people, on our children, on other species. The forces we are up against have made peace with mass death. They are treasonous to this world and its human and non-human inhabitants.Second, we counter their apocalyptic narratives with a far better story about how to survive the hard times ahead without leaving anyone behind. A story capable of draining end times fascism of its gothic power and galvanizing a movement ready to put it all on the line for our collective survival. A story not of end times, but of better times; not of separation and supremacy, but of interdependence and belonging; not of escaping, but staying put and staying faithful to the troubled earthly reality in which we are enmeshed and bound.This basic sentiment, of course, is not new. It is central to Indigenous cosmologies, and it lies at the heart of animism. Go back far enough and every culture and faith has its own tradition of respecting the sanctity of here, and not searching for Zion in an elusive ever-distant promised land. In eastern Europe, before the fascist and Stalinist annihilations, the Jewish socialist Labor Bund organized around the yiddish concept ofDoikayt, or “hereness”. Molly Crabapple, who has written a forthcoming book about this neglected history,definesDoikaytas the right to “fight for freedom and safety in the places where they lived, in defiance of everyone who wanted them dead” – and rather than be forced to flee to safety in Palestine or the United States. Perhaps what is needed is a modern-day universalization of that concept: a commitment to the right to the “hereness” of this particular ailing planet, to these frail bodies, to the right to live in dignity wherever on the planet we are, even when the inevitable shocks forces us to move. “Hereness” can be portable, free of nationalism, rooted in solidarity, respectful of indigenous rights and unbounded by borders.View image in fullscreenAnti-Trump protesters march against the administration in New York in January.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianThat futurewould require its own apocalypse, its own world-ending and revelation, though of a very different sort. Because as the scholar of policing Robyn Maynard hasobserved: “In order to make earthly planetary survival possible, some versions of this worldneedto end.”We have reached a choice point, not about whether we are facing apocalypse but what form it will take. The activist sisters Adrienne Maree and Autumn Brown touched on this recently on their aptly named podcast, How to Survive the End of the World. In this moment, when end times fascism is waging war on every front, new alliances are essential. But instead of asking: “Do we all share the same worldview?” Adrienne urges us to ask: “Is your heart beating and do you plan to live? Then come this way and we will figure out the rest on the other side.”To have a hope of combating the end times fascists, with their ever-constricting and asphyxiating concentric circles of “ordered love”, we will need to build an unruly open-hearted movement of the Earth-loving faithful: faithful to this planet, its people, its creatures and to the possibility of a livable future for us all. Faithful to here. Or, to quote Anohni again, this time referring to the goddess in which she now places her faith: “Have you stopped to consider thatthismight have been her best idea?”Spot illustrations by Sophy Hollington"

Under Donald Trump, that scramble may be back. If news reports are right, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is offering the US abluntdeal: minerals for military help – a slice of sovereignty traded for a shot at stability.The concern is this isn’t a return, it’s a sequel. For three decades, Washington supportedJoseph-Désiré Mobutu, a cold war ally and brutal dictator who looted the Congo until his 1997 fall. That history of power politics still casts a long shadow. The Trump administration openly favours muscle over diplomacy. Fadhel Kaboub, an associate professor of economics at Denison University,notesthat Biden-era talk of partnering for clean energy has been shelved, with the US driven less by green goals than by copper and cobalt for missiles and microchips.The logic is bleak but clear. Since 1996, the Congo’s wars have drawn in foreign armies and proxies, leaving over 5.5 million dead. The DRC faces a worsening security crisis driven by armed groups likeM23, allegedly backed byRwanda and other regional powers. Western governmentslamentthe violence, but focus on securing access to minerals vital to theirindustries. Kinshasa, seeing appeals to multilateraljusticeachieve little, has turned to dealmaking. If dependency is inevitable, it might as well be leveraged.The DRC’s leadership is not naive. They know Mr Trump sees Africa not as a partner but as a warehouse of strategic materials, andUkraineas proof that he will turn weakness into American gain. They know China won’t send troops – citing non-interference – even as its firms dominate Congolese mining. WithRussiaand Gulf states offering assistance, Kinshasa pushes for US bases to guard “strategic resources” – like cobalt,70%of which comes from the DRC and is essential tosmartphonesand Nato’sdefence industry. Congo may want boots; Washington prefers business.The proposeddealwith the US seems desperate and strategic: security support in exchange for mining rights. Don’t call it protection money. After Mr Trump’s Africaenvoysignalled a deal was coming, the DRC repatriated three Americans tied to a failed coup, and a tin mine, which iscontrolledby US investors, began reopening as M23 rebels pulled back – a fragile win in a volatile landscape. Kinshasa hopes either to have Washington broker a peace that forces the rebels into retreat or to gain the firepower to crush them outright.It might also unlockIMF fundingand widen access to western capital markets. But at what cost? The likeliest outcome is that the DRC will receive just enough to remain dependent. Its mineral sector will be dominated byforeign firms, its fiscal autonomy eroded by conditional loans and its economylocked into the old patternof subservience – supplier of cheap inputs, consumer of expensive outputs.Calling this colonialism isn’t quite right. Empires ruled by decree, with no pretence of consent. Today’s coercion ismore subtle: a sovereign state cornered, at a weak moment, into accepting colonial-style terms without soldiers or flags. The tools are different –security deals, trade exemptions, private investment. But the logic is familiar. The irony is that this is being pursued voluntarily by a government with few alternatives.

As a certified public accountant, I don’t give investment advice. But I’m comfortable leaving my money in the stock market. Why? Let’s put things into perspective.MarketsarestillwayupMany younger millennials and gen Z-ers may be panicking about recent falls in the market. But we’ve been here before – and worse. In March 2009, theDow Jones Industrial Averagelost more than half its value from the levels it reached less than two years before. In the past 15 years it has increased sixfold.Today’s economic problems are not as severe as 2009. Corrections happen, and rumors move markets. Which is why the Dow Jones average is down about 15% from its high back in November. However, it’s still at the highest level it’s ever been from before late 2022.US small business owner says China tariffs endanger her company: ‘I could lose my home’Read moreDespite losses – and there will always be more losses – overall, people who invested in the markets over the past decade are still in very good shape.Theeconomyis OKLast month the economy added more than228,000 jobs, despite shedding hundreds of thousands of government workers. Meanwhile, other indices remain strong. True, manufacturingslipped into contractionlast month – but that’s not really news, considering that – other than a few blips – it has been in contraction for years. Service industries are in theirninth consecutive month ofexpansion. Unlike 2009, capital is available and our banking system is strong. Consumerscontinue tospend. Wages are outpacing inflation.It’stooearlytojudgeTrump’stariffmovesYes,Donald Trump’s trade war is disruptive. Maybe in the next few months – or a little longer – the smoke clears. We’ll see how this plays out. Maybe Trump’s decision to force the US economy to “take the medicine” so early in hisadministrationaims to time this upside towards the end of his term. I wouldn’t be surprised to see more market volatility based on rumors, guesses and people trying to get attention for themselves. But I wouldn’t expect them to tank like they did in 2008.Growthpoliciesunder wayThere are also some very pro-growth policies under way and more coming.Like it or not, regulatory oversight from the federal government has already been scaled back thanks to a bunch of executive orders and the dismantling of agencies. This will help business owners keep their eye on their businesses, rather than the federal government. More importantly, both theHouse and Senateare moving to debate and then finalize a number of tax decreases which will include extending or making permanent many of the tax benefits from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well potentially eliminating taxes on capital gains, overtime, social security and tips.All of this won’t happen, but some of it will and when it does consumers may have more in their pockets and businesses will enjoy a further long-term boost that should encourage more investment and growth.Acoolingofinflation?The bond market thinks that inflation will cool down. That’s because bond yields havesignificantly decreasedover the past few weeks. When inflation is expected to fall, so do yields. These traders think that – despite tariffs – there will be enough of a slowdown to dampen price increases and encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Will the slowdown cause a recession? Maybe. But lower interest rates mean a lower cost of borrowing. It also helps reduce the government’s spending towards paying down debt.Small business owners seem to feel fine in the chaotic Trump era. Why?Read moreOne big beneficiary of lower interest rates would be the residential real estate industry – which representsup to 18%of the US economy. Many homebuyers (and sellers) have been holding back due to higher interest rates. But now that bond yields are falling, so too are mortgage rates (which are also based on future inflation). In late 2023 the average mortgage rate wasabout 8%. Now it’sclose to 6.5%. We’re getting close to a tipping point that could ignite this market. As we head into the spring and summer I would expect to see more buyers and sellers come out of hiding.I’m sure plenty of economists, academics and pundits will argue with these takes. The bottom line: don’t sell your stocks. Hold firm. History shows that, unless you speculate or get lucky with an isolated home run, investing in the broad stock market via mutual and index funds generally outpaces all other investments. If you have excess cash, consider putting more into these funds. Of course, consult a competent wealth adviser and evaluate your specific risks. But relax. You’ll be fine.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessStock marketsTrump tariffsUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

That’s what fuels support for even incompetent regimesSun 13 Apr 2025 07.20 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 12.39 EDTShare“He’s really gone and done it this time. Now everyone can see what a disaster he is.” How many times have we heard this about Donald Trump? And how many times has it been proved wrong? Well, maybe this time he really has overstepped. After all, his clowning around with tariffs, sparking trade wars, then suddenly reversing his position, couldprovoke a global recession, perhaps even a depression. Surely his supporters will disown him? But I’m not banking on it, and this is why.Already, Trump has waged war on everything that builds prosperity and wellbeing: democracy,healthy ecosystems, education, healthcare, science, the arts. Yet, amid the wreckage, and despite some slippage, his approval ratingsstill hold between 43 and 48%: far higher than those of many other leaders. Why? I believe part of the answer lies in a fundamental aspect of our humanity: the urge to destroy that from which you feel excluded.This urge, I think, is crucial to understanding politics. Yet hardly anyone seems to recognise it. Hardly anyone, that is, except the far right, who see it all too well.Inmany parts of the world, and theUS in particular, inequality has risen sharply since the late 1970s. (The UKtracks this trend.) The world’s billionairesbecame $2tn richerlast year, while the number of people living below the global poverty line is more or less unchanged since 1990.There isstrong evidenceof a causal association betweengrowing inequality and the rise ofpopulist authoritarian movements. A paperin the Journal of European Public Policyfound that a one-unit rise in the Gini coefficient (a standard measure of inequality) increases support for demagogues by 1%.Why might this be? There are various, related explanations:feelings of marginalisation,status anxietyandsocial threat, insecurity triggeringan authoritarian reflexand aloss of trust in other social groups. At the root of some of these explanations, I feel, is something deeply embedded in the human psyche: if you can’t get even, get mean.In the US, a high proportion of the population is excluded from many of the benefits I’ve listed. Science might lead to medical breakthroughs, but not, perhaps, for people who can’t afford health insurance. A university education might open doors, but only if you’re prepared to carry tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. Art and theatre and music improve our lives: good for those who can buy the tickets. So do national parks, but only if you can afford to visit them.Democracy, we are told, allows people a voice in politics. But only, it seems, if they have a few million to give to a political party. As the political scientist Prof Martin Gilensnotes in his book Affluence and Influence: “Under most circumstances, the preferences of the vast majority of Americans appear to have essentially no impact on which policies the government does or doesn’t adopt.” GDP growth was strong under Joe Biden, but as the economics professorJason Furman points out: “From 2019 to 2023, inflation-adjusted household income fell, and the poverty rate rose.” GDP and social improvement are no longer connected.All those good things? Sorry, they’re not for you. If you feel an urge to tear it all down, to burn the whole stinking, hypocritical, exclusive system to the ground, Trump is your man. Or so he claims. In reality his entire performance is both a distraction from and an accelerant of spiralling inequality. He can hardly lose: the more he exacerbates inequality, the more he triggers an urge for revenge against his scapegoats: immigrants, trans people, scientists, teachers, China.But suchkiller clownscan’t pull this off by themselves. Their most effective recruiters are centrist parties paralysed in the face of economic power. In hock to rich funders, terrified of the billionaire media, for decades they have been unable even to name the problem, let alone address it. Hence the spectacular uselessness of the Democrats’response to Trump. As the US journalistHamilton Nolan remarks: “One party is out to kill, and the other is waiting for its leaders to die.”In the UK, Labour, like the Democrats, has long assured itself that it doesn’t matter how wide economic disparities are, as long as the poorest are raised up. Now it has abandoned even that caveat:we can cut benefits, so long as GDP grows. But it does matter. It matters very much. A vast array of evidence, brought together in 2009 inThe Spirit Levelby Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett andupdated in 2024, shows that inequality exerts a massive influence on social, economic, environmental and political outcomes, regardless of people’s absolute positions.If there is a such a thing as Starmerism, it collapses inthe face of a paperpublished by the political scientists Leonardo Baccini and Thomas Sattler last year, which finds that austerity increases support for the radical right in economically vulnerable regions. Austerity, they found, is the key variable: without it, less-educated people are no more likely to vote for rightwing demagogues than highly educated people are. In other words, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are busily handing their core constituencies to Nigel Farage.Of course, they deny they’re imposing austerity, using a technical definition thatmeans nothing to those on the sharp end. Austerity is what the poor experience, while they must watch the rich and upper middle classes, under a Labour government, enjoy ever greater abundance.Starmer and his minions suggest there’s nothing they can do: wealthy people are already taxed to the max. As private jets and helicopters cross the skies,anyone can see this is nonsense. Of all the remarkable things I stumbled across while researching this column, the following is perhaps the most jaw-dropping. Onthe most recent (2022) figures, once benefits have been paid, the Gini coefficient for gross income in the UK scarcely differs from the Gini coefficient for post-tax income. In other words, the gap between the rich and the poor is rougly the same after taxes are levied, suggesting that taxation has no further significant effect on income distribution. How could this possibly be true, when the rich pay higher rates of income tax? It’s because the poor surrender a much higher proportion of their income in sales taxes, such as VAT. So much for no further options. So much for Labour realism.The one thing that can stop the rise of the far right is the one thing mainstream parties are currently not prepared to deliver: greater equality. The rich should be taxed more, and the revenue used to improve the lives of the poor. However frantically centrist parties avoid the issue, there is no other way.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistThe Invisible Doctrine: The Secret History of Neoliberalism, by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, was published in paperback earlier this monthExplore more on these topicsInequalityOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

A preacher of voodoo economics, attacking the US’s allies and enemies alike. Condemnation ofDonald Trumpin the chaos since his “liberation day” has been swift.For most people the self-inflicted damage makes no sense, and rightly so.Far from making America great again, the president has made Washington an international pariah. There will be financial pain for ordinary Americans: from the wealth destruction in the markets, higher inflation, and a probable US recession. Living standards elsewhere will be damaged, too, amid expectations for the worst global slowdown since the 2008 financial crisis, excluding the Covid pandemic.However, it would be wrong to revel in the backlash for too long. Trump’s tariff madness is not a unique moment. The forces underpinning his political project – if the chaos can be dignified with such a label – have been long in the making, and will require more than a rout in the bond markets to suppress.As Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016, has warned: Trump is asymptom of a global sickness, not the cause. The events of the past week are only the tip of a much deeper crisis in globalised, free-market capitalism that has roots stretching back decades.In the long march of globalisation – advanced with the most zeal, ironically, from Washington – it is well documented that winners and losers have been created within rich countries. Yes, consumers broadly benefited from access to cheaply produced goods, supporting living standards. But it has not been entirely cost-free. That became patently clearer after the 2008 crash, and in the devastating years of austerity economics that followed.When announcing his tariff plan Trump pointed to data showing that, between 1997 and 2024, the US lost 5m manufacturing jobs in one of the largest drops in industrial employment in history. This ought not to excuse the president’s flawed and reckless policy: the US was not “looted” by other countries. The pillaging was directed, ironically, by US-based corporates, backed up by Washington Consensus economic policy. However, it at least helps to go some way to understanding the backlash.Employment rates for working-class men, in particular, have fallen sharply, whilewages have stagnated. Inequality research by the UK’s Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that US male hourly wages, after accounting for inflation, areworth less today than in 1975, despite the vast accumulation of wealth at the top of the pile.Across other western economies, including the UK, Germany and France, a similar hollowing-out has taken place; made worse by the weak, uneven economic growth of the past 15 years since the 2008 crash.In the grip of the Covid pandemic, the issues with lengthy, low-cost supply chains came further into sharp relief. That was then compounded, as the Société Générale strategist and infamous markets uber-bearAlbert Edwardssays, by multinationals using the inflation shock after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a smokescreen to engage in a round of greedflationaryprice-gouging.“To be sure, western corporates’ quest to maximise profits by outsourcing production to China and elsewhere has lifted millions in the emerging world out of poverty,” he wrote in a note to clients last week. “But it has impoverished much of US labour at the expense of capital. Profits have boomed at the expense of workers and now they are as mad as hell.“The financial community speaks with one angry voice when they see what they regard as self-inflicted damage from President Trump’s tariffs binge. But just as mainstream commentators failed to comprehend why people voted for Brexit, they are missing the point of tariffs.”Politically, the years of economic disappointment and the sense of being “left behind” for many voters have created fertile ground for snake-oil salesmen such as Trump to exploit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Joe Biden’s vast inflation reduction act stimulus package was starting to make headway in tackling some of the concerns. In Germany, fiscal orthodoxy is being sidelined to enable more spending on defence and infrastructure, while Keir Starmer’s Labour party is promising investment to fix the UK’s battered public realm.However, there is a danger of the promises still ringing hollow. Progress remains insufficient to encourage sceptical voters that politicians from the same parties who governed during the years of economic disappointment really know how to fix things.Some of their actions are also actively making matters worse, not least in Britain, where Labour’s benefit cuts and austerity-lite policies are undermining the idea that Starmer represents very much “change” at all from the Conservatives.To plot the way forward, Gordon Brown was right last week to call for an “economic coalition of the willing” among countries willing to stand up to Trump. As odd as it may sound, tackling the shortcomings of globalisation is best achieved through international collaboration. No country is an island, entire of itself.Globalisation cannot be entirely unpicked, nor would it be desirable to do so, especially at a time when countries around the world face collective challenges; from existential climate breakdown, to war and poverty.Any coalition of the willing must, however, face up to the problems with the old Washington Consensus. While it is clear Trump’s bullying and intimidation must be stopped, it should not involve rebuilding the pre-liberation day world exactly as it was.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyEconomics viewpointTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrade policyInternational tradeTariffsEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationhas largely dispensed with due process rights in deportingimmigrants, who are now being targeted for their protected speech, having their visas or green cards summarily cancelled without process and sometimes without notice, and getting kidnapped off the streets and hustled into vans so that they can be shipped to “detention centers” too far away for their loved ones, or their lawyers, to visit them.Some immigrants are being targeted for disappearance because they oppose Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, an opinion that it is now physically dangerous, instead of merely unpopular, to hold. But others the government seems to be seizing almost at random.More than 200 Venezuelan nationalshave been seized and deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador, rendered outside of US jurisdiction indefiance of judges’ ordersdemanding that their deportation flights be stopped. Of those Venezuelans, most hadno criminal record. Other deportees, like the Maryland father and sheet metal workerKilmar Abrego García, seem to have beendeported by mistake; the Trump administration says that Abrego García, who they admit theydid not mean to deport,will not be brought backto his family in the United States. Conveniently, the fact that they have deported him to a foreign prison is supposed, in the Trump administration’s logic, to absolve them of responsibility for putting him there. “We suggest the judge contact [Salvadoran] President Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador,”the White House said, obnoxiously, after ajudge ordered themto bring Abrego García back.What’s the true cost of Donald Trump? All the crises around the world that we’ve no time to fix | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreMeanwhile, the sadism of the deportations, and thecruelty of the Salvadoran prisonwhere the men are being kept, seem to hold a kind of aesthetic appeal for the Trump camp. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, recently flew to the El Salvador prison fora photoshootwith the captives there, where she stood in front of a crowd of men packed into a cell behind bars with her hair coiffed in long beachy waves.Now, the Trump administration may be seeking to extend the lawlessness and cruelty of its deportation regime to the next logical target: American citizens. The White House spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt,confirmedon Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering pathways to deport citizens as well. “The president has discussed this idea quite a few times publicly. He’s also discussed it privately. You’re referring to the president’s idea for American citizens to potentially be deported,” she said. “The president has said, if it’s legal, if there is a legal pathway to do that, he’s not sure.”This would be illegal. But so is so much of what the Trump administration is doing with its deportation policies. It is illegal to cancel visas and green cards without due process, as the Trump administration has done and continues to do as part of a widening dragnet in its anti-immigrant purges. It is illegal to target immigrants for their speech, as the Trump administration has done to pro-Palestinian and anti-genocide activists, from Rümeysa Öztürk toMahmoud Khalil. It is illegal to deport people to a foreign prison where they have no recourse to enforce their rights and no path to pursue their freedom – it is illegal to do this, as the Trump administration has done, specifically to prevent its victims from seeking to enforce their own rights in American courts. And it is illegal to ignore the binding orders of federal judges to stop all of this conduct in order to ensure that the deportations can continue, punishing innocent people, silencing protected speech, and scaring whole populations out of work, travel, political participation or any of the other daily dignities that they are supposed to be entitled to in this country.But the law, increasingly, is whatever theTrump administrationdecides it is. And there is no force that seems prepared to make them obey the law when their will does not incline them to do so.Trump was ‘the candidate of peace’. Now he’s fanning the flames of war | Mohamad BazziRead moreThat is because the supreme court has been no help, and if anything has acted, so far, as all but an accomplice to Trump’s dismantling of the rule of law in his pursuit of anti-immigrant vengeance. Lower court judges have attempted to intervene on behalf of the disappeared immigrants, issuing orders commanding the Trump administration to stop deportations under a long-dormant 1798 wartime measure known as theAlien Enemies Act, and to return Abrego García to the US immediately. Butthe supreme courthas stepped in to pause these orders, allowing the Trump administration’s deportation agenda to continue. In the Abrego García case, the court weakened adistrict court order to “effectuate”the innocent man’s freedom and return to a mere command that they “facilitate” it, and only in ways that don’t interfere with the executive branch’s foreign policy prerogatives – in practice, a weakening of the demand to bring Abrego García back home to a request that the Trump administration provide more plausible deniability when they refuse to do so. And while Brett Kavanaughweighed in with a concurrenceto make a pious declaration of the need for due process in deportation proceedings, the court’s actions speak louder than its words: they are allowing the kidnapping and deportation of US residents to continue without due process.The legal precedents being established in these immigration disappearance cases have no limiting principles: if visa holders, asylum seekers and legal permanent residents can be snatched and deported with effectively no practicable recourse to due process protections, then there is no reason why citizens can’t be. It is in the interest of every American citizen to take an active stand in defense of our immigrant neighbors. Because once the Trump administration decides that they have no rights, then neither do we.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionTrump administrationEl SalvadorAmericasUS domestic policyUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

You had to go to the cinema to see films in those days, when small boys ran barefoot on a conveyor belt to turn the reels, and it’s possible I watched its depiction of a family torn apart by violence, resentment, alcoholism and sexual abuse in horror while crunching popcorn, eating hotdogs and drinking a big bucket of Fanta ™ ®. No wonder I was sick on the old Danish woman next to me. Luckily, in Denmark, being vomited on by a stranger is considered good luck, and we began a torrid affair.But I watchedFestenagain in my 50s and found it hilarious, laughing out loud at its grim affirmation of bleak inevitability. But the film hadn’t changed. So what had the world done to me in the intervening years to make my sense of humour so black? Or had all that bacon and pastry I ate in the 00s somehow made me more sensitive to the Danish sensibility? Similarly, once I drank only Yorkshire Tea for a week and briefly became both resentful and ingenious.On Monday night, I made my once-a-decade attempt to enjoy Sam Peckinpah’s flawed 1973 revisionist westernPat Garrettand Billythe Kid, in which all the women are semi-naked prostitutes or ex-prostitutes in clothes, and yet it’s the morals of all the respectable and fully clothed men that are really up for sale. Get it? Screenwriter Rudolph Wurlitzer is asking, who are the real prostitutes?Meanwhile,Bob Dylanwanders about as a character called Alias, who doesn’t seem to know where he is, who he is, or what he ought to do. The teenage me found this frustrating, but to this 57-year-old man Alias’s blank-faced acceptance of fate seems like a rational response to 2025. Is it possible to get post-traumatic stress disorder by looking at a succession of internet memes of penguins complaining about tariffs?Indeed, this time around Peckinpah’s mangled masterpiece made the most sense to date. Billy the Kid represents American freedoms under attack from big business, namely the cattle barons to whom people’s rights and lands are dispensable. And the lawman Pat Garrett has to decide whether to do the right thing, or bend the knee to tyranny to survive, like Keir Starmer, and to get rich, like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Snoop Doggy Dogg.(Now there are no ideals or ethics in American politics, if there ever were, and everything is nakedly transactional, where once geopolitical powerplays were disguised as altruism. Here. Have these Jackson Pollock paintings. They will invalidate socialist realism. Here. Have these blankets. They contain smallpox spores and it’s cold on the reservation. Sleep well.)When I wrote my current standup show last autumn it seemed pessimistic. Now it seems prescientAnd if, like Billy the Kid, you stand up to avaricious authoritarians, you end up dead on the porch in just some brown trousers while Rita Coolidge weeps, or detained at customs like a French intellectual. Peckinpah’s once reviled film is now almost too on the nose for 2025! ButThe Handmaid’s Taleseemed like science fiction back in the 80s, when you had to read it if you wanted to get a date with an attractive feminist.But given that Donald Trump’s domestic and foreign policies seem based on the same narcissistic notions of manifest destiny that forged the old west, maybe it isn’t surprising thatPat Garrettand Billythe Kidsuddenly speaks volumes. There’s a new sheriff in town and he’s working for the modern-day cattle barons, who are farming engagement on vast digital plains with great globs of porn and racism, and pushing out the people who went west to post pictures of cats and sad things about Palestine.Pat Garrettand Billythe Kidat least has the edge musically on the Trump administration because it gave us Dylan’s three-chord classic Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door, as opposed to a degraded version of YMCA, sung by an inauthentic manifestation of the Village People, still dressed as gay-friendly archetypes of the American collective subconscious, but stomping on a human ear – for ever!The central conceit of my current tour show,Stewart Lee vsthe Man-Wulf, is that the bullies are taking over politics and comedy and we’re somehow seduced by their cruelty. World events currently approach the show head-on at such velocity that the jokes in it buffet around like ball-bearings in a pinball machine and bash into different news stories daily, while I flap the flippers like a blind idiot Brexiter.Some throwaway yuks inlast week’s column, and last week’s live show, about Russell Brand, another of the comic flatulists currently flourishing in the court of King Donald, underwent hasty last-minute rewrites as allegationscoalesced into criminal charges, inconveniencing me enormously.Playwrights write their plays only once and then walk away from the scenes of their crimes, even as their storylines are overtaken by world events. I, however, am required to retool my work nightly, while losers like William Shakespeare, Samuel Beckett or Alan Ayckbourn benefit from the notion that their hastily tossed-off and then simply abandoned works are somehow “timeless”, when in fact they are just the products of lazy and careless minds.When I wrote the current standup show last autumn it seemed pessimistic. Now it seems prescient. By the time it closes next year I am worried it will seem nostalgic. Will the newly enslaved Indigenous people of Greenland look back fondly on the2025 tariffsand theSignal scandalas they mine mobile phone parts from rapidly thawing permafrost, while YMCA booms endlessly out of a subterranean speaker system?

How long will the world tolerate this?Arwa MahdawiWhat is happening is, quite simply, annihilation. Yet our politicians keep funding it and media outlets normalize itSun 13 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 05.01 EDTShareWhere do I even start? In recent weeks I’ve sat down to try and write aboutGazaand, every time I steel myself to write about one atrocity, another atrocity is committed. Palestinian journalists have beenburned alive, babies havefrozento death, medics have beenexecutedand buried in mass graves, kids are being killed in their sleep. Meanwhile, in the US andGermany, speaking out about dead Palestinian babies can land you on adeportation list. Arguing that international human rights law should be respected can put you at risk of beingsnatched off the streetand stuck in a detention centre.I don’t know where to start and I don’t know what is really left to say at this point. After 18 months of endless carnage, it should be clear to everyone that this is not a war. That this is not self-defence. What is happening in Gaza is, quite simply, annihilation. A litany of genocideexpertshave stated this. Respected international organizations likeAmnesty Internationalhave concluded that Israel is committing genocide – and yet our politicians are still funding this.Palestinians aren’t just being exterminated with US-supplied bombs. The more insidious killer now is disease and starvation. On 2 March – more than a month ago – Israel cut off supplies to Gaza in an attempt to change the terms of the ceasefire agreement. Calling this an “aid blockade”, as headlinestend to do, doesn’t do justice to the horror of what is happening: this is not an “aid blockade” so much as it is a starvation campaign.Gaza, after all, has been reduced to rubble; it’s not like there is food growing in the strip that people can rely on. An analysis of satellite imagery by the UN in November found that more than 90% of cattle had died and about 70% of land for crops in Gaza has been destroyed or damaged since the beginning of thisiteration of the war in the territory.Water is also being used as a weapon of war. In early March, a week after stopping any food or other humanitarian supplies from getting into Gaza, Israelcut off the electricity supplyto Gaza’s main operational desalination plant. The situation now could not be more desperate. “Gaza is a killing field, and civilians are in an endless death loop,” the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said onTuesday.This is not an ‘aid blockade’ so much as it is a starvation campaignEmboldened byDonald Trumpand his visions of building hotels and casinos on top of these killing fields, Israel is not even trying to hide its aims any more. It wants to rid Gaza of Palestinians andannex the West Bank. And it will starve, kill and terrorize Palestinians until they “voluntarily” agree to leave en masseto somewhere like Sudan or Somalia– those being a couple of the countries the US and Israel have recently floated as potential relocation areas.“We will see to the general security in the Gaza Strip and will allow the realization of the Trump plan for voluntary migration,” Benjamin Netanyahurecently said. “This is the plan. We are not hiding this and are ready to discuss it at any time.”The deputy parliament speaker Nissim Vaturi, meanwhile, recently went on Kol BaRama radio, to call for the Gazafication of the West Bank. “We need to separate the children and women and kill the adults in Gaza. We are being too considerate,”Vaturi said. “We will soon turn Jenin [in the West Bank] into Gaza,” he added.If this is the first time you’ve seen this statement, by the way, it’s because it wasn’t covered by the same mainstream western outlets that have devoted thousands of words to asking if a college student saying “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is a call for genocide. Although, to be fair, if the western media did cover every publicincitement to genocidemade by Israeli politicians and thought leaders, then there would be no space to cover anything else.View image in fullscreen‘I’m writing this not because I hope to change any minds, but because the only power I have – the only power that many of us have – is to continually raise our voices and say that we do not consent to this.’Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesRather than calling out these incitements, certain elements of the media seem keen to normalize the people making them. Last month, for example, Yoav Gallant, Israel’s former defense minister, joined the ADL for a fireside chat in New York withCNN’s Bianna Golodryga. The international criminal court, let me remind you, hasissued an arrest warrantfor Gallant for war crimes. The court found “reasonable grounds” to believe Gallant and Netanyahu “bear criminal responsibility for the following crimes as co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”. CNN, I should note, has done some excellentreportingon Gaza. But for the network to sit down for a cozy “fireside chat” with Gallant – while Palestinian journalists are being burned alive, no less – is appalling.One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This by Omar El Akkad review – a cathartic savaging of western hypocrisy over GazaRead moreNormally, when I write an opinion piece, it feels like I’m having a little tete-a-tete with the reader. But I don’t really know who I’m writing this piece for. If you’ve read up to here then there’s a good chance you already agree with me, that you’re already appalled by what’s happening and that you’re using your own voice as best you can. And if you are not devastated at this point, then there is simply no convincing you to care.I have written a lot of op-eds where I’m essentially just begging people – including some of my colleagues in the western media – to give a damn about Palestinian suffering. To remember that Palestinians are humans too. To remember that starving civilians is a war crime, one which should not be sanitized with the passive voice and obfuscating language. To understand that this isn’t some distant foreign policy issue: this genocide is US-taxpayer funded. Meanwhile,unprecedented attemptsto suppress free speech in the US on Palestine have turned this into a domestic issue.I’m done begging people to care about Palestinians now. I’m writing this not because I hope to change any minds, but because the only power I have – the only power that many of us have – is to continually raise our voices and say that we do not consent to this.“One day, when it’s safe, when there’s no personal downside to calling a thing what it is, when it’s too late to hold anyone accountable, everyone will have always been against this,” thejournalist Omar El Akkadwrote.

The question quivers on the world’s lips, but Sir Keir Starmer thinks it a fool’s errand trying to guess the answer. The prime minister has told colleagues not to waste any time on feverish speculation about the intentions of the US president.This is sensible counsel after 10 days in which Typhoon Orange has wreaked havoc in global markets. His tariffs were so sweeping and so breathtakingly dumb that the hit list included acluster of barren islandsnear Antarctica. Was his notoriously thin skin once pricked by an insolent penguin? Were the highest US tariffs in more than a century an ego-gratifying instrument to get other leaders to beg for mercy by “kissing my ass”? Are tariffs designed to be a revenue-raiser cunningly disguised as an economy-wrecker? If the aim, as some claim, is to reindustralise America, creating the conditions for an inflationary slump is a strange way to go about it.Members of the Trump regime have offered no consistent explanation for such wantonly ruinous and self-destructive acts. After days of insisting that there would be no retreat from any of it, hedid back off, at least temporarily, from a lot of it. Sir Keir is correct. Trying to attribute logic to the US president’s reckless impulses or to make predictions about what he will do next is a waste of nervous energy. It is safer, if scarier, to proceed from the assumption that the only certainty about Trump’s world is instability.Keir Starmer will carry on calling Uncle Sam a friend however little it behaves like oneFaced with a craziness so alien to his own nature, what’s a prime minister who prides himself on his rationality to do? Sir Keir has elected to be the calm voice urging cool heads in the raging storm. That is a product of his temperament and what he takes to be good politics. When the seas are so alarmingly choppy, the last thing the passengers on HMS Britannia want to see is their captain with a sweaty brow and panicky eyes.The prime minister has mildly suggested that trade wars are not a terribly good idea, but you should not expect a word of explicit criticism of the US president to escape from the lips of Britain’s leader. This is in marked contrast with others in his peer group who share the same fears that the Trump regime has placed global security and the global economy in simultaneous peril. Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, has beenhighly belligerenttowards the White House, and not just because it appears to be enhancing his chances of winning his country’s imminent election. Friedrich Merz, the new chancellor of Germany and previously a staunch Atlanticist, has baldly declared that “independence from the USA” has become imperative and suggested that Nato may soon be dead.Those who yearn to hear similar sentiments coming from Sir Keir will be disappointed. Allies say he regards it as “a duty” to try to “get on with Trump”. There will be noLove Actuallymoment. Even if he had the acting chops to replicate the scene in which Hugh Grant plays a decent British PM who rebukes a bullying US president, Sir Keir wouldn’t do it. In contrast with the German chancellor, he will continue to insist that the US remains the essential ally. He will carry on calling Uncle Sam a friend however little it behaves like one.The prime minister is keen to deepen European cooperation on defence and is lobbying for British access to the newEU re-armament fund. But Sir Keir is worried by Merz-like talk about finding a European replacement for Nato. He thinks that notion dangerous because it could make a self-fulfilling prophecy of American withdrawal from the security guarantees which Europe has relied upon since 1945.“Don’t poke the beast” remains the watchword at Number 10, even as the beast rampages around chewing the legs off the global economy. One takeaway from recent turmoil is that Trump can be compelled to blink when the pressure is sufficiently intense. It was the threat of a meltdown in the US Treasury market,accompanied by warningsfrom some of his own supporters that the American economy faced a “nuclear winter”, that ultimately forced him to announce the “90-day pause” to the majority of his most severe tariffs bar those on China. But it would be wrong to conclude from this retreat that Britain only has to take Sir Ed Davey’s advice to “stand up” to the White House to make Trump back down. Sir Keir likes the Lib Dem leader, but scorns his demands for retaliation as juvenile. “Slagging off Trump, calling for retaliation. If we’d done what Davey is advocating, we’d be looking at 125% tariffs,” says one government official, possibly exaggerating for effect. The UK does not wield the clout of the bond market. Should he ever forget this, Rachel Reeves is there to remind Sir Keir of the fragility of their own fiscal position. He will carry on maintaining that counter-measures would be counter-productive.Ministers appear increasingly pessimistic aboutnegotiating awaythe 10% “baseline” tariff that has been imposed on Britain as it has been on most countries. “Tariffs are here for good,” remarks an official. The current focus is on trying to contain the damage threatened by elevated 25% tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium. Sir Keir hopes to attract credit forthrowing lifelinesto vulnerable industries, as the government did yesterday byrecalling MPsfrom their Easter break to pass emergency legislation to take protective control of the endangered steel plant in Scunthorpe, Britain’s last blast furnace facility. That’s a popular government move with Labour people, and you haven’t been able to name one of those for a while. “This is not back to the 1970s,” insists one cabinet minister. “It is assertive pragmatism to protect a key industry.” Ministers say there will also be assistance for pharmaceutical companies, big exporters to the US and a big employer in the UK, if punitive tariffs materialise. If you are in a sector that government regards as “strategic”, there’ll be help. If not, good luck. The Treasury won’t be riding to the rescue of every exposed industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that was before Trumptriggered carnage. Theretaliatory tariff levelsthat the US and China are whacking on each other are so eye-wateringly extreme that they will suffocate trade between the world’s two largest economies. If this is truly the “end of globalisation as we know it”, the Starmer government will need a plan for the “changed world” its leading figures bang on about. The current plan appears to be to do what they are already doing, but with more oomph. “Our plans don’t so much change as turbocharge,” says Sir Keir. Same set of wheels, but with go-faster stripes. In truth, much of what the government has unveiled since Trump brandished his tariffs card in the Rose Garden would have been announced anyway. Theeasing of electric vehicle targetswas in the pipeline already. As was the go-ahead for a giantUniversal studios theme parkin Bedfordshire.Crisis can be an excuse to cower or it can be a spur to grasp opportunity. A growing number of Labour voices see an opening for the Starmer government to pivot towards Europe. The prime minister tells friends that the UK is being taken seriously by the rest of its continent in a way that it has not been for a decade. Trump, Ukraine and not treating the EU as an enemy have played roles in the rebuilding of bridges. But the fabled “reset” in relations with our closest neighbours has thus far produced more warm words than it has concrete agreements that could lift growth. To sense how the wind is shifting, keep a weather eye on the chancellor. In the run-up to next month’s important EU/UK summit, Ms Reeves has started using much sharper andmore ambitious languageabout removing trade barriers with the union. “We’re getting more confident about how we talk about it in public,” says one cabinet member. Number 10 is wary of any move that might be depicted as “undoing Brexit”, butpolling tells usthat a chunky majority of Britons now devoutly wish that it could be undone. The perils posed to prosperity by Donald Trump make it more imperative to relieve the impediments to growth that Britain has inflicted upon itself.“Keep calm and carry on” has served Sir Keir well in the opening phases of this crisis. Bigger, bolder moves will be demanded of him before it is over.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

Bosses have dropped their masks, but gen Z is fighting backSarah ManavisEmployees are choosing to opt out of a new era of corporate malignity, epitomised by Elon MuskSun 13 Apr 2025 03.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 13.19 EDTShareAlmost any workplace study in the last decade will tell you that the death of productivity – and the death of profits – is a direct result of having miserable, overworked and micromanaged employees. In an attempt to make themselves feel in control, bosses delude themselves into believing that a tight grip will yield big results from their staff.Overwhelmingly though, the reality is the opposite: that relaxed, empowered workers (with plenty of free time) are the ones who manage to do the best work, often in shorter days than 9-5.Can this delusion be added to the list of those held by Elon Musk and Donald Trump? Last week, Trump administration officials told US federal employees that Musk’s department of government efficiency (Doge) was using artificial intelligence to surveil staff emails for any anti-Trump sentiment or perceived disloyalty. AGuardianreportsaid certain federal agencies were warned to watch what they said in any work setting, with the Doge team secretly recording virtual meetings and loading new monitoring software on to computers – adding that any diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) buzzwords were also being scanned by AI. It remains unclear what the administration might do with this information, who it might be shared with and whether it is about to inform another round of the administration’s now-characteristic mass layoffs.The use of shoddy tech to enforce McCarthyist principles may seem like a predictable next step in the Trump-Musk alliance, whose express goal in the last three months has been to cut up the government, in ways that often benefit their private ventures. (Already, they claim to have used Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, to gut government departments.) But this story comes in the wake of a screeching pivot in the world of work, where hypersurveillance and inflexibly harsh practices are fashionable again after a brief hiatus, where they have been adopted – as in the case of Musk’s department – to increase efficiency.The late 2010s and early 2020s were defined by pseudo-benevolence from corporations. It was an era of companies as families and fun over functionality; when management pushed yoga classes, snack walls and in-office mini golf, and bosses were pitched as friends rather than the next rung up in a rigid hierarchy. This was a superficially gilded age of work: perks and swish spaces were more often than not a mask for poor benefits and conditions, and even worse pay. The pandemic saw a rise in workplace surveillance technology, as managers scrambled to retain control over their staff, whom they could no longer monitor behind the glass walls of their open-plan offices – despite the popular idea that we were witnessing the birth of a new, better working world.In spite of this raging corporate malignity, young workers are rejecting work that looks anything close to gruellingWe have now entered a new era of grim austerity in the workplace. The prevailing wisdom has shifted from easy-going to grind. In January, founder and former CEO of BrewDog, James Watt, went viral for saying workers should focus less on work-life balance and more on obsessive, dedicated work-life integration; in the same week, the former M&S and Asda CEO, Stuart Rose, argued that working from home wasnot “proper work”. Surveillance technology is booming, with projections that70% of large employerswill be monitoring staff in some form by the end of this year. This is all happening in the midst of an economic crisis: for two years now, we have seen a near-constant barrage of mass layoffs in major industries, where workplaces are whittling down staff numbers (and benefits) to brace themselves for the coming global recession.This together amounts to a mask-off moment for these heads of companies, ditching their previously thin values in pursuit of competition and efficiency, at any cost to staff – while expecting total loyalty in response. What makes things different this time around is there is no false pretence that these companies care about their workers, or that any benefits they receive is because of some benevolent company care. Instead, we have the knowledge that everything is being done to maximise the bottom line.We shouldn’t conclude that this is anything more than a blaring signal of our bleak new era. But how far can this ethos go among a workforce galvanised against it? Earlier this year, Oli Mould, a professor of human geography at Royal Holloway, University of London, wrote that gen Z areprioritising work-life balance over hustle culture, seeking out companies providing secure contracts and ample benefits, explicitly opting out of roles that demand long hours and churn. In spite of this raging corporate malignity, young workers are (when they can) rejecting work that looks anything close to precarious or gruelling. They are ready to pledge their loyalty to their employers – but only to those companies willing to fulfil the reasonable expectation that employees get something substantial and equally committed in return.If corporate decision-making were determined by workers’ desires, wouldn’t we be faced with a reality where the richest man in the world is combing through entry-level workers’ emails to make sure they have never complained about their jobs? There’s only so much workers can do to push back against this powerful wave of drudgery, emboldened by a political culture that celebrates overworking and callousness (a culture spearheaded by the very people conducting this workplace surveillance). There is serious generational friction, but it’s hard to picture an outcome in which this gentler vision of work is the side that succeeds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather than achieving fear-induced motivation among staff, the only outcomes corporations can expect are less-productive, unhappy employees. As one federal worker told theGuardian: “It’s really funny to think about the Dogebags sitting there, watching and learning in real time, that the ‘deep state’ is really a bunch of goobers just doing our boring jobs for middling pay.” Workers are certainly the losers, but this philosophy has no winners.Sarah Manavis is a US writer and critic living in the UKExplore more on these topicsSurveillanceOpinionElon MuskTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Is Trump a “useful idiot” of even darker forces? What has Putin got on a president who succeeds a long line of (mostly) admirable predecessors, who saw Russian leaders as enemies with whom they had to coexist, not as friends?One conspiracy theory going the rounds is that “the tariffs are about manipulating share prices for him and his billionaire buddies to profit from fluctuations”. This theory was hardly dismissed out of hand when Trump stated “this is a great time to buy” after the stock market collapse.True or not, thecollapse of the bond market last Wednesdaywas something else, and precipitated a panic that almost took the smirk off Trump’s face. Yes, he most certainly blinked, having childishly boasted that some 70 countries were crawling to him to negotiate.Most economists agree that the tariff war Trump has initiated is far more extensive in its threatened consequences than the notoriousSmoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930. There are now serious fears of a world recession, or even depression, as “beggar my neighbour” policies return after being abandoned in reaction to the economic and political damage they caused in the 1930s.Serious though the tariff war is, there is a danger it may distract attention from the wider crisis, namely that Trump and his sidekicks are presiding over a quasi-fascist state, with huge damage to the rule of law, democratic values and the lives and living standards of countless poorer nations being cut off from US overseas aid.Which brings us to how Britain should respond. Does our government really wish to be as close to Trump as, sadly, Keir Starmer appears to want to be?Paul Krugman points out that, in 2024, the average EU tariff on US goods was 1.7%, against an average US tariff on EU goods of 1.4%. Hardly seriousFirst, a little background. There is nothing new about Europe’s distrust of the US. The breakup of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in 1973 so alarmed European leaders that Chancellor Schmidt of West Germany and President Giscard d’Estaing of France joined forces with Britain’s Roy Jenkins, then president of the European Commission, to set up the European Monetary System in the late 1970s. This was intended to be a “zone of monetary stability” in the face of what became known as America’s “benign neglect” of the international monetary system. Its principal manifestation was the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), which evolved into the eurozone.But what Trump has been up to is causing far more distrust of the US on the part of Europe than that 1970s experience. Gordon Brown, the hero of the successful coordination of G20 policies in 2009 after the 2008 banking crisis, is arguing for a similar coordinated effort – to ward off the global recession that many fear the tariff war could precipitate.This, says Brown, means “working ever more closely with the EU – indeed, the changes under way in Europe make possible a collaboration that is even more extensive than removing the post-Brexit trade barriers”. On which issue, there are signs that the Germans and others would welcome us back into the customs union. Ministers talk about removing “unnecessary trade barriers”, but how long can they go on about self-imposed red lines when the biggest barrier to our trade has been the huge losses of export business caused byBrexit?Er, that is to say, it was the biggest until Trump slapped a 10% tariff on most British goods exports to the US, 25% for steel, aluminium and pharmaceuticals, and more on vehicles. So much for cosying up to Trump.EU protectionism? Nobel laureate Paul Krugmanpoints outthat, in 2024, the average EU tariff on US goods was 1.7%, against an average US tariff on EU goods of 1.4%. Hardly serious.Now that the US is disengaging from its traditional relationship with Europe, it is obvious that, for defence and security reasons, the UK needs to be closer to the EU; indeed, there are already stirrings in that direction. But it is also obvious that a government that is desperately seeking to put flesh on the bones of its growth policy needs to recognise that its economic interests also require the abandonment of those red lines about not rejoining the customs union and single market.Trump has already demonstrated to Starmer that he cannot be trusted, whether or not our prime minister kowtows to him.Finally: a little light relief.

Mary, Vicky, Annie and Bessie are the mighty blast furnaces, though only two are still in action. Jubilation broke out in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire council leader Rob Waltham told me, still exhausted from striving to keep the steelworks open. “I’ve just been talking to a family with three generations all working there,” he said. “It’s all the family’s earnings, all about to lose their jobs at once. The eldest retires next week, really afraid his pension might have gone.”Such was the suspicion of Chinese owners Jingye that workers blockaded the plant on Saturday morning to stop executives entering; they were reportedly worried that they might sabotage the works as theemergency bill in parliamentwas stripping away their power. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, told the Commons how negotiations with the owners had come to naught: he said it had become “clear that the intention of Jingye was to refuse to purchase sufficient raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running.” In the Lords, John Reid, former defence and home secretary, blamed Boris Johnson for recklessly allowing British Steel to be sold to a company in a hostile state. “Did it never occur to anyone,” he asked sardonically, “that it may be, in a competitive world, in the interest of the Chinese government to purchase and then close down the British steel industry?”Waltham says 20,000 Scunthorpe peopleare dependent on the plant. As the Commons debated the bill, he was talking to the owner of a firm with 200 people working inside it on a maintenance contract. “It might have finished a small company,” he said. Full nationalisation of British Steel is near-certain, but couldn’t be done in one parliamentary day.Eight years leader of the council, Waltham is theConservative candidatein next month’s elections for the new Greater Lincolnshire mayoralty. But he has no ideological qualms about nationalisation, a word that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown never dared utter,using euphemismswhen they were forced to nationalise Railtrack, the precursor to Network Rail, in 2002. Waltham says: “Government intervention here was inevitable, I always said so. When a market fails, there’s no choice and other essential heavy industries under pressure may need the government too.” That echoes Reynolds telling the Commons that most of Britain’s “foundation industries” were in “substantial difficulty” when Labour took office. While Tories postured loudly in the Commons about needing a one-year sunset clause to end these unwelcome emergency powers, Waltham was telling me the government needs to run the plant for three years or more to transition to electric arc furnaces.‘I have spent my life in this corner of Lincolnshire and witnessed how such job losses affect every part of a community’Read moreThis government is not allergic to the notion of public ownership. Blair had madeditching clause IVhis emblem of “newness”, abandoning the Labour party’s commitment to “the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange”. The Starmer government will say it’s “pragmatic”, quite rightly. But the dilemmas are hard, even if not ideological. The epic failure of Margaret Thatcher’s privatisations are plain for all to see, but she’s not here to castigate. Public support hassoaredfor bringing rail, mail, electricity and buses back into public ownership, reaching 82% for water. Privatisation has left Thames Water£16bn in debtand withdecrepit machinery. Should the state really take on heavily indebted, loss-makers that swallow up funds for public services, if a company will shoulder some of the risk? Yet there should be a healthy suspicion of any company stepping forward: private equity group KKR istop of the bidding for Thames, so someone clearly thinks there’s money in our sewage. Ditto any other bidder for British Steel after a series of short-lived, dud owners.What is the “pragmatic” solution whenScunthorpe is reported to be losing £700,000 a day? As in their manifesto,Labour has £2.5bn set asideto revive the steel industry, but that could be drained fast. Rousing patriotic words rang through the Commons on the need for a “sovereign” steel industry to defend us from a wildly uncertain world:speaking on Sunday, Reynolds admittedthe raw materials might not arrive in time to save it.“At the heart of this debate is actually a very simple question – can we entrust a critical national asset to a company that we do not trust? … In a world where threats to our economic security multiply each day, we cannot allow that risk to fester at the heart of our industrial core,” wentLiam Byrne’s eloquent tub-thumper,as chair of the Commons business and trade select committee. Just before the debate, reading the emergency steel bill’s wording, he said to Reynolds, only half-joking, that he would add an amendment removing the word “steel” so these commanding powers could be used for any industry in the national interest.Our nationalisation phobia has handed state assets over to foreign governments to make handsome profits that should have been ours. The French and Italian statesown chunks of our railway companies, while nearly half our offshore wind capacity iscontrolled by foreign state-owned entities, including Denmark and Norway. If they can make them turn a profit, why not our own government? Thatcher’s mystical belief that private is always more efficient died long ago.The world has indeed changed and the government needs to be alert to all the shifting moods in the air. It must stop respecting outdated shibboleths, speed up a radical industrial strategy – and urgently reopen the trade routes to Europe that would support many more workers. Reynolds ended his speech with “Take back control!” A clear signal of intent for a newly activist, interventionist state.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBritish SteelOpinionLabourSteel industryManufacturing sectorcommentShareReuse this content"

The suffering of the women and babies – an estimated 170,000 of them – who were incarcerated and abused in the Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes that housed “fallen women” is one such story. It is a scandal that is difficult to read about without experiencing an overwhelming feeling of disgust, from the testimonies of abuse and forced adoption, to themass graveat the former St Mary’s mother-and-baby home near Tuam, County Galway, which contained 796 bodies of babies and children. The nuns put many of them in a septic tank. There were no burial records.The efforts of survivors, campaigners and historians to bring these stories to light in the face of obstruction and indifference has beenthe work of decades. The Irish government made a formal apology in 2021 after a judicial commission report. Yet this story, and the human misery it has caused, is not over: the last home closed in 1996. There are living survivors, and people who are descended from the victims. The exhumation of the children’s remains, so that they can be identified if possible and given a proper burial, is continuing. And then there is the question of redress.This week, it was reported that, of the eight religious organisations linked to Ireland’s mother-and-baby homes,only twohave offered to contribute to a survivor redress scheme. The Sisters of Bon Secours – the order that presided over the septic tank mass grave – offered €12.97m (about £11m), while the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul has proposed contributing a building to the scheme. A third religious body – the Sisters of St John of God – declined to contribute, saying there was “no legal or moral” basis to do so as there was “no evidence that our sisters there acted in any untoward manner”, but offered a donation to survivors.The other five – the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, the Legion of Mary and the (Anglican) Church ofIreland– made no offer. They gave various reasons – or excuses, depending on your viewpoint. Ireland’s children’s minister, Norma Foley, expressed her disappointment, saying that, while the state had admitted its role in the scandal, more should have been done by the church and the religious organisations.While public expression by the state of its culpability has been explicit and categorical, the remorse expressed on the religious side has been less clear-cut. Past statements from the orders involved such as “with deep regret … we acknowledge that there are women who did not experience our refuge as a place of protection and care” and “it is regrettable that the Magdalene homes had to exist at all” lack a certain tone of regret, shall we say. The Good Shepherd Sisters, as they are now known, have made particularly impressive use of grammatical gymnastics over the years (“We sincerely regret that women could have experienced hurt and hardship”). Perhaps most shocking was this: “It was part of the system and the culture of the time.”Nothing from the nuns, or the Catholic church, has really come close to expressing true remorse. A “definitive” apology in 2021 from Eamon Martin, Ireland’s most senior church figure, was worded thus: “I accept that the church was clearly part of that culture in which people were frequently stigmatised, judged and rejected. For that, and for the longlasting hurt and emotional distress that has resulted, I unreservedly apologise.”Yet the church wasn’t just part of that culture. Itwasthe culture, saturating every aspect of life in Ireland, shaping public attitudes towards women and their babies, encouraging their shaming and ostracising. Some campaigners have called for church assets to be seized unless the institution contributes to a state-run redress scheme.Without a true acknowledgment of the pain that has been caused, how do you begin to move on from something so traumatic? Yes, there have been memorial events and gardens – in Dublin, a journey stone monument was unveiled in 2022, and the National Centre for Research and Remembrance is to hold records related to the institutional trauma, with a museum and exhibition space. Culturally, the scandal has been intelligently and sensitively revisited, from the novella and film Small Things Like These to the BBC drama The Woman in the Wall, and Sinéad O’Connor’s previously unreleased The Magdalene Song. Liam Neeson is collaborating with Catherine Corless – the amateur historian who devoted many hours to painstaking research into St Mary’s, and who battled on heroically despite widespread indifference when she tried to make the mass grave public – on a film, The LostChildrenof Tuam.There is no chance of these children and their mothers being forgotten now, and that is meaningful. I was too young when I saw in 2002 The Magdalene Sisters, a drama which gave me a lifelong aversion to Irish nuns, so repugnant and sadistic was their behaviour towards the vulnerable women in their control. Being the granddaughter of a woman who was once tarred as “illegitimate” – the bald cruelty of this term, of the thought of labelling a baby thus, is enough to bring tears to your eyes – perhaps led to my interest in this dark chapter of Irish history. My grandmother was born in a mother-and-baby home, but in Wales. It was no picnic, but had she been in Ireland – the country of her suspected father – even greater miseries would have awaited her.The treatment of children born out of wedlock in Ireland as “an inferior subspecies” – then taoiseach Enda Kenny’s words in 2014 – and the humiliation to which they were subjected is a stain on the church’s history. Corless said in interview at the time that she had lost respect for the Catholic church. She is by no means alone in that.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It can’t be long before Jeff Bezos personallyextends his thanks, as he did when we – Amazon employees and Amazon customers – paid for his flight to sub-orbital space, but let’s not wait. As soon as Monday, when his fiancee, Lauren Sánchez, is due with five friends on a rocket trip, Amazon givers could be witness, again, to the kind of unfettered excess that is only possible if everyone, at every level, contributes, even if it’s only via permanent surveillance and asurrendered toilet break.But no one puts it better than Jeff, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, did himself, after he took his inaugural Blue Origin space trip in 2021. “You guys paid for all this.” More recently, we provided funds – that might not exist without the company’s pitiless working conditions – for Sánchez’s pink diamondengagement ring, proudly exhibited, estimated value, $3m. The billionaire delivered it, an enchantedVoguewriter reported, in the sweetest way, on his massive new yacht, “hiding the ring under her pillow after a starlit dinner à deux”. Few passions have been as exhaustively documented as that between these seasoned lovebirds. (Favourite saying: “Love you to space and back.”) And this week, prior to funding the solemnisation of that love – a June wedding in Venice – it will duly be our privilege to watch Lauren’s hen flight slip the surly bonds of Earth.Everyone on this pointless excursion will,Ellemagazine confirms, wear full makeup. “We are going to put the “ass” in astronaut,” says the singer Katy Perry. “Little girls and little boys are going to be more curious about space and what else is out there because we’re bringing attention to it,” says Sánchez. Already the trip is advertising, to all ages, ticket availability on Bezos’s exclusive Blue Origin rocket tours.How Venetians, however, are to benefit from their bit parts in the forthcoming Sánchez-Bezos exploit,The Blings of the Dove, is less readily understood. Only last year, the city was so overwhelmed by tourism it introduced an entry fee, though one so small itreportedly made little difference. But its mayor,Luigi Brugnaro, who actively welcomed the Bezos wedding, is reassuring residents that a three-day invasion by the Trump ally, his bride, a retinue of celebrity guests, their countless attendants and media being groomed into a frenzy, is nothing the city can’t deal with. And as much as it might look unappealing, the tradition of US plutocrats Venice-washing their loot dates back at least to the time when Henry James’s friends were crowing about palazzos and treasures you could buy for a song. “The common Italians are not at all aware of the artistic value of such a unique specimen of decoration of 17th century as ourgran sala,” wrote the US banker’s wife, Ariana Curtis, after snapping up the Palazzo Barbaro in 1885. “We, however, do not intend to be tied to it – regarding it as a good investment.”The wedding plan is, reportedly, for the celebrations to centre on the Bezos yacht, a craft famous for its rivalrous mast dimensions, enormous support vessel (or garage/helicopter pad), andcustom figurehead, one thought to be modelled on Sánchez until she indicated toVogue, with the utmost delicacy, that its breasts were too small for that to be true. Tourist crowds will judge for themselves but the briefest comparison of the wooden figurehead and Ms Sánchez wearing, for instance, the corset she picked for Trump’s inauguration, confirms, as do her many candid selfies, that the effigy hardly does her justice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is it wise to choose this venue or, indeed, any inside Europe where, after repeated industrial disputes andfines for surveillance of its workers, Amazon – and therefore the obscene wealth of our June bridegroom – remains synonymous with workplace practices widely considered unconscionable? It is a while since the International Trade Union Federation named Bezos “the world’s worst boss”, but last year the European parliamentbanned Amazon’s (14) lobbyists, citing that company’s repeated refusal to engage with itsEmployment and Social Affairs committee. Should Sánchez be made aware of what also tends not to feature in magazine tributes to her new career in philanthropy, that the European section of the UNI global union considers Amazon, known for“bombarding” workerswith anti-union messaging, as “hostile to the European model”? Or does Sánchez know this, yet still insist on hailing Venice, or the parts of it able to accommodate an Amazon flotilla, from the Bezos substitute for a burnish’d throne? Her brother talks ofroyal-level spectacle.While there is every chance, with no Amazon warehouses nearby, that many spectators will simply enjoy the evidence of colossal waste and any amount of fillers, with the chance to glimpse a waterborne Kardashian or Trump, there can be no guarantee others will not react to the provocation. You do not have to be familiar, after all, with thehuman-cage contraptionthat Amazon once patented (to allow its human assets to mix with actual automatons) to conclude that a couple intent on Venetian profligacy has learned nothing, not even with the help ofThe White Lotus, since his “you guys paid for all this” triggered international disbelief.As we can’t be sure thatVenicedidn’t demand a fortune in return, it’s possible the city has made Bezos’s late-life bid to look classy, financially worth its trouble. But still: the city offers something that is irreplaceable and desired by the second richest – or thereabouts – man in the world. Isn’t the least Venice could do for the numberless exhausted workers whose dignity Amazon has denied, to show Bezos there’s one thing he can’t buy?Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The head of the Saudi-backed Muslim World League counsels British Muslims to talk less about Gaza and more about domestic issues. Labour MP Tahir Ali is criticised for campaigning for a new airport in Mirpur in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir; he claims the criticismshave led to “Islamophobic” attacks. After push-back, the BBC changes a headlinedescribing converts to Islam as “reverts”, a term some Muslims use to suggest that Islam is the natural state of humankind.Just a taster of debates about British Muslims over the past week. At the heart of each of these controversies is the question of how Muslims should relate to western societies, and western societies relate to them. For some, the answer is easy. On the one side, many claimIslamto be incompatible with western values and that allowing Muslims to settle here has led to what they regard as the degeneration of western societies. On the other are those who insist there is no issue, and those who raise concerns are bigots. Both are wrong. There are issues about Muslims and integration that need discussing, but those issues are rarely as presented in these debates.Part of the problem is a view of Islam as fixed and static, a belief that it has remained the same throughout history, as have Muslims’ beliefs about their faith. It is a perspective ironically shared by dogmatic Islamists and implacable critics of Islam. In reality, not only are Muslims as diverse as any other community, but their connection to their faith is constantly evolving. To understand Muslim attitudes and attitudes to Muslims, we need to track that changing relationship between Muslims, their faith and wider society.The first generation of postwar Muslim immigrants to Britain, largely from the Indian subcontinent, was pious and culturally conservative, but wore its faith lightly. Many men drank alcohol. Few women wore the hijab.The second generation – my generation – was more secular. Our desire for equality led us to challenge not just racism but the obscurantism of mosques and faith leaders. The more hardline strands of Islam had little sway within British Muslim communities until the end of the 1980s. The irony is that, since then, a generation of Muslims far more integrated and “westernised” than the first came also to be the generation most insistent on maintaining its “difference”. A study by the Institute for the Impact of Faith in Life (IIFL) published last month found that young people were most likely to view themselves as Muslim more than British, while over-65s were twice as likely to identify asBritish first.The more inward-looking character of Muslim communities today has been forged out of social and political developmentsThe reasons for the transformation of attitudes are complex. Partly they lie in international developments such as the battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for leadership of the global ummah that led to Saudi petrodollars helping fund more hardline Islamist organisations in the west. Partly they lie in the rise of identity politics and of narrower conceptions of belonging. And partly they lie in public policies driven by a perception of the nation as a “community of communities”, in the words of the influential Parekh report on multicultural Britain. State institutions began relating to minority communities through “community leaders”, often religiously conservative men who used their relationship with the state to cement control over their ethnic fiefdoms, encouraging social division along lines of identity.Many institutions and policymakers came to regard socially and religiously conservative Muslims as more “authentic”, often dismissing those with liberal views as not being truly of their community. The BBC’s use of “revert” to describe “converts” may well have come from a desire to portray what it took to be an authentically Muslim view.The more inward-looking, conservative character of many Muslim communities today has been forged out of social and political developments rather than simply from religious conviction. Nor are identitarian forms of belonging unique to Muslims.A report last yearfor the Institute for Jewish Policy Research found that most British Jews had “a stronger Jewish identity than British identity”. Around three-quarters felt “attached” to Israel, especially in the wake of the7 October Hamas attack, and this framed the response of many (though not all) Jews to the Gaza conflict.For many Muslims, too, their identity is shaped in part by the Palestinian struggle, and they feel distraught about Israeli attacks on schools, hospitals and civilians. Unlike with Jewish identity, though, this gets condemned as “sectarian”. What is sectarian is not support for the Palestinian cause, or opposing the destruction of Gaza, but to view these purely through the lens of Muslim identity. It is defining attitudes to political issues by the boundaries of identity rather than by political and moral reasoning that makes it sectarian.Sectarianism has long existed in British politics. For decades the Labour party, incities such as Bradfordand Birmingham, has exploited a machine politics based on the biradari, or clan, system that could deliver bloc votes toparticular candidates. Today, that old machine politics has been folded into the politics of identity.Tahir Ali’s constituency of Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley is beset with social and political problems, from thebin strikebefouling the streets to the worstchild poverty ratein Britain. He seems largely to have ignored the strike and has never voted in parliament on issues of welfare reform or in opposition tobenefit cuts. He has, however, been campaigning for the reintroduction ofblasphemy lawsand pressing the Pakistani government to build an airport in Mirpur. MPs have every right to engage on foreign issues. It is difficult, though, not to view his record as being defined by sectarian interests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is this perception, rather than any deep attachment to Islam, theIIFL studysuggested, that drew Muslims to identify with their faith more than with their nationality.The growing clamour that Muslims don’t belong in the west, a sentiment often attached to a desire for Britain to beexclusively “white”, is part of the process whereby racism has become rebranded in identitarian terms. It can only reinforce Muslim sectarianism.To imagine politics not as a means of effecting social change in more universalist terms, but as a process bound by the limits of identity, is deeply corrosive.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The first her family knew of it was when they received the goodbye letters Anne hadposted them from Switzerland. It follows another case from 2023, when 47-year-old Alastair Hamilton went to the same Swiss clinic after telling his mother he was going on holiday. He had been suffering from stomach problems but hadno diagnosed illness. There are similar cases of individuals being prescribed lethal drugs in Canadawithout the knowledge of their families, to their profound distress.If MPs in Britain vote to legalise assisted dying next month, the same could happen. Eligibility would be more limited than in Switzerland or Canada, to people diagnosed with a terminal illness where a doctor believes they probably have fewer than six months to live. That’s more subjective than it might sound: in Oregon, for example, doctors have interpreted terminal illness to include malnutrition from eating disorders, and the assisted dying bill’s sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, rejected amendments backed by eating disorder charities to prevent this happening here. Having learning difficulties or a mental illness, feeling depressed or suicidal, or alcohol misuse that might impair judgment would not preclude someone from seeking amedically assisted death. There would be no obligation on assisted suicide providers to notify families their relative is about to die, and no route for relatives to raise concerns about coercion.Do we really want to live in a society in which a depressed 19-year-old diagnosed with terminal cancer can kill himself with medical assistance, and his parents only find out afterwards? Or in which an older woman who is terminally ill can get an assisted death to avoid being a burden on her adult children, with no opportunity for them to tell her that caring for her would be an act of love rather than obligation? These circumstances would be entirely permissible under Leadbeater’s bill. They are the logical extension of treating medical assistance to kill oneself as healthcare, and as facilitating an adult’s right to make autonomous and private choices.Last week, Leadbeater announced that the next stage of her bill – when the Commons will debate and vote on the bill as amended during committee stage – would bedelayed by three weeksuntil 16 May. This is a concession, albeit a paltry one. Many of her colleagues were alarmed that such a consequential debate might happen just a few days before local elections and when the government’s impact assessment has not yet been published. Now, it gives MPs more time to digest what has happened to the bill in committee stage. If they look beyond the fervent spin, they will find legislation that has beenweakened rather than improved. The judicial safeguard has been eliminated. Instead of judges signing off assisted deaths, this will fall to panels with no investigatory powers, no ability to summon witnesses or to hear evidence under oath, and no obligation to make inquiries beyond hearing from one doctor. External oversight of the system by the chief medical officer has been removed. The NHS can outsource assisted dying to for-profit companies. There is no proper regulatory regime nor any protection for hospices from being financially penalised for not providing assisted dying on their premises. Doctors can proactively suggest assisted dying to under-18s, who can qualify for it from their 18th birthday. These are just some of the problems with the bill. Little wonder that six Labour MPs have written to colleagues calling it “flawed and dangerous”.Doctors can proactively suggest assisted dying to under-18s, who can qualify for it from their 18th birthdayHow did we get here? There are some intellectually honest proponents of assisted dying who acknowledge that people would suffer wrongful deaths if it were legalised. The brain surgeon Henry Marsh even said in 2017 “if a few grannies get bullied into it, isn’t that a price worth paying for all the people who could die with dignity?”. Grim, though upfront. But I have watched open-mouthed as some MPs arguing for assisted dying have chosen to ignore what we know about safeguarding to pretend it’s possible to eliminate the risk of people being coerced into killing themselves, through something as cursory as a bit of training for doctors signing it off. Have they not read the same safeguarding reviews that I have, which make clear that even experienced social workersroutinely miss cases of domestic abuse? Have they not digested the implications of NHS scandals, such asmid-Staffs, thematernity scandals, and theTavistock’s clinicfor gender-questioning children? Is it arrogance or ineptitude that makes them think they know better than the country’sleading experts on domestic abuse?Whatever it is, the need of some to keep their consciences clear by deluding themselves that the bill is safe means they have had to cast the MPs and experts who have desperately tried to amend the bill to make it safer as acting in bad faith, rather than people with a more realistic understanding of the world. They are perceived as bad folk using words like “risk” and “safeguarding” as a foil for some other irrational opposition to something that’s innately good. In fact, it’s the other way round: some assisted dying proponents have been quasi-religious in their fervour that theirs is the one true way, rejecting pragmatic amendments from those who don’t think it can be done safely, but want to minimise the risks.It is an unserious, irresponsible way to make law that could lead to vulnerable or suicidal people being prescribed lethal drugs by the state. Labour seems yet to twig what a serious political problem this could be. Does it really want to be known as the party that failed to fix the NHS so that a parent with probably-terminal cancer could access decent end-of-life care, but instead made it possible for them to kill themselves with medical assistance when they were feeling suicidal? But these ugly politics pale against the fundamental moral question. I don’t want to live in a society that sees people with complications and vulnerabilities as expendable in reducing the suffering of others. It really is as simple as that. And it distresses me immeasurably that there are MPs who cannot see this is precisely what this bill would achieve.Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnistskip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tyres are the main source of land-based microplastics entering our oceans, where they absorb and concentrate forever chemicals discharged by our environmentally reckless water and pharmaceutical industries.This combination is then ingested by zooplankton such as krill, which die carrying their toxic load to the ocean floor. Plankton numbers are down 50% globally since the 60s, and are continuing to decline at 1% per annum. As phytoplankton produce 50% of the world’s oxygen, this could end very badly for every oxygen breathing creature on the planet, including of course the human race.So why don’t we all accept that SUVs are an existential threat to human existence and consign them to the rubbish heap of history?Dr Robin Russell-Jones, Scientific Advisor All Party Parliamentary Group on AirPollution(2017-21)Marlow, BuckinghamshireYou argue for increased levies on large SUVs because of their detrimental effects on safety, road condition and world climate. Until recently, cars were getting smaller but they’re now, especially SUVs, increasing in size.It’s common to see vehicles the size of small buses used to pick up the shopping or run the kids to and from school. I fully support the idea of increased levies with one caveat: remember that a minority of individuals, especially the countryside, need vehicles with decent-sized engines and proper four-wheel drive for their work, to carry or pull heavy loads, often off road.In Cornwall, this includes people working in farming, forestry, fencing and walling, fishing and the building trade. These people don’t own large SUVs for fun. So yes, introduce higher levies to discourage ownership of large SUVs but ensure there’s a discount arrangement for provable essential owners.The countryside is not a museum. If future legislation on SUVs is insensitively rolled out, it runs the risk of infuriating a lot of working people.Dr S P G PerryPenzance, CornwallVain men lack appealI can assure impressionable males wavering towards the “masculine” ideology peddled by certain influencers that worthy women are not interested in the vainglorious, but those who are considerate, good company and willing to put themselves out (“A benign, perfectly sculpted picture of vitality… or the palatable face of toxic masculinity?”, Comment).I find the notion of a man who enjoys constantly gawping at himself in a mirror or through a lens quite repugnant. I have no need of feckless ornaments, but could entertain pursuits that genuinely showcase virile strength – such as digging up the pendulous sedge in my garden.Mona SoodSouthend-on-Sea, EssexTighten church safeguardsIt would seem that Youth With a Mission, like many other Christian organisations, needs to be subjected to much tighter legal control (“Christian missionary group accused of public shaming and rituals to ‘cure’ sexual sin”, News).What we need is legislation to compel religious bodies to pass accusations of abuse and hurt to competent, independent agencies; the Charity Commissionto withdraw Gift Aid privileges from any organisation that does not show they have satisfactory safeguarding procedures; and engagementby the churches and others with the new discipline of trauma theology.Sadly, there is nothing new about religious leaders acting in a hurtful and abusive manner. The basic message of the gospel – of love and charity – needs to be what people associate with Christianity if it is to have a future.Andrew McLuskeyAshford, SurreyMental health issuesI would like to thank Martha Gill for highlighting the misuse of mental health labels by the police, military and justice system to blame victims of abuse and the most vulnerable members of society (“Mental ill-health is losing its stigma, but it’s still used to blame victims of abuse”, Comment). Our family includes a former victim of domestic violence, gaslighted by accusations of mental ill-health, and a middle-aged paranoid schizophrenic, who happens to be autistic.We talk openly and have learnt that we are one of many similar families. Over the years, relatives, friends and the wider public have become more informed and understanding, bearing out Gill’s assessment that mental ill-health is losing its stigma although not in much of the media.Fear is fuelled by reportage of psychotic violence, undeniably terrifying, without reference to the appalling lack of mental health care and supervision.We are often asked if we are scared of our schizophrenic loved one. When suffering from a psychotic episode, he is a danger only to himself, suicidal or terrified of being killed. He is never fully well, never complains and is acknowledged by all who know him as a kind and caring individual.Name and address suppliedClosing the attainment gapKenan Malik argues that white working-class children fail to become doctors or engineers because of an attainment gap and lack of social pathways compared with white middle-class children (“The white working class is nothing like what politicians think – or claim – it is”, Comment).I grew up with white working-class children, attended school with them and now teach them. The national curriculum provides little access to traditional working-class subjects like metalwork, woodwork, graphic design, textiles and home economics.This has switched them off education and the few that try to become doctors or engineers are hindered by a lack of resources, support and acceptance. If we want to narrow the attainment gap we need to abolish the snobbery of academic subjects over technical subjects.Kartar UppalSutton Coldfield, West MidlandsThoroughly modern LadyThe Ladymagazine didn’t fold because it appealed to “ladies” of a bygone age (“Women’s magazines still thriving despite closure of The Lady, the ‘journal for gentlewomen’”, News).It continued to be a popular magazine and was bang up to date, stylish and fun. It is the “lavender and old lace” image that is way out of date. There was a lively letters page, a topical and sometimes controversial debate, plus fashion, interviews, reviews and columns by leading writers.As to the title, why change it to something unfamiliar? How many readers ofGood Housekeepingmagazine, for instance, want to be good housekeepers? As a regular contributor toThe Ladyfor 20 years, I always made sure my column addressed current issues, not those of concern to Victorian ladies.Liz HodgkinsonOxfordExplore more on these topicsMotoringObserver lettersPollutionTransportTransport policyOceansPlasticslettersShareReuse this content"

Whether she’s discussing menopausal hormone treatment (she’s on it), her libido (“It’s not what it was but [musician husband Ben Lee] and I have a really nice sex life”) or her ex Anthony Kiedis’s fondness for dating teenagers (“Why can’t you be with a grown-up?” she sighs), for 54-year-old Skye, there’s no such thing as too much information too early in the morning.Skye’s aptly named memoir, Say Everything, has been praised as raw, revealing, disarming and horny. “I definitely didn’t want to hurt people,” the actor says when we meet over breakfast at a cafe near her Sydney home. It’s just that between recounting her sexcapades with both male and female celebrities – “Writing a sex scene is so funny because I didn’t want it to be cringy, sleazy or too crass,” she laughs – Skye had a lot of past to surrender and guilt to process. It is, she says, also a cautionary tale for her two daughters.Her droll and self-aware memoir, which dishes on the private lives of heavyweights from Madonna to Gwyneth Paltrow to Robert Downey Jr, has captured the attention of everyone from Miranda July (“I gobbled it up,” she gushed) to 90s-curious gen Zers: “People are fascinated with what life was like out in the world without [smart]phones.”View image in fullscreenSkye with Keanu Reeves in the 1986 film River’s Edge, her first film role.Photograph: Hemdale/AllstarName-dropping comes naturally to this OG nepo baby. Skye, named for the island where she was conceived, is the daughter of the Scottish flower power singer Donovan, who left her mother, the US model Enid Karl, and Skye’s older brother, Dono, before Ione was born. Her mother’s previous boyfriends included Jim Morrison, Keith Richards and Dudley Moore but it was Donovan and his desertion that Karl never really got over as she struggled as a single mother (and occasional pot dealer) in Los Angeles. Skye didn’t meet her famous father until she was 17, in an awkward encounter her book recounts in farcical detail.Father and daughter have since reconciled but she is nervous about him reading the book, in which Donovan’s absence looms large. “I would always be an abandoned daughter, always searching for proof of love,” Skye writes – while explaining how she blew up her first marriage to theBeastie Boysrapper Adam Horovitz (AKA Ad-Rock) by cheating on him repeatedly.View image in fullscreenSkye with John Cusask in the 1989 film Say Anything.Photograph: Allstar/20th Century FoxGrowing up, Skye gravitated towards other daughters of famous fathers, including Karis Jagger, Amelia Fleetwood and the Zappa children. At 15 she quit school and became legally “emancipated”, taking up her first film role oppositeKeanu Reevesin the 1986 teen thriller River’s Edge.Skye always kept detailed personal journals and she has mined the juiciest material for her memoir. Some of her teenage antics read like a gen X schoolgirl’s wildest fantasies: there’s her (ultimately fruitless) pursuit of Reeves, who politely turns her down in his LA apartment one night after filming: “When I reached for his belt buckle, Keanu took my wrist, stopping me.” She canoodles with her good friend River Phoenix, develops a crush on her Say Anything co-star John Cusack (it won’t be consummated until years later), has a fling with theRed Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, then shacks up at 16 with his heroin-addicted bandmate, Anthony Kiedis, eight years her senior.View image in fullscreenWith Anthony Kiedis at the 1989 MTV Video Music awards.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicWhile Skye didn’t consider their age gap problematic at the time, she does now. The self-confessed “helicopter mum” says her “hackles rise” just imagining her 15-year-old daughter, Goldie, in her shoes. She also finds it curious that Kiedis continues to date much younger women. “If someoneneverhas a relationship with a woman their own age, that I do not understand,” she says. Neither Goldie nor Skye’s 23-year-old daughter, Kate, have read Say Everything yet, “but they know about my life,” Skye assures me, “and my destructive way I had sex.”The intense, unprotected sex she had with Kiedis “freaked” her out, as did the rock star’s serial unfaithfulness and jealous rages. She also writes that there was a HIV scare, an abortion Kiedis didn’t accompany her to and many fearful nights driving around LA searching for the singer when he disappeared on drug binges. “The need to save [Anthony] was an addiction in itself,” she writes.Then, at 18, Skye met “the first great love of my life”:Adam Horovitz,a man she describes as “a sweetie pie”. They soon moved in together and, for a while, life was “one long daydream”. The pair tied the knot when Skye was 21, just as the Beastie Boys’ star was rising, pulling Horovitz away on months-long tours. Skye “felt abandoned by his protracted absences”. Alone in LA, she began joyfully – but guiltily – exploring her bisexuality, first with the British model Alice Temple, then with two of Madonna’s exes, Ingrid Casares and Jenny Shimizu. (Strap-on sex with Shimizu, she writes, “made me needy and devoted. I wanted to be her dog, like in that Stooges song.”) Skye’s infidelities became more indiscreet. One day Horovitz arrived home from a tour to find her in flagrante in their back yard pool.Her anguish at hurting Horovitz is still apparent three decades on. “I secretly hope [reading my memoir] helps him and his family but I kind of know their personalities and I almost think it might be doing the opposite, unfortunately,” she says.View image in fullscreenSkye’s brother Dono Leitch, Adam Horovitz and SkyeDespite its promise to say everything, Skye’s memoir ends surprisingly early: in 2006, when she was in the throes of new lust with another “short king”, the Australian singer Ben Lee. They hadmet a decade beforewhen Lee’s band signed to the Beastie Boys’ record label. Skye describes the first time they had sex as “the best sex I’d had since Jenny” – but Lee, who had previously been in a long-term relationship with the actor Claire Danes, felt Skye was coming on too strong. “Whatever you’re feeling, I am not,” he tells her, curtly, after their first night together.‘I just realised at that moment: I want to laugh through life with this person’Read moreSkye and Lee married in 2008 in a Hindu wedding ceremony in India and had Goldie nine months later. “The way you father the girls has practically healed me,” she writes of Lee. Skye has been faithful throughout their marriage – something she felt necessary to include, because “people are going to wonder”.“I don’t feel I’m missing out,” she says. “I think I’m a little more straight than gay but, anyway, all I know is I’m happy and I’m not distracted and looking around.”The fact her memoir speeds over her last two decades with Lee was not due to any demands from him for privacy but because her publisher wanted it to end on “a bit of a cliffhanger”, leaving the door open for a sequel. And anyone craving a closer look at the couple’s life can tune into their weekly podcast,Weirder Together, in which they banter about family life, famous friends and their creative pursuits – from Lee’s music to Skye’s latest film roles.View image in fullscreenIn Sydney the ‘ghosts’ of Skye’s Hollywood past aren’t ‘in my face all the time’, she says.Photograph: Cybele MalinowskiMidway through our conversation, Skye’s megawatt smile lights up. She waves to someone across the courtyard. “Oh, Ben!” she exclaims. “You saw my location!” Lee walks over beaming, trailing the couple’s miniature long-haired dachshund, Gus, who is six months old today. “It’s his half birthday,” Lee coos as Skye scoops up her “baby boy”.Later I ask Skye if Lee’s rigorous touring schedule has ever brought up the same insecurities she felt with Horovitz.“Oh my god, yes!” she says. “When [Ben] would [leave LA and tour Australia] and especially when Goldie was little, I almost would have a full breakdown inside. It triggered so much for me. Luckily at that point I had emotional maturity and I knew to go to therapy and I knew to get help, and to communicate with Ben and other people about my feelings.”View image in fullscreen‘I was just like, “Oh my god, I might lose him”’ … Skye with her husband, musician Ben LeeAnother challenge early in their relationship was Lee’senmeshment in spiritual cults. There was an Indian guru (“I was really trying my hardest to be supportive but it was like having a whole other person [in the relationship],” recalls Skye), then a “more rigid” group involving a Peruvian leader and ayahuasca ceremonies. “That was scary, because I was just like, ‘Oh my god, I might lose him’ … not physically – but losing his mind into something.”There were parallels, Skye says, in trying to extricate Kiedis from heroin addiction and Lee from “fanaticism”. She was relieved when internal ructions in the ayahuasca group finally “snapped” her husband out of it.The couple live in Australia, where their daughters are studying. Sydney’s natural beauty inspires Skye to paint and she likes that the “ghosts” of her Hollywood past aren’t “in my face all the time”.But Hollywood hasn’t moved on just yet. Her friends are having fun imagining who might play Ione in a film adaptation of Say Everything, with Sofia Coppola suggesting the Saltburn actor Alison Oliver. I ponder, half-jokingly, whether the film wouldpass the Bechdel test. “Maybe not,” Skye muses. “Even when I’m in my big lesbian phase, I’m always thinking about Adam [Horovitz].”And nearly 40 years after he turned her down, there is one Hollywood ghost Skye hopes her memoir resurrects. “I would love for Keanu to [read it] and think it’s great,” she says, grinning.Say Everything by Ione Skye is out now in Australia (A$24.99 HarperCollins Australia), the UK (£22.00, HarperCollins) and the US (US$29.99 Simon & Schuster)Explore more on these topicsAutobiography and memoirKeanu ReevesJohn CusackRed Hot Chili PeppersCelebrityBeastie BoysinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Unable to return home, he could only watch helplessly from afar and grieve alone. Later, he tells me that it’s not anger or hate that consumes him now, but survivor’s guilt. “All the time I think: ‘Why? Why am I alive? Why wasn’t I killed with my family?’”The only reason he can think of, he says, is so that he could tell their story to the world.Eight years earlier, Alnaouq had co-founded a platform to help young Palestinians in Gaza write about their lives for an international audience. It began in the aftermath of another airstrike that had claimed the lives of his older brother Ayman and four of his friends during theseven-week Gaza war in the summer of 2014.In my mind, I thought all westerners don’t like the Palestinians. They don’t want to read our stories. I was proved wrong“That incident struck me very, very hard,” he tells me quietly from his office in London. “I sank into a deep depression. I wanted to die. I really, genuinely was waiting for the moment that I die so I can join my brother and just get rid of this life.” Numbly, he watched more deaths being reported in the media – six, eight, 10 more Palestinians killed – with very little sense of the flesh-and-blood people behind the numbers.Then someone he’d met in Gaza a few years earlier, an American journalist and activist named Pam Bailey, messaged Alnaouq on Facebook asking how he was. “I told her: ‘I’m fine’. She said: ‘No, tell me something real. Tell me how you feel after losing your brother.’ So I told her the truth. I told her I’m very, very depressed. I’m spending all my time at my brother’s grave. When I’m all alone, I burst out crying.”In an effort to help him work through his depression and grief, Bailey suggested that Alnaouq write a story about his brother in English. “At first, I said no. My English wasn’t very good.” But eventually he agreed. It took them three months – Alnaouq writing drafts, Bailey sending back detailed edits – to get the story into shape. When it was ready, Bailey published it online.View image in fullscreenAhmed Alnaouq, activist, journalist and co-founder of We Are Not Numbers , photographed at home for the Observer New Review in April 2025.Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer“That changed my life,” says Alnaouq. “For the first time, I received messages of sympathy and support from people outside Gaza. In my mind, I thought that all westerners don’t like the Palestinians. They don’t want to read our stories. But that proved me wrong. It boosted my confidence and made me feel I was wrong when I said there is no hope in this life.”Impressed by the impact of their endeavour, Alnaouq and Bailey had another idea: “Why don’t we replicate this experience for other Palestinians who lost loved ones in Gaza? Why don’t we create a platform where young people can tell their stories in English and share them with the world?”, says Alnaouq. They called the platformWe Are Not Numbers(WANN).We encouraged our young writers to write about the beauty of Gaza. How the people are friendly and hospitable – about all aspects of lifeIt started in 2015 with 20 budding writers – many of them English literature students such as Alnaouq – aided by volunteer mentors from around the world. They wrote of hardship and loss, of feelings of anger and despair and dread in the face of recurring Israeli attacks. They also wrote about the things they loved about their homeland, despite the blockade on Gaza, the scarcity of jobs, the worsening poverty. “We encouraged our young writers to write about the beauty of the place,” says Alnaouq. “About how people in Gaza are friendly and hospitable, about the culture, the mosques, churches and cemeteries – about all aspects of life.” The aim, as well as providing a form of therapy for traumatised young people along with vital connections to the outside world, was to “break the stereotypes” about Gaza for an international audience accustomed to seeing “this dusty, horrible place” on the news.The project took off. “We were amazed by how talented young writers in Gaza were,” says Alnaouq. “Every six months, we would recruit another 20 or 30. We would train them to write and help with their English. Over the past 10 years, we’ve published more than 1,500 stories and poems.” Among their alumni are the award-winning poet Mosab Abu Toha and the Al Jazeera journalist Hind Khoudary.View image in fullscreenA group of young Palestinian writers from We Are Not Numbers, the platform co-created by Ahmed Alnaouq.Photograph: Courtesy of Ahmed AlnaouqNow, Alnaouq and Bailey have collected 74 standout pieces from the past decade in a moving book entitledWe Are Not Numbers: The Voices of Gaza’s Youth(Naomi Klein described it as “a jailbreak and a miracle”; Riz Ahmed found it “impossible to put down or forget”). Each chapter covers a year, with big events refracted through highly personal lenses. In 2015, after the devastation of the previous summer’s war, one writer, Nada Hammad, observes the “canvas of grey” across Gaza slowly giving way to “small splashes of colour” – a wall painted white, graffiti sprouting across temporary housing. “It was a declaration of survival,” Hammad writes, “not a struggle to forget.”Subsequent years bring further violence and disruption, but also efforts to live normally amid the chaos. One writer describes his friend’s attempts to pursue his love of astronomy in a land without readily available telescopes. We hear about the byzantine complexity of online shopping amid the blockade and the dismay of a young woman who relocates from Abu Dhabi with her family only to find sand in the shower water and power cuts lasting 18 hours. Her initial dislike of her parents’ homeland gradually softens into respect for its people who excel in figuring out “how to thrive with very little”.By the time of theHamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, Alnaouq was living in the UK. He had moved over in 2019 on a prestigious Chevening scholarship to do a journalism master’s degree in Leeds. After graduating, he worked at the Palestinian embassy in London. Then he took over from Bailey as WANN’s international director, overseeing the daily running of the organisation. (He also hosts a podcast calledPalestine Deep Diveand travels widely to give talks.)Isabella Hammad: ‘I heard Edward Said speak when I was seven’Read moreOn 22 October 2023, came the Israeli bombardment that killed 21 members of his family.This time, unlike 2014, Alnaouq had a way of communicating his loss with a global audience. “When this bombing happened, I went to social media immediately and started voicing about what happened to my family and I received a lot of media attention.” The response spurred him on to expand WANN’s reach beyond the internet. “We thought: ‘Now is our chance. Not only will we have our stories online but we will put them in a book, so that more people will understand what’s happening.’” Four contributors, including Alnaouq’s brother Mahmoud, have been killed in Gaza since October 2023. “It’s our duty that we make their stories immortal, on paper.”The war hasn’t stopped young people in Gaza from writing about their experiences; if anything, it’s intensified their need to communicate. “Now we publish maybe three times more stories than before,” says Alnaouq. “Most of our writers lost their homes. They lost their laptops. They don’t have electricity or internet connection. But they write their stories on their phones, wait a few days for internet connection and then submit them to us. Every month we publish 35 to 40 stories.”“We’re chronicling history in Gaza, not by facts and statistics and news stories, but by the lived experiences of the people. It’s not a political project: it’s a human project.”We Are Not Numbers: The Voices of Gaza’s YouthbyAhmed Alnaouq and Pam Bailey is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£14.99).

She has a point. Carter, 31, best known asBridgerton’s Prudence Featherington, is 5ft 10 and aquiline, glamorous in a maroon leather coat and silver-studded shoes. Staunton, 69, is barely 5ft tall, quiet and unassuming in slacks and a blouse, short grey hair pinned back.There’s no hint of grandeur to this theatrical dame, who was Oscar-nominated for her performance in Mike Leigh’sVera Drakein 2004, played Dolores Umbridge in theHarry Potterseries from 2007 and was the last iteration of Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix’sThe Crown. Staunton’s stellar stage career in both straight plays and musicals also brought her afifth Olivier awardfor her recent performance inHello, Dolly!at the Palladium. If anything, she seems slightly in awe of her only child with her husband of 41 years, Jim Carter (AKADownton Abbey’s Mr Carson).The week in theatre: Hello, Dolly!; The Hot Wing King; Fangirls – reviewRead more“She’s everything I could never be, this tall, elegant, confident, gorgeous woman,” Staunton says. “I just sit here and think: ‘In God’s name, how did that happen?’” “I’ve got your eyes and dad’s legs,” Bessie comments. (Both women do indeed have piercing blue eyes.) “Fortunately there’s a line in this play about how you can’t tell that the characters are mother and daughter, because you wouldn’t really pick us out in a crowd [as related]. But it’s always been a life dream of mine to work together.”The dread term “nepo baby” hangs in the air for a moment before Staunton exorcises it. “Surgeons’ children become surgeons,” she says. “Should they be penalised because their parents have done the job before them?” Bessie says the acting profession was demystified for her as a child: their West Hampstead home was frequently visited by the likes of Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson, with whom Staunton appeared in the 1992 comedyPeter’s Friends. Also she observed her parents as jobbing actors beforeVera Drake, and thenHarry PotterandDownton, kicked them into a different league of celebrity.Acting, when she was at school, “was all about fun and dressing up, and being able to carry that on as a grownup seemed like the biggest privilege. But I didn’t want any handouts,” she says. “One of my biggest things is that I got into the National YouthTheatreand then Guildhall [School of Music and Drama] without them knowing who my parents were. Of course, if this were my first gig out of drama school it’d be very different.”Staunton says that for her and Carter, it would only have been a difficult decision to let their daughter act if they didn’t believe she could make a success of it: “That would have been hard, because you’ve got to be honest in those situations. But she was fine, and she’s had to make her own way. We didn’t want her to be handed into the business by us because that wouldn’t have shown any respect.”View image in fullscreenImelda Staunton, centre, takes a curtain call for Hello, Dolly! at the Palladium in London with, from left, Tyrone Huntley, Andy Nyman and Jenna Russell.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesAfter parts inCranford,Doc Martin,Howards EndandBeecham House, Bessie landed the role of Prudence, the snooty and sexually unfulfilled older sister of Nicola Coughlan’s Penelope Featherington, AKA Lady Whistledown, inBridgertonin 2020. It’s hard to recall now what a boon that show’s blend of costume drama, ethnic inclusivity and unbridled rumpy-pumpy proved during lockdown. “It gave everyone a hopeful escapism, which we needed so badly at the time,” recalls Bessie. “And I got one of the few funny, awkward sex scenes in it, which I thought was really important, because not all sex is steamy and romantic.”Being in a long-running TV series was a great technical education, comparable in its way to the six years her mother spent in repertory theatre after leaving Rada in 1976 (though Bessie concedes she had a head start in TV, “because I grew up visiting film sets and knew what a first AD did, what a runner and a dresser did”). She proved her stage acting ability in the pivotal role of Fenny in Dodie Smith’sDear Octopusat the National last year and will soon be seen inOutrageous, the forthcoming drama about the aristocratic Mitford sisters, who remain a source of perennial fascination to biographers and producers. She’ll play writer Nancy alongside Joanna Vanderham as fascist sympathiser Diana, with Anna Chancellor as their mother, Sydney.“I know a weird amount about Nancy Mitford,” Bessie says. “I narrated the audiobook of her novelThe Pursuit of Lovea few years ago; she worked in St Mary’s hospital in Paddington, where I was born, and she went to Francis Holland School, which I dipped my toes into for a few years. It’s my first lead role. It’s a brilliant script by Sarah Williams, and it’s a story about six women, all of them totally unique and all of them raised under the same roof. I originally said quite vehemently to my agent that I didn’t want to do another period drama, but he said: ‘I don’t think you’re going to want to say no to this one … ’”Similarly, Bessie characterisesMrs Warren’s Professionas “a play with two women at the helm in a masculine world – which unfortunately we still do live in – and them not wanting to play by the rules”. In Shaw’s 1893 play, Mrs Warren’s Cambridge-educated daughter Vivie discovers that her mother is a sex worker turned madame, setting up a debate where sex, marriage and commerce intersect. “Basically it’s about capitalism and it could have been written in the last two years,” Bessie adds. “It asks how much longer can we all look away before we have to turn and face what’s really going on in the underbelly of the world?”View image in fullscreenBessie Carter, centre, with Harriet Cains and Nicola Coughlan in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixThe genesis of the show came when Staunton was discussing potential projects with director Dominic Cooke, a trusted collaborator. They’d never worked on a play before but a musical wasn’t an option because, as she says without vanity, “I’ve done all the big ones”. She graduated from the chorus ofGuys and Dollsin the National’s groundbreaking production in 1982 – where she and Jim Carter met on the first day of rehearsals – to play Miss Adelaide in the 1996 revival.Thereafter, she steadily knocked off Stephen Sondheim’s major works withSweeney Todd(2012),Gypsy(2014) andFollies(2017). Cooke, who directed her inFollies, finally persuaded her to do Jerry Herman and Michael Stewart’s light 1964 tale of a turn-of-the century matchmaker,Hello, Dolly!, which she initially dismissed as “sugary”.Staunton had reservations aboutMrs Warren’s Profession, too, having played the role of Vivie during her rep days. “I think at that time I didn’t know what it was about,” she says. “Dominic said read it again. I did and realised that the combination of Dominic – knowing the care he takes – and myself and Bessie might be something interesting.”Acting with her daughter will be another first: “The CrownandHarry Potter, they’re two firsts because there’d never been seven books made into eight films [with the same central cast]. And never on television had you had one long story with three casts playing the same characters.”The Crownwas a particular challenge as – following on from Claire Foy and Olivia Colman – she was playing the version of the queen that contemporary viewers knew best.“That body, that shape, that hair…” she says. “Plus I think it was hard for audiences to accept a new queen if they’d been fond of the previous one.” Bessie chips in: “I found that really exciting as an audience member, seeing the new version.” It was, we agree, like getting a new James Bond, except that the queen was allowed to age.Appearing in a straight play afterHello, Dolly!is something of a relief for Staunton. “It’s odd for me to be in a room where we’re not choreographing, but it’s great because I don’t have to worry about my voice or all that technical side of it,” she says. She and her daughter ran lines together before rehearsals started, either in the family home or at Bessie’s flat in Brixton. “If we’d done that in the first day of rehearsal, looking into each other’s eyes, pretending to be another person, that would have been weird,” she says. “What we have no idea of is what it will be like for an audience watching a mother and daughter playing a mother and daughter. We will be doing things that we have no idea we’re doing just because we are genetically connected.”View image in fullscreenImelda Staunton with Bessie and Jim Carter after being made a dame at Windsor Castle in 2024.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesBoth Staunton and Jim Carter were in BBC One’sCranfordwhen a teenage Bessie won a part in it as a maid in 2007-8, but none of them shared scenes together. And Staunton and her husband haven’t acted opposite each other since that fateful meeting inGuys and Dolls. In the past she’s said they avoided working together “so you bring home different things”. They have also famously rarely spent more than two weeks apart for work. Couldn’t she and Bessie have found a part for him in the Shaw play? “Wouldn’t happen,” grimaces Staunton. “Try as you might, he’s had it with theatre. He’d rather be in the garden.” Bessie adds: “He’d better bloody come and see it, though.”At this point it’s probably worth mentioning that Yorkshire-born Carter dropped out of a law degree at the University of Sussex to join a theatre group called the Brighton Combination in 1968, which put him in early plays by Howard Brenton, but also required him to learn circus skills. “He doesn’t unicycle any more, but he can still juggle and he’s still got all his magic gear,” says Staunton. “He still pulls out a card trick or a coin trick now and again,” Bessie adds. In the early years of their marriage, Carter was a more visible face on film and TV than Staunton. I tell her how fondly I remember his role as a French resistance fighter called Déjà Vu (“Haven’t I seen you somewhere before, m’sieu?”) opposite thelate Val Kilmerin the Zucker brothers’ 1984 war spoofTop Secret!. “Jim’s first screen kiss was with Val Kilmer,” she says with a rueful smile.Everyone always goes, ‘Oh, God, you don’t want to date an actor.’ And I say, but my parents are totally happy and they’re both working actorsTalk turns briefly to mortality. Alan Rickman, who died in 2016, was one of Staunton’s contemporaries at Rada and preceded her in theHarry Potterfranchise as Severus Snape. “We weren’t close friends but I miss his presence and his kindness,” she says. “Once 15 of us went to see a show with him and we ended up at [theatre hangout] Joe Allen’s. It was long before I was inHarry Potterbut he must have started in it because at the end he just got the bill and said” – here she does a terrific impersonation of Rickman’s bone-dry drawl – “Harry Potter’s paying.” Bessie, delighted, says that Anna Chancellor recounted a similar story about Rickman during the filming ofOutrageous.A larger absence in Staunton’s life is Stephen Sondheim,who died aged 91in 2021. “He was a great champion of me but he loved all his stars,” she recalls. “The great thing about him is he would never say: ‘When Patti [LuPone, his Broadway muse] did this part…’ He would just be in the now and you were the best one on that day. After we didSweeney Toddin 2012 he insisted I should play Mama Rose inGypsyin London, but I wasn’t famous enough then, and apparently neither was he, which seems inconceivable.”Gypsydid happen at Chichester in 2014 and duly became a smash hit in London. When he died, Bessie gave Staunton a framed photo of Sondheim sitting in their West Hampstead kitchen during rehearsals forSweeney Todd.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Phil Fisk/The ObserverAt the Olivier awards Staunton paid tribute to her late Irish Catholic mother while accepting the award for best actress in a musical forHello, Dolly!. “If I may say something to my late mum, whose name was Bridie McNicholas,” she said. “Great name, must renew [my] Irish passport. Mum, I’m here at the Albert Hall, I’ve got a prize, but more importantly, I’m about to do a play with your granddaughter. I wish you were here.”Bridie, a talented singer and musician who ran a hairdressing salon, and her construction worker husband, Joe, emigrated to Archway in north London from County Mayo in the 1950s.Bridie and Joe split up when Staunton was in her late teens but got on well even when they found new partners. Bridie died in 2004, a week before Staunton received news of her Oscar nomination. Carter and Bessie accompanied Staunton to that Oscars ceremony, and they took ham salad sandwiches to eat in the limo on the way. “We’ve got our packed lunches for rehearsal today,” says Staunton matter-of-factly. “You’ve got to besustained.”Joe died in 2010. I wonder how he and Bridie would have felt about their daughter being made a dame by King Charles in 2024. “I don’t think they’d have believed it but they’d have been extremely proud,” says Staunton. Bessie says: “We toasted them on the day.” Has ennoblement changed her mother, I ask Bessie. “Yeah, dad and I have to bow to her now,” she grins.Those we lost in 2021: Stephen Sondheim remembered by Imelda StauntonRead moreWhat’s the secret of a long marriage? I ask Staunton. “I don’t think there’s one secret but respect, kindness and humour are the secret to ours,” she says. Bessie is now single, having split with herBridgertonco-star Sam Phillips. “Everyone always goes, ‘Oh, God, you don’t want to date an actor.’ And I say, but my parents are totally happy and they’re both working actors.”They’ve given her a romantic and a professional pattern for life, proving it’s possible to move between film, TV, stage drama and musicals. Bessie lets slip she’s been having singing lessons: “I’d love to be inGuys and Dolls, genuinely.” Would she want to play Miss Adelaide, her mum’s old role and the more comic part, or Sarah Brown, the missionary who gets the romantic songs?“Adelaide, because I like the funny,” she says.“Do both,” says Staunton.Mrs Warren’s Professionis at the Garrick theatre, London, 10 May to 16 AugustExplore more on these topicsImelda StauntonThe ObserverTheatreGeorge Bernard ShawMusicalsTelevisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Collaborating with the Rolling Stones in the early 1980s, he later opened a recording studio at his home in the Jamaican countryside, helping a younger generation of artists to come to prominence, including his daughter Xana and son Azizi.Born Maxwell Smith in 1944 in Alexandria, a hillside hamlet below Browns Town in northern Jamaica, he moved to Kingston at 10 years old to live with his father following his mother’s emigration, but clashed with his stepmother and absconded; moving between the disparate homes of extended family members, he was partly raised by strangers after enduring periods of homelessness. In the rocksteady era he began working as a record salesman for Ken Lack’s Caltone label and made his first set of recordings for the label fronting the Emotions harmony trio, the love song I’ll Buy You a Rainbow reaching the Jamaican Top 10 in March 1967.View image in fullscreenMax Romeo performs in Chicago, Illinois, August 1981.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesHis determined courtship of a local girl earned him the nickname Romeo and after the Emotions disbanded, he got his first taste of international fame through the ribald Wet Dream, produced by Bunny Lee, which hit the UK Top 10 in November 1969, despite a BBC ban for its suggestive lyrics. The saucy hit brought Romeo to London for his first overseas performances, including at the Caribbean Music Festival held at the Empire Pool with Desmond Dekker and Johnny Nash, the bulk of Romeo’s innuendo-laden debut album A Dream recorded in London with the Rudies backing band.Back in Jamaica, Romeo began focusing on social commentary, sometimes setting his lyrics to adapted folk songs or spirituals. Macabee Version referenced his newfound Rastafari faith and Black Equality attacked the Eurocentric mindset of postcolonial Jamaica; Chi Chi Bud used coded metaphors to decry the island’s pervasive inequalities. Appearing on the bandwagons that helped bring Michael Manley of the leftist People’s National party to power in 1972, Romeo recorded songs like Let the Power Fall and Press Along Joshua to signal his support for Manley’s vision, but when change was slow to come after Manley took office, Romeo responded with the critical No Joshua No.After working on the Revelation Time album with arranger Geoffrey Chung atLee “Scratch” Perry’s Black Ark studio in 1975, Romeo began working more concertedly with Perry, the single War Ina Babylon attracting Chris Blackwell’s interest; the resultant album of the same name was released by Island Records overseas, introducing Romeo to a broader international audience. The follow-up, Reconstruction, was self-produced, with the censorious Melt Away its most outstanding number, but the album was rapidly deleted after financial disputes and the momentum further interrupted when Romeo moved to New York to star in a musical called Reggae, which flopped at the box office. He was an uncredited backing vocalist on the Rolling Stones’ album Emotional Rescue in 1980 and Keith Richards subsequently appeared on Romeo’s Holding Out My Love To You, a crossover attempt that broadened his fanbase in Japan, but failed to ignite in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

It was a fallow period for each of them and the meeting sparked a new determination to get back on track. Romeo abandoned the courier service he had run in New York for several years to make ends meet and returned to Jamaica shortly before the sensational success of the Prodigy’s Out Of Space, which sampled Chase the Devil, sparking renewed interest in his work; a decade later, Kanye West mined Chase the Devil for Jay Z’s Lucifer, cementing Romeo’s original in the global consciousness. In the interim, albums for Jah Shaka, Mafia & Fluxy and Mad Professor made him a regular on festival stages throughout Europe and North America; the studio he opened at his home in Treadways, near Linstead, enabled his children to launch their own musical careers.Max Romeo undertook his final tour in 2023, performing in 56 cities throughout Britian and Europe, shortly after he filed a $15m lawsuit against Universal Music Group and Polygram Publishing for unpaid royalties (the companies later sought to have it dismissed). I remember Max as pragmatic, politically engaged and open minded, a thoughtful person with a strong sense of humour whose obvious intelligence and drive belied a lack of formal education. He is survived by his wife, Charm, and several children.Explore more on these topicsReggaeJamaicaLee 'Scratch' PerryDance musiccommentShareReuse this content"

It’s with Garland that he’s now co-written and co-directed the filmWarfare, a claustrophobically immersive account of an ill-fated surveillance mission that he survived in Ramadi province, Iraq, in 2006. Two men, among them Mendoza’s best friend, sniper and medic Elliott Miller, were badly injured by al-Qaida insurgents, and the attack intensified as the Seals sought to evacuate their wounded. The film, described in theNew Yorkeras “a work of hyper-exacting realism”, opens in the UK on 18 April.How do you feel about war films in general?I feel not seen. It’s actually embarrassing to watch them – they don’t get our culture right, we don’t speak that way. People have asked, are you worried thatWarfaremay trigger veterans and active-duty military? I think it does the opposite. It’s saying, you’re not forgotten, you are seen. Oftentimes, what is more triggering is seeing what we go through not accurately represented.Did you have any concerns about telling a story rooted in personal trauma?I knew I had to be responsible. The biggest fear was always somebody getting hold of it and changing it through creative licence or because it doesn’t fit into the traditional Hollywood grammar of moviemaking, but I had no reservations once I got to know Alex.The two of you agreed that you wouldn’t embellish or dramatise the story. How did that work?We interviewed as many of the guys as we could and took a detective-like approach to slotting everyone’s memories together. Forensic is a word we’ve been using a lot. We wanted to make a really honest film, so if it didn’t exist in someone’s memory, it did not go into the story. Memories were our bumpers.I walked off set, I cried, then I came back and Alex had to take the reins for the rest of the dayThis all happened almost 20 years ago. Did you and the others talk about it much at the time?No. We each had our own perspective, but we didn’t take the time to slot them all together because we were operating again two days later.Has makingWarfarebeen therapeutic?Writing with Alex was more like going to a therapist every day than going to a writing session. Obviously he’s a great writer but he’s also a great listener. Diving into the details and the more emotional components, some of the questions he’s asked me have been far more intelligent than [those asked by] some therapists I have spoken to. It’s comforting because you feel heard and you feel understood.Were there any difficult moments during filming?Having my director hat on allowed me to detach myself emotionally most of the time but there was one particular take of the scene where the IED goes off and D’Pharaoh [D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, who plays Mendoza] starts to drag Cosmo [Cosmo Jarvis, playing Miller] up the driveway. Elliott was there with me on set. The light was right, the smoke was right, the energy was right, and it struck a chord – a lot of emotions that were down there started to manifest themselves. I had to call cut. I walked off set, I cried, then I came back and Alex had to take the reins for the rest of the day.View image in fullscreenWill Poulter, left, and D’Pharaoh Woon-a-Tai in a scene from Warfare.Photograph: Murray Close/APThe actor playing you cries. Was it important to show that?Yes, because it happened. I think I’d have had a reaction no matter who it was, but being that it was my best friend, it stopped me in my tracks. I thought he was dead, I didn’t want to believe it was him, but I quickly snapped back into reality.The film’s soundscape is very powerful. When it’s loud, it’s explosively loud, but there are also some incredibly tense moments of stillness.I wanted to bring out this heightened sense. Even when there’s nothing happening, you know something is about to happen, so you’re on the defence. You can hear your hand scratching your hair or a pen on paper, so although it’s quiet, it’s loud.I hear you put the cast through a three-week boot camp before filming started.I gave Will [Will Poulter, who plays the officer in charge of the operation] a lot of autonomy and ownership, and I said, these are your guys, they’re not mine. Cherish the ride because you’re going to experience something that most actors do not get to experience. The goal was to put them in positions where they rely on each other, then I injected stressors – gave them tasks that I knew they couldn’t complete, gave them time lines I knew they couldn’t make. It was very kinetic, very fast-paced, with long days and no time to go back to the trailers.Was the food superior on set?Fridays were good – there’d be something fun like an ice-cream truck.It’s been argued that war films inevitably wind up glorifying conflict. How doesWarfarefeed into that debate?It isn’t meant to fit into some political box. There’s not a lot of narrative for a reason: it’s for you to fill in the blanks. There’s no score for a reason: adding music, I can lead you to believe what I want you to believe or I can make you feel what I want you to feel – sad, angry, and so on. But if you watch this and say I think war is a good thing, then you should reassess how you view things.Were you ever afraid as a Seal?No. If somebody is drafted, and they get thrown into combat, typically the outcome is not optimal, but it was what I signed up to do, so I’d been mentally prepared. It doesn’t mean I’m not impervious to trauma, it just means it’s less of a shock.Watch a trailer for Warfare.Did you write at all while serving?No, I was way too busy. In this cool, cryptic way, a lot of what I’ve seen that has stuck with me is in things like firefights that I’ve choreographed for movies, commercials, video games … they’re kind of like a living journal that only I know about.Could you ever have imagined you’d wind up in Hollywood?No, but it’s very similar structurally, in that you have multiple departments working together to achieve something. There was a lot of concern about our shooting schedule forWarfarebut we did it. When everybody was on the same page, we were extremely efficient, and I now use this as a template for how much we can film.What’s next for you as a writer?There are a few things I’m developing, about what happens after warfare.Warfarein is UK and Irish cinemas from 18 AprilExplore more on these topicsWar filmsObserver New Review Q&AAlex GarlandFilm industryDrama filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The one he chose as his model stood inthe gardens of the imperial palace and had been built for King Sunjo in 1878.“My father was a painter who had modernised Korean art,” says Suh, “but, as the country was rapidly moving towards westernisation, he became obsessed with the idea that he could live like a scholar from an older time. For him, it was a way to preserve certain traditional virtues and practices that were fast disappearing.”For several years, his father, Suh Se-ok, collected salvaged timbers from traditional buildings that had been dismantled. He also tracked down a small group of traditional artisans who possessed the knowledge and skills to construct the house according to age-old principles and techniques. “One of them was an old master carpenter, who had actually built several houses in the palace complex,” Suh tells me. “When my father contacted him, he had a job repairing people’s doors.”Suh visited the construction site almost daily as the house slowly took shape over six years. “It was like my playground,” he says, smiling. More vivid still is his memory of the day that he went with his father to the original house in the palace gardens, where the master carpenter made measurements for the design of the new one. “What was truly astonishing was that he only made two,” Suh tells me, still sounding awed. “I don’t know how he did it, but he was able to calculate all the other dimensions in his head from those two measurements. Then, when it finally came to the actual day that the structure was erected, everything fitted together perfectly.”If our formative experiences shape our lives, Suh’s creative trajectory must surely be rooted in his childhood sense of wonder as he watched the slow, meticulous construction of the building that would become his family home, its walls, roof and rooms replicating the interiors and dimensions of the royalhanokthat had been built 100 years earlier.View image in fullscreenDo Ho Suh in his London studio.Photograph: Amit Lennon/The ObserverHaving leftSouth Koreafor New York in 1991, Suh has since become an internationally renowned artist whose primary subject is home – a place and a state of mind that he explores in drawings, sculptures and video pieces, but most hauntingly in the creation of shimmering fabric architectural reconstructions of the houses he has lived in over the years in Seoul, New York and London.“You find the everyday and the universal in Suh’s art, in his enduring consideration of home, both as a physical space and as something lived,” says his London gallerist, Victoria Miro. “His works can be ephemeral, but they are underpinned by profound thought. They come from places imbued with personal meaning and allow us all to connect with ideas of home and life as a journey.”Made from semi-transparent nylon mesh, Suh’s lifesize collapsible structures were patiently stitched together with the help of traditional seamstresses recruited by his mother, Min-za Chung. The results are both meticulous in their replicated detail – door knobs, light switches, even the faint traces of marks left by nails and screws – and otherworldly in their almost ghostly translucence and muted colours. Fragile and semi-transparent, they speak of belonging, displacement, identity, longing and embedded memories.“For me, memory is central to what I do,” Suh says. “We bring our memories with us when we move and my memories inhabit the architectural pieces that I create, which are physical, but also psychological and metaphorical. What I bring is a skin, the thin skin of the bigger physical thing. The idea to use the semi-translucent fabric came about when I was trying to find a way to realise the intangible quality of memory. The material is fragile like our memories and it also has that haziness that many people associate with the past.”In a few weeks’ time, an installation of Suh’s work will occupy Tate Modern’s concourse, a challenge that, as we speak, is occupying a lot of his thinking time. “It’s odd to put them all in a white cube because many are site-specific,” he says. “And around 70% of the pieces are new, so it’s not really accurate to call it a survey show. In a way, this exhibition is more about how I want to show the work, rather than what work I want to show.”The exhibition title is Walk the House, a reference to an old and now seldom-used Korean colloquialism. “It’s something I heard the old master carpenter say many times and it has stayed in my consciousness,” Suh says. “It refers to the practice of taking your house with you when you move to another location. Old traditional Korean houses were built using interlocking dovetail joints – no nails or screws – so, if needed, they could be disassembled, transported and then reassembled somewhere else by ordinary people.”We are chatting across a long table in the middle of Suh’s spacious studio in north-east London. Around us, pinned to the wall, are a selection of large drawings: surreally elongated figures, a spiralling cluster of human skulls and repeated rows of curving lines in black, red and blue ink. On a long white bench that runs the length of another wall, flat boxes of crayons, pencils, pens and charcoals are arranged neatly. There is a calmness to the space, and to him, his responses thoughtful and carefully worded.Suh has lived in London for several years now, but one senses he could be at home anywhere. “I guess so,” he says, “but I have an emotional attachment to certain places that I have lived in and left. My work is a way to somehow deal with these departures.”View image in fullscreenDo Ho Suh, Perfect Home, 2024 (Detail).Photograph: Courtesy of the artist. © Do Ho SuhWhen I ask if he considers himself an exile, he looks momentarily uncomfortable. “My decision to leave Korea was voluntary, not forced,” he says, firmly, referring to the predominantly political resonance the term has assumed of late. “I have witnessed a situation where people were forcibly displaced in Korea during the process of redevelopment in the 1960s and 70s. That experience is also a part of my practice, though it is not obviously apparent in my work.”Nevertheless, the experience of exile, the sense of not entirely belonging elsewhere, and the attendant longing for the place one has left seems central to the sense of hauntedness that hovers in and around his eerily empty fabric spaces as one walks through them. “Really, what happened is that the concept of home only started to exist for me when I left Korea,” he says. “When I was living there, I didn’t think about it at all. ”Now 62, Suh left Korea in 1991, when he was 29, his decision partially driven, he has said, by a desire to escape his famous father’s shadow. Having attained a degree and a master’s in painting at Seoul National University, he found his qualifications were not recognised in America, so he duly undertook a second degree course in painting at Rhode Island School of Design, before graduating from Yale with a master of fine arts in sculpture in 1997.He describes his move from painting to sculpture as “totally organic”, the idea to do so having already been planted before he left Korea. Having grown up in the 60s and 70s “watching Disney every day” and absorbing American pop music on TV and radio stations that broadcast to American GIs stationed in Korea, he did not experience culture shock, but a more subtly unsettling feeling. “In Korea, language is so transparent, but when you are speaking another language it becomes somehow more physicalandopaque. I was constantly dealing with that as well as the small differences in everyday objects – the placement of door knobs, the height of ceilings.”In Korea, Suh was required to undertake two years of compulsory military service, an experience that underpinned a later sculptural work,Some/One(2001) – his titles often playfully deconstruct English words and phrases. Made from 100,000 stainless steel military dog tags, it appears at first glance to be a cross between an ancient suit of armour and a ceremonial robe, albeit one that extends outwards across the floor, its hollow, mirrored interior reflecting the viewer standing before it. I ask him if his experience of compulsory military service has left a deep mark on him, as his art sometimes suggests. “Maybe,” he says, after another thoughtful pause, “but, at the time, it just seemed like an extension of high school, which was very strict and disciplined.”View image in fullscreenDetail from Nest/s, which is inspired by domestic spaces around the world.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Lehmann Maupin New York, Seoul and London. Photography by Jeon Taeg Su. © Do Ho SuhIn New York, Suh also began exploring the essential difference between American and Korean society, the one often brutally individualistic, the other driven by an ideological adherence to a collective nationalist identity. Several of his earlier pieces explore this cultural dichotomy, including the intriguingly titledWho Am We?(2000), which is essentially a gallery wallpaper comprised of thousands of tiny scanned portraits taken from Korean school yearbooks stretching back three decades.“The tightness of the portraits is important,” he says. “I reduced the size so that people’s individuality began to blend, but you could still see the differences. In a way, I was challenging people’s ability to see these differences, especially when it comes to Asian people. In America, I would hear certain comments all the time – ‘Oh, you all look alike’. So there is an interesting tension in the work, which, at first glance, shows all these similar short crew cuts and black uniforms, but when you go in close of course everyone is different.”In 1998, Suh createdPublic Figures, a site-specific sculptural piece for a public park in Brooklyn in which several hundred small resin figures support a monolithic concrete plinth. (His original proposal, rejected on health and safety grounds, was to have it move an inch every day until it traversed the site. The moving version will be installed at Tate Modern.)A sly subversion of the traditional state-sponsored memorial monument or statue,Public Figuresaddresses the stoicism of anonymous collective endeavour. For another related site-specific piece,Floor(1997-2000),he raised the floor of a gallery by having 180,000 small resin figures hold aloft a glass surface that visitors walked over. In both, the faces of the figures are oddly expressionless, neither defiant nor downtrodden. “I’m glad that you pay attention to the expressions,” he says cheerily. “I wanted to make them as neutral as possible, not dramatic in any way. In many cases in our lives, the burden exists, but you don’t really feel it, and you cannot do anything about it.”View image in fullscreenHaunting Home (2023).Photograph: Courtesy of the artist, Lehmann Maupin, New York, Seoul and London, and Singapore Tyler Print Institute. © Do Ho SuhSuh attended college in South Korea at a time of political upheaval, with anti-government riots on many college campuses, including the one he attended. When I ask him if he considers himself in any way a political artist, he replies: “My generation went through very turbulent times – teargas and rioting all the time. It was impossible not to be political because everything was political. When people say that my work comes from a very deeply personal place, I am surprised because I don’t think such a place exists. Even the very personal is political.”He pauses for a long moment. “My work is not loud. I am not trying to put across a message, but underneath I think there is quite a radical attitude towards the world. The idea of making a mobile architectural space from an immobile one is a very radical idea, but visually it is quite subtle, and there is beauty and colour and craft, all of which maybe distract people from the underlying politics.”For me, Suh’s most resonant work is his most personal: the floating fabric houses, rooms, staircases and passageways he recreates, denuding them of their solidity and, in the process, creating these liminal spaces that echo through our own memories and daydreams. He has created two new fabric pieces for the exhibition:Nest/s (2024) which comprises various domestic spaces from around the world that have been configured into a single space, andPerfect Home: London, Horsham, New York, Berlin, Providence, Seoul (2024), a reimagining of his current home in London containing fixtures and fittings from other spaces he has lived in. “I think of time and place as inseparable,” he says, by way of elucidation. “It is the entanglement of the two that is important for me. One space can often carry the memory of other spaces.”In his celebrated bookThe Poetics of Space, the French thinker Gaston Bachelard noted how the buildings we have lived in, particularly during childhood, contained cellars, nooks and corridors where many of our most enduring memories are housed. “All our lives,” he wrote, “we come back to them in our daydreams.”For Suh, his created spaces are both memory palaces and dream spaces, but also meticulously crafted homages to the transient homes that have left an imprint on him. In some instances, too, though, he has left a literal imprint on them. In 2016, he finished an epic and intimate undertaking called the Rubbing/Loving Project, its oddly erotic title evoking another way that he has chosen to memorialise places in his life, including the apartment in New York in which he had lived for 20 years. Having covered the walls of each room in paper, Suh and his team of assistants began rubbing on the paper covering with coloured pencils, eventually creating a composite – and ghostly – imprint of the apartment.“It was empty, as it was waiting to be sold,” he says, “so I was literally living inside my project. I had chosen to do the blue room, which had been my bedroom. It was a very intense and laborious experience, so much that I lost my fingerprints through so much rubbing. My cells and skin were embedded in the paper.”Do Ho Suh: Tracing Time review – an extraordinarily beautiful search for homeRead moreAs he rubbed, he says, he started to recall his time there: the traces of holes he had made in the walls reminded him of the time he screwed in a coat rack, but also his visit to the hardware shop to buy it, and even how warm that particular day had been. Other memories came flooding back, including conversations he had had with his landlord, who had lived there for three decades. “I was transported,” he says, quietly, “and at one point I started to almost hallucinate because I remembered the conversations so vividly.”He began thinking, too, of all the others who had lived in the house, which was originally a dormitory for German sailors, and of the traces they had left that had been erased by time. Strange things began to happen: footsteps on the floor above and a metal door at the top of a staircase that would suddenly open. “Some might call it ghosts, some might call it embedded memories,” he says, “but so many people lived there, it felt like they had all left some elements, some traces there that were still lingering around.”It strikes me that these traces and intimations, real and imagined, inform his work in the most subliminal way. “I am trying to show that the memories of these places never leave you,” he says, echoing Bachelard. “They stay with you when you go. So, in a way, these homes have been haunting me.” Transformed into his translucent architectural structures, they haunt us too.Do Ho Suh: Walk the House is at Tate Modern from 1 May to 19 OctoberAt one point I started to almost hallucinate because I remembered the conversations so vividlyDo Ho SuhExplore more on these topicsArtThe ObserverTate ModernSouth KoreaSculptureAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some viewers thought it was a documentary, while others argued its harrowing depiction of post-apocalypticSheffieldshould not have been aired at all.View image in fullscreenA scene from Threads. Warp Films is developing an episodic TV drama based on the 1984 film.Photograph: Bbc/SportsPhoto/AllstarHowever, Mark Herbert, Warp’s chief executive, who grew up near South Yorkshire city and remembers the impact Threads had on the country, said he hoped the remake would highlight “the best of humanity and the worst of humanity” – which he regarded as another contemporary talking point.“I was born in Doncaster,” he said. “I grew up in a mining community, and Sheffield was about 15 miles away. I was 14, and I remember walking into school and everybody had seen it. People thought it was real. It had this real public-safety film vibe to it. They had budget limitations, so they had to use real public service and news footage.“It’s a different time now – we’re 40 years on – but it feels like the time is right for it. There’s also a bit of what people have brought up about our previous work, likeThis is England. Even the darkest stuff, it’s got a huge heart to it. And I think there is a huge heart in Threads that we can explore. It feels like enough time has passed that we can take that original and do something a bit bold, original and fresh with it.”It is early days for the project. No writer, director or cast have been signed up or announced. But the Warp team believe Threads provides echoes of Adolescence, in the story’s ability to display authenticity and heart in the most desolate of situations.With increasing concerns thatBritish stories may be squeezed outof TV drama as broadcasters search for hits that work worldwide, the Warp team also believe Threads can be another project set in a British city capable of drawing global audiences.“The way the original film was written and made, it absolutely had that voice of Sheffield,” Feller said. “And I think that’s the kind of place, again, where you find that very rounded heart to the storytelling.”There is no doubt taking on the project is a challenge. Jackson, who also produced the original film, said he suspected Threads was not enjoyable for most viewers – and should not have aimed to be. “I feel very strongly that it shouldn’t be entertaining,” he said. “To use something as important as nuclear war as a vehicle for entertainment is quite, quite wrong.”Herbert said projects focusing on realistic characters in a recognisable urban setting would attract and challenge viewers. “It’s that authenticity,” he said. “It really has to come from the page, from the characters. It’s a bit like my favourite gangster series,Gommorah, which is so specifically Naples. Yet it’s just mind-blowing – and then has characters that are different.“I’m quite attracted to slightly outsider stories.

No physical altercation took place, according to the PA news agency.Rourke had received a formal warning fromBig Brotherearlier in the week for “unacceptable language and behaviour” directed at another housemate, JoJo Siwa.The 21-year-old US singer accused Rourke of being homophobic after he made comments about her sexuality and said he would “vote the lesbian out real quick”.JoJo Siwa.The Oscar-nominated actor had also asked Siwa if she “likes girls or boys”, and when she replied that she liked girls and her partner was non-binary, he said: “If I stay longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more.”She responded: “I can guarantee I’ll still be gay and I’ll still be in a very happy relationship.”Hughes, who has presented sports coverage for the BBC and ITV, told Rourke “you can’t say that” after theformer boxersaid he needed “a fag” and gestured to Siwa to add: “I’m not talking to you.”Hughes, 32, comforted Siwa in Wednesday’s episode after the comments.In the diary room, Rourke was given a formal warning and Big Brother said: “Further language or behaviour of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.”Rourke then apologised to Siwa, saying: “I want to apologise.

On 22 July 2011, Norwegian neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb outside the office of the then prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, killing eight people and damaging surrounding buildings, before murdering a further 69 people on the nearby island of Utøya.But now the same site is to be reconfigured by hope. Last week, after a multi-round, three-year-long selection process, a jury of curators, politicians, artists and representatives of the victims and survivors of the attacks announced the winning design for a new Norwegian national memorial to be unveiled in time for the 15th anniversary in 2026.Norwegian artist Matias Faldbakken’s mosaic Upholding, 12 metres high and 15 metres wide, and made of some 500,000 stones, shows a wading bird native to Utøya reflected in the lake. It is a monumental piece that touches on both societal support and nature.And a mosaic, Faldbakken argues, is the perfect symbol for a memorial site. “A fragmented image, every part plays its role. In old literature, it’s called painting for eternity. A mosaic is one of the only image formats that survives fire, earthquakes and floods.”The mosaic will be braced by a steel rig similar to the one that once secured Pablo Picasso’s mural The Fishermen on one of the blast-damaged blocks in the quarter. Faldbakken, who representedNorwayat the Venice Biennale in 2005, explains that he was initially inspired by walking past the rig holding Picasso’s work, which stood in the Government Quarter for almost three years.View image in fullscreen‘I took my artist’s ego out of the equation’ … Matias FaldbakkenPhotograph: Vegard KlevenBut the main purpose of the monument is not to reference the work of another artist but to serve as “a window to the other crime site”, explains Faldbakken. After triggering the Oslo blast, Breivik travelled to the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, a lake 40km northwest of Olso, where he attacked a summer camp for the Labour party’s youth wing (AUF). Most of the 69 victims were teenagers.“I was out on the island many times,” Faldbakken says. “I started to research the birds. And this small wader had a lot of physical traits that I thought worked: a very small, fragile and light bird with its thin legs. But it has this angle to it. It has a gaze. It pushes you a little bit back.”On Faldbakken’s last visit to Utøya, the lake was completely still, the water a mirror, which inspired the bird’s reflection in the design. It is not meant as a clear symbol of life and death. “This is a very peaceful image but it is almost like a Rorschach test. It has this duality,” he notes. “Breivik was a homegrown terrorist, which mystified this country at the time. There’s that serene Scandinavian facade, and yet there’s the terror underneath.”Survivors and the relatives of those killed will be involved in placing the stones into the composition. The names of the 77 people who died will be engraved on the base of the work.View image in fullscreenA model showing the work from behind, in situ in the Government Quarter.Photograph: Vegard KlevenRegitze Schäffer Botnen, who was a 17-year-old participant at the Utøya camp on 22 July, was a member of the jury. Initially she felt that she was representing all the survivors, “And then I realised that is an impossible task. So, I figured out that I had to dig deeper into the subject and listen to other survivors and people who lost their children, and ask the question not what do you like the most but what is a good memorial? To see what kind of conversation that started, and learn from it.”The transparency and public engagement in the selection process was in part a result of the backlash against a rushed commission for a memorial on Utøya island in 2014. The chosen work, Jonas Dahlberg’sMemory Wound, proposed a permanent three-and-a-half metre gap be cut through the island. The concept was considered by many as memorialising one act of violence with another, andthe project was subsequently dropped. “It didn’t have the grounding of what we’re doing now,” Faldbakken says, tactfully. “And it was very much in the backyard of many people who lived close to Utøya, and were the people who took out their boats and saved the kids.”In 2012, Breivik received a 21-year-sentence, the longest that can be handed down in Norway. “He might theoretically walk past the memorial a free man some time in the future, but it is highly unlikely,” says Thomas Ugelvik, a professor of law at Oslo University. Breivik received aforvaringsentence, which is indeterminate. If he still poses a threat to society the sentence can be extended, potentially for the rest of his life.Arguably, the greatest memorial to 22 July would be the impossibility of such an attack happening again. “We have a greater focus on emergency preparedness than we did before the attack, as well as many safety measures around governmental buildings and critical infrastructure,” says Jens Stoltenberg, who went on to become general secretary of Nato and is now finance minister of Norway. “But no measure can serve as a guarantee against terrorism or extremism. In that sense a memorial is important as a constant reminder of something we would never want to experience again, and that our free and open society can never be taken for granted.”In the wake of 22 July, led by a public address from Stoltenberg, Norwegians came together. Thousands of people participated in a “rose march” the following week, walking from the town hall to Oslo Cathedral holding roses in defiance of extremism. Faldbakken was in the US at the time of the attacks, but two of his children were in Oslo. “It had an echo in our family life, because the kids were really shocked by it. I jumped on the first plane and came back.”Having to take so many peoples’ views and feelings into account while designing the memorial was a very different practice for Faldbakken. “I stood on the side as an artist and thought I’d make the best work I can based on this idea. Pretty early on I took myself and my artist’s ego out of the equation. It was not about me any more; it was about them.”Explore more on these topicsArtAnders BreivikNorwayEuropeSculptureInstallationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While it is harder now for a budding star to imagine a stage career, the more immediate impact is on theatres’ skills and craft departments.The problem is a top priority for Indhu Rubasingham, two weeks into her high-profile job as artistic director atNational Theatre. Now she and the NT’s executive director and co-chief executive, Kate Varah, are announcing a move to boost the supply of skilled workers across the country, from costume designers and makers to set creators and computer technicians.“This is a fast-growing sector, but the scale of this problem is putting it all at risk. A nationwide training drive is the answer,” Varah told theObserver. “Performing arts subjects have seen a 68% drop in student numbers, while the figures for those taking GCSEs have dropped by 47% and A-levels by 29%.“The result is that young people are not even thinking of theatre as a ­viable industry, whatever kind of backstage work they might otherwise have gone into.”The NT is to fund expansion of itsNational TheatreSkills Centre over three years, with the help of a new and “significant” corporate partnership with Bank of America.View image in fullscreenKate Varah, the National Theatre’s executive director and co-chief executive, says a nationwide drive is needed to recruit more backstage workers.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverThe centre, based in the theatre on London’s Southbank, currently offers placements, training courses, apprenticeships and work across all the NT’s departments, from costumes, to scenery, to computer technology. The new money from Bank of America will allow the NT’s craftspeople to take time out to teach trainees.One of those already benefiting is Sarah Ray-Dobson, an apprentice in the props department. “This is the first time I’ve worked in a theatre,” she said. “Prop making is a career I had never considered for myself, but I’m really enjoying it. I’ve also never seen an arts-based apprenticeship before, so I never thought that was even an available route.“All of the skills I’ve learned here can be applicable to other areas. I’ve been learning carpentry skills, furniture making and painting, including wood graining and glazing, which would definitely be helpful with my future projects.”Varah said: “We have a job vacancy rate of about 30% in the cultural sector and this is down to the skilled worker shortage. Things on the horizon, like AI, may change the landscape and could help around the edges, but it’s not really going to make a dent, and, what’s more, there are plenty of people who want to do it.’Research by Ravensbourne University London shows that 75% of 18- to 25-year-olds want to work in thecreative industries, she said. “But they don’t see how to get access to it, or what the first steps are. That’s our job and our brand, really, as the National Theatre; it’s part of our remit to make it clear to them.”View image in fullscreenSarah Ray-Dobson, an apprentice prop maker, at work at the National Theatre in London.Photograph: Cameron Slater PhotographyAt the Nottingham Playhouse, chief executive Stephanie Sirr said they were “having to advertise vacancies two, three or even four times”.“The shortage has taken us slightly by surprise. It is worrying,” said Sirr, who is also joint president of UKTheatre, the membership organisation for theatre producers, managers, owners and operators. The problem in Nottingham and elsewhere, she suggests, has been exacerbated by the dearth of old-fashioned apprenticeships.“These always attracted clever, practical people who sometimes went into the theatre. It’s very­different from a decade ago. People are not coming through the normal pipelines because kids are not doing drama in school and so are not making props, or doing the lighting, or painting scenery.”The lack of new blood, Sirr added, meant that experienced workers were at a premium: “If we don’t have ­trainees, older workers can never retire. And some of these jobs are quite physical. We are also losing some trained young people to the live music industry, or to film and television, which pay better.”Varah believes that merely publicising the existence of the centre, launched last autumn, outside London will establish it as a beacon for the whole industry. She believes the NT can point more trainees in the right direction and will benefit 15,000 people over the next three years.Varah said: “The relationship between the creative industry and the education sector is at the centre of all this. It’s about ensuring there are sufficiently trained people to go forward, so we need teachers who can go into the expressive arts at GCSE level and start building the confidence for people to pursue a career in that area. But we also need to use a partnership like this to create the gateway for those who are trained. At the moment they’re not seeing that path, so it’s brilliant.”Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, has welcomed the scheme. It would “open up opportunities and drive growth,” she said, adding: “We want to break down barriers to entering careers in our world-leading creative industries by ensuring that young people across the country are able to have access to skills and training.”The government has identified the creative industries as one of eight “growth-driving sectors” in its industrial strategy, although its own data shows that 60% of theatres have reported worsening staff shortages since 2019.This article was amended on 13 April 2025. An earlier version omitted to say that Kate Varah was the co-chief executive as well as the executive director.Explore more on these topicsStagecraftThe ObserverNational TheatreTheatreDrama and dancenewsShareReuse this content"

But if there was one band who could speak to ourpolitical moment, as they unfortunately but necessarily say – who could bring the feeling of resistance, if not actual change, to the desert – it would be Green Day, the American punk band whose seminal record American Idiot stuck a middle finger to the Bush administration in 2004. Though the album is in fact more rock opera of sweeping adolescent feeling than political commentary, the opportunity for concert catharsis, if not actual change, is high; it’s a historically excellent time to scream along to “don’t want to be an American Idiot.”Lady Gaga at Coachella review – a thrilling all-timer of a performanceRead moreCatharsis was intermittently on hand during Green Day’s headliner set on Saturday, a muddled affair that, although performed to punk perfection, landed more awkwardly than one would hope. To be fair, the California-based band, formed when frontman Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt were in high school in 1987, was dealt a tough hand as Coachella’s headliner follow up to Lady Gaga, who transformed the desert into a gothic fever dream with astunning and instantly canonical seton Friday night. And more pressingly, in following unofficial headliner Charli xcx, who preceded Green Day on the main stage Saturday with a larger crowd and a tighter grip on middle-finger energy and the color of puke green.Brat Summer signifiers still abounded in the audience forGreen Day, a striking mix of Gen X grey hair and Gen Z hair gems for Coachella’s legacy act of the weekend. The band seemed not to know which audience to cater to, the old-school fans or the generations raised downstream of Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and split the difference in uneasy fashion from the jump; the set opened with two full tracks from other bands, Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody and The Ramones’ Blitzkrieg Bop, with a man in a Billie Joe-styled bunny suit hyping up the crowd – whether a delay tactic or an intentional nod to forebearers, it was never clear.Without intro, the band plowed through 18 tracks spanning 1994’s Dookie to 2024’s Saviors, all delivered with their signature impishness unaffected by time, with standard concert camera work and stock visuals largely rendered in the stark American Idiot color scheme of white, black and red. But front-loading the set with the three American Idiot songs most nostalgically beloved by millennials – the title track (lyrics changed to “Don’t want to be an American idiot / I’m not part of a Maga agenda”), Holiday and Boulevard of Broken Dreams – robbed the 90-minute set of critical build-up and the audience of some fickle attendees. American Idiot would work much better as an exclamation point finale than, say, Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) with an audience member brought up to play lagging acoustic to Armstrong’s impeccable vocals. With few interstitials, minimal intros and no clear delineation between eras or significance, the setlist felt less like a coherent tour through a storied career and more a collection of songs powered through with consummate professionalism.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Amy Harris/Invision/APThat’s not a knock on the band members – drummer Tré Cool, sweating off his glitter eyeshadow with relentless pursuit of rapid-fire rhythm; bassist Dirnt, as dogged and limber as ever; and especially Armstrong, whose voice retains a hint of the punk nasality and remains one of the most distinctive and pleasing in American rock music. His singing cut through the volume and any doubts, from throat-scratching scream to rare moments of spare emotion, as in Wake Me Up When September Ends. The grief anthem marked the high point of the show, when Armstrong – still sprightly at 53, eyes still kohl-rimmed and twinkly – summoned the strongest command on an audience he at one point advised to temporarily drop their phone cameras and live in the moment.Live and yell in the moment, many did, though the show evinced the limitations of a legacy punk rock act as a main stage headliner in the post-Beychella era of elaborate productions. Green Day are seasoned performers with a deep catalog of the loud, the invigorating and the scream-able; they are also a three-piece outfit in their 50s not known for choreography – punk is an attitude and a freedom, after all – with little to bring to the massive main stage beyond absolutely shredding their instruments. In lieu of added staging or guests (a little of friend andoccasional co-performerBillie Eilish would have gone a long way), Armstrong relied on classic rock concert tricks for audience engagement – “wave your hands in the air,” a 1-2-3-4 countdown for everyone to jump, pitting sides of the audience against each other in a screaming contest – that ran out of juice by the end.Still, Green Day delivered on the ultimate mandate of a headliner act: loud, fully absorbingfun. From Basket Case to Brain Stew to Jesus of Suburbia to, yes, American Idiot, the volume was invigoratingly high, the music comforting, the heads banging. And the opportunity to scream along to lyrics of disillusionment and anger as welcome as ever.Explore more on these topicsCoachellaGreen DayFestivalsPunkPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Premieredat the 1952 Proms, when it was the only music by any female composer that season, the concerto languished until after Carwithen’s death in 2003. Now the 30-minute piece has been recorded twice, received its German premiere last month, and, in the latest step in its reawakening, was the centrepiece of the latest Barbican Hall concert by Sakari Oramo and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.Quartet by Leah Broad review – Britain’s great female composersRead moreCarwithen’s champions, who include the soloist in both this and the German performances, Alexandra Dariescu, make large claims for concerto and composer alike. Despite Dariescu’s unstinting performance, however, Carwithen’s piece does not entirely justify them. The concerto is accomplished for sure, with neatly crafted moods veering between late romantic and neo-classical, but more is hinted at than is achieved, even in the intimacy between the piano and a solo violin in the slow movement. The closest the concerto comes to a crux or a moment of revelation is in the thundering solo cadenza in the final movement.View image in fullscreenUnstinting … Alexandra DariescuPhotograph: Mark AllanIt took only a few bars of Malcolm Arnold’s fifth symphony, which took up the second half of the concert, to encounter the colour and incisiveness missing from the Carwithen. Arnold’s writing memorialises four friends who had all recently died when the symphony was written in 1961. There is undoubtedly darkness in the scoring but, for the most part, the symphony brims with contrast and confidence. There is a serenity in the slow movement and a jauntiness in the two that follow that make a strong case for treating this as Arnold’s most successful orchestral work. Oramohas long been a committed advocate of it,which this performance confirmed, and he brandished the score for its own round of applause at the end.Right at the start of the evening, the BBC Singers joined Oramo and the orchestra for a ravishing performance of Vaughan Williams’s Serenade to Music . The setting of part of the scene between Lorenzo and Jessica in act five of Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice is one of Vaughan Williams’ most transcendent achievements. In today’s grim times it poured even more balm than usual into the soul.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Symphony OrchestraSakari OramoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, he wields it to propel his narrative forward in the kind of urgent, endless staccato rush that sometimes requires the reader to look briefly up and away, if only to gulp at some fresh air.Nova Scotia House, the 51-year-old journalist’s first work of fiction after two books on fashion, tells the story of living through the Aids crisis of the 1980s and early 90s, and how those who survived it will be forever accompanied by the ghostly presence of those who didn’t.Johnny is 19 years old when he meets Jerry, 45, the older, wiser guide who introduces his young charge to London, the gay scene, and a sense of community – a queer community – he has long sought. In his first nightclub, for example, Johnny experiences “people more people, noise like I had not known it, a hard wall, relentless, so many bodies, light mostly red, smoke steaming from bodies, smoke from cigarettes, chemical smoke in the air, Jerry grinning maniacal, in my ear he said, follow me, and Jerry took my hand…”Nova Scotia House is intensely claustrophobic, its jittery rhythm an incantation to all that we can lose in lifeJerry, Johnny says, “was the first man I loved, the first man I loved who died. If we normalise Jerry’s death, we eradicate Jerry. If we normalise the nightmare of HIV, we eradicate its victims.”Porter tells Johnny’s story from the sober – and mostly sad – vantage point of 30 years later. He continues to live in Jerry’s flat, No 1, Nova Scotia House, not merely out of sentiment but because he never quite got his act together enough to leave, and move on. We don’t learn what it is he does for a living, but are instead given the sense that life is passing him by, and that most of his connections now come via dispiriting hookups found on his phone. “Will I see anyone. Don’t care. Sounds rude, it’s not rude.” Mostly, he pines for something deeper, but this he feels is impossible in a city ravaged by redevelopment, obliterating existing neighbourhoods and pricing out natives. Still, he tries. “I want a beer and I want that guy to come over and I know he won’t come over so why do I bother when I know he won’t be coming over. The game is the game. Can I get out. Do I want to get out.”Nova Scotia Houseis intensely claustrophobic, its jittery rhythm an incantation to all that we can lose in life, even as we are still busy living it: youth, hope, optimism, alongside the helpless yearning for a better tomorrow. Its pages are steeped in alienation, and soaked in melancholy. What is it like, Porter posits, to be almost 50 and still feel that the world around you remains so cursorily hostile? How do we maintain our tribes?But while the writing style can seem suffocating, there is purpose to it. It pulls you in, then holds you appalled, hypnotised. It is of course the critic’s bad habit to read autobiography into fiction, but Porter has conjured such intensity here, and such tangibly real characters, that it feels like the gospel truth. This is a book that works both as a tribute to those who died of the cruellest disease, and as a more general lament to love, loss and remembrance. It is profoundly, bracingly human.Nova Scotia Houseby Charlie Porter is published by Particular Books (£18.99). To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

This assured thriller sees a widowed single mum and abuse survivor dipping her toe back into the relationship circuit, only to find herself terrorised by quirky memes. It’s scarier than it sounds.Having reluctantly left her young son in the care of her sister, Violet (Meghann Fahy) arrives at an upmarket restaurant for a first date with a charming photographer named Henry (Brandon Sklenar). But from the outset something is off. Violet is bombarded by a series of increasingly threatening “digi-drops” (an AirDrop, or wireless file transfer, to all intents and purposes). The messages warn of harm to her son unless she does exactly what she is told – and her instructions include committing a murder. There’s a 50ft radius in which to send or receive a digi-drop, so the sender must be in the restaurant. But since every punter in the place is glued to their phones, that doesn’t narrow it down much. Violet must use her well-honed survival instincts to make it through to the dessert course. It’s enjoyable stuff: a taut and crisply edited balance between humour and horror.Watch a trailer for Drop.Explore more on these topicsThrillersThe ObserverreviewsShareReuse this content"

The poem performs the obsequies for the poor redbreast but is also a roll call of the other birds of old Albion: the thrush, the owl, the dove and more. InBird School: A Beginner in the Wood, Nicolson sets out to educate himself about these species and discover why avian mortality is a considerably bigger problem now than it was when the ballad of Cock Robin was first heard.Since the 1960s, numbers of song thrushes in the UK have fallen by 40%, from a population of approximately 100,000 to about 60,000, according to the British Trust for Ornithology. There are half as many tawny owls in our woods since the 1970s, and the decline of turtle doves is even more vertiginous: we’ve lost 90% of them in the past 60 years. (Though the robin is faring rather better: from a nadir in the mid-80s when fewer than 100,000 specimens were recorded, the ranks have swelled to a healthier 150,000 today.) In Nicolson’s lifetime, the heavens have emptied of birds: though partly as a response to this, every new publishing season finds the skies black with books about our feathered friends. There has been a spectacular murmuration of birder-authors in recent years, includingTim Dee,Stephen MossandDeborah Cramer.The fate of Cock Robin, who met a violent death in midair, is re-enacted on our moors and estates to this dayIn a decorated career, Nicolson has written about wetlands,the Hebridesandrock pools, but admits: “I had never paid any attention to birds. I had not cared about them.” However, it’s an iron law of the book trade that a nature writer in need of a subject will sooner or later turn their attention to the treetops. A gentleman farmer, Nicolson enlists friends and farmhands to build him a hide, a bespoke treehouse, to pursue his research – an episode that delightfully recalls the squire-servant relationship of Ted and Ralph fromThe Fast Show.View image in fullscreenAdam Nicolson.Photograph: James NuttOf all the wild creatures that surround us, birds are perhaps the most appealing, the leastwild. We are soppy about dogs and cats in this country, but we also fork out £250m a year on bird victuals. According to Nicolson, the feeders and bird tables in British gardens groan under 150,000 tonnes of treats including fat balls stuffed with insects – the mini-kievs of bird gastronomy – enough to fill up all the visitors who are ever likely to call in our back yards three times over. So how to explain their melancholy absence?Intensive farming, including the loss of hedgerows, is a major culprit in the plummeting bird population, as is the wider problem of the climate emergency (though rising temperatures may tempt long-lost species like the golden oriole back to the British landscape). It’s not only ornithologists who have these airborne targets in their sights. At one time, Nicolson says, tens of thousands of birds perished so that their feathers could furnish women’s hats, and now the commonest bird in the UK is not the homely sparrow but the pheasant. A staggering 28m or more game birds, bred for sport, fall to guns every year. The fate of Cock Robin, who met a violent death in midair, is re-enacted on our moors and estates to this day.Bird Schoolis elegant and involving. Like one of the nests Nicolson finds on his property, it’s been deftly assembled.

Her colleague Luke Broadwater, once a Pulitzer prize winner for the Baltimore Sun, makes theTrump administrationhis beat.As co-authors, at book length of Mad House, they deliver a sharp and wit-filled portrait of Capitol Hill dysfunction. Generally unflattering, Karni and Broadwater dedicate their book on modernUS politicsto “the leakers, gossips, and busybodies who populate the halls of Congress”.Their tone matches the age. UnderDonald Trump, politics is performative, personas are outsized. People are angry. What passes for authenticity is prized. Ambition and wishful thinking are rife. The players know it, yet find the call of fame irresistible.New books chart Biden’s downfall – and the picture is damning for DemocratsRead moreKarni and Broadwater begin with the cautionary tale ofKevin McCarthy, hapless and desperate as speaker of the House, and end with impressions and ruminations from Chuck Schumer, the Brooklyn-born leader of Democrats in the Senate.McCarthy comes off much worse. His fellow House members rejected him. Hell, they humiliated him. All the way fromNancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker emeritus, to Matt Gaetz, the Republican bad boy from Florida who somehow became Donald Trump’s first pick for attorney general, almost all of them loathed him.As a California congressman, McCarthy was a back-slapping schmoozer – not anyone’s idea of someone cut out for “high-stakes negotiations”, in the words of the authors. “I don’t know what the hell he’s doing here. Why is he even here?” Pelosi would say – with McCarthy standing right there. “He was a waste of space, and it was a waste of her time to have to talk to such an idiot,” Karni and Broadwater write.Pelosi was not alone. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, was similarly unkind. McCarthy, she said, “was about a pursuit of power, and the rest of it didn’t matter. That inherently made him a dangerous and ineffective leader.”View image in fullscreenMad House: How Donald Trump, Maga Mean Girls, a Former Used Car Salesman, a Florida Nepo Baby, and a Man with Rats in His Walls Broke Congress.Photograph: Random HouseFor Gaetz, it was personal. McCarthy declined to shut down an ethics committee investigation into allegations of drug use and underage sex. When McCarthy’s fall came, he attempted to frame it as a “Matt Gaetz grudge fuck”. Some measure of consolation arose: being Trump’s attorney general pick didn’t work out for Gaetz, who’s now out of Congress entirely, a minor TV host.In December, the ethics committeereleased its report. It was not a good look for anyone, let alone a prospective AG. The committee found “substantial evidence” that Gaetz “violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress”.Still, Gaetz is married to Ginger Luckey, sister of Palmer Luckey, a tech mogul and defense contractor. Gaetz also sells videos on Cameo. “I served in Congress. Trump nominated me to be US attorney general (that didn’t work out),”he advertises. “Once I fired the House Speaker.”Karni and Broadwater have more than the saga of McCarthy and Gaetz to make the reader scowl, cringe and giggle. “If there was one thing politicians of every ilk serving in the 118th session of Congress could agree on,” they observe, “it was that they were members of a dysfunctional legislative body populated by a bunch of clowns.”Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, is caught yearning to be Trump’s running mate in 2024. Her past criticisms of him? Her vote to certify the 2020 election? Forgettable sins, she hopes. Yet she is acutely aware that Trump is the force of the day.“I can’t move forward and move up and be anti-Trump,” Mace says. “That’s just not where the country is.” More like, it’s not where Republican voters are. “If I want to have a career going forward, then I have some decisions I have to make.”Karni and Broadwater twist the knife, cataloging Mace’s “nine tattoos, up from zero”. The congresswoman’s body art includes the names of her children, on her ribs. A Robert Frost quote elsewhere. The opening sentence from Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway? On her torso. Mace keeps Bible quotes on her fingers, “tattooed in red to make them less visible”. A graduate of the Citadel military school, the daughter of an army general, Mace sits on the armed services committee.More seriously, Karni and Broadwater capture how Schumer lowered the boom on Joe Biden, as his age and infirmity grew too great to ignore. After the then president’s televised faceplant last June, on the debate stage with Trump, the New York senator told his former colleague the end was nigh. No more than five SenateDemocratsbelieved Biden should keep running. Beyond that, “if the president refused to step aside, [Schumer] would argue, the consequences for Democrats and Mr Biden’s own legacy after a half century of public service would be catastrophic”.“If I were you … I wouldn’t run,” Schumer said. “And I’m urging you not to run.”Biden said: “You’ve got bigger balls than anyone I’ve ever met.” He soon stepped out of the race.But Schumer was not clear-eyed on all things. “Here’s my hope,” he told Karni and Broadwater. “After this election, when the Republican party expels the turd ofDonald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican party.”Call that … wishful thinking.Another Democrat, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, wasn’t buying it.“There are plenty of examples of societies captured by a singularly unique individual demagogue and that get healthy after that person disappears,” Murphy tells Karni and Broadwater. “I don’t know. I’m not as optimistic as he is. I worry there’s a rot at the core of the country that will continue to be exposed politically.”Now Schumer himself stands exposed, his leadership in question over his failure to stand up toRepublicanspushing a punishing spending bill. The New Yorker is 74 and still uses a flip phone. Murphy is 51, from the iPhone generation, seen as a leader in waiting. On the Senate side of Karni and Broadwater’s Mad House, change may be coming.Mad Houseis publishedin the US by Penguin Random HouseThis article was amended on 13 April 2025.

At the edge of the stage, arms windmilling, his face set in concentration, he looks like a footballer waiting to take to the pitch. In fact he’s Liverpool manager Bill Shankly. In writer-director Phillip Breen’s new play, adapted fromDavid Peace’s book, we see Shankly take the club into the first division and on to FA and Uefa Cup victories between 1959 and his retirement in 1974.Narration is passed from one actor to another in a 52-strong cast, rippling across them like a chant around a stand. This huge ensemble moves over the stage like a shoal of fish, gravitating towards Shankly. Mullan stands, solid as a tree trunk, as if defending a goal; squinting into the distance like someone sizing up a shot. His hand flicks forward while motivational lines fire out of his mouth like the blasts of a whistle.Bill Shankly: Life, death and footballRead moreHe constantly calls the players “boys” and “son”, but Breen’s script doesn’t unpack the psychology of the team, and Shankly’s wife, Nessie, is also sidelined. A scrappy stampede of scenes plays out like a series of match reports, declarative rather than dynamic, so the show loses the dressing room at the end of each wordy long half.Its visual language is more eloquent.As Shankly assembles a team and legacy at the club, wooden planks are gradually slotted into a wall behind him until it stands complete. Empty space grows when he retires and is forced apart from the team by Les Dennis’s stiff and thinly drawn chairman Tom Williams. Slumped on a chair, Mullan’s precise verbal strikes are now stutters. It’s as if he has been punctured, slowly deflating before us until he resembles a boy, looking up wistfully, waiting for someone to guide him. Like one of the players after all.Red or Deadis at the Royal Court, Liverpool, until 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverLiverpoolBill ShanklyDavid PeacePeter MullanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Buy water at the nearby Spar (you’ll need it) before ambling through the wood, across fields and up, up, up until – massively out of breath – you reach the top of Golden Cap, the south coast’s highest cliff. Your reward: panoramic views of the wide sweep of vast Lyme Bay, from Portland on your left to Exmouth in Devon. Return to the Anchor Inn for crab brioche rolls and local Palmers beer. The beach at Seatown is a fossil hotspot – hunt for ammonites at low tide.Bridport Vintage QuarterThe Alleyways Antiques market is home to more than 50 traders selling a huge variety of artefacts from high-end antiques to quirky kitsch. It’s tucked away behind the main high street on the St Michael’s trading estate. First stop is Paul Michael Farnham at Studio 49 (instagram.com/paul_michael_farnham), an antiques dealer with an astonishing eye for Persian carpets, sculptures and more. From there it’s a short walk to the covered market filled with blue-and-white china, lighting and furniture. Don’t worry about getting stuck here: there’s also great food available on site at the Red Brick Café (redbrickcafebridport.com).Bridport MarketsTo catch the essence of Bridport (bridportandwestbay.co.uk), don’t miss the market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, when the town’s three main streets are transformed into bustling hubs of activity with stalls selling food, clothing and bric-a-brac. The market has a long history dating back to 1253 when King Henry III granted the town a charter. You’ll often find a band playing in the main square, behind the town hall, or further down South Street. The Wednesday market is smaller but great for secondhand books and cut flowers, vintage textiles and local honey.Hive BeachView image in fullscreen‘A postcard-perfect stretch of the Jurassic Coast’: Hive Beach.Photograph: Getty ImagesA short drive from Bridport, glorious Hive Beach is a postcard-perfect stretch of the Jurassic Coast, with honey-coloured cliffs, bracing waves and coastal walks. Hive Beach Café (hivebeachcafe.co.uk), a local institution, serves the freshest seafood right on the beach: fish and chips, but also crab sandwiches and chilli-and-lime squid. For a spot of retro glamour, walk 100 yards up the cliff to the Seaside Boarding House, a hotel and restaurant run by former Groucho Club co-founder Mary-Lou Sturridge.

In the 60s, Moore (daughter of the sculptor Henry) designed clothes for musician clients including the Animals and Eric Clapton. Previously based in Notting Hill, she relocated her entire clothing collection to this cute store on South Street. We saw gems by Etro, Valentino and Westwood among the 1940s evening dresses, classic 1950s, psychedelic 60s shifts and 80s bling. Shop online to search by era and designer, from Amies to Westwood (dressbridport.co.uk).West Bay HarbourIt would be hard to find a more atmospheric fishing village than West Bay with its dramatic sandstone cliffs and views of Golden Cap. The bustling harbour is a heady mix of yachts and working fishing vessels. On a sunny evening, there’s nothing nicer than buying the freshest fish and chips from one of the local kiosks and strolling to the harbour wall to tuck in while the sun goes down.G&T Garden ToursJason Goodwin and Simon Tiffin founded G&T Garden Tours to share their passion for the glorious gardens of Dorset. In particular, ones not normally accessible to the public, with the gardens’ owners sharing stories and personal insights. Past trips have taken in Jasper Conran’s spectacular grounds and the Beaminster garden of furniture designer John Makepeace. Tour guests stay at lovely Symonsbury Manor, with gourmet meals by Caroline Purchase. Don’t miss the chance to walk up the nearby iconic cone-shaped Colmers Hill, one of the most recognizable landmarks in West Dorset. Booking the tour is essential as groups cap at 14 and premium summer slots sell out months ahead (gtgardentours.co.uk).Eating outView image in fullscreenCatch of the day: hake being served SoulshineBridport is a foodie paradise with a thriving independent scene built around local, seasonal and sustainable food. Soulshine (wearesoulshine.co.uk) is a wonderfully relaxed café for breakfast, lunch or dinner, owned by former River Cottage colleagues. For Italian food, try the Napolitana pizzas at Mercanto Italiano (mercatoitaliano.uk) or go to the little takeaway bakery Brassica Forno (brassicaforno.co.uk) for arancini, pizza al taglio, pastries and doughnuts.

The Italianate formal gardens, laid out in the 1920s, feature stunning topiary, an impressive orangery and a recently restored 18th-century swimming pool. In recent years, the owners have launched a major rewilding project, handing back to nature more than 10,000 acres of marginal farmland and woodland.

Certainly it’s not for everyone. Some find it too bleak, depressing even. Others lean into it, the endless stretch of shingle and the looming presence of a nuclear power station at the southern end that lends a distinctly apocalyptic feel. Throw in the surreal afterthought of a miniature railway that runs across the beach and there really is nowhere else quite like it.The place has long been an inspiration for artists, photographers, architects and writers, drawn by the otherworldly atmosphere, the strange clash of styles and the shifting blue-grey light.It drew me a couple of years ago, when I decided it would make a great setting for a key scene in my psychological thriller. My two main characters end up at the Metropole, an entirely fictional hotel that I wish existed: a forlorn art-deco gem crouching on the shore near the lighthouse. As the fog sets in, a mysterious widower confesses more than he should to his ghostwriter about the mysterious circumstances of his wife’s death. It felt like the right place to dial up the romantic suspense.Our brief stay is distinctly less gothic. We start with lunch at the Dungeness Snack Shack on the beach: fat juicy prawns, fried fish in flatbread, red cabbage slaw, fried potatoes (nothing so obvious as chips here), scallops and halloumi taste sublime in the sea air, even more so at less than a tenner a head.View image in fullscreenPerfect escape: West Cottage, once a lighthouse keeper’s home.Photograph: Katie PankowskiWe walk past the mishmash of cottages and cabins – everywhere you look it’s Martin Parr meetsArchitectural Digest; next to the bright green bungalow with a St George flag and washing line out front, there’s a black, midcentury cube with floor-to-ceiling glass.Found objects, pebble sculptures, piles of fishing nets, rusting machinery and boats abandoned far from sea all add to a sense of mystery; what has been left to gently decay, and what has been lovingly curated?Everywhere you look it’s Martin Parr meets Architectural Digest - a bright green bungalow with a St George flag next to a black cube with floor-to-ceiling glassWe head to the Pilot Inn for a pint, its retro pine-clad interior already packed by 6pm with locals tucking into generous portions of fish and chips, “the best in England”, according to the late filmmakerDerek Jarman, whose rustic former home, Prospect Cottage, overlooks the beach.As we walk across the shingle, the rolling fog I imagined in my book puts in an appearance. Ahead of us is the flashing beam of the lighthouse shrouded in sea mist. We follow the straight line of the miniature railway track, slightly spooked by the eerie whistling sound and a low hum from the nuclear power station.We make it back across the marshland to our home for the night, West Cottage, one of two former lighthouse keepers’ homes, at the foot of the original Dungeness lighthouse which was built in the 18th century.View image in fullscreenWork of art: Prospect Cottage, with stones sculpture by Derek Jarman.Photograph: Lynn Hilton/AlamyLike most of the properties around here, there’s an interesting history. West Cottage, dating back to 1843, was bought by artist, sculptor and photographer Martin Turner in the 1990s. When his daughter, Kathryn, inherited it, she embarked on a meticulous renovation. There are lovely touches throughout the house, from the reclaimed floorboards to the brass taps and the striking Spanish floor tiles in the kitchen and bathroom. We cook a meal and cosy up for the evening with a roaring wood-burning stove.The next day, we pack up and head to Camber Sands. Less than 20 minutes along the coast it could be a different state, like leaving Arizona for the Hamptons. Here the coastline softens, the sea is bluer, the surf whiter and the shingle turns to swirls of creamy sand dunes, overlooked by pretty clapboard houses.Just nearby is Harry’s, a restaurant that opened a few months ago and is part ofthe Gallivant, a boutique hotel a few yards from the beach.View image in fullscreen‘A pretty, conservatory-style dining room’: Harry’s restaurantA pretty, conservatory-style dining room with white wicker chairs and walls lined with framed vintage swimwear looks out on to a small courtyard. The lunch menu feels like good value at £29 for two courses, but we’ve worked up an appetite after a walk on the beach and opt for three courses at £35.With ex-Bibendum chef Matthew Harris as lead chef here, we can’t resist the Maldon oysters, suitably elemental with a zing of sauce mignonette (vinegar, minced shallots and pepper). The local fish – hake today – caught from Rye Bay is the perfect foil to the anise of the fennel and spiced red cabbage purée.There’s also an impressive range of English wines on the menu including a crisp, dry East Sussex sparkling white from Oxney Organic Estate. The highlight is sharing an old-school Armagnac prune crème brûlée and vanilla ice-cream served as it should be, in a silver coupe with chocolate sauce to pour over.Before we leave, we walk into Rye and its picture-perfect Mermaid Street, a steep incline of cobbled lanes and half-timbered houses. It’s undeniably pretty, but for me it doesn’t quite pass the Marmite test. Give me the ghostly fog and bleak desolation of Dungeness any day.West Cottage sleepsfour in two bedrooms and is available from £981 forfive nights.

The lidded earthenware casseroles are put away until autumn; the jars of beans in the larder are moved to the top shelf – almost too high to reach – and slow cooking is swapped for suppers that take a few minutes on the grill. The last few days before Easter is when I make a deep casserole of beans, onions and sausages – the final big casserole, with which to wave goodbye to winter-spring.The last few days before Easter is when I make a deep casserole of beans, onions and sausagesOf all the jars of beige pulses on the larder shelves, it is black-eyed beans which are the most infrequently used, though I’m not quite sure why. Much as I enjoy the slow-food ritual of soaking dried beans overnight and cooking them from scratch with bay leaves and onion, I am more likely to choose a tinned or bottled variety for a weekday dinner.Bean-based meals are worth making the day before. They reheat successfully and often seem to get better after a night in the fridge. I use a deep casserole, usually of cast iron, that can be left to simmer quietly on the hob. If yours is made of earthenware, then I suggest starting off in a stainless-steel saucepan then, once the liquid is added, transferring it to the casserole dish and baking at 180C/gas mark 4, for 40 minutes.The first herb up this spring has been the mint. (It is usually tarragon, but not so this year.) A healthy plant that has been growing in a pot on the kitchen steps for a year or two now. I pinched a handful of stems for a seasonal ice, the first in a while – chopping the leaves finely and steeping them in a light sugar syrup before freezing. Mixed with yoghurt in place of custard they produced the most refreshing of desserts. One that I have been known to trickle a little melted chocolate over on occasion.Sausages and black-eyed beansI use plump, heavily seasoned sausages here, perhaps the fat Italian sausages thick with fennel, black pepper or chilli that you find in Italian delis. They have a coarse, open texture and take particularly well to long, slow cooking. Failing that, a good butcher’s breakfast sausage will do the job admirably.Serves 4.

Warm 3 tbsp of oil in a deep pan, add the onions and cook them over a moderate heat until they are soft and golden. Stir regularly so they colour evenly.While the onions are cooking, peel and finely slice the garlic, then add it to the softening onions together with the bay leaves, fennel seeds and peppercorns.When the onions are soft and sticky, remove them from the pan and add a little more oil. Cut the sausages into short lengths, then add them to the pan and let them colour nicely on all sides.Return the onions to the pan, add the sherry, continue to cook for a couple of minutes, then stir in the flour. Cook for a further 2 or 3 minutes, then introduce the hot stock, tuck in the thyme sprigs and continue cooking for 25 minutes.Core and thickly slice the apples and add them to the simmering hotpot. Season with salt, black pepper and the mustard. Continue cooking until the apples are soft and beans are tender enough to crush between finger and thumb. If you wish, finely chop the leaves of a few sprigs of parsley and stir in at the end.Mint frozen yoghurtView image in fullscreen‘Pop in the freezer without churning and simply stir thoroughly every few hours until frozen’: mint frozen yoghurt.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverAs much as I appreciate my ice-cream machine, I also like recipes that don’t require one. The sort of ice you can pop in the freezer without churning and simply stir thoroughly every few hours until frozen. This bright green, refreshing ice is one those. You just need a deep freeze and a freezer box. It helps the texture of the finished water-ice if you can remember to beat the mixture with a fork or small whisk every hour or so as it freezes, though this is not essential.Serves 8.

Pulse until you end up with moist, green sugar. Put the green sugar and water into a saucepan and bring to the boil. As soon as all the sugar has dissolved, remove it from the heat and quickly cool the mixture – either by putting the pan in a sink of cold water or, as I do, by pouring the syrup into a bowl set in a larger one full of ice cubes.Blitz the remaining mint briefly with the yoghurt, then stir into the cooled syrup and mix gently. Pour the mixture through a fine sieve into the bowl of an ice-cream machine or chilled plastic freezer box. If using a churn, then mix until almost frozen. If you are using the freezer method, place in the freezer for a couple of hours or until ice crystals start to form on the edges, then stir or whisk them into the liquid centre and return it to the freezer. Repeat once, an hour or so later, then leave until almost frozen. Serve the mint-ice in small bowls.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsSausagesNigel Slater recipesDessertFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

Today’s recipes bring those celebrations to the dining table with slow-roasted lamb seasoned with Greek flavours of oregano and garlic, and paired with a crisp fennel and herb salad that celebrates the new season’s bounty. It’s a meal that’s just made for sharing – and for toasting the end of a long winter.Greek-style braised lamb shoulderRich, soft and full-of-flavour lamb with classic Greek flavours and a gentle chilli heat.Prep10 minCook4 hr 30 minServes4-62 tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper1½kg bone-in lamb shoulder1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 small bunch fresh oregano(about 20g)1 tsp chilli flakes250ml white wine500ml chicken stockJuice of 1 lemonHeat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3. Put a tablespoon of olive oil in a large, heavy-based dutch oven-style pan in which the lamb will sit flat, and put on a medium-high heat. Season the lamb, sear on all sides until well browned all over, then lift out on to a plate. Add the onion to the hot oil in the pan and cook, stirring, for 10-12 minutes, until softened and starting to colour. Turn down the heat to medium-low, then add the garlic, oregano and chilli flakes, and cook, stirring, for a minute.Pour in the wine and simmer for about four minutesto deglaze the pan, scraping any browned bits from bottom and sides. Once the wine has reduced by half, add the stock and lemon juice, then return the lamb shoulder to the pot, cover and roast for three hours, until the meat is very tender.Take the pot out of the oven, turn up the heat to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then strain the liquid into a second pot (if it’s easier, lift out the lamb first).On the hob, cook the liquid on a medium-high heat until it reduces to a thicker, sauce-like consistency. Baste the lamb in the reduced cooking liquor, then cover the pot and return to the oven to roast for a further 30 minutes, basting every 10 minutes.Take the pot out of the oven and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Shred and/or carve the meat, arrange it on a platter, pour over all the cooking juices and serve with the fennel salad below.Fennel and herb salataView image in fullscreenJorge Paredes’ fennel and herb salata.A refreshing, acidic side salad that really cuts through the richness of the lamb. Slicing the fennel very thinly makes a huge difference to the balance of the dish, but you can freestyle with the herbs to your heart’s content: use whatever you fancy, but just make sure they’re all very fresh.Prep20 minServes4-62 fennel bulbs40g fresh basil– Greek, Italian or Thai, it’s up to you20g fresh mint20g fresh dill20g chervil, or tarragon2 blood oranges, or 2 ordinary oranges or 1 grapefruit10g fresh ginger, peeled250ml extra-virgin olive oilJuice of 2 lemons20g sugarSalt, to tasteSlice the fennel as thinly as you can – use a mandoline, ideally – then put in a large bowl. Pick all the fresh herb leaves off their stems and add to the bowl. Peel and segment the oranges, then add to the bowl.To make the dressing, grate the ginger into a small bowl (or jar), add the extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice and sugar, then whisk (or seal the jar and shake) to emulsify.Just before serving, pour the dressing over the contents of the salad bowl, add a generous pinch of salt to taste, toss to coat and combine, and take to the table.Jorge Paredes is head chef atOma, London SE1Explore more on these topicsEasterGreek food and drinkMain courseFoodLambMeatVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

I like to be up at 6.30am and off to an empty Hampstead Heath. I’ve got antisocial dogs who think they own the park, so it’s easier that way. Then I can spend the rest of the day at home away from everyone.Not a people person then?On Sundays, no. I live in east London, where Sundays are stupidly busy. I’m old enough to remember when everything was closed. I miss that sense of the world being shuttered. I love being in southern Italy. Sundays, all the shops are shut, save the baker, maybe, for the morning. We need that break from the insanity.The perfect Sunday to yourself?I’d start to sort the crap out in my house: I’m on the verge of becoming a reformed hoarder. I’m slowly sorting out all I’ve accumulated and love when everyone pisses off and I can pick a room to start working through.How hoard-yare we talking?I’m a nightmare on eBay when it comes to kitchen stuff: plates, pans, bowls, another stack of cocktail glasses. It was a problem, but I’m getting better. I’ve stopped in the last 18 months. And now, I don’t put stuff away for special occasions. Use or get rid is my new mantra.Sundays growing upWe went to mass and Catholic Sunday school when we were young. Then, and into my teens, we’d come home and sit round the table having a family roast, whether my mum’s or grandmother’s. We were all there, no excuses. It only stopped at university.Do you host?Yes, I’m too lazy to travel home from anywhere. My partner Neil is also a cook, so we divvy up food duties. If we have chef-y friends coming over, they’re instructed which course to bring. A friend of ours has lodged with us for 20 years – he’s part of the family. In the evenings, three of us and my sister chill out, watch TV, and roast something mellow, like a chicken.Dish from Waitrose with Nick Grimshaw andAngela Hartnett, season seven, is available nowExplore more on these topicsAngela HartnettThe ObserverFoodSunday with…featuresShareReuse this content"

Small plates £19-£65; large plates £37-£145; desserts £8.50-£12; wine from £50I’m going to tell you a story. This is a story about that which shall not be named. A word that is rarely dissected or discussed in polite society. Yes, occasionally it’s muttered casually – between close friends, in an Islington townhouse. You may even hear it whispered along the hallowed streets of London’s Broadway Market – if you’re lucky. But rarely do we take this beast apart. Not often is the brute hung, cut along its middle, for us to follow the grain of its connective tissues.I doubt many of us even know the origins of this polemic word. Fewer still of the German-born sociologist, Ruth Glass, who coined the phrase, after moving to London and observing the displacement of working-class residents of its neighbourhoods, by middle-class newcomers. We are, of course, talking about that uninvited guest, the ghost at the feast…gentrificationnn!View image in fullscreen‘Many of the current residing members of Notting Hill arrive at this restaurant for just this’: côte de boeuf steak.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverAhhh, good old gentrification. This is a word derived from “gentrify”, as coined by Samuel Laing in the 19th century. He argued that one could attain upper-class status through conduct rather than birth.I was born in west London in 1984, and raised on Notting Hill’s Powis Terrace by my mother,Andi Oliver,when she was 20 years old. Across the following 40 years of my life, I have lived with 23 flatmates in 15 different flats within west and east London. And because of this, I was lucky enough to bear witness to the foreshadowing of the mass-gentrification pilgrimage that was to come to Notting Hill in 1998, and again to Hackney in 2009.View image in fullscreenComfort food: smoked pink fir potatoes.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverOn a Friday night, not long before the beginning of spring, I sat in a restaurant with my mother on the street that grew us both. Dorian sits on a quiet, unassuming road in Westbourne Park, Notting Hill. Beside it isthe Globe– a basement club that has been open since the 1960s and was run by my stepfather throughout the 1990s. As well as being where she met him, it is the first place my mother was paid to cook food.Dorian, which now resembles a 1930s European bistro, was once Coins Coffee Store, run by a family friend and the first place I was ever employed. For three months in 1996 I washed dishes and made scrambled eggs in the very same kitchen where Max Coen and his exquisite team today present a menu of truly refined decadence. The room is warm, the lights are low and, upon entering, a quasi holy feeling is felt within, telling you that yes, you are in fact exactly where you are meant to be – which as we all know is what makes a great restaurant a truly great restaurant.View image in fullscreen‘A welcome fattiness’: wild mushroom liquor.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverDorian also understands the power of the front-of-house. Nadena – proficient, relaxed, adept – was a total pleasure to accompany us throughout a dinner full of clarity and intention. And, as Mum said, “not fancy for the sake of it”. With its tremendous glass wine fridge, marble counter and metallic lamps resembling smartly dressed gentlemen observing the room’s checkerboard floor – which itself evokes a modern Versailles (or perhaps Westminster Abbey?) – there is a satisfying air of grandiosity in the room.Our only concern for the evening continued to be the inappropriately loud, relentless thrum of mediocre dance music, a melody befitting neither Mum’s nor my taste, nor the predilections of my predecessor, Jay Rayner.If I can be so bold, I think we all would have preferred some gentle jazz. (I must stress, this is not a Dorian-specific problem, bad music in good restaurants is a consistent institutional failing.)View image in fullscreen‘Smart and privileged’: Crab and pomelo rostiPhotograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThis was not our first Dorian rodeo – so we began with the rostis, which arrived smart and privileged. Max has a superb way with a potato and crème fraîche and caviar. I’d love to tell you about the other dewy, cheesy, truffly situation that sat to my right, but my mother ate it. This is probably a good time to mention that a few years ago my mother went from seafood enthusiast to a person with a seafood allergy (after a particularly violent episode in Antigua with a lobster). It’s all been very upsetting. She has described it as “being broken up with by the best boyfriend you’ve ever had for no reason”. So when fish can be safely enjoyed, my mother’s euphoria is evident.Our tuna crudo, sharp and cleansing, harked back to the lauded tuna tartare of Park Lane’sNobuin the early noughties. Here, too, at Dorian, you feel as if it were sliced from the belly of the beast a mere moment before.Ever since I can remember, my starting point on a menu is the fish. When we step into a restaurant, we are essentially looking for the sublime and rarely do I not find it. Case in point, the turbot. Oh the turbot… if a truly multisensory experience is required for ultimate happiness, this dish was it – my nirvana. Fat steaks of butter-soft fish and verdant green herbaceous sauce. This dish made me happy, it made me want to write poetry. With this dish, one could feel the passion of Caravaggio in Max’s cooking.I’m not sure why neither Mum nor I ordered the steak. Many of the current residing members of Notting Hill arrive at this restaurant for just that. This is a côte de boeuf that has attained that which many of the clientele cannot, Instagram fame combined with a word-of-mouth reverence. It’s decadent, it gleams and it shines as it shows up for our neighbours, a table of four – who ordered the beef and a bottle of barolo – showing the room they knew who they were and the night they wanted to have.Mum and I also know who we are. We’re people who like a gentle broth, one that heals. The wild mushroom liquor, with charred greens and smoked potato, had a welcome fattiness and was inventive and delicious.It was truly lovely to have dinner with my mother at Dorian, at the end of Powis Terrace, the place we called home for so long. We talked about when things around here changed. Something so intangible to begin with. Unfriendliness is what she noticed first. Something so small, that as we all know, can become something so big. I, like so many others, have feared change in my life and tried to hold on to old things. But what I’ve always known is that fundamentally, we are here to share space together, with grace and patience and love. Mum calls it “breaking bread”. Sharing food with each other is love without words and eating together creates space for conversation. Gentrification is not something that we usually talk about. But sometimes, just sometimes,you cantalk about it. Go on, I dare you.This article was amended on 13 April 2025 to replace some words that were omitted during the editing process.Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsThe ObserverFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

The inside story of the boom in luxury food heistsWho would steal 22 tonnes of posh cheese, or £37,000 of smoked salmon? A rise in fraudulent orders for luxury foodstuffs has rattled the industry, leaving artisan producers with unpaid bills and a truckload of questions…Will ColdwellSun 13 Apr 2025 01.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 13 Apr 2025 08.09 EDTShareOne day in October 2024, Chris Swales, 54, a smoked-salmon producer with a confident demeanour and a stubbled jaw, stood at the gates of an industrial estate in east London staking out the units. There were teenagers loitering about, knackered cars, XL Bullies; everyone seemed to have more than one phone. It didn’t seem like the sort of place where nine pallets of frozen fish would be delivered, but – he checked the address he had noted down from the courier – this was the place.A couple of months earlier, Swales couldn’t have imagined that he’d be sniffing around Walthamstow on the hunt for £37,000 in missing produce, yet here he was. In August, he’d received an email – subject: “Collaboration” – from a man named Patrick Moulin, who claimed to be the buyer for Match, a French supermarket. Moulin was looking for an ongoing supplier of smoked salmon and hoped that Swales’s company, theChapel & Swan Smokehousein Exning, Suffolk, would provide it.The orders were big. Notcrazybig, but big enough to make Swales reconfigure the production schedule of his 10-person team to meet it. Over the following weeks they worked “hammer and tongs”, loading up the produce in batches to be frozen and stored at a depot in Grimsby until the total order was completed. Soon enough, Swales was notified that it had been collected and the appropriate paperwork signed.Two weeks later, Swales was still waiting to receive payment. He chased, but when Moulin requested he take payment on receipt of the second batch of smoked salmon – worth another £55,000 – Swales put his foot down: “I was never going to say yes to that.” The line went cold.Calls to Moulin now went unanswered. So Swales phoned Match directly and asked to be put through to their buyer. No, a woman on the other end of the line told him, no one by the name of Moulin here. Swales felt a sense of panic rising. He was determined to find out where the goods went, so the next morning he hopped in his car and sped to London. “I knew something was wrong,” he said. “But still I was thinking to myself, this is very, very odd. I mean, I’ve never heard of anyone stealing frozen smoked salmon before. Why would you want it?” Deep down, he still believed that everything would work out.I knew something was wrong. But still I was thinking to myself, this is very, very oddNow, surveying the units in the yard, he was less sure. None of the units seemed refrigerated, but he spotted a shipping container at the back with a condenser attached, which he reckoned could have done the job. He strode in and a man with a dog approached. “You don’t know anything about a frozen distribution point for a French supermarket?” Swales asked. He was met with an icy stare. “Sorry,” Swales mumbled, “I think I’ve got the wrong address.” He hurried out of the yard and got back in his car, heart racing. The cold reality of what had happened finally sunk in. “I was so furious that I’d been duped,” he says. “Then all these other stories started coming out…”In late October 2024, news broke thatNeal’s Yard Dairy, one of the UK’s best-known purveyors of artisan cheese, had fallen victim to a scam of grand proportions. A fraudulent buyer, who posed – much like Moulin – as a representative for a major French retailer, placed an order for 22 tonnes of award-winning cheddar. A total of 950 clothbound wheels of Hafod, Westcombe and Pitchfork worth £300,000 were delivered to a warehouse in London. By the time Neal’s Yard realised that the buyer was not who they said they were, it was too late.The GreatCheeseRobbery struck a chord, making headlines around the world. “That’s a Lot of Cheddar” read one in theNew York Times. Jamie Oliver put out a warning to his 10.5m Instagram followers. “If anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it’s probably some wrong ’uns,” he said in a video posted to the app. “Are they going to unpeel it from the cloth and cut it and grate it and get rid of it in the fast food industry, in the commercial industry? I don’t know – it feels like a really weird thing to nick.”Something about a crime of this nature captured the imagination. It was both shocking – a friendly independent business, defrauded – and comic, evoking the plot of a Wallace and Gromit film.Foodtheft is often thought of as unserious, but the scale of this offence challenged that assumption. Just as rates of shoplifting were reaching a 20-year high, organised criminals were homing in on big busts of luxury fare, reaffirming the value of a commodity too often taken for granted. These were people with a knowledge of the industry, an eye for high-value produce and the means to shimmy it undetected through blackmarket channels. The correspondence Swales had with Moulin contained a detailed negotiation over quantities and logistics; Neal’s Yard described the fraud as “deceptively convincing”, adding that “Conversations with the alleged representative demonstrated a deep understanding of the sector.”View image in fullscreen‘How are they going to get rid of the cheese? It feels like a really weird thing to nick.’Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The ObserverAccording to a report by the British Standards Institute, food is the commodity “most at risk of theft in global supply chains” and the degree to which it is being targeted has been rising. In 2021, 18% of supply-chain thefts in the UK were related to food and drink. In 2023, this figure had jumped to 24%, with food and drink amounting to a third of all hijacking incidents globally. The price of food rocketed by 25% between 2022 and 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics, and during this period headline-grabbing heists abounded. In Greece, 52 tonnes of olive oil were siphoned from a warehouse in Halkidiki; in Spain, a gourmet food business was robbed of 400 legs of Iberico ham with a total price tag of €200,000. In December 2023, a trailer containing £50,000 worth of cheese was stolen from a service station on the M5 in Worcestershire.Crimes of this sort are not new – £12.5m of maple syrup was stolen from a facility in Canada in 2012 – but in recent years numerous factors have combined to make high-value food far more appealing to criminals. The pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis all drove up food prices, as has the impact of climate change – drought in Spain caused the price of olive oil to jump by 70% in 2023. A decade ago, Russia banned the import of EU food, creating a lucrative hidden market. Many suspect that the cheddar from the Neal’s Yard heist has gone east, where demand for European delicacies remains high. Custom officers in Russia are known to have busted shipments of Dorblu Classic, Formaggio Retinato Leone, Chèvrano XO and Grana Padano, all being smuggled across the border (it’s impossible, it seems, to sanction one’s desire for a cheese plate).Here in the UK, Brexit created an additional vulnerability for what is sometimes described as “European distribution fraud”. As Alice Rizzuti, a criminologist at the University of Hull with a specialism in food crime, told me: “People might have thought being out of the common market would have meant more controls and checks on the border. But, actually, it was the opposite. And because we’re not part of the EU any more, the cooperation with EU counterparts is not as much as it used to be.”Rizzuti tells me that attention to food crime has risen in the past decade, driven primarily by high-profile crimes. It started in 2013, when the UK was roiled by the horse-meat scandal that led two years later to the formation of the National Food Crime Unit, a law enforcement branch of the Food Standards Agency. The tendency to see food crime as less serious, she explains, is one reason that it has been able to proliferate – it’s a lower stakes racket than, say, drug smuggling – and often the crimes are committed by those within the industry who may be otherwise running a legitimate business. “But it is serious,” she says. “Because of the safety, security and reliability of the food market. And whether it is fraud or theft, there are often links to other crime types – organised criminals might be using the profits to commit other crimes.”Whether it is fraud or theft, there are often links to other crime typesFor John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food, it’s the level of sophistication that has changed. Parmigiano Reggiano, he points out, has always been a commodity targeted by thieves, and in 1998 Jamie Montgomery had £30,000 worth of award-winning cheddar stolen from his warehouse in Somerset.Thatgreat cheese robbery (as headlines at the time also cleverly referred to it) was a relatively straightforward smash-and-grab. “But last year,” says Farrand, “it seems like these thieves stepped up the level by which they operated. What they understood about the food that they were stealing and the way they communicated with these small food and drink producers was – dare I say – quite clever. They spoke in the language of a buyer, they provided fake paperwork… I think [this crime] has always been here but it’s got smarter – probably because there’s more money in it for the robbers.”When word got out that Swales had fallen victim to a fraud, his phone started ringing. He began to hear from many other small food producers, some with far worse experiences than his own. There was another smoked salmon producer, he told me, who was bankrupted after losing £80,000 in a similar fashion and had to remortgage his house. Swales was also contacted by a haulage company that had been left with unpaid invoices after delivering huge quantities of alcohol from Ukraine to France over the summer. In that particular case, the name of the customer was familiar: Patrick Moulin.Another producer who got in touch was John Gill fromCoston Hall Dairy, in Norfolk. While he hadn’t been defrauded out of any produce himself – in fact, the farm really only sold small quantities of raw milk from an on-site vending machine – he had fallen victim to an identity theft in which criminals co-opted Coston Hall’s details in order to place dozens of orders for cheese, fruit and meat with different producers around the country. One of the biggest orders, he says, was for a container of salmon for £150,000.Gill only became aware of this, he tells me, when he began receiving phone calls from suppliers who wanted to confirm an order. He came out of a meeting in late November 2024 to find a dozen missed calls. Every day for the next two weeks he’d get several more, each time he’d have to explain and the supplier would cancel the order. He still has no idea how many people got fooled; the scammers, he later discovered, had changed the contact details on Coston Hall’s searchable Google profile, so that if someone used that number to verify an order, they would have been directed right back to the criminals (only those who used the number on their website got through to John). All he could do was try to get the word out through their network – posting on social media and putting a banner on their website. But it was a nerve-racking experience. “It really got in your head,” Gill said. One worry was that they might start hearing from producers expecting them to pay up. His sleep was affected, his ability to trust. “I mean, I don’t even know if you’re who you say you are,” he tells me when we speak over the phone.View image in fullscreenScene of the crime: the police are often left scratching their heads and looking for clues.Illustration: Carl Godfrey/The ObserverAgain, it was a sophisticated operation. The fraudsters took Coston Hall’s details from Companies House, and used a photograph of Gill’s wife in communications, to appear more trustworthy. One producer Gill spoke to was contacted by the scammers several weeks earlier – priming him for a future order – and others were told to prepare for up to £1m worth of future trade. The fraudsters requested 30-day payment terms, or they’d try to pay by credit card and if the supplier did a credit check it would come up fine, since they were using Coston Hall’s details. Gill is certain that during this period the fraudsters themselves phoned the farm, in order to suss out how to evade detection for longer, which he still finds chilling.Just like Swales, Gill believes he was dealing with specialists. According to producers he spoke to, the people on the other end of the line “sounded very genuine. They knew what they were talking about. They knew the industry.” There was a group of around four or five people, he believes, all with Essex accents. The food was all being directed to Southend. Gill suspects the food might be destined for Christmas markets. For smaller quantities, perhaps. But Swales and the cheesemakers affected by the Neal’s Yard theft believe that it would be very difficult to shift this kind of food in the UK once restaurants and retailers were on alert. As Swales points out, it’s a small community. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, so I know most,” he says. “I started sending out warning emails to say if you get offered some frozen smoked salmon without a brand label for the French market, let me know straight away. “I expected someone to go, ‘Yeah I saw some of this at the market last week.’” The fact that they didn’t was another strong indicator that the salmon had left the country.Swales believes that the police could be doing far more to hunt down the perpetrators. He reported the offence to Action Fraud and several weeks later received a response informing him that “It has not been possible to identify a line of enquiry which a law enforcement organisation in the United Kingdom could pursue.” To Swales, this was staggering. There was, he says, a CCTV camera outside the entrance to the industrial estate. All the police would need to do is spot the delivery truck, track the licence plate and they’d be on the tail of his stolen fish. “I was just so angry and upset,” he said. “Inertia and inaction is something I just can’t handle.”When I put this to Action Fraud I was told that “Over 850,000 reports are made to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau every year and not all cases can be passed on for further investigation. Reports are assessed against a number of criteria, but not every case of fraud will result in a judicial outcome.” I also raised it with the National Food Crime Unit, which told me that it takes food crime very seriously and had put out an alert to the industry about last year’s incidents, but that theft and distribution fraud was primarily a police matter. In a statement it said: “Although it’s our view that food fraud in the UK remains at a low level, the drivers and motivations for food fraud are evolving… Food businesses can help ensure they don’t become a victim of theft or fraud by doing their due diligence with suppliers and customers.”Food businesses can help ensure they don’t become a victim of theft or fraud by doing their due diligenceThe investigation into the Neal’s Yard theft, however, has shown some promise. Last October, police in the Met’s Specialist Command Centre arrested a 63-year-old man on suspicion of fraud by false representation and handling stolen goods. In January this year three more men were arrested, all on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and handling stolen goods. “We’re all waiting for the outcome of this,” says Swales.What is certain, though, is that last year’s crime spree has been a wake-up call for artisan and independent food producers. “We’d like it to be taken more seriously by the police,” says Farrand, “because it is theft and it can ruin businesses, and therefore it can ruin people’s lives. But from the other side, the industry needs to be probably a bit more savvy and a bit more aware of these things. There is this lovely trust within our end of food and drink. People transact and try to source from local producers and you do just expect to receive some goods and get an invoice. And that shouldn’t go away because 99.9% of the time everyone is a decent human being. But equally you do need to be on your guard.”It has changed how Swales operates. “I’ve learned to be much more cautious,” he says. “To take things slowly.” Recently he had an inquiry from someone who wanted to buy straight away and he declined. “I could end up putting someone off… especially with fish, where everything is straight away, straight away and there’s this energy, electricity in the business… but now I’m just very suspicious,” he says. “I know it will cost me some money and some opportunities, but I would much rather do that than go through what I’ve been through before.”There is still, he feels, something to feel optimistic about, proud even, as a fine-food producer. After we speak, he sends me a follow-up email. “The rash of fine-food fraud recently points to the quality of food production in the UK these days,” he writes. “Clearly highly valued.”Explore more on these topicsFoodThe ObserverCrimeCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thanks to a run of poor harvests in west Africa, cocoa prices have been on the rise for years now, but things have become particularly acute this year: according to a recent story intheGuardian, prices of popular Easter eggs are up by as much as 50% on last year, yet many have simultaneously shrunk in size. The wine trade, meanwhile, has been enduring its own battle, with duty hikes and the cost of a new environmental levy among other factors pushing prices up. All of which makes port producer Fladgate’s collaboration with Portuguese chocolate brand Vinte Vinte feels like good value: a collection of four 5cl bottles of Taylor’s and Fonseca Port, with four 25g bars of chocolate (£22). A grown-up Easter gift that doubles as an introduction to the joys of wine-and-food matching.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

But the choice of which port does depend on which kind of chocolate: as the Vinte Vinte kit suggests, the darker-coloured, more darkly fruited LBV and reserve styles (such as the exuberant black forest gateau flavours of Fonseca Bin 27 included in the kit, or the vividly fruity Niepoort Ruby Dum Port NV; £19.50,reservewines.co.uk) are better suited to dark chocolate; more mellow, cask-aged Tawny Ports (such as the kit’s 10 Year Old Taylor’s or the gorgeously suave multilayered fruit-and-nuts of Graham’s 10 Year Old Tawny; £20, Waitrose) are better saved up for milk chocolate. Port doesn’t have the monopoly on chocolate combos however. The demerara-and-dates of Pellegrino’s Sicilian fortified wine, marsala can easily sub for tawny, while the luscious pure sweet mulberry of a sweet fortified grenache from Roussillon, such as Mas Amiel Maury 2022 (£20.79, 50cl,adnams.co.uk) can stand in for darker ports.Henriques & Henriques Full Rich Madeira NV (£12.25, 50cl, Waitrose)Easter sweetness isn’t all about chocolate. I have yet to find a satisfactory pairing for my own age-inappropriate Easter Sunday habit of nibbling Haribo and jelly babies, with the closest I’ve come to matching the ruthlessly efficient pleasure centre-targeting mix of refined sugar and industrial-strength tangy acid being the great sweet wines made from riesling in Germany and furmint and other varieties in Tokaj in Hungary. But there are all kinds of possibilities when it comes to finding a wine to drink with the more traditional, almond, marzipan and dried fruit of an Easter Simmel cake, with one of the world’s most unfairly overlooked fortified wines, Madeira from the eponymous Portuguese sub-tropical Atlantic Island, at the top of the list. Henriques & Henriques Full Rich Madeira is rich, full, figgy and sweet but balanced with Madeira’s trademark acidity; Barbeito Malvasia Reserve 5Year Old Madeira (£18.95, 50cl,oxfordwine.co.uk;yorkwines.co.uk) is a swish, electrifying elixir of nuts, dried fruit and golden syrup.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodEasterfeaturesShareReuse this content"
