I think that applies very much in this case.”He later added: “Let’s be clear, Zelenskyy is not a dictator. But it’s only right and proper that Ukrainians have a timeline for elections.”Zelenskyy was elected as Ukrainian president in May 2019. Elections were due in 2024 but not held because of martial law.In a private phone call with Zelenskyy on Wednesday, Keir Starmer expressed his support forUkraineand said it was “perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during world war 2”, according to a Downing Street spokesperson.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, and leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, swiftly made public statements condemning Trump’s remarks. Carla Denyer, the co-leader of the Green party, made a comment criticising the US president’s language shortly before Farage landed in Washington.The defence secretary, John Healey, compared Zelenskyy to Winston Churchill by not holding elections during war time, as Trump repeated his attacks on the Ukrainian leader.Speaking at a press conference in Norway, Healey was asked whether the US still had Europe’s best security interests at heart following Trump’s comments.Healey said: “Europe’s best security interests and America’s best security interests are satisfied by an end to this war in Ukraine and by a strong, unified Nato.“That’s an argument that we are having and have discussed with the Americans and will continue to make.”He later added: “This was a man who, stuck in his country, led his country, and still does. He was elected.”Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

But we expect to hear more than the Russian gentleman’s tired fabrications.”The UK is attempting to tread a fine diplomatic line between supporting Ukraine and not offending the US president, Donald Trump, who is seeking a deal to end the three-year war.Trump has struck out alone in recent days by opening negotiations with Russia without including Ukraine or other European allies. In an escalation of tensions between Washington and Kyiv,Trump claimed president Vlodymyr Zelenskyy is a dictatorwith low opinion ratings who has avoided holding an election. Meetings between the US envoy Keith Kellogg and Zelenskyy in Kyiv ended with a cancelled press conference on Thursday.Starmer is due to meet Trump on Thursday in a week of frantic diplomatic activity which will see the French president, Emmanuel Macron, also visit the White House on Monday. The prime minister’s approach is to “take the heat out” of the row between Trump and Zelenskyy,who has described the US president as living in a “disinformation bubble”.On Thursday Macron said he would seek to convince Trump that showing weakness to Putin would make it harder for the US to confront China and curb Iran’s nuclear programme.“I will tell [him]: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of [Putin]. It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s not in your interests,” Macron said.“How can you be credible with China if you’re weak with Putin? And you, who doesn’t want Iran to get the nuclear bomb, you can’t be weak with someone who is helping it to get one.”Starmer has not publicly spoken about the war of words between Trump and Zelenskyy before his meeting with the US president next week but description of the Ukraine leader as a dictator has been met with widespread political condemnation among western allies.A Downing Street spokesperson said on Wednesday that Starmer had expressed his support for Zelenskyy in a phone call, describing him as “Ukraine’s democratically elected leader” and made the point it was acceptable to suspend elections in war time, as Winston Churchill did during the second world war.Among those publicly contradicting Trump were the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, who said“let’s be clear: Zelenskyy is not a dictator”, and the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, who said Trump was “not right” in his comments about the Ukrainian leader.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told the BBC on Thursday that Zelenskyy was elected. “We know from our recent history here in the United Kingdom, in Northern Ireland last time Labour was in power, that commenting on every up and down, every word that is said is not the way to get a solution,” she said.She added: “We’re clear, and the prime minister is clear, that we’ve got to take the heat out of this situation.”On Thursday night Elon Musk said Trump was “right to ignore” Zelenskyy, who he claimed was “despised” by the Ukrainian people.“If Zelenskyy was actually loved by the people of Ukraine, he would hold an election,” Musk posted on X. “He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he cancelled the election.”At Starmer’s meeting in Washington, the prime minister will push for the US to help provide security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with Russia, with discussions about higher European defence spending also likely to be on the agenda.Trump has demanded higher European defence spending, saying the US has had enough of supporting Ukraine militarily. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, warned adding to defence spending would require “difficult decisions, across the board” to balance the books, raising the prospect of further tax increases or spending cuts at the spending review.“The world is changing rapidly, and the importance of keeping us safe is not up for grabs,” she said. “The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. That will require difficult choices, right across the board, but you can’t have a strong economy, you can’t have strong public services unless we are properly defended as a country and protect our national security.”Suggesting a plan was being readied to increase spending on defence to 2.5% of GDP, the chancellor said: “We will set out the path to that in the proper way. But no one should be in any doubt about my commitment and this government’s commitment to spend more money on defence.”Government sources signalled an announcement would come alongside its strategic defence review, being led by the former Labour defence secretary and Nato chief George Robertson, which is due to complete this spring.Tax rises, more borrowing, and spending cuts could all be on the table as options, but Ed Balls, the former Treasury minister and an ex shadow chancellor, told the Political Currency podcast that there was a case of breaking the fiscal rules to borrow more to fund an exceptional need for higher defence spending.“I think that is much more credible than a massive tax rise, and I think it’s much more credible than undeliverable public spending cuts the markets won’t believe in,” he said.Starmer had suggested over the weekend that the UK could be prepared to contribute to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine.Meanwhile, Moscow repeated warnings on Thursday that any British plan to send troops to Ukraine as part of a potential peacekeeping mission would be unacceptable to Russia. Germany has suggested that talk of European troops in Ukraine is “premature”.Later, John Healey, the defence secretary, told a press conference in Norway that the idea of peacekeeping forces was “jumping ahead of ourselves”, as formal negotiations have not started and Ukraine needed to be involved in the final talks.Healey said: “Our prime minister had made the commitment that if we reach a ceasefire, we reach an end to the fighting, security guarantees will be needed and Britain is ready to play a full part in that and we’re leading some of the detailed discussions about what may be needed, but I am certainly not going to give you any detail that is going to make President Putin the wiser.”On Zelenskyy, Healey said the Ukrainian leader was “the elected leader of Ukraine, and he’s done what Winston Churchill did in Britain in the second world war, suspended elections while at war. And our job is to stand with the Ukrainians, support the Ukrainians, support them in their fight. And if they choose to talk, support them in the negotiations as well.”Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyUkraineVladimir PutinKeir StarmerForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Those affected are legally certified as blind from birth.But after doctors injected healthy copies of the gene into their eyes with keyhole surgery that took just 60 minutes, four children can now see shapes, find toys, recognise their parents’ faces, and in some cases, even read and write.“The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives,” said Prof Michel Michaelides, a consultant retinal specialist at Moorfields Eye hospital and professor of ophthalmology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology.“We have, for the first time, an effective treatment for the most severe form of childhood blindness, and a potential paradigm shift to treatment at the earliest stages of the disease.”Four children aged between one and two from the US, Turkey and Tunisia were selected by specialists from Moorfields and UCL in 2020. The operations were carried out at London’s Great Ormond Street hospital.LiveDoctors in London cure blindness in children with rare condition – video reportHealthy copies of the AIPL1 gene, contained in a harmless virus, were injected into the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye.The gene is vital for the function of photoreceptors, light-sensing cells in the retina that convert light into electrical signals that the brain interprets as vision.The therapy was only administered into one eye per patient to overcome any potential safety issues. The children were then followed up for five years. The results werepublished in the Lancet journal.Prof James Bainbridge, consultant retinal surgeon at Moorfields and professor of retinal studies at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said children born with LCA can distinguish only light and dark, and what little sight they do have they will lose within a few years.“Some children are even able to read and write following the intervention which is something that one would absolutely not expect in this condition, untreated.”The parents of one of the children described the results as “pretty amazing” and said they felt “lucky” to have benefited. Their six-year-old son Jace, who was two when he was treated, can now pick tiny things up off the floor and identify toys at a distance.Brendan and DJ, who did not wish to share their surname, travelled from Connecticut in the US for the treatment in September 2020.“Pre-surgery, at around two years old, you could have held up any object, even a couple of inches away from Jace’s face, and he would not be able to track it,” said DJ. “It didn’t matter how bright it was, what colour it was, what shape it was.“And now we get calls and notes home from school that he’s stealing phones out of teachers’ back pockets, which is hysterical to us.”Brendan said he noticed a difference within the first month when his son reacted to the sun shining through a window. “He kind of pulled himself back. It wasn’t just even an eye shut, it was more of a physical reaction.“And I remember welling up and getting really emotional because that was the first time that Jace ever had any reaction to any sort of light stimulus or anything of the sort. From there, it’s been pretty amazing.”UCL developed the treatment using a special licence granted by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and backed by gene therapy company MeiraGTx.Since the four children received the therapy, a further seven have been treated at Evelina London Children’s Hospital by specialists from St Thomas’ hospital, Great Ormond Street and Moorfields.Explore more on these topicsBlindness and visual impairmentChildren's healthMedical researchGene editingChildrenHealthGeneticsnewsShareReuse this content"

He subsequently became unwell and was pronounced dead at 1.53pm.An investigation has begun into his death, with the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) carrying out independent inquiries into the incident.The man’s family were being supported by specialist officers and updated on the progress of the investigation.An IOPC spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we are independently investigating the circumstances of a 27-year-old man’s death following his arrest by Border Force officers at Manchester airport on Wednesday 19 February.“Our investigation follows a referral from the Home Office which detailed how the man was due to travel from the airport on Wednesday and was stopped after displaying unusual behaviour.“He was subsequently arrested by officers and taken to a holding area where he became unwell and paramedics were called. Sadly, he was pronounced dead at 1.53pm.“After being notified of the man’s death, we declared an independent investigation into the circumstances at 4.29pm on Wednesday. IOPC investigators were sent to the scene to begin gathering evidence.”The IOPC’s director, Amanda Rowe, said: “First and foremost, our thoughts are with the man’s family and loved ones, as well as all those affected by his death.“When someone dies after being taken into custody, it is important for there to be a thorough investigation to understand what has happened.“We have been in touch with the man’s family to explain our role and will keep them updated as the investigation progresses.

Claire Holland, the chair of London Councils umbrella group, said: “These figures show almost a quarter of town halls in London would face financial collapse without emergency borrowing.”Jim McMahon, the minister for local government, said: “We are under no illusion of the state of council finances and have been clear from the outset on our commitment to get councils back on their feet and rebuild the foundation of local government.“We are working with local leaders, encouraging councils to come in confidence where needed to seek help and be assured we will offer a relationship of partnership – not punishment – in our joint mission to improve public services for communities and create economic stability.”Astatementfrom the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said reform of council finances “would take time” and there was “potential for continued instability” in the months and years ahead.Hampshire county council, which applied for EFS support in the form ofa 15% council tax risefor the next two years, had its bid rejected by ministers earlier this month.The 50% year-on-year increase in the number of EFS packages reflects rapidly deteriorating municipal balance sheets at councils all overEngland, in rural and urban areas, regardless of local political control.Upper-tier council balance sheets do not currently reflectsoaring deficitsin special educational needs spending, which are effectively kept off the books under special accounting rules due to come to an end in just over a year’s time.EFS support packages have proliferated since being introduced in 2021. Then, the tiny handful of EFS recipients had sought help after declaring effective bankruptcy as a result of risky property investments.Now most councils granted EFS are thought to be generally well-run victims of years of the structural underfunding that accompanied austerity, high inflation costs, as well assoaring demandfor adult social care, child protection and homelessness services.The EFS approach goes against good accounting practice, and is seen by critics as a short-term fix that avoids effective insolvency by loading councils with debts. Many believe Labour’s ambition to tackle local government finance will fail without changes to council tax.Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentEconomicsAusteritySpecial educational needsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

There were 477 stolen last week – they cost £4.50 each.”View image in fullscreenManeki-neko are seen as a symbol of good luck in Japanese culture.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThis amount would mean the chef lost a total of £2,146.50 during one week.The City of London police said it had not received any reports of theft from the restaurant.The maneki-neko figurines are believed by some within Japanese culture to bring good luck and have been a feature in the Lucky Cat restaurants.Reflecting on his empire of more than 80 restaurants globally, Ramsay said: “It does get a bit scary, in terms of how big it is and the global impact.“The team are incredible and there are some amazing chefs throughout.“Opening, in 1998, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, I would never have thought it would be here today – this year we celebrated 24 years at three star Michelin.”Ramsay also told Ross that his daughter Holly Ramsay, 25, and Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty are planning a “Christmas wedding”.Peaty, 30, did not seek his permission but did talk to him about the engagement. “He said ‘Holly is just the perfect woman. I’d like to get your blessing – from you and Tana for her hand in marriage’. It was that sort of amazing moment. Everything went quiet.

Hope I haven’t woken you,” the MP begins. “I’m stuck in a brothel in Bayswater and I’ve run out of money … I met a woman as I left the Carlton Club who offered me a drink, but I now think she is a KGB agent. She wants £500 and has left me in a room with 12 naked women and a CCTV.”Hart tells the MP to sit tight and calls his special adviser, Emma, who “offers to leave her house and go personally to Bayswater on an extraction mission”. They decide against this but instead send a taxi to extract the MP and return him to his hotel.Hart is asleep when the MP calls again at 4.10am. He has made it back to his hotel but not without a further twist. “I slipped out of the room and saw the taxi Emma ordered across the road, so I legged it over and jumped in,” he tells Hart. “However, it turned out it was a different taxi being driven by an Afghan agent called Ahmed … He demanded £3,000 for a blow job.”Asked what he did, the MP tells Hart: “I legged it back to the hotel and locked the door.”Demands for peerages and knighthoodsPoliticians brazenly asking for honours is a recurring feature of the book. In April 2024, Hart met one Conservative MP who was first elected in 2019 in a safe seat — which they now wanted to trade for the House of Lords.“Give me a peerage and I will give up my safe seat,” this MP said. Told this was not an option, the response was: “Well, you are all bastards and this is unfair.”A few months earlier on 1 February 2024, Hart recalls a meeting of the honours committee where “one prominent Labour MP seeking an upgrade to his knighthood gets defeated” and a Conservative MP’s campaign for a CBE “gets similar short shrift by the lay members” — apparently amid vague rumours of wrongdoing by said MP on a foreign trip.Boris Johnson and the privileges committeeOn 7 June 2023, Hart gets a call fromHarriet Harmanwho tells him the privileges committee she chairs will publish its report on Boris Johnson later that month and hand it to him that week.Harman discloses that the report will recommend a 20-day suspension for Johnson, which will almost certainly result in him facing a recall motion and by-election. (As it happened Johnson quit parliament after being handed the findings).Hart speaks to Johnson, who begins “questioning whether there is any procedural route by which we can kill off the report or at least vote it down”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He reminds Johnson that it was he who set up the process, approved its terms of reference and accepted Harman as chair. “But I was in India and I wasn’t concentrating,” Johnson replies. “I left it all to the whips.”Reshuffle talesView image in fullscreenRishi Sunak and Suella Braverman clashed frequently during her time as home secretary.Photograph: Phil Noble/APThe book lifts the lid on Sunak’s cabinet reshuffles and deteriorating relationship with his first home secretary,Suella Braverman. Days after being appointed she got into trouble for leaking confidential information to Tory backbencher John Hayes, an ally of hers, but she survives the scandal.She survives the February 2023 reshuffle as well, though Hart recalls how “one lucky cabinet appointee is less grateful than her promotion deserves”. The three female cabinet ministers who were given promotions in that reshuffle were Kemi Badenoch, Michelle Donelan and Lucy Frazer.“Let’s all agree about one thing,” Sunak said about the female minister in question. “She is fucking useless but we can’t get rid of her.”Half a year later,Sunak is ready to sack Braverman. In the room with the closest members of his team, the prime minister puts her on speakerphone as “all hell breaks loose” and she begins a “ghastly ten-minute diatribe of vindictive and personal bile”.Getting food delivered in Downing StreetThe book also reveals the more prosaic side of being prime minister.It was 9pm and Sunak was meeting close aides in his office when his phone rang. The room sat in silence as he had “a rather oblique conversation with someone in which he tells them to ‘take the package to the black gates halfway up Whitehall and someone will meet you’”.Sounding “faintly alarmed”, Rupert Yorke, Sunak’s deputy chief of staff, asked for an explanation. It turned out to be the prime minister’s Nando’s order. According to Hart, Yorke reminded him that “as PM he can ask other people to do that kind of thing, but he seemed rather hurt by the suggestion”.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsBoris JohnsonRishi SunakSuella BravermanHarriet HarmannewsShareReuse this content"

Here comes the supermarket bridesmaid gownThe cost of living crisis isn’t going away but neither are weddings. With budgets being slashed, even supermarkets are coming for the bridal marketChloe Mac DonnellThu 20 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 12.03 ESTShareFirst came the supermarket wedding dress. The next unexpected item in the bagging area? A bridesmaid dress. From next month, alongside eggs and loo roll, bridesmaids-to-be doing the weekly shop at Asda can pick up a dress with the launch of its first bridesmaid range. Available in sizes UK8 to 24, the collection starts at £24 for a satin halterneck dress. The retail giant says the launch was prompted by demand from consumers with searches for bridesmaid dresses up 69% year on year.While most people are thrilled to be a bridesmaid, the excitement can be somewhat diminished by the cost involved. Social media is rife with bridesmaid horror stories of what brides have expected their friends to pick up the costs for. My own quick straw poll found dozens of tales of brides dictating what bridesmaids could wear. Even though it wasn’t something the bridesmaid wanted to wear or would wear again, they were expected to cover the costly bill. The expense is often in addition to hen parties followed by travel, accommodation, hair and makeup for the wedding itself.As a result, the high street has emerged as a more affordable alternative. For those without a particular brief, resale sites and rental platforms can also prove fruitful. ASOS launched its first dedicated bridesmaid category in 2015, followed by Whistles in 2017. Other retailers such as John Lewis curate an edit of dresses that could be suitable for a wedding without being bridesmaid specific. With supermarkets already experiencing success with their existing clothing offerings (Sainsbury’s TU clothing becamea £1bn brand in 2022) it appears their next target is the budget bridal market.View image in fullscreenGeorge at Asda bridesmaid dress multiway £32.Photograph:  /PR imageDelia Phillips, senior buying and design director at George at Asda, describes the collection as “pocket-friendly and size-inclusive”. It follows the release of its £60 wedding dress in 2006 (it sold out within hours) and a line of bridal lingerie first released in 2012. Last September Sainsbury’s TU followed suit,releasing a £22 wedding dress. Phillips says its low-cost bridesmaid collection has “been carefully curated to reflect this season’s most popular wedding themes, offering a range of elegant designs for the entire bridesmaid party”. The four different dress styles come in three colours – navy, blush pink and sage – a popular colour palette for spring and summer weddings. Its most expensive option, at £32, can be styled four different ways.According to research,the average cost of a weddingin 2025 is £25,625, a 3.7% rise from 2024 figures. But now, withinflation at an unexpected 10-month high, those figures could rise again. Many bridal parties will be looking to reduce costs. An expensive dress that is generally only worn for a couple of hours could be the first item to be culled. With the emergence of dupe culture, where many consumers fail to tell the difference between a designer item and a similar cheaper iteration, perhaps a supermarket dress for less than £40 could be the next humble bridal brag.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He spent his days playing table tennis and cards with fellow servicemen.“The facilities were clean and good overall, and the sun was shining,” he said. Still, he complained that he did not receive the medical treatment typically expected at a sanatorium, while the meals were “tasteless and lacked meat”.He and the other soldiers were forbidden from wandering outside in the evenings or making contact with locals. Alcohol was also hard to come by, he added.‘When has Russia ever kept its promises?’: Ukrainians furious over Trump’s plan to end warRead moreSince the start of the war, hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers have returned home, many participating in government-funded programmes for rehabilitation.Russian government organisations for veterans, which oversee trips to the hundreds of sanatoriums across the country, have not publicly promoted the trips to North Korea, nor has any footage of the visits been released.But in an interview published this month, Russia’s ambassador to Pyongyang said that “hundreds of Russian soldiers” who fought in Ukraine were “undergoing rehabilitation in North Korean sanatorium and medical facilities”.“The treatment, the care, the food – everything related to staying in North Korea was absolutely free,” the ambassador, Aleksandr Matsegora,toldthe government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.The statements were noteworthy as one of the first public acknowledgments from either side of North Korea’s tangible support for its ally’s war effort.“When we offered to compensate our [North Korean] friends for at least part of their expenses, they were genuinely offended and asked us never to do it again,” Matsegora said.The extent and impact of North Korea’s role in providing medical and rehabilitation services to Russian soldiers remain unknown.Pyongyang’s healthcare system has been strained under international sanctions, while language and cultural barriers could further hinder treatment – especially given the wide range of physical and psychological conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, that many soldiers endure.It is unclear whether severely wounded Russian soldiers have received treatment in North Korean hospitals or if any health centres beyond Wonsan have accommodated servicemen.Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.So far, North Korean medical outreach appears to be relatively small-scale and restricted to servicemen from Russia’s far east, which has a short land border with North Korea.A representative of a Russian tour agency, which facilitated soldiers’ trips last summer, told the Guardian that the tours were exclusively for servicemen from Russia’s far east and accommodated only a few hundred participants.But the representative said North Korea had the capacity to “welcome many, many more Russian soldiers”.North Korea plans to open a long-promised “luxury beachfront” resort on the Kalma Peninsula near Wonsan this year. North Korean state media claim the complex includes about 150 hotels and can accommodate tens of thousands of visitors. Russian media have promoted it as a potential tourist destination.Some observers suggested that Russia could be sending its military to North Korea under the cover of medical help.“The arrival of combat-experienced Russian soldiers, particularly if they include officers or noncommissioned officers, to North Korea may allow the Russian military to work with North Korean forces and disseminate lessons from the war in Ukraine while ostensibly recuperating,” the Washington-based Institute for the Study of Warwrotein its report last week.3:14Why are North Korean soldiers entering Russia's war against Ukraine? – video explainerNot far from where the soldiers were staying in Wonsan, North Korea also organised a summer camp for the children of Russian servicemen who died in the war in Ukraine.Duringa trip to Pyongyangin June last year, Putin first mentioned the summer camp, thanking “comrade Kim Jong-un for organising the holiday of the children of killed participants of the special military operation in the Korean camp Songdowon”.Russia has a longstanding connection with the Songdowon summer camp, which Russian children visited even before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.In contrast to the medical trips, Russian media have openly covered the visits to North Korean summer camps,publishing picturesof children posing in front of statues of the country’s leaders.“Undoubtedly, one of the advantages of the trip was the lack of connectivity. It turned into a complete two-week digital detox from all outside information,” one young female participant of the summer camp in 2024told a regional outletin Yekaterinburg, a Russian city in the Urals.Describing North Korean children, the girl noted that it was “very unusual to see how they marched in unison, played musical instruments as instructed and did everything together”.Aleksei, the soldier, said he was not sure he would return to North Korea for another trip if given the chance. “I’d rather recover closer to home, somewhere more familiar,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaNorth KoreaVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ratings are in freefall; once the most watched thing on TV, these days the soap is lucky if it cracks the top 20. But an anniversary like this gives EastEnders an opportunity to not only celebrate itself, but to reaffirm its own mission statement. And it has gone about this by going on an absolute tear.With little else to lose, EastEnders has spent the last few weeks wildly swinging for the fences. Don’t mistake this for hyperbole, either. Just look at last Thursday’s episode where – and I promise I’m not making any of this up – Phil Mitchell embarked on a long monologue about all the different things he’s survived (alcoholism, drug addiction, illness, heart attacks, an actual shooting), then travelled back in time and murdered a younger version of himself, before the ghost of his dead mother arrived and urged him to kill himself. It was utterly bizarre, but it was also incredible. Had a big budget streaming show attempted something this daring, it would be lauded to the heavens. But this is old workday EastEnders, and so the whole thing passed without comment.Still, this impeccable form meant that EastEnders went into Thursday full of confidence. And it needed it, because this was the big anniversary live episode. In the past, live episodes of EastEnders have been marked by a pleasing shonkiness, with actors forgetting lines, or visibly twitching when they’re supposed to be dead, or calling Ian Beale by his actor’s name and then looking more terrified than any human in all of history. Still, even by previous standards, this episode had an awful lot of ground to cover.The Vic had been destroyed (again), trapping a number of characters, one of whom was in labour. But also to clear up was the aftermath of a six-week whodunnit about Cindy Beale’s attempted murder to deal with (she had already died once before; but forget it: it’s Walford). Plus, there was the continuing saga of Phil Mitchell’s efforts to kill himself and a brand new Bandersnatchesque twist where viewers got to decide which hunk Denise Fox should end up with. All said, it was shaping up to be spectacular.But then came the reality. There was no Cindy in the live episode and, aside from one very brief shot at the end, no Phil either. Anyone expecting any more time-travelling homicides will have come away bitterly disappointed. The Denise storyline was something of a damp squib, too. After a weirdly breezy pep talk from Linda Carter (who was somehow able to brush off the fact that the pub she used to work in had just exploded, at the exact same time that she watched Phil Mitchell attempt to shoot himself in the head), she knocked on the door of the hunk she had the least sexual chemistry with, and that was that.Sonia’s birth was also dealt with in a strangely businesslike manner, save for the fact that she named her baby Julia, after the show’s co-creator Julia Smith. Instead, the bulk of the episode was devoted to a number of romantic exchanges between Martin Fowler (trapped under a girder) and Stacey Slater (much less trapped under a girder). The reason for this quickly became apparent; a paramedic stated that Martin would probably die once the girder was lifted. Spoiler – he did.It was all very sad but, for those of you keeping score, live EastEnders episodes are now officially a very bad time to be Stacey Slater’s romantic interest. Her boyfriend Bradley Branning died on the 25th anniversary, and now Martin’s gone too. Just as a piece of practical advice, whoever ends up with Stacey next should probably give serious consideration to booking a nice long holiday for the duration of February 2035. Better to be safe than sorry, after all.Storylines aside, though, the main takeaway of the episode was how extraordinarily proficient it all was. The performances and execution were flawless. Not a single thing went wrong. It is the first time that EastEnders has properly nailed a live episode. So while it might not have been particularly memorable, from a technical standpoint this was a clear demonstration that EastEnders knows exactly what it’s doing.The hope must have been that this experiment would put more eyeballs on EastEnders. Regardless of what happened in the episode itself, you’d have to hope that it works. It might no longer be the ratings behemoth it once was, but this was proof that EastEnders still has an awful lot to be proud of.EastEnders Live aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsEastEndersTelevisionSoap operaDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the foreign secretary makes a speech to theG20in South Africa and someone forgot to switch on the televised stream, did it really happen?This was meant to be David Lammy’s big day out. His Foreign Office team had briefed in advance that this was to be his most forceful intervention on Ukraine yet. No more Mr Nice Guy. No more couching his words in the language of twisted diplomacy. Just shooting from the hip. Telling it as it is. Leaving every other foreign minister at the summit in Johannesburg gasping for breath.Only it didn’t work out like that. The waiting world tuned in to the G20 YouTube channel in the middle of the afternoon. Expecting fireworks. Except the only video stream available was a recording of some politicians arriving at the venue earlier in the day. We waited. And waited. Still nothing. Perhaps a private meeting had overrun. An arm-wrestling contest between Big Dave and Sergei Lavrov?Not exactly. Eventually it became clear. Someone apologetically admitted they had forgotten to turn on the power at the mains. The cameras had recorded nothing. In desperation, the Foreign Office sent around a readout. Lammy had spoken. And he had been forthright. The bravest of the brave. We just had to take their word on this. It had all really happened. We hadn’t slipped into a parallel universe.Nor had Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, taken it lying down. He had left the room rather than sit there while Lammy laid into his country. And him. Dave hadn’t minced his words. Russia had learned nothing. It had no respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty. No sympathy for the innocent victims of aggression. No readiness for a durable peace. All we had heard from Russia was the logic of imperialism dressed up as realpolitik. Britain was ready to listen to a way forward that respected Ukraine’s sovereignty. But all he had heard was tired fabrications.Strong stuff. We checked the transcript. The speech seemed a bit on the short side. Had there been a mistake somewhere? Had 10 minutes of a blank screen been erased from history? The bit where Lammy questioned the interventions of the US: Donald Trump acting as Vladimir Putin’s Useful Idiot. Ceding sovereignty of Ukrainian land to the Russians. CallingPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator. Criticising Ukraine for not holding elections while the war was still going on. Holding peace talks without allowing the Ukrainians to be present.But no. It turned out Lammy hadn’t been quite that brave. Couldn’t quite make the connection that one of the reasons Russia behaves the way it does is because it knows it has the active encouragement of the Americans. We are seeing a shift in the world order. It is no longer the US and Europe against Russia. It’s the US and Russia against Europe. Dictators United. Yet the UK clings to the past. Willing it not to be true. So for Trump there can be no cross word. Just a slightly sad, quizzical eyebrow. Really, Donald? Really?As for The Donald himself, he was taking a few hours out of his schedule in which he had declared himself King to catch some shut-eye. To think of his next move. So it was left to the US vice-president,JD Vance, to fill the gap with an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington. Where he was interviewed by a fawning Mercedes Schlapp, the former White House director of strategic communications.Schlapp couldn’t have been more excited to have Vance there. It was all she could do to stop herself curling up at his feet in adoration. “Can I be your best friend?” she begged. “P-L-E-A-S-E.”This was less interview, more extreme love-bombing. Where JD got whoops of applause just for talking in fully formed sentences. It’s more than The Donald can manage I suppose. It seems that many on the right, in the US and the UK, have abandoned any pretence of critical thinking. No serious questioning is allowed. If Trump has said something then it must be true. If necessary, reality must be bent to conform to the presidential vision. The power of reason has been suspended. We are living in the world’s most influential echo chamber.“Do you know what the day is?!” screamed Schlapp. “It’s the one-month anniversary of the inauguration. Isn’t that amazing?”Cue screams and gasps from Mercedes and the audience. And do you know what tomorrow will be? The month and a day anniversary. Vance was in his element. There’s nothing he likes more than the feeling of smoke being blown up his ass. Normally vice-presidents feel like no-marks. If he plays his cards right and follows the Trumpian script, he gets to have his supporters.So Vance droned on and on. The Donald was the Messiah. His only mission was to bring security and prosperity to the American people. Then a few words on Ukraine. By now familiar. Trump was a master negotiator. Only he could bring peace. He alone had the leadership. Civilisation was at risk if European leaders didn’t bend to his will.All of which went totally unchallenged. Not a mild inquiry why the “world’s best deal maker” had surrendered all his bargaining chips to the Russians before the negotiations had even started. But then, maybe Schlapp just doesn’t care. If it’s good enough for Trump, it’s good enough for her.One person we didn’t hear from was Keith Kellogg, The Donald’s envoy to Ukraine. He had been due to give a press conference after meeting Zelenskyy in Kyiv but cancelled it. The damn Ukrainian and European media aren’t quite so servile and might have had a few words to say about Trump’s abusive remarks about Zelenskyy.And then there wasNigel Farage. Turning up like a bad smell in Washington for CPAC. Nige has been uncharacteristically quiet on Ukraine. He knows most Britons have no time for Trump’s interventions on Ukraine, but can’t quite bring himself to criticise the US King. So he belatedly mumbled something equivocal. Zelenskyy wasn’t a dictator but Trump was right about everything else.Nige, The Donald doesn’t love you. He doesn’t even think about you. You’re nothing to him. He’s a mentally unwell narcissist. The sycophancy just washes over him. You’re just another court jester who can be dropped at any time. Have some self-respect.Do you ever get the feeling that the world is going to shit?Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyThe politics sketchG20Donald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

The 81-year-old’s bright orange family motor sits perilously close to a hole in the ground that, since Monday, has continued to get bigger.Her husband summed up how the couple felt about the prospect of losing their trusty four-wheeler. “It’s not the end of the world,” said Iain Pavely, 83. “We don’t drive around in it much.”View image in fullscreenIain Pavely, 83 and Fran Pavely, 81.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianThe couple live a stone’s throw away from a sinkhole that has captured the nation’s attention. It first appeared in the quaint village of Godstone,Surrey, on Monday night.At first, it caused the taps of many in the village to run dry. But on Tuesday, concerns deepened after the hole grew by 20 metres. Cables were exposed and homes close to the sinkhole were evacuated amid concerns of an explosion. One resident’s back garden was even enveloped by the expanding hole.In efforts to halt the spread of the sinkhole, the high street where it first appeared has been closed off. Some locals might not be able to return to their homes for months.The village, which is near the A25, has been a thoroughfare since the middle ages. Now, instead of the pitter patter of horse and carriage, the road that runs through Godstone often sees HGVs and other heavy duty vehicles.For some, the road closures have provided some respite. “When big lorries pass, our whole house shakes,” said Ieuan Newman, 28.View image in fullscreenIeuan Newman.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianHe lives a short distance from the sinkhole but he is not too worried about his home, which dates back to the 19th century. He said: “This house has been here longer than anyone on this planet. I’m not worried about it going anywhere.”Godstone sits on a network of tunnels and sand mines that date back to the 17th century. Some locals think this might be part of the reason behind the sinkhole. Newman’s partner, Bethany, said: “There was a song we would sing at primary school about not building your house on sandy land.”The couple has been surprised by the nationwide attention the sinkhole has received. Newman said: “Yesterday it was a circus. I thought it was just ridiculous, there were even helicopters.”Some outlets have even livestreamed aerial footage of the sinkhole. “I was caught walking the dog down the road on a live stream,” said Bethany. “It’s really funny, it’s just a hole in the road.”Kath Bourg, 63, lives just in front of the cordon and next to the entrance of a network of underground caves. “I’m bricking it. I live over the caves so it’s quite scary. I’ve got a backpack just in case I get evacuated as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what I’ve learned about buffets, ‘clean eating’ and what not to serve food onJay RaynerMuch has changed in the food world but there are a few truths that still holdThu 20 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 11.49 ESTShareIhave been writing this column for 15 years. That means there have been 180 of them, filled with wisdom, insight, whimsy, prejudice, contradiction and sometimes just outrageous stupidity, all of it interrogating the way we cook and eat now. As this is my last of these columns I thought, as a service, I should summarise the key points. Are you ready? Good. Let’s go.Individual foods are not pharmaceuticals; just eat a balanced diet. There is nothing you can eat or drink that will detoxify you; that’s what your liver and kidneys are for. No healthy person needs to wear a glucose spike monitor; it’s a fad indulged by the worried well. As is the cobblers of being interested in “wellness”, because nobody is interested in “illness”. People have morals but food doesn’t, so don’t describe dishes as “dirty”. And stop it with the whole “clean eating” thing. It’s annoying and vacuous.Fat is where the flavour is and salt is the difference between eating in black and white and eating in Technicolor, even if your cardiologist would disagree. Brown foods and messy foods are the best foods, and picnics are a nightmare. Buffets are where good taste goes to die. Most dishes can be improved with the addition of bacon. The kitchen knives in holiday rentals are always terrible; take your own. Hyper-expensive foods are never about deliciousness; they are about status. Don’t bother with them. Bechamel sauce is easy to make; just follow the damn recipe.Gravy stains down your shirt are not a source of embarrassment; they are a badge of honourOften, good food takes a while to cook and sometimes it requires skill; all those cookbooks with words like “simple” and “express” in the title may not be your friend. If we’re going to slaughter animals for our dinner, we have a responsibility to eat as much of that animal as we can, including the inner wobbly bits. Some of the best foods carry with them the faint whiff of death. Making chutney at home from your allotment glut is a lovely hobby, but you really don’t have to share what you’ve made with your neighbours.Tipping should be abolished. It’s wrong that restaurant staff should be dependent on the mood of the customer for the size of their wage. They should be paid properly. It works in Japan, France and Australia. It can work in the UK. All new restaurants should employ someone over 50 to check whether the print on the menu is big enough to be read, the lighting bright enough for it to be read by and the seats comfortable enough for a lengthy meal. If a waiter has to explain the “concept” behind a menu there is something wrong with the menu.By all means serve small sharing plates, but make sure the table is big enough for all the dishes that are going to arrive, and they come out in an order that makes sense. The kind of wines that natural-wine fans adore smell of uncleaned pig’s bottom and are horrible. Waiters should always write down orders. Eating alone in a restaurant is dinner with someone you love and a delicious opportunity for people watching. Great food can be found in the scuzziest of places. Gravy stains down your shirt are not a source of embarrassment; they are a badge of honour. Expensive restaurants are wasted on the people who can afford them. And food should always, always, be served on plates. Not on slates. Not on garden trowels. Not on planks. On plates. Give or take, that’s all the advice and invective I have for you. Thank you so much for reading.Explore more on these topicsFoodHappy eaterRestaurantscommentShareReuse this content"

I love them both and we live in a mostly happy family with their dad, my partner.We had our children in our early 30s, without really thinking about it or talking it through. I have struggled to find peace with my role as a parent and, though I love my kids, I am increasingly envious of my single friends.School holidays and weekends feel like an endless burden. When Monday comes around I’m relieved and re-energised as I’m at work and away from the kids. I feel guilty about this but, if I’m honest, I’d say I don’t enjoy having small children. I hate role playing, hide and seek, etc, and I leave all of that to my partner. I dread being left alone with the kids as I feel I can’t meet their constant demands and expectations of me. I find myself giving them more junk food and screen time than I know is healthy, just so that I can be alone in my room.How can I accept my life as a parent when deep down I regret having kids? Do you have any advice on how to accept my predicament?Eleanor says:People think becoming a parent automatically transforms you into someone who enjoys parenting. I don’t know why we believe that. Some people see their child and feel a bolt from the heavens but some people just don’t. Some people take months or years to bond with their children; some people don’t like being pregnant; and some people, clear-eyed, don’t think they’d make the same choice again. I don’t know why we’d insist or expect that parenthood – alone among human experiences – feels the same for everyone. It’s quite possible that many, many people feel the way you do and we just don’t have the resources to talk about it.One way to accept life as a parent might be to see parenthood as a rapidly changing condition.I’m a ‘trad wife’ in a happy marriage. How can I get my friends to accept me for who I am? | Leading questionsRead moreEarly into being a mother, one of my best friends confided: I’m spending all this time doing kids activities, I play with blocks, I watch Play School, but I’mnot a kid. So this is boring to me – I’m bored. But the blocks only lasted so long, as will your kids’ hide and seek. Then they read books and like some of the music you like and make jokes and bend rules. That can be a lot more interesting to spend time with than bright colours and loud noises. Then they have changing personalities and moral conundrums and thoughts you can talk about as an adult – and then a few years later they’re gone from your home.That’s not to say, “You’ll enjoy what’s to come, you have to.” But it is to say things change so rapidly that your feelings about this period right now aren’t necessarily a guide to how you’ll feel about the next ones. Just as parenthood isn’t the same for all people, it isn’t the same across one life.One word of caution: the unvoiceability of parental regret can sometimes mean it gets taken out on the kids. When we don’t have ways to address feelings as they come, they accumulate, and in the emotional hydraulics of it all they can wind up sprayed back at the kids. Not necessarily in a dramatic scene, just by establishing a dynamic where 99% of the time you make sacrifices but 1% of the time you let them know there’s a bill somewhere.It is very scary for a kid to have indications that their existence made things worse.It is extremely important that you are able to like your life. It is also extremely important that children not learn that anyone might prefer they didn’t exist. That creates a real imperative to parse these feelings away from them; leaning in to things that make you feel like you, getting assurances from friends or others about parts of parenting they don’t like, whatever you need to do so these feelings have somewhere to go besides back into the family dynamic. “I can handle it alone” is not a great option. We tend to overestimate how successfully we can conceal dark emotional truths from kids by just not saying them out loud.It might be helpful for both these aims if, instead of asking how you can accept parenthood unto itself, you think, “I’m not enjoying what parenting asks of me right now.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

On the opposite side have been authoritarian states, led mainly by the Soviet Union, followed, after the demise of the Soviet Union, byRussiaandChina.But all this is rapidly changing.Russiaand China have morphed into oligarchies, run by small groups of extraordinarily wealthy people.The US has been moving from a democracy to an oligarchy as well – and is doing so at lightning speed underDonald TrumpandElon Musk.The new poles are coming to be global democracies versus a global oligarchy. The United States is emerging on the side of global oligarchy.Trump’sremarks late on Tuesday– siding fully with Russia’s narrative of blaming Ukraine for the war there – signals more clearly than any other recent statement that the US is prepared to jettison its European allies and switch sides to embraceVladimir Putin’s Russia.Even Trump can be cajoled into doing the right thing – you just have to know which buttons to press | Kenneth RothRead moreEarlier on Tuesday, senior American and Russian officials agreed not only to seek to end the war inUkraine, but also, in the words of the secretary of state Marco Rubio, to explore “the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians”, both geopolitically and economically.Trump’s phone call with Putin last week also reflected Putin’s view of the world – that Russia and the US are “two great nations” that should not only negotiate Ukraine’s fate directly but also together address even weightier global affairs.Just after the call, Trump posted that he and Putin had “reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many! We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together.”The phone call occurred on the same day, not incidentally, that Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, declared that the United States would not supportUkraine’s desire for Nato membership.And on the same day, the SenateconfirmedTulsi Gabbard, widely seen as sympathetic to Putin, as the next director of national intelligence.At last week’s Munich security conference, JD Vance – the man whorefuses to saythat Trump lost the 2020 presidential election – accused Europe of abandoning the values of democracy by excluding the far right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) from government.Vance’s bizarre comments came just days before Germany’s general election. He had earlier met the AfD’s co-leader Alice Weidel.The AfD is a rightwing extremist party. In 2017, Björn Höcke, an AfD party leader in the eastern state of Thuringia,complainedthat Germans were “the only people in the world who’ve planted a monument of shame at the heart of their capital” – Höcke was referring to the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust – and that Germany needed “nothing less than a 180-degree turnaround in the politics of remembrance”.In 2018, the AfD party leader Alexander Gaulanddismissed“Hitler and the Nazis” as “just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history”.In 2023, AfD politiciansmet with other far-right extremiststo discuss an “overall concept, in the sense of a master plan” for the “remigration” of “migrants” to their countries of ethnic origin – no matter whether those migrants were asylum seekers, permanent residents or German citizens.The AfD wants to end German military aid to Ukraine and restart the Nord Stream pipelines through which Russia used to supply Germany with natural gas.So what is Vance doing embracing the AfD? Why has Musk also promoted the AfD on his X platform?There should be no doubt about what is happening. The Trump-Vance-Musk regime wants to empower the nationalist far-right in Europe in order to divide European democracies and weaken the western alliance.This potentially emboldens further Russian military incursions like the 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine.It strengthens the global oligarchy.Commentators in Moscow are claiming that the American-led effort to isolate Russia over Ukraine has ended and are celebrating Trump’s support for Russia’s narrative about who started the war in Ukraine.We are on the road for democracy and justice | Bernie SandersRead moreAfter Trump’s phone call with Putin, Russia’s main stock market index jumped 5%, to its highest point since last summer, and the ruble gained against the dollar to its strongest level since September.The Trump-Vance-Musk regime is not only undermining democracy in the US. It is also laying the foundation for undermining democracies around the world.It is making the world safe for oligarchy.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

But what exactly is meant by that? An economic difference? Of the 20 leading global economies,several are in the south. In the south, some countries are many, many times richer than their neighbours. A climate difference? The climate crisis affects every country in the world, and especially small island states and the poorest countries. The10 greatest emitters, if we go by CO2emissions per inhabitant, are split between countries in the north and south.Are we talking about a migration difference? A huge number of migrations are between countries in the south. A political divide? In both the north and the south, there are those who support collective solutions, and conversely, those who support efforts to withdraw from global affairs. In both the north and the south, there is competition between regional powers. In both the north and the south, there are countries that comply with international law and others that flout it.Yes, we are living in a fragmented world, but is this happening at the line of geographical division between north and south? Certainly not. The UN doesn’t recognise this artificial division either. It focuses on categories of countries that need the most international support.The real line of division is the one that separates those that support the international rules-based order from the rest. The discussion we should be having, atG20meetings and everywhere else, is not the clash between north and south, but between those that support the law and those that support power by force.View image in fullscreenThe French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAInFrance, our moral compass is not guided by north or south, but by justice. We do not avert our eyes from any crisis or violation of international law. A country under attack is a country under attack, and an aggressor country is an aggressor country. This distinction does not change based on whether the country is in the north or the south.That is why Franceat once condemnsviolations of international humanitarian law in Gaza and the West Bank, the7 October terrorist attacksagainst Israel,the war of aggression led by Russia against Ukraine, and the atrocities perpetrated bySudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan. That is why it is fully committed to maintaining the ceasefire in Lebanon, after working towards its adoption alongside the US. That is why it is working to bring an end tothe clashes in the Great Lakes region, where M23 rebels continue to violate the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is why France is workingso that Syrian men and women can live in peaceand freedom in a sovereign, peaceful Syria that is reintegrated in its regional environment. And I have travelled to each of these regions to strongly reassert our beliefs.Because France does not use double standards. And the voice of France, which tirelessly defends equality and law, will continue to be heard, at a time when law is contested, if we strengthen international law. This implies that there is a role for everyone to play in global governance, and therefore, that it must be reformed. Every second we waste on the path to multilateralism reform fuels claims its institutions are illegitimate. France would like to see crucial projects for the future of peace and global governance to be completed between now and 2026, when our country will hold the presidency of the G7.As the 80th anniversary of the UN’s creation approaches, let us move forward with determination so that our institutions reflect today’s world, and so that a rightful place can be given to our African partners in global governance, the UN security council and international financial institutions. We must also make progress on practical implementation ofthe Paris pact for peoples and the planetinitiated by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Because no country should have to choose between fighting poverty and fighting climate breakdown. Because we need private funding so that development assistance is sufficient, and because we must innovate to support developing countries.I believe that South Africa would like this to be a key aspect ofits current presidency of the G20. It can count on France’s full support.Jean-Noël Barrot is the foreign minister of FranceDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s to expose the regime’s criminalityThu 20 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 20.36 ESTSharePolitical power boils down to two things: votes and money. But when money buys presidents, senators and judges, votes are merely the sales receipts. What’s left is money, and the purpose of power is to get more of it.Trump’s non-billionaire followers appear thrilled that Elon Musk and his so-called “department of government efficiency” are burning down the government. “Imagine if Trump hadn’t met and talked with Elon Musk that all this progress on efficiency may not be taking place or at such a fast pace needed before the midterms,” comments holy666 on aFox News storyabout the mass layoffs of federal employees.Firings at the IRS elicit particular glee. Writes EnemyCitizen: “A beautiful thing about Mr Trump’s approach is that internal revenue will slow down and Congress will have to sober up and stop passing appropriations bills that apply our hard-earned money to frivolous political agendas. No more blank checks, Congress!”In fact, what the megalomaniacal multibillionaire is destroying is everything – minus the policing functions, of course – that we pay taxes for, including such frivolous agendas as food inspection, flood mitigation and Medicare. This is how kleptocracies work. Taxes are collected from the hoi polloi. The more benign government functions – housing the poor, postponing climate apocalypse – are abolished. But the rest of these functions do not entirely disappear. Rather, it is farmed out to private enterprise, which undertakes what it’s paid to do with minimum expense and maximum profit (and we all know corporations never commit waste, fraud or abuse).One of the diabolical features of an anti-state state like our current regime is its ability to turns acts of resistance against the state against themselvesWatchdogs are eliminated, bribery islegalized. The most corrupt carry off the greatest rewards. And bereft of revenue, social services wither, the infrastructure crumbles, and the prisons fill with the destitute and the resistant.Maga wants to starve the bureaucracy. But it still wants money. And with the wealthiest awaiting gigantic tax breaks, they need it from the rest of us. With the Internal Revenue Service in effect transformed into a shell corporation laundering the money of the ultra-rich, why should we pay taxes?The IRS is being speedily organized for this rerouting.

It is trying to coerce the agency to give Elon’s AI-wielding AV squadunfettered accessto the system containing the personal and financial data of every American taxpayer, small business and non-profit.Not only would this arrangement provide an armory of intelligence to be deployed against the president’s enemies – according to alawsuitfiled by taxpayer advocates, unions and small business alliances, it would give Musk access to his rivals’ profit and loss statements, payrolls, tax records and information about IRS investigations into their (or his own) suspected tax fraud. “No other business owner on the planet has access to this kind of information on his competitors,” assert the plaintiffs, “and for good reason.”These are all good reasons to withhold your taxes.Can the tactic work? Is it right? Morally and politically motivated tax nonpayment has an honorable, if not always successful, history. After the Roman empire’s destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD Jewish people refused to pay Rome’s “temple tax”. Rome responded by destroying more temples.Gandhi’s salt tax protest, on the other hand, was the first step toward India’s independence from the British empire. The American Revolution was a tax revolt, and that worked – although some colonists resisted taxes levied by the revolutionaries and, after independence, the states as well.More recently, American opponents of wars, nukes and abortion have refused to pay all or portions of their taxes in protest. Many went to prison for it. InCivil Disobedience, Thoreau wrote of weighing the benefits and costs of any given action. He believed all taxation was illegitimate as long as the US condoned slavery. “If [the injustice] is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then I say, break the law,” he concluded.One of the diabolical features of an anti-state state like our current regime is its ability to turns acts of resistance against the state against themselves. Principled prosecutors and agency heads resign rather than carry out the president’s illegal orders – leaving only Maga flunkies in their places. Civil servants quit rather than pervert the services or science they’ve devoted their careers to – leaving the work unguarded and the workforce decimated, precisely as the wrecking crew intends.So it is with tax resistance. Every dollar that does not come into Washington’s coffers is justification to cut another dollar. You may remember that the vanguard of 21st century far right populism was the Tea party, an anti-tax movement.It’s never been more important to stay tuned in | Margaret SullivanRead moreIn theNew Republic, Liza Featherstone points out that the destruction of popular government programs is not “a goofy misstep on this administration’s part. Rather, it’s exactly the point.” Whether firing park rangers, defunding daycare centers, or deep-sixing job-creating clean-energy projects in red states, the programs’ “popularity is precisely what the Trump-Musk administration dislikes about them. For anti-government ideologues, it’s important that people not have good experiences with the government.”And if people have bad experiences with the government – if they contractbird flubecause the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no longer have the wherewithal to control and prevent disease; if bridges collapse because the funds to repair them are cut off – well, there’s proof that the government can’t do anything right, and deserves to be destroyed.In fact, after it outsources the government, the regime would be smart to keep calling it the government. When IRS.com loses a taxpayer’s refund and assigns a bot to sort out the problem, the taxpayer will blame IRS.gov.Thanks to intentional staff shortages at the IRS, your missing tax payment might go unnoticed, just as the Trump family’s multibillion-dollar fraud escaped the agency’s auditors for decades. But if tax evasion is a secretive act, tax resistance is civil disobedience, a public, political act. The reason to withhold your taxes is not to cheat the government of much-needed funds. It is not even to cheat the crooks now running the country, satisfying as that may be. It is to expose the criminality of what is being done – and not done – with the money the state has a legal and moral obligation to collect and then to distribute, to serve all the people.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five booksExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTax and spendingTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Raducanu approaching the umpire. Raducanu wiping away tears with a towel.An emotional Raducanu is an instant headline, although this wasn’t a case of injury or frustration. Having seen a man in the crowd whoseoff-court behaviour had already concerned her, she was doing the sensible thing and reporting it. The Daily Mail reported that she was “reduced to cowering behind the umpire’s chair”. What a brilliantly multi-purpose use of language: paternalistic readers can get heroically angry on her behalf while the others write her off as a snowflake.‘I’ll be OK,’ says Emma Raducanu after incident with ‘fixated’ man in DubaiRead moreRaducanu’s upset was understandable. She has been stalked before, as have plenty of women’s tennis players. Last year Katie Boultershared her experiencesof being followed home, and of a man issuing violent online threats while he attended a tournament in which she was competing. “Things like this happen all the time,” she said.Danielle Collins may seem to have a thick hide on court – witness her performative antics at last month’s Australian Open – but she is “vigilant and cautious” in her real life after being stalked multiple times, both online and in person. “Sometimes that has come across to fans as being withdrawn, distant,” she says, “but … sometimes I’ve had to be more careful about what I say and do because I don’t want certain people knowing where I am.”Sloane Stephens, speaking a couple of years ago, said that “all of us as athletes … we’ve gotten these crazy messages for years. We completely normalised being called names and death threats”. When someone posted her own address and told her: “I’m gonna be there tomorrow,” her fellow US player Madison Keys had to persuade her to contact the FBI.We tend, when we hear these stories, to focus on the obsession, the creepiness, the extremity of behaviour. The guy who hid in Chris Evert’s closet for three days, smoking cigarettes. The guy who wanted Anna Kournikova to save him from drowning. The guy who harassed Serena Williams then moved on to torment a French punk singer. It can feel like a very distant problem, an irresolvable mental health issue, the price of being talented, famous and female.Nothing to do, then, with the screeds of social media abuse those same women’s tennis players receive on a daily basis from gamblers who have lost money on their games. And a separate issue, still, from the drive-by haters who just want to register their opinion that Caroline Garcia is a clown, or Coco Gauff is a traitor to America.View image in fullscreenDanielle Collins has said she has sometimes come across as ‘withdrawn and distant’ as a result of previous abuse.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesAre they really unrelated? Not if you’re the one on the receiving end. They’re more like consecutive stops on the same route, one you’ve become increasingly familiar with on your commute to and from the court. “All high-profile sportspeople suffer a level of public scrutiny and abuse but for women there is a whole extra sphere of horror,” says Stephanie Hilborne, chief executive of Women In Sport, who has found the Raducanu incident “deeply troubling”.She argues that the problem is “not well enough understood by an industry dominated by men”, and she has a point. Right now the most powerful tool that female athletes have to grow their profile is, to be blunt, themselves. Last year’s Olympics proved how valuable social media can be to sportswomen who lack the financial and media support that traditionally scaffolds men’s sport. The locker-room photos, the video confessionals – direct fan communication that makes female athletes feel more accessible and relatable is their most valuable asset, asrugby union’s Ilona Maherhas been proving.But it also leaves them exposed on platforms where they receive disproportionately more abuse than male athletes (including 85% of all online abuse at the Tokyo Olympics). “Sportswomen are all too often subjected to excessive expectations to open up their personal lives to the public through social media in order to sort out a horrible history of exclusion and lack of visibility and investment,” says Hilborne. “It is not women that should have to shoulder this burden.”A number of sporting organisations – including World Athletics, the International Olympic Committee and Fifa – now employ AI systems to monitor and filter out online abuse towards athletes during tournaments. That may alleviate some of the worst symptoms, but it does not deal with the root cause. The global sporting industry is still a long way from eradicating the intrinsic sexism that fuelled its historic culture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But women’s football, cricket, and rugby should not be expected to fix the problems left ignored by the men’s games. Especially not in a social environment where we’re witnessing a frightening backlash against feminism.Men’s sport can still be a breeding ground for toxic masculinity, be it tribalism in the stands, on-field exhortations to “man up” or stop being a “bitch”, or the untouchable behaviour of star players at elite clubs. If it doesn’t deal with its underlying culture, asks the UN report, “then how can we expect young men in particular to end this cycle of dangerous and abusive behaviour that contributes to violence against women and girls?”The stalking of women’s tennis players is neither a rare nor a new phenomenon. But it’s something we should all be concerned about.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTenniscommentShareReuse this content"

But there are four reasons I’m not worried yetCarrie NugentScientists are closely monitoring 2024 YR4 – and while it’s relatively small, it reminds us of the dangers lurking in spaceCarrie Nugent is an associate professor of computational physics and planetary science and author of Asteroid HuntersThu 20 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 11.12 ESTShareTwo days after Christmas, the Atlas sky survey team discovered a new rocky object in Earth’s astronomical neighbourhood. Atlas discovers near-Earth objects all the time: in 2024, the team discovered 167 of them. They also codiscoveredcomet Tsuchinshan–Atlas, which dazzled sky gazers last autumn. But this discovery was special: there’s a chance the 40-90 metre object, known as 2024 YR4, will hit Earth in 2032.In January, the impact probability was estimated to be just over 1%, then it was raised to 2.3% in early February. As of this week, the Nasa JPL Center for Near Earth Object Studies has raised that to3.1%– or about 1-in-32 chance of impact.There are fourreasons I’m not worried just yet. First, the possible impact would be inDecember 2032, so we’ve got time to prepare. Second, the asteroid is likely not terribly large by asteroid standards. The little asteroid that unexpectedlyexploded over Chelyabinskin Russia, causing damage but no deaths in 2013, was roughly 20 metres across – 2024 YR4 is bigger than that but still vastly smaller than the 10km-diameter object that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. If 2024 YR4 hits, it would cause regional, not global, destruction. And with years to prepare, people have time to evacuate the area.Which brings us to the third reason not to panic – the surface of the Earth is mostly water. And although asteroid-tsunami studies could use more research, I think most experts would agree that a 40- to 90-metre asteroid-ocean impact could happen without loss to human life or property.View image in fullscreenEstimated position of 2024 YR4 as of 31 January 2025.Illustration: NasaFourth, we are still gathering data on this object. The impact probabilities come from specialists using computer software to figure out where2024 YR4 might go. The timing here is important. For an asteroid to hit the Earth, you don’t just need the asteroid’s orbit and the Earth’s orbit to cross. You need both Earth and the asteroid to be in the same place in the solar system, at the same time.You can picture these trajectory predictions as a line of possibilities showing where the position of the asteroid might be in December 2032. Right now, , 3.1% percent of the line overlaps the surface of the Earth. As astronomers gather more observations of this asteroid, they’ll become more confident about what its path will be, and the line of possibilities will shrink.As the line shrinks, the Earth-overlapping portion becomes a larger fraction of it. That can make the impact probability go up – at first. This has happened before with newly discovered asteroids. But as more observationsof those objects were made, the line continued to shrink. Eventually, only part, and then none, of the Earth was covered by thelikely paths predicted in the line. When that happened, the impact probability rapidly dropped to zero. We will have to wait and see what happens to 2024 YR4’s impact probability.Asteroid impacts are often represented, in media and literature, as a symbol of human powerlessness against the universe. But the reality is quite different. A few years ago, Nasasignificantly changed the orbitof an asteroid. The Dart spacecraft slammed into a 150-metre asteroid moon at tremendous speed, changing its orbital period by more than 30 minutes. And although every impact scenario is unique, that’s a promising result – it’s enough of a kick to knock many objects off course, causing them to miss Earth. However, the remaining time before 2024 YR4’s possible impact is extremely tight to fund, build and launch such a complex spacecraft.View image in fullscreenIllustration showing Nasa’s Dart spacecraft prior to impact at the Didymos binary asteroid system in October 2022.Photograph: Nasa/Johns Hopkins/ReutersThere’s a community of astronomers, software engineers, citizen scientists and civil servants who spend their days discovering and keeping tabs on every single one of thealmost 38,000 known asteroidsand cometsthat pass through near-Earth space. Nasa’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office and the European Space Agency’s Planetary Defence Office, which have similar goals even if they disagree on spelling, have been working with governments and the UN, preparing for something just like this.Each night, surveys such as Atlas discover near-Earth objects using telescopes. These surveys send their observations to the Minor Planet Center in Massachusetts, which checks them for accuracy and publishes them. This allows other people to point their telescopes at the right part of the sky, at the right time, and get the follow-up observations that secure an orbit. In the case of 2024 YR4, observations have poured in from all over the world – from Kansas, London, Ukraine and China, just to name a few. This collective gathering and publishing of observations allows trajectory-prediction groups in the US and Europe to keep tabs on the new discoveries to see if any have a chance of hitting Earth.2024 YR4 is worth keeping an eye on. Right now, it’s pretty faint, and the full moon has been flooding the night sky with light, making it tough to track. Over the coming months, expect to see more observations coming in, including ones from theJames Webb space telescope. These observations will tell us more about the object’s size and where exactly it’s headed.Asteroid triggers global defence plan amid chance of collision with Earth in 2032Read moreBut this smaller object should be a reminder of the bigger near-Earth objects out there. Very roughly, there’s a one in 350 chance that a much larger asteroid – 140 metres across or larger – will hit Earth in your lifetime. This is much more likely than the one in 17,000 chance you have of being struck by lightning. Personally, I’m thankful that the asteroid surveys regularly scan the night sky with their telescopes, keeping watch.Carrie Nugent is an associate professor of computational physics and planetary science at Olin College of Engineering, the author of Asteroid Hunters and creator of the science podcast SpacepodExplore more on these topicsAsteroidsOpinionAstronomySpaceNasaEuropean Space AgencycommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, the debate has largely focused on how to revive the ailing German economy after two years of recession and how to control migration, which has fuelled support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.The conservative CDU/CSU leader, Friedrich Merz, has swerved speaking about the need for massive borrowing to pay for a surge in defence spending because many of his supporters oppose extra debt. The Social Democratic (SPD) chancellor, Olaf Scholz, isdodging discussionof sending German troops to Ukraine as part of a possible European security force if a ceasefire agreement is reached because part of his political base is either anti-militarist or Russia-friendly. After an emergencyEuropean summiton Ukraine in Paris on Monday, an irritable Scholz said talk of boots on the ground was “highly inappropriate”.Neither of the main contenders to run Europe’s largest economy dares tell the domestic electorate just how dire Germany’s security situation is looking, now that Donald Trump is pursuing a quick deal with Vladimir Putin – apparently largely on Moscow’s terms – to stop the fighting inUkraineand draw down US forces from Europe.“Nobody wants to get caught speaking the truth before the election,” says Jan Techau, a former defence ministry speechwriter who is now director of Europe at the consultancy Eurasia Group. “In the worst-case scenario, if Trump pulls off this deal with Putin and carves up Europe into spheres of influence,Germanyis very exposed.”Unlike France and the UK, Germany does not have its own nuclear deterrent, and its armed forces are rusty and understaffed after three decades of self-disarmament since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is struggling to fully equip a brigade of 5,000 troops todeploy in Lithuaniaas part of Nato’s deterrent presence.Scholz declared aZeitenwende(turning point) within days of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and created a€100bn (£82bn) special fundto buy defence equipment. But he failed to follow up and convince Germans that times have truly changed and that the country must shed its postwar aversion to all things military. While military and intelligence officials say Russia could be ready to attack a Nato country by 2030, experts say it will take decades for Germany to fix its forces at the current rate.“Even the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has not created a sense of urgency in Germany – a sense that time to rebuild the military is not infinite,” says Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff of the German Council on Foreign Relations. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy has calculated that, at the current procurement pace, it would takenearly 100 yearsuntil the army had as many artillery howitzers as it possessed in 2004.When the special fund runs out at the end of 2027, it will leave a€30bn a yearbudget hole just to keep defence spending at Nato’s current target of 2% of GDP. It will take almost double that amount to reach the likely objective of 3% or more, which allied leaders are expected to set in June. If Trump starts pulling US troops out of Europe, the bill will rise even higher.Merz has said if he wins the election, he will start by cutting wasteful welfare spending and kickstart economic growth with tax cuts before considering extra borrowing. He has hinted that he isopen to reformingthe constitutional “debt brake” that severely limits government deficits to create more fiscal space for defence investment, and perhaps even tojoint borrowingwith European partners to fund common defence equipment.The conservative frontrunner has blasted Scholz for his lack of leadership in the EU andhas vowedto restore Germany’s damaged relations with France and Poland, work more closely with the UK and take a lead in Europe’s response to the war in Ukraine. Unlike Scholz, he supports supplying Kyiv with long-requestedTaurus medium-range missilesable to hit targets inside Russia, subject to agreement among European partners. A close parliamentary colleague says Merz is deeply pro-European and Atlanticist, and understands that Germany will have to borrow fast to boost defence.However, the real questions are whether he will have sufficient political capital to borrow massively for defence and to fix Germany’s broken infrastructure; whether he will have the parliamentary super-majority needed to reform the debt brake; whether he has the sense of urgency that has been largely missing during the past three years of centre-left government; and how far his likely SPD coalition partners will let him go in squeezing welfare to pay for defence.By failing to prepare public opinion for the coming storm, Merz is storing up trouble for himself when the time comes, very soon, to make wrenching choices on public spending and borrowing.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionUkraineRussiaEuropeOlaf ScholzNatocommentShareReuse this content"

In today’s torrid circumstances, that imbalance is perhaps excusable. After all,Donald Trump, it now turns out, really means it. He is more interested in US plunder and profit from places like Gaza, Ukraine and Greenland than in upholding a just peace or good order.Even so, the inattention towards Germany needs to end. Britain’s politicians, like German politicians, are rewiring their worldviews amid a political gale. But Germany, though no longer a great power, is nevertheless a great nation. Indeed, it may be more than ever the essential European nation now, after the Trump administration’s very public trashing of the entire Atlantic alliance seemed to leave Europe to its own devices.TheGerman general election, this coming Sunday, is an event with consequences. Primarily, of course, those consequences will be felt in Germany itself, with its extended economic stagnation, its anxieties about migration and borders, its traditional fears about borrowing, its nervousness about military commitments, and its sudden lurching anxiety that the US is ready to allow Russia to threaten the lands on its eastern frontier.Germany’s inherent importance, though, means the election will also help determine whether Europe – not just the EU – is able to cope with Trump’s second term. Will that Europe be able to deliver the defence and security to protect not merelyUkraine, a daunting enough task, but the Baltic republics, Poland and the other former Soviet satellite states too? Can it reform its faltering economic model? These are reverberations that Britain cannot avoid, even if it wants to.Needless to say, the German election has received only a fraction of the attention that this country’s political class lavishes on a US election. Equally predictably, much of that very limited amount of attention is absorbed by a fixation – one that is shared to a degree by the German media – with the populist anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. As a result, however, the likely victor on Sunday, the centre-right CDU-CSU coalition under the probable next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has barely been scrutinised at all.This contest is occurring against a backdrop of economic failure, not success. The German economy shrank in 2023 and again in 2024. It seems likely to stay in recession again this year. It adds up to the longest period of economic stagnation since the fall of Hitler in 1945. Whoever emerges as chancellor after Sunday will face choices very similar to those confronting Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.The reasons for Germany’s decline are not hard to understand. Germany’s dependence on Russian energy meant prices soared after the invasion of Ukraine. Olaf Scholz’s three-party coalition government, in power since 2021, has scaled back that dependence – renewables now produce 60% of German energy – but not eliminated it. German car exports have become more expensive, while China has surged ahead in the production of cheaper electric vehicles. A tariff war with the US now looms.All this has provided a system shock to a country still strongly conditioned by its craving for postwar stability. “We have used up our old success, and not invested in new things,” the commentator Theo Koll told theUK in a Changing Europe podcastthis week. “We have for a long time lived in a kind of ‘Gore-Tex republic’ … we wanted it nice and cosy inside and all the unpleasant things had to be outside.”1:12German chancellor hits back after Vance tirade at security conference – videoTherise of the AfD, amid the perception that irregular migration is out of control, is the single most visible sign that the old political era has ended. It has been quickened by violent killings where migrants are suspects during the election campaign in Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and,last week, Munich. The latest Politico poll of polls puts the AfD on 21%, double what it secured in the previous federal election in 2021, running second to the CDU-CSU on 29%, but ahead of Scholz’s SPD on 16% and the Greens on 13%.By that token, though, a victory for Merz’s CDU-CSU on 23 February would be genuinely significant. It would be significant even though 29% would be a decline from the 42% that the parties took under Angela Merkel in 2013. It would show, in Europe’s heartland, that the line can be held against populism of the right. This is not a trivial lesson, especially after the debacle of the French assembly election last year.It would also be a vote of confidence, albeit a relatively weak one, for one of Europe’s few remaining big parties of the centre right. Once-powerful parties like the French Gaullists can only look on with frustration and envy – to say nothing of Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives. Not least, it would also be a rebuke to those like Elon Musk and JD Vance who have actively promoted the AfD from abroad.Yet it would also pose two big questions. The first, and more immediate, would be the coalition that Merz would construct and the content of its programme. Everything here depends on which parties qualify for the Bundestag and on how many seats each wins. Merz has repeatedly ruled out governing with the AfD, so his main coalition partner could be Scholz’s diminished SPD or, less likely in view of Merz’s commitment to growth, the Greens.Europe is looking to Germany for leadership – but these elections will dash its hopes again | Cas MuddeRead moreIf the polls are right, however, whatever Merz comes up with is likely to be a weak coalition. This would give him relatively little leeway to drive reforms of the kind he advocates – familiar themes to UK readers, like benefit cuts, ending business red tape and raising defence spending. He is, though, open to loosening the constitutionally enshrined “debt brake”, which is blocking much-needed public investment. It is likely to take until Easter before we know the full coalition picture.The other, intimately related, question would be about Germany’s borders. Merz triggered huge protests when the AfD backed his bill allowing Germany to turn asylum seekers and other migrants back at the border. This prompted arare rebuke from Merkel, that Merz had abandoned a historically resonant firewall against far-right support. Yet border controls matter for any state that seeks to ensure the security, including the social welfare, of its citizens, and Germany is not the only country where voters are demanding greater effectiveness.Sunday’s election is a critical European moment, and would be even if Trump did not exist. The key question is not, at least at this stage, about the rise of the extreme right. It is about the continuing viability of the centre right, or the adaptability of what Merkel, from early in her career as party leader, dubbed “the new social capitalism”. The current recession has put this vision to an unforgiving test. Merz will be judged by the outcome, if he wins power. It is a moment that matters for Germany – but also for us.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionEuropeDonald TrumpTrump administrationNatoAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightcommentShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, the bodies of two young children and their mother, and that of an 83-year-old peace activist,were returnedto Israel by Hamas. They were kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 raid in which the militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and others. Around 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war in response.It was always feared that the ceasefire deal, which has brought desperately needed respite for Palestinians in Gaza and the return of Israeli and foreign hostages, would be fleeting. The six-week opening stage is due to expire on 1 March. The talks on the more complicated second stage have yet to begin, more than a fortnight after they were due.There are two glimmers of hope. The first was the striking confidence of Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, indeclaringlast weekend that “phase two is absolutely going to begin”. The second is that Hamas, militarily battered and under pressure within Gaza and from Arab governments, hassaidthat in the next phase it would be willing to release all remaining hostages at once, rather than in staggered groups. In exchange, it wants Israel’s complete and rapid military withdrawal from Gaza and the release of hundreds more Palestinians held by Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu hasreportedly saidthat this phase would be conditional on the disarming of Hamas and the end of its presence in Gaza.The Israeli prime minister does not want to cross Mr Trump. But it has never been in his interests to reach phase two, not least because of the threat that the extremist coalition member Bezalel Smotrich may walk out. His security chiefs long believed politics was the biggest obstruction to a deal. Now he hasdismissed themfrom the negotiation team, replacing them with his well-connected confidantRon Dermer, who could yet attempt to bypass Mr Witkoff and deal with Mr Trump directly.At this late stage, the extension of phase one would be better than nothing. The agreement and implementation of phase two, inherently more difficult, would be a major step forward. But the immense question of phase three looms: what form reconstruction in Gaza might take. Mr Trump’s abhorrent announcement that Palestinians should make way for a US-owned “Riviera of the Middle East” –embracedby Mr Netanyahu – has precipitated a discussion that had been sidestepped lest it derail the deal, as well as due to its inherent complexity.Ethnically cleansing Palestinians would require countries willing to take them. Though Egypt and Jordan rely heavily on US aid, their leaders cannot afford to comply. Arab countrieswill meet in Riyadhon Friday as they scramble for an alternative plan, discussing Cairo’shastily drawn-upproposal under which the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and others would fund reconstruction, with Hamas formally excluded from governance and oversight of the work. Even if they can find a theoretically workable solution, Mr Trump would need to be flattered into agreement. In the meantime, with hostages still held, and with conditions in Gazaremaining so dire, the priority must be to maintain the ceasefire. Whether or not it can be the foundation of a long-term response to this crisis, it is still essential to save lives now.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A 16-point swing from the Scottish National party yielded a harvest of 37 Westminster Labour MPs. The SNP, which had changed leaders twice in little over a year, plummeted from 48 Westminster MPs to a mere nine.Yet if anyone assumes Labour is now in the driving seat of Scottish electoral politics again, they have not been paying attention.A poll last weekshowed Labour facing its worst Holyrood election result since devolution began, with only 18% of Scots planning to vote for Anas Sarwar’s party when the Scottish parliament comes up for election in 2026. The SNP, meanwhile, is on course to be the largest party at Holyrood again, potentially enabling the current first minister, John Swinney, to form the nationalists’ fifth consecutive devolved administration.With more than a year to go before the Holyrood vote, much may obviously change. Nevertheless, the figures provide a sobering backdrop to this weekend’sScottish Labour conferencein Glasgow. This gathering, which Mr Sarwar addresses on Friday, followed by Sir Keir Starmer on Sunday, could have been a celebration of one victory and a launchpad for a second. Instead, the conference is likely to be a reality check for Labour on the turbulent Scottish and British political landscape after a quarter of a century of devolution.Part of Labour’s rapid decline in Scotland is undoubtedly explained by the Starmer government’s poor start last year. Cuts in winter fuel payments were an early blow. National insurance rises and Labour’s refusal to compensate theWaspi womencampaigners or to change the two-child welfare cap did damage too. Yet these policies were unpopular in England and Wales as well as in Scotland.The difference is that all these issues were exploited by the SNP in ways that the main opposition party in England, the Conservatives, could not match. The upshot inScotlandis that Mr Swinney has been able to steady the SNP ship, steering his party away from arguments about identity and back towards economic and social justice issues. In England, meanwhile, Kemi Badenoch is getting almost nowhere.Yet the SNP’s recovery owes at least as much to Nigel Farage as to Mr Swinney. Reform UK is now on 14% in Holyrood polling, and has been able to attract support from Labour voters, older and working-class pro-union men in particular. That would give Reform UK around 15 Holyrood seats, despite having little campaign organisation in Scotland. The SNP is less vulnerable, since it can rely on pro-independence voters. As a result, even though SNP support is currentlyflatlining, it has pulled away from the other parties, as Labour slips and Reform UK advances.The Starmer government has done important things for Scotland, ​especially on public sector pay. And the SNP government’s record is flimsy on several fronts, including health and education. Nevertheless, Mr Sarwar remains caught between the fiscal caution of the Labour government in London and thecostly and often inefficient, but still popular, universalism of SNP welfare and health programmes nearer to home. In his pre-conferenceinterviewwith this paper, Mr Sarwar said he recognised both the challenge and the importance of his speech to delegates on Friday. Scottish Labour has not yet articulated a distinct and convincing programme of its own. Yet that is what Mr Sarwar needs to do in Glasgow this weekend.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Protecting our own democracy and social cohesion, to parody the words of Marco Rubio, requires us to protect what we hold dear if we are to retain consent for protecting the people of eastern Europe and beyond.David BlunkettLabour, House of LordsThe solution to the European security crisis does not lie in increased military spending (Trump’s return means UK must swiftly find a way to increase defence spending, 16 February) or a Eurobomb (As the US retreats, Europe must look out for itself – so is Macron’s nuclear offer the answer?, 17 February). This discredited thinking has already taken us to the precipice:89 seconds to midnight, according to the Doomsday Clock.Moreover, the US and European thinktanks that are advocating this path are largely funded by and work in the interest of the military industrial complex, as detailed inrecent researchby the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. Their outputs should be treated with the same degree of scepticism as the disinformation from Russian and Chinese troll factories.Europe is strong today because it has kept arms at bay and democratic politics is its first line of defence. A future European security policy should be centred on international law, inclusive diplomacy, conventional non-offensive defence, strengthened societal resilience and support for the international ban on nuclear weapons. These policies won’t cost the earth; the alternatives just might.Ian DavisFounder, Nato WatchRichard ReeveCoordinator, Rethinking SecurityPaul RogersEmeritus professor of peace studies, Bradford UniversityI feel as if I am now living in a parallel universe (Trump calls Zelenskyy a dictator amid fears of irreconcilable rift, 19 February).

We’re thinking about how to earn a living and pay the rent. Nobody, that is, except the chancellor, for whom“growth is the No 1 mission” that “underpins everything else”– schools, hospitals, net zero.Yet decades of growth since the 1960s have left us with thousands of food banks and facing an environmental abyss. The idea that only more growth will allow us to protect the planet is like saying we can only finance the fire brigade by selling petrol to arsonists.Yes, our current economy to some degree counteracts the loss of jobs to automation by producing an ever-growing volume of stuff and persuading the better-off to want it. But even at this unsustainable level of consumption growth, the economy fails to provide much of humanity with life’s basics. Furthermore, since money can be made more easily out of addiction and dependence than out of restraint and self-sufficiency, much of the consumption growth consists of products with limited benefits or that are actively harmful to health, wellbeing and community life.The challenge is to end catastrophic consumption growth while simultaneously enabling all of us, globally, to have the opportunity of a good life. That requires changing the economic rules, tackling inequality, taxing wealth not employment, and strong environmental regulation.Donald PowerLondonRachel Reevesneeds to tweak all three self-imposed targets: the balanced current budget, the investment rule and dashing for GDP growth at seemingly any cost.We should call a balanced current budget by its proper name – austerity. Yes, New Labour achieved this in the ultra-low interest rates of the early 2000s, but since then we have had the global financial crisis and Covid. This leaves the current budget exposed to inflation risk. Without a return to central bank purchases of government debt, and with the inflationary headwinds of climate change and Donald Trump’s trade wars, this self-imposed rule means that higher inflation leads to fewer teachers, nurses and doctors. So remove debt-servicing costs from the rule.The investment rule – including public assets as well as liabilities when looking to reduce debt relative to GDP – makes more sense, except that targeting a reduction in public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) creates narrow incentives to meddle with local government pensions and the student loan book. There are broader alternative measures. As your editorial rightly pointed out, GDP growth hides all sorts of problems – not just stagnant wages, regional inequalities and falling GDP per head, but also no distinction between good growth and bad growth.To encourage good growth, I would suggest one further tweak: integrated financial and sustainability reporting. The logic is simple – by looking at social and environmental benefits alongside financial benefits, the government (and companies) can make better decisions. By announcing investment plans in January but not reporting thecarbon budgetuntil later in the year, we risk a period of uncertainty and flip-flopping. Integrated reporting means better decision-making, allowing the government to focus on growth that brings embedded benefits around health, equality, education, clean energy, decent work and resilient infrastructure.Dr Neil LancastleSustainability lead, school of accounting and finance,De Montfort UniversityIt is worth remembering that the only beneficiaries of economic growth are the 1% who control the levers of such growth. How long before Rachel Reeves starts banging on about trickle-down economics, which, again, only benefits the 1% at the top of the pile. Improving the wealth of all citizens is only possible through the redistribution of such closely hoarded wealth. However, as the wealthy control the means of redistribution through the media, finance and political support, I don’t expect to see any change in my lifetime. As usual, the rich get richer and the other 99% of the population and the environment can simply drown. But so long as there is demonstrable “growth”, that’s OK.Andrew RisbyLochgilphead, ArgyllDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, pleaseclick hereto upload it.

He is unlikely to play again this season and, as he will be out of action when Andy Farrell names his British & Irish Lions squad, Feyi-Waboso’s chances of touring Australia are hanging by a thread.Finn Russell fit to face England as Scotland name side for Six Nations clashRead moreThe 22-year-old has been at the centre of a saga over the past two months and Exeter made their feelings clear on Thursday with a terse statement that revealed the wing aggravated his shoulder in a rehab session with England during the first rest week of theSix Nations. Steve Borthwick had hoped that Feyi-Waboso might be available for the back end of England’s campaign but he is now set to be out until late May.The England assistant coach Richard Wigglesworth said: “We needed to make sure he was going to be right so he got tested properly here, significantly tested. It wasn’t right so then the surgery option then came. As an attack coach, I would be lying [if I didn’t think] ‘It would be nice if Manny was …’ but it wasn’t like that. There were all these hurdles that he was going to have to get over and failed at one, a fair bit away from returning to play. Part of being a professional rugby player is that you have to deal with these things. Knowing Manny as we do, he’ll be diligent, he’ll get back, and we’ll look forward to when he is.”The Professional Game Partnership – signed last summer and worth £33m a year to the clubs – is a step towards central contracts and gives Borthwick a greater degree of control over the 17 players, including Feyi-Waboso, on enhanced deals. Crucially, they also give him “final say” over all sports science matters including operations.The Feyi-Waboso saga is a messy one in what can be considered the first major test of the PGP. Soon after Feyi-Waboso suffered the injury, Exeter were keen for him to undergo surgery and the club booked him for an operation. It was believed that was the player’s preferred option. It then transpired he would have a second scan which raised two possibilities: to have surgery or to attempt to rehab his shoulder without the operation and potentially returning for the back end of the Six Nations.View image in fullscreenRichard Wigglesworth, England’s attack coach, talks to the players during a training session at Pennyhill Park.Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesWhen naming his squad for the Six Nations on 14 January, Borthwick said unequivocally that Feyi-Waboso would be having surgery but that did not prove to be the case due to a delay in the process. Amid that delay, the Exeter wing went down the rehab route and Borthwick was adamant it was the “player’s decision”. When called into camp last week, England put him through a series of tests; Feyi-Waboso reinjured his shoulder and finally went under the knife on Wednesday.It raises questions as to why two months elapsed between Feyi-Waboso sustaining the injury and having surgery and why there has been such confusion. The PGP was supposed to give Borthwick greater control, and with it clarity, but having three parties involved has drawn out the process. “I think it certainly would have happened quicker, without doubt,” Exeter’s director of rugby Rob Baxter said in January. “We had things booked, ready to go, decisions ready to be made a week ago, and then the process you have to go through now has certainly slowed things down.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Martin has started England’s last 11 matches but, having been unable to train last week, he was dropped to the bench with Leicester clubmate Ollie Chessum replacing him in the starting XV. After a setback in training, however, Martin drops out of the 23 with Hill in line to win his third cap and his first in four years.The 25-year-old is a flanker by trade but fills in at lock for Bath sporadically and England’s captain and second-row Maro Itoje is in no doubt as to Hill’s qualities. “He is a player I have admired for a number of years, seeing him do his thing at Worcester and then at Bath,” Itoje said. “In his last stint with England I also played with him there. He is a supreme athlete. He looks like Clark Kent and Superman with his glasses. He is a man carved out of Greek stone. I am very happy that I hopefully get an opportunity to play with him.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Are we underestimating the effect of these things? Did the pitch mics at the Bernabéu pick up Nico González in the pre-match huddle saying: “Lads, we’ve all absorbed the news about the related third-party transaction rules being declared improper. I am as a consequence bang up for this.” Did the cameras detect Savinho whispering: “Guys, we are now free to seek our own definition of market value. This commercial potential is hugely energising. Hit me early over the top.”‘We’ve been the worst this year,’ Guardiola says after Real Madrid thrashingRead moreThere will be suggestions that sport doesn’t work like this. Some will object that the logic doesn’t stand up because Newcastle’s players should also have been running on pure, uncut sovereign fund deregulation vibes, equal partners in a joyful 5-5 draw. Who can really say for sure? In the end, all that really seemed certain at the Bernabéu was that City’s Big Tribunal Energy had mysteriously dissipated.English champion teams have found themselves outmatched in this competition before. Although perhaps never quite like this. The likes of Blackburn at least had the good manners to look confused, angry, ready to do someone. City collapsed like a rain-sodden cardboard box, a sporting entity with no resistance, no fibre. A 3-1 defeatreally could have been anything at all.At the end of which three things seem true. First, the current iteration of this great team is now done. This was its last dance, a chance to go down, if not with all guns blazing, then with all guns gently ticking over in search of forensic incision.Instead, City were meek in a way that still comes as a shock to those yet to see it in the flesh. In Spain the buildup to this game was dominated by a debate overthe precise meaning of a key English swearword, with linguists and native speakers consulted on the nuances of Jude Bellingham’s controversial red card F-word. Pep Guardiola’s team have at least offered some clarity. People of Spain, watch the highlights back. This is what completely fucked looks like.The second certainty is that City will be back. This is not the end, because the end cannot exist now for clubs with these resources. Not only will the project endure, the project is already clearing new lines of finance via its elite tribunal game. Defeat in Spain, a single bad season. These losses can be absorbed when the sport is stratified as never before.The third thing relates to Guardiola himself, who once again delivered his public response like a man strapped to a wheel of pain, unable to process defeat, failure or elements beyond his reach. City will rebuild. But does Guardiola really have the will and the capacity to curate another era?With this in mind it is necessary to emphasise just how bad City were in Madrid. The numbers don’t get near it. By the end, City had 12 shots to Madrid’s 15. They shaded the possession and passing. In reality, this was a night of humiliation for Guardiola, his team olé’d about the place, rondo’d off, treated like cones. As early as the 20th minute it was startling Madrid were still only 1-0 up as those white shapes romped around the empty spaces, the crowd gushing idly over its favourites, clapping Raúl Asencio like proud parents as he completed a back pass.Kylian Mbappébarely broke into a sprint while compiling his hat-trick. But then, why sprint when the space is already there?View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé celebrates after scoring his second goal.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/APNone of this is unusual in outline. Things fall apart. Great teams decay and regenerate. Play enough times and you will eventually lose. The wider question for a manager who is obsessed with legacy and the due rewards of history is how much did Guardiola’s own errors contribute to this? And how successful has his time at City been when it comes to the greatest prize?“We have achieved something unique in our country and in Europe, we have won once and we have been there many times,” Guardiola told Spanish TV. It is a generous definition of unique. There are those in Spain who like to dwell on Guardiola’s relative failures in Europe given the scale of resources at his disposal.His 2011 Barcelona team are still the greatest of the century, a total re-gear of what it meant and felt and looked like to dominate elite football. But it does seem odd now that the creator of that team has won the competition once in 14 seasons since, reaching two finals, losing to Spurs, Monaco, Chelsea and others along the way. This despite having total patronage for his vision, the greatest riches, best facilities and most elite intelligence ever made available to any manager.The current season is Guardiola’s worst in European competition. The last seven games have brought five defeats andone win against Club Brugge. There has been for the first time a sense of being behind the curve.Paris Saint-Germain tore City apartplaying like a classic Pep team. Madrid did the same playing like a modern iteration, deep possession and rapid attacks.Guardiola has also made micro-mistakes. Abdukodir Khusanov’s deployment out of position at right-back against Mbappé-Vinícius felt like a kind of hazing ritual. What was meant to happen here? Khusanov, who has never played in a game like this, would suddenly discover miracle innate right-back capacities?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is also an angry, rage-fuelled leader. But how is it that Guardiola has allowed his team to become so reliant on a single player in every position, let alone a one-shot goalscorer? How is it he seems to have so few leaders, but plenty of fearful avatars of the blueprint? The great midfield obsessive has neglected his key area, failing to add in the summer when it must have been clear this was required. Kevin De Bruyne is still the only approved element of spontaneity, even in his new slower gear, still gamely chugging about like a routemaster bus on its way to a wedding. Nobody in the squad comes close to replicating those attributes.View image in fullscreenThe defeat in Madrid was City’s fifth in their last seven Champions League games.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty ImagesAsked if he has the will to drive this process, goaded a little by the home crowd chanting “Guardiola stay”, he answered: “Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. I want to continue.” It will be fascinating to watch this happen. Nobody really knows how Guardiola sees his future. Contract extensions are ultimately meaningless. The outcome of City’s financial charges will have a huge bearing. Which way will Pep jump?Rebuilding a team on this scale is an exhausting process. History suggests even great managers tend to get 10 years running ahead of the tide. Guardiola has been doing it for close to 20. His cultural impact is all pervading, to the extent it has become a self-fuelling competitive advantage as clubs appoint managers on the basis of their pencil-sketch similarity to the master.Perhaps that cycle has finally completed itself. Maybe Guardiola’s final hybrid shape is the all-conquering version of big men at the back, a big quick man up front and a midfield of core technical mastery.If so it feels fitting that team should play out their own farewell against Madrid, the celebrity counterpart to Guardiola’s more orderly collectivism, with their half a billion euros front four, with Carlo Ancelotti out there striding his touchline looking like a renaissance duke persuaded reluctantly to star in an advert for alpaca wool tailored overcoats.City and Madrid can both continue to present themselves as insider-outsiders, victims of the tyranny of hoi polloi, forced to obey rules made by others, wings constantly clipped. The project will endure and refresh, with or without the architect of its most beautiful moments. All angles considered, that tribunal victory probably is the most significant result of the week.Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaManchester CityKylian MbappéfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Key sticking points were expected to surround the precise role for Yasir al-Rumayyan, the PIF’s governor, in golf’s new world and where the Saudi-established LIV Tour sits on the sport’s schedule.Trump introduced Woods at the White House after the meeting in a reception marking Black History Month, saying they had “interesting discussions” about the future of the game.Tiger Woods expects Trump talks to see LIV golfers back on PGA Tour in 2025Read moreLIV’s formation in 2022 created divisions in elite golf that are yet to heal. Players such as Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau swapped the PGA Tour for LIV with no apparent hope of return. If Trump can accelerate a deal – and he believes he can – a pathway would be established for those golfers to play in PGA Tour events once again.Equally intriguing is where the PGA Tour, LIV and the DP World Tour all sit in what ideally would be a global golf schedule. The PGA Tour declined to comment on the White House meeting when approached by the Guardian on Thursday, but Monahan later confirmed the “constructive working session” with Trump and Al-Rumayyan.“Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, we have initiated a discussion about the reunification of golf,” Monahan said in a statement. “We are committed to moving as quickly as possible and will share additional details as appropriate.“We share a passion for the game and the importance of reunification. Most importantly, we all want the best players in the world playing together more often and are committed to doing all we can to deliver that outcome for our fans.”Trump holds a significant role not only because of his love for golf but because of the influence he can exert on the US Department of Justice, which under Joe Biden’s presidency was seen as a potential stumbling block to the PGA Tour and Saudis forming an alliance.In practical terms the PIF will seek to invest in PGA Tour Enterprises, a body created in June 2023 when a framework agreement for peace in golf was surprisingly announced. Broader matters of intrigue involve potential increased involvement by Saudi Arabia inUS sportsfranchises.Scott and Monahan also attended the White House in early February.Woods spoke more positively than everon Sunday about golf’s future. “Things are going to heal quickly,” Woods said. “We’re going to get this game going in the right direction.” Rory McIlroy had earlier revealed he played golf with Trump in early January.Explore more on these topicsTiger WoodsLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourGolfUS sportsSaudi Arabia and sportDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Work had already started on renovating their stadium thanks to the tireless efforts of the club’s former owners, who ran Trinity sustainably and deserve immense credit for nights like these becoming a reality. Without them, what happened next does not materialise.Wakefield were purchased by local businessman Matt Ellis and his family. They promised to revolutionise Trinity and how they have delivered on that promise. Ellis appointed the legendary Super League coach Daryl Powell to lead a rebuild in the Championship – and the club promptly won all three trophies on offer in the second tier last year.During that period, a redeveloped, modernised Belle Vue was being built – and the people of this West Yorkshire city responded to what was happening, with crowds going up last year, despite Trinity not competing in Super League.In an IMG criteria-led world where what you do off it means more, this club are the perfect blueprint.IMG arrived in rugby league determined to raise standards off the field, as well as on it. Off the field, Wakefield are now up there with the best of them but on it, this was an important lesson about the work that is still to be done by a club who have trodden a very similar journey themselves in recent seasons.View image in fullscreenHull KR’s Mikey Lewis receives treatment on an ankle injury sustained scoring the match-winning try.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAHull KR and Leigh Leopards have returned to Super League from the Championship in the last few years and have made no secret of their fact they want to thrive, not just survive.Leigh lifted the Challenge Cup in 2023, while Rovers made the Grand Final for the first time last season. They are clubs Wakefield are desperate to emulate.But the Robins showed here why they are made for the big moments with a hard-earned victory to spoil Wakefield’s Super League homecoming, in front of the biggest crowd Belle Vue has seen for 17 years. 4,710 watched Hull KR put 50 past Wakefield at the end of the 2023 season: here, 8,065 watched a much closer affair.It was a familiar story, with the reigning Man of Steel, Mikey Lewis, proving to be the difference as he scored the match-winning try. But that try could come at a cost for Lewis and Rovers, with the half-back suffering an ankle injury in the act of scoring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Red Devils named a predominantly reserve squad for their Betfred Super League opener against St Helens and were defeated 82-0 – the biggest losing margin in the competition's history – after they were placed under restrictions.Salford were bound to a £1.2m sustainability cap after they failed to provide the RFL with the necessary requirements to lift the restriction following businessman Dario Berta's takeover on 7 February.The club said in a statement: \"Salford Red Devils is pleased to announce that the takeover of the club has been formally approved by RFL Commercial, following the completion of the final requirements. As such, the club will be in a position to field a full-strength squad on Saturday for the Salford Red Devils' opening home fixture against Leeds Rhinos.\"The club is excited to welcome the Salford Red Devils community and enjoy the spectacle that will be the Happy Mondays, who will be performing on matchday.\"The RFL has launched a compliance investigation into Salford's decision to field a reserve squad against St Helens. The investigation could result in Salford being charged with a breach of operational rules, which if proven would expose the club to a range of potential sanctions.Salford's decision to use a reserve squad drew criticism from rivals, including the Warrington head coach, Sam Burgess, that it had compromised the integrity of the competition.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It doesn’t look good,” Hull KR’s coach, Willie Peters, admitted post-match. Rovers have fought to win their opening two games by a combined margin of just three points. In some ways, you could suggest that is a sign of a team yet to hit top gear. But in others, it is a hallmark of a team destined to compete at the top again: winning, even when they are not at their best.And Wakefield will hope they can now follow a similar journey after a remarkable turnaround in less than two years. With young, homegrown stars like Max Jowitt and Oliver Pratt excelling here, they have the foundations laid for something special, you suspect.This was a lesson as to the fine margins required to succeed at the highest level.But the fact it was a team who were in this position just a few years ago that taught that lesson shows there is a path for even brighter days ahead for a club with incredibly bold ambitions to gatecrash Super League’s elite.

However, the unspecified illness means a chance for Bakole to take on Parker, though the full IBF title will not be on the line.Dubois has won his 22 professional fights, suffering two defeats along the way. He won the “interim” IBF title against Filip Hrgovic and was promoted to world champion status when Oleksandr Usyk vacated the belt.New Zealand’s Parker has a record of 35 wins and three defeats.

With hindsight and our different experiences, we say to ourselves that we should have revealed it from the start. The message that I especially want to give is that we realise that the most important thing is happiness.”Bompastor and Abily were previously teammates at the French club Lyon, where they won two and five Women’s Champions League titles respectively, and both starred in the French national team for prolonged periods on the international stage, both surpassing 150 senior international caps.Asked what had held them back from disclosing their relationship in public sooner, Abily said: “We were still two well-known players. We were already associated with many things. We didn’t want it to be just that. We are working together at the moment, but it won’t be like this [working at the same club] our whole life either. We don’t work together because we are a couple. We work together because we complement each other.”Bompastor, who succeeded Emma Hayes as the Chelsea head coach, continued: “Revealing my life together with Camille, our relationship, after – as I say in the book – these 13 years of lies, is still a subject on which we are not entirely comfortable today. We are rather discreet and we like to have a completely normal life.

Source: CopernicusThe carbon pollution that humans have emitted into the Earth's atmosphere has trapped sunlight and caused the planet’s temperature to rise.On top of this, the chart shows temperatures were boosted in the first half of 2024 by the El Niño climate phenomenon. As this died out, temperatures dropped below 2023 levels – but still remained very high.Now let’s look again at the map of 2024 temperature records and the places that saw records broken by the greatest margins.The western part of theHindu Kush Himalayas (HKH)saw their hottest January on record in 2024. Parts of the mountain range saw the temperature record smashed by over 5C.Winter snow cover was low in the mountains, whose rivers supply water to a quarter of humanity.The HKH glaciers are projected to shrink by 30-50% this century even in a best-case scenario for cutting carbon pollution.“It is really scary,” said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, a climate scientist at Nepal’s International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. “I have seen how glaciers have been receding, lakes have been forming … and white mountains have been turning into black rock faces.”South Americawas hit by record-breaking monthly air temperatures in almost every month of 2024, but through March to June temperatures were consistently extreme in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and the Amazonas state of Brazil.Wildfires swept across the continentin 2024, anddrought hit the Amazon.Even the Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, went up in flames.AsChinaexperienced its hottest summer on record, parts of the country surpassed their previous average September record by over 5CAuthorities in ‘furnace city’ Chongqing, in central China, launched almost 200 cloud-seeding rockets to artificially bring rain and cool the megacity.Power grids across the country were strained by a surge in power demand, as people turned on their air-conditioning to seek relief from the heat.The poles are also heating alarmingly fast. In August 2024, a large swath ofAntarcticabroke temperature records for that month, with temperatures up to 6.5C above the previous record. This already followed a July that broke historic records for that month.This time of the year is midwinter for the south pole, and so the temperatures were still below zero – but some days saw temperaturesreach 28C above expectations.From August through to November, stretches of theArcticfrom Canada to Russia saw their hottest months on record.By the end of the summer melt season, in September, the extent of sea ice was at the sixth-lowest level that scientists had ever seen.They expect the Arctic to see its first ice-free September within the next decade.In every month of 2024, thethe oceansexperienced record surface air temperatures. The Atlantic was especially hot in the first half of the year. Parts of the Pacific and Indian oceans broke monthly air temperature records by over 1C for every month.What that means to people is “an explosion of extreme events of all sorts,” said Regina Rodrigues, an ocean scientist at Brazil’s Federal University of Santa Catarina.Hot air can hold more moisture, allowing storms to unleash more rain, while a hot ocean has more energy to feed hurricanes and cyclones as they release water vapour and heat. “It's almost as if it were boiling. What a warmer ocean does is cause rapid intensification,” said Rodrigues.Overall,global warmingis caused by burning fossil fuels. Experts warn that continuing to do so will lead to more death, disease and destruction.The Paris agreement set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century. While 2024 surpassed this level, the target is measured over decades, so a single year above that level does not mean the target has been missed.Still, current policies put the world on track for 2.7C of global heating, and experts warn the climate emergency continues to get worse with every fraction of a degree that temperatures rise. Every year in the past decade has been one of the 10 hottest, in records that go back to 1850.A woman uses a fan as she walks on a hot June day in Beijing.

Sebastião Moreira/ EPAC3S senior scientist Julien Nicolas said: “These findings highlight the unprecedented conditions of 2024 and the widespread, accelerating impact of human-induced climate change. As the planet continues to warm, more records are likely to be broken in many parts of the world, exposing larger populations to extreme heat, placing greater strain on the environment and ecosystems, and increasing the risk of profound and irreversible changes to the climate.”The Guardian analysis is based on air temperature two metres above the ground or sea. The monthly figures are based on an average of the daily figures, which themselves are an average of the hourly temperatures from Copernicus.These hourly snapshots are calculated by state-of-the-art reanalysis models, which combine billions of readings from satellites, ships, planes and weather stations. They are more accurate in populated parts of the planet than in remote regions with few direct observation sites.“These analyses are consistent with what is expected given the very large warming so far, and the particularly extreme conditions this year,” said Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich and vice-chair of the physical science working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).“If we don’t manage to decrease the burning of fossil fuels and reduce the global emissions of CO2 fast, these extreme temperatures will continue to become even more extreme and frequent,” she said. “Some regions could become uninhabitable. The last IPCC report has highlighted that we are starting to reach some limits to adaptation under the current level of global warming.”"

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is being lobbied by some fund managers to put more focus on the riskier practice of investing in the stock market as a way of boosting economic growth.Senior City executives have had meetings with Reeves, and it is understood that at the most recent there were discussions about possibly limiting the cash Isa allowance to £4,000 a year.This wasfirst reported by the Telegraph, and Reeves later signalled that changes could be on the way. Asked about the proposal on Thursday, she told broadcasters: “At the moment, there is a £20,000 limit on what you can put into either cash or equities, but we want to get that balance right.” She added that she wanted to create “more of a culture in the UK of retail investing like you have in the US, to earn better returns for savers”.UK savers urged to ‘act now’ and shake off their Isa apathyRead moreThe main two types of Isa are the cash Isa and the stocks and shares Isa, and currently the most an individual can save in these accounts is £20,000 each tax year. Consumers can spread their money between multiple Isas or just pay into one, so at the moment savers can stash up to £20,000 a year in one or more cash Isas.This allowance is a lot more generous than it used to be: for almost a decade the cash Isa limit was £3,000 a year, although it has stood at £20,000 since 2017.More than 18 million people have a cash Isa, and there is almost £300bn sitting in them, but earlier this month the new economic secretary to the Treasury, Emma Reynolds, spoke about theneed to drive an investment culture“that realises cash is not a good investment”, adding: “Why do we have hundreds of billions of pounds in cash Isas?”However, cash Isas are a key source of funding for banks and building societies, which use the deposits to fund loans to households and businesses.Last week, Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, said that any attempt to cut tax breaks on cash Isas would reduce the availability of mortgages for first-time buyers.Investing in the stock market has the potential for higher returns: the average stocks and shares Isa produced a 11.86% return over the past 12 months, compared with 3.8% for the average cash Isa, according to data issued on Thursday by the financial data provider Moneyfacts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said the police should re-investigate both the officer who sexually assaulted her daughter and her line manager.“Jaysley was so much more than just a soldier – she was our daughter, a sister to Emilli, and a friend to so many,” McCready said. “She was full of life, bright, and absolutely fantastic at her job.”She said Beck was so respectful that she called the officer “sir” even as he sexually assaulted her. “The army itself has said she was exactly the kind of person they wanted to join. She should still be here.”McCready said 700 women and men had come forward during the two-week inquest to report abuse.“We won’t stop fighting until meaningful action is taken,” she said.“This is a message to Sir Keir Starmer and our government – things need to change. The army cannot be allowed to investigate itself any more – when it comes to cases of sexual harassment, assault, bullying and abuse. The army shouldn’t be marking their own homework.”The inquest in Salisbury heard that in July 2021 Jaysley was allegedly assaulted by Battery Sgt Maj Michael Webber while on an adventure exercise. She told a relative this had included him putting his hands between her legs, and she had been so terrified she fled from him and slept in her car.Rheinberg said: “These were not reactions to a stolen kiss. On the balance of probabilities I find that Jaysley was sexually assaulted.”The coroner criticised the way the incident was investigated, concluding it should have been reported to the police rather than being dealt with, as it was, through a “minor administrative action”.Rheinberg said that in the autumn and winter of 2021, Beck’s line manager, Bdr Ryan Mason, had sent her an “onslaught” of “inappropriate” messages that “clearly breached army codes of conduct”. He described Mason’s declarations of unrequited love as “disturbing” and “intolerable harassment over a sustained period”.But, the coroner said, because of the way the Webber complaint was dealt with, Beck did not report Mason. She was found dead in her room at Larkhill Camp in Wiltshire on 15 December 2021.The coroner said: “There was a failure on behalf of the state to deal appropriately or effectively with the complaint by Jaysley following a sexual assault. The failure was systemic in that every senior officer involved in the decision-based process in seeking to secure the least possible punitive outcome on behalf of the accused failed to follow correct procedures, and in so doing so breached established policies.“Jaysley was left with a feeling of injustice, but more importantly lost faith in her ability to complain effectively. Jaysley’s superiors were aware that a serious wrong had been done to Jaysley by a senior officer. Trivial disciplinary action was taken. Inappropriate paternalism can play no part in an institution that requires high standards.”He added: “I find there is an arguable case for saying in relation to Jaysley the state breached her article 2 right to life by reason of the state’s failure to put in place a framework of laws, precautions, procedures and means of enforcement which will, to the greatest extent reasonably practicable, protect life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One witness said she had beenpropositioned by a sergeant when she was 17and took to locking her door because she was frightened colleagues would walk in when she was in bed.After the inquest Brig Melissa Emmett, the head of the army personnel services group, apologised to Beck’s family. “We should have done so much more to support and protect her,” she said.Emmett said there had been “significant” changes made since Beck’s death including“zero-tolerance policies”issued in 2022 to “unacceptable sexual behaviours”.Emma Norton, the founder ofthe Centre for Military Justiceand a lawyer for Beck’s family, led calls for an independent body to investigate complaints from service personnel. “The service complaints process doesn’t work,” she said.Alistair Carns, the minister for veterans and people, paid tribute to Beck and said the army ​w​ould “reflect on the failings identified to learn lessons” from the inquest​,​ adding that there ​w​as “no place for any abuse or unacceptable behaviours within the military”.He said: “Let me be clear: there is no place for any abuse or unacceptable behaviours within the military.

We will honour Jaysley’s legacy by ensuring this is done in the shortest possible time and in the most effective manner.​”Lisa Longstaff, of Women Against Rape, said: “The reports from the inquest reveal a horrific pattern of sexual abuse of power by officers who are of a higher rank and also age.

She thinks she’s a country vicar in the genteel shires, wicker basket and everything,” another member replies.“Fat [vicar] needs a more intense climb than Gorton Road,” the first councillor responds.In other messages she is referred to as a “massive bitch” and “the Laziest Vicar of 2018 Award Winner.”In a shocking exchange of messages, the group talk about seeking “retribution” against the priest, who was also a Labour party member.One references Bonfire Night, to which Gwynne replies: “Can’t we burn her on the bonfire?”When another member suggests she is “not flammable”, Gwynne replies saying: “Oh give over. Think of all that crackling!!!”The priest, who asked not to be identified further, said: “When the story ofAndrew Gwynne’s WhatsApp group ‘Trigger Me timbers’ first broke, I was surprised they would be that foolish, but not entirely shocked at the content.“I fully expected that I would be one of the people they discussed in such derogatory terms, although it is painful to read in a national newspaper. My feelings aside, this has upset my family and friends enormously.”The priest said she wanted to speak out because while much of the focus has been on the conduct of the politicians involved, “we have heard little of the impact on the individuals mentioned and the local community.“There is a deep sense of hurt and betrayal among the community, that people they supported and trusted would speak about them in such a denigrating manner,” she said.“I have spoken with some of those also mentioned, who like me feel hurt and humiliated, who have lost trust in those that were supposed to represent them.“We have been bullied, mocked and personally insulted in the most horrendous language, including wishing the death of a pensioner and an awful violent death on a cyclist.“These are people known to me who are generous with their time, who are decent, kind people who have supported Andrew.”Many of the “nasty degrading comments” that Gwynne had made towards constituents, the priest said, were directed towards “party members who worked hard to get Andrew elected, who were on his side”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How can you serve the community if you are insulting them to your friends in private?”A Labour party spokesperson said: “As part of our WhatsApp group investigation,a group of councillors have been administratively suspended from the Labour party.“As soon as this group was brought to our attention, a thorough investigation was launched in line with the Labour party’s rules and procedures and this process is ongoing.“Swift action will always be taken where individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour party members.”In a statement posted on X after he was suspended, Gwynne wrote: “I deeply regret my badly misjudged comments and apologise for any offense I’ve caused.“I’ve served the Labour party all my life and it was a huge honour to be appointed a minister by Keir Starmer. I entirely understand the decisions the PM and the party have taken and, while very sad to have been suspended, will support them in any way I can.”Explore more on these topicsLabourWhatsAppnewsShareReuse this content"

She was good at her job, confident, inspirational.But after joining the army at the ago of 16, Jaysley found herself trapped in a brutal, toxic environment where sexualised behaviour to young junior female soldiers was endemic and there was too little support and backing from the chain of command.By the time she was found dead in December 2021 aged 19,Jaysley had allegedly been sexually assaulted by a battery sergeant majorduring an adventure exercise.When Jaysley complained, the investigation was botched and, a few months later when she wassubject to a barrage of unwanted attention from her line manager, she did not raise it, fearing she would be seen as a mischief-maker.Jaysley also had two consensual relationships with soldiers – but both are troubling as they were with men who were significantly older and more senior in rank. One was married, which worried Jaysley deeply, while the other cheated on her.View image in fullscreenJaysley Beck at her passing out parade.Photograph: Family Handout/PAThe teenager’s family hope her inquest, which has been heard in Salisbury this month, will lead to real change in how women and children (Jaysley was a child when she joined) are treated in the armed forces and how their complaints are investigated.Emma Norton, founder of the Centre for Military Justice anda lawyer for Jaysley’s family, said that despite repeated promises by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to improve conditions for women, it was clear abuse continued.During Jaysley’s inquest, dozens of female soldiers have described their experiences on theFill Your Boots social media account, prompting the head of the army, Gen Sir Roly Walker, to expresshow “disgusted” he wasat what was still going on.Norton said: “The sheer volume of these posts suggests that this is not a problem of the past. Several of Jaysley’s friends gave evidence during the inquest about the continuing problems facing women in the army,in particular gross misogynistic language and behavioursthat are still being experienced.”She said the way complaints were investigated needed to be changed to stop terrible behaviour being swept under the carpet. “The service complaints process doesn’t work. It’s not independent. It’s run by the service concerned,” she said.There have long been calls for fundamental reform of the complaints system. Two major reviews,in 2019and2021, called for a central service complaints team.But Norton said: “The MoD is still not willing to countenance the independent handling of serious service complaints. They keep tinkering with the process, but it’s still the army investigating the army and they are marking their own homework.”Jaysley joined the army in March 2019 and undertook junior entry basic training at the army foundation college in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.Shortly after she graduated she began a relationship with one of her instructors, George Higgins, who was eight years older. During the inquest he refused to say when he first had sex with Jaysley.Jaysley was posted to 47th Regiment Royal Artillery (RA), based at the Larkhill camp inWiltshire, and in February 2021 was selected to serve in the corps engagement team, which travels around the UK promoting the army as a career.In July while on an adventure exercise in Hampshire, Battery Sgt Maj Michael Webber, who was 39 at the time, allegedly pinned Jaysley down and tried to kiss her during a drink-fuelled social event. She was so frightened she spent the night locked in her car.A junior officer found her and reported it to the RA’s regimental headquarters. Webber was dealt with by “a minor administrative action” and wrote Jaysley a letter of apology, which he ended by saying his “door was open” for her.During the inquest Maj James Hook, who organised the exercise, said he had known Jaysley was not enjoying the event and thought she might have been trying to “generate a situation” where she would be sent back to Larkhill.Col Samantha Shepherd, who was the regimental colonel for the RA, concluded the allegation was of “unwelcome attention, inappropriate contact” rather than of sexual assault. She told the inquest: “I know now that it constitutes a sexual assault but I didn’t know it at the time.”By the autumn of 2021 Jaysley’s line manager, Bdr Ryan Mason, appeared to have become fixated with her. In October and November he sent her almost 5,000 messages and voicemails, telling her: “You’re stuck with me for ever.”She considered him “psychotic and possessive” but was reluctant to report him. At this time she was also fretting over her relationship with SSgt Cory Budd, who was married.Friends of Jaysley’s – male and female –were aghast at how she had been treated.A male friend said her “flaw” was that she was “pretty”, which made her a constant target. A female colleague said Jaysley was “beautiful”, so she was bound to get harassment and “disgusting comments” from male soldiers.At the end of 2021, Jaysley had been keen to get away from camp for Christmas and had placed presents for her family in her car boot.In the early hours of 15 December 2021 after a party in her block, she sent a WhatsApp message to a relative, telling him she loved him. That afternoon, Jaysley’s body was found in her first-floor room.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Nandy said that the money would “shore up those institutions that are at risk of closure” and support our “crumbling infrastructure”.The cost of capital projects can easily run into millions. The Octagon theatre in Bolton underwent a programme of works withan estimated cost of £10m, while some theatres built with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) have beenquoted similar amountsto have it removed and repaired.When asked if the money will go far enough, Nandy said the government investment should lead to more philanthropic funds flowing away from London and into the regions.She said: “Small amounts of government money can unlock much larger sums. Over the last decade and a half, we’ve seen philanthropy step in to fill the gap that’s been lost from some government funding. But the problem is so much of that has been targeted towards a handful of major institutions, mostly in London.”The announcement was timed to mark the 60th anniversary of the publication of Jennie Lee’swhite paper on the arts. When Lee became the first arts minister in 1964 she tripled the Arts Council grant over a six-year period, and pumped resources into regional arts institutions.Nandy said that today not enough children felt comfortable in the country’s cultural institutions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But too many kids growing up today just don’t have that feeling. They don’t have that belief. One of the things I’m going to ask the arts world to do more of today is to open their doors to the communities to make sure that they are properly community spaces.”Earlier this week, the government confirmed a £10m investment into the British Library North in Leeds, while a further £5m went to the National Poetry Centre in the same city as part of a £47m fund for culture projects.The £10m for the British Library North will be spent revamping the Egyptian-style Temple Works building, which is a derelict Grade I-listed building that will be converted into a northern outpost for the library. The £5m for the National Poetry Centre will renovate a Grade II-listed building to create a national headquarters for poetry.Explore more on these topicsLisa NandyArts Council EnglandBritish MuseumLabournewsShareReuse this content"

In June, a man was jailed for pinning down and repeatedly punching a judge, Patrick Perusko, during a family court case.Walney, who was formerly the Labour MP John Woodcock, said the review commissioned by Carr “should not only examine better physical protection for judges, it should lead to better understanding and restraint from politicians who can put lives at risk with ill chosen words”.In a further indication of Tory distrust of judges, the former prime minister Liz Truss told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, US, on Wednesday that the British judiciary “is no longer accountable”.“The same people are still making the decisions. It’s the deep state, it’s the unelected bureaucrats, it’s the judiciary,” she told the audience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A further appeal was allowed by upper tribunal judges in January.Carr said she was “deeply troubled to learn of the exchanges” at PMQs and told reporters she had written letters about her concern regarding judicial decisions.“It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary. Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process,” she said.Responding to Carr’s concerns, Philp said politicians were “perfectly entitled to comment on decisions by judges”. Jenrick said: “The principle of the rule of law is being misused. It needs to be reclaimed. It does not, and never has meant, rule by lawyers.”The Conservative party was approached for a comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumConservativesRobert JenrickChris PhilpnewsShareReuse this content"

While most people get better at home in a couple of days, it can be more serious in older adults, younger children and people who are immuno-compromised.According to data fromNHSEngland, on average 1,160 patients a day were in hospital with norovirus last week, a 22% rise compared with the week before. In the same period last year the rate was 509 patients a day.The Guardian understands the most recent high was two weeks ago, when there was an average of 961 cases a day.The number of patients with Covid is also rising, albeit slightly, while the number of children in hospital with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has continued to climb, and flu cases in hospital remain high, despite falling.Health bosses saidhospitals were running at near capacity, with more than 95% of adult beds occupied. The situation was a result of demand as well as delays in discharging patients, with almost one in seven beds occupied by patients who are well enough to leave.“It is concerning to see the number of patients with norovirus hit an all-time high and there is no let-up for hospital staff who are working tirelessly to treat more than a thousand patients each day with the horrible bug, on top of other winter viruses,” said Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England.“To help stop the spread of norovirus, it is important to remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water and avoid mixing with other people until you have not had symptoms for two days.”Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, suggested the high levels of norovirus reflected a return to pre-pandemic behaviours.“Research found that although hand washing and hand sanitising increased during 2020 and 2021 during Covid, it’s since decreased, as people have become less worried about infections and viruses generally,” he said. “For examplesurveyshave found that around one in five [people] don’t always wash hands after the loo, and aboutfour in tendon’t wash [hands] before handling or cooking food,” he said.Another problem, said Williams, was presenteeism - people being required or expected to go into work or school even when they had symptoms.“Most hospital acquired norovirus is spread by people with symptoms – and so the lesson is that if you are sick, try to reduce mixing close contact indoors and especially avoid sharing things like food or drinks, and especially for those more at risk clinically or the elderly,” he said.“Norovirus can be serious for some, but who wants to be sick for a few days if they can avoid it? It’s unpleasant at best.”Explore more on these topicsNorovirusNHSHealthHospitalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Membership records show he has never been a member,” they said.Materialon Facebook from 2021 showsGill wearing a Reform UK rosette while campaigning with Richard Tice, who is now Reform UK’s deputy leader. “Great to be with Nathan Gill, leader of Reform UK Wales, campaigning today,” Tice posted.Police said Gill, who lives in Anglesey (Ynys Môn), north Wales, was charged by postal requisition, adding: “The investigation has been led by detectives from the Met’s counter-terrorism command and a man was previously interviewed under caution on 3 March 2022 in connection with bribery allegations.“Further inquiries were carried out by officers and after authorisation by the Crown Prosecution Service counter-terrorism division, the man was subsequently charged as above.”Gill became an MEP for Ukip in 2014, a role that ended when Britain left the European Union.He quit Ukip after accusing it of losing its focus on Brexit to pursue an anti-Islam agenda.In 2019 he was elected to the European parliament for Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, the forerunner to Reform UK.Gill was also a member of the then national assembly for Wales between May 2016 and December 2017.After leaving Ukip he sat as an independent and in 2021 was billed as Reform UK’s leader in Wales before Senedd elections. He failed to win a seat.On his X account, last updated in 2021, Gill wrote: “The last MEP for Wales, having worked for 16 years to make it so. Love my God, my family and my country. Not ashamed or afraid to be patriotic.”In 2016 he described the importance to his life of his Mormon faith.He told the BBChe was teetotal and had been a bishop in Anglesey with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for six years.Explore more on these topicsUK newsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

That will continue to be my obsession,” he added, asCentricareported a slump in profits.The supplier’s customer service has come under fire in recent years as the energy crisis has caused bills to rise, and households have raised concerns about faulty smart meters.Losing top spot to Octopus came almost four decades after British Gas was privatised under Margaret Thatcher. This was described as “quite honestly the biggest development in the domestic retail energy market since it opened”, by Dan Morris, the chief executive of the consulting firm Cornwall Insight.British Gas managed to keep its customer base relatively steady last year, despite rising competition in the market, according to Centrica’s financial results, published on Thursday.Centrica said the supplier now served 7.46m households, compared with 7.53m in 2023. This means British Gas holds 23.1% of the market, narrowly behind Octopus, which grew its share of the market to 23.7% of households in Great Britain by the end of last year.O’Shea said keeping energy bills lower would rely on the UK building “a resilient energy system with an abundant source of supply”.He confirmed that Centrica was still in talks with the government over plans toinvest in keeping its Rough gas storage facility open, and in building a new nuclear power plant alongside French utility EDF at Sizewell C, in Suffolk.The FTSE 100 utility company has warned that gas bills could be billions of pounds higher unless the government supports its planned £2bn investment to upgrade the Rough gas storage site off the Yorkshire coast.O’Shea said that the UK’s biggest gas store, which was loss-making in the second half of last year, would not remain open unless it was a financially sustainable asset. The company did not need government funds, he said, but hoped to secure similar revenue guarantees as those offered to other energy infrastructure projects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At his confirmation hearing, Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee tried in vain to elicit answers about his role as a witness in the criminal investigation into Trump’s mishandling of classified documents.During the investigation, Patel was subpoenaed to testify about whether the documents the FBI seized atMar-a-Lagohad been declassified under a “standing declassification order”, as he had represented in various public comments at the time.The Guardianreported at the timethat Patel initially declined to appear, citing his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. He later testified after the chief US district judge in Washington authorized Patel to have limited immunity from prosecution, which forced his testimony.That loyalty, to resist federal prosecutors, endeared him to Trump and is understood to have played a factor in him ultimately getting tapped for the FBI director position after Trump struggled for weeks to decide who he wanted at the bureau, a person familiar with the matter said.Patel ultimately clarified, in something of a partial admission under close questioning from senator Cory Booker, that although he witnessed Trump issue a declassification order for some documents, he did not actually know whether they applied to the documents found at Mar-a-Lago.Democrats have unanimously considered Patel’s track record in the firstTrump administration, his incendiary remarks criticizing the bureau he was nominated to lead and more generally his role in the classified documents case to be disqualifying.When Trump tapped Patel last year, Democrats largely believed it would lead to a backlash that would sink his nomination. No resistance ever materialized, in part because Patel was less controversial than some of Trump’s other nominees, such asPete Hegsethfor defense secretary.Patel was formerly a public defender in Florida before joining the justice department in 2014 as a line prosecutor in the national security division.Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to lead FBI, accused of orchestrating agency purgeRead moreIn 2017, Patel became a top Republican aide on the House intelligence committee, where he authored a politically charged memo accusing the FBI and the justice department of abusing surveillance powers to spy on a Trump adviser. The memo was criticized as misleading, though an inspector general later found errors with aspects of the surveillance.His efforts impressed Trump, who brought him into the administration and quickly elevated him to national security and defense roles. By the end of Trump’s first term, he was the chief of staff to defense secretary Chris Miller and briefly considered for CIA director.While John Durham, the special counsel appointed by Trump, found a catalog of mistakes by prosecutors in the Russia investigation, he found no evidence that officials had been motivated by political animus and brought no charges – contrary to claims by Trump and Patel.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpFBIUS politicsMar-a-LagoLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

The invertebrates have rows of pudgy legs and skin speckled like a galaxy, and areconsidered “living fossils”, having remained virtually unchanged for 500m years.“They are from this ancient lineage and they are unique,” says On Lee Lau, who works in the collections team at Tūhura Otago Museum and backed the creature to win the country’s annual bug of the year award.“They seem very soft and like a slow-moving, stumpy kind of caterpillar,” Lau said. “But they have that dark secret where they’re really amazing hunters, and can shoot slime out of their oral papillae.”Velvet worms are not actually worms or caterpillars, despite their names and resemblance. Rather, they are considered something of a missing link between worms and insects and are so distinctive from other invertebrates they have their own taxonomic rank below “kingdom” and above “class,” called Onychophora.View image in fullscreenTheHolacanthella duospinosa,or Giant Springtail, was also a nominee in the competition.Photograph: Frank Ashwood/SuppliedThePeripatoides novaezealandiaeis one of roughly 30 velvet worms endemic toNew Zealand. They typically reside on the forest floor, where they shoot jets of sticky fluid on to their prey, before dissolving it into a soup and slurping it up. Velvet worms are thought to live for roughly five years and produce 10 to 20 offspring annually. Some, including the winner, hatch their eggs internally and bear live young.The elusive velvet worms are difficult to study as they can be hard to find, and while the winning species is thought to have a stable population, they are subject to threats such as habitat loss and predators, according to theDepartment of Conservation. Globally,insect numbers are plummetingdue to intensive agriculture, urbanisation and climate change.The Entomological Society of New Zealand launched thebug of the yearcompetition in 2023, inspired by the country’s wildly popularbird of the year competition. The popularity of the bug awardsis growing, with this year’s competition generating the highest number of voters so far – nearly 10,000.The velvet worm won with 2,652 votes, just 110 points ahead of the runner-up – an endemic apple-green praying mantis. Other contenders included a wingless fly that hitches rides on bats, a slug that looks remarkably like a gherkin, an exquisite lichen-coloured moth, and a sea slug named after Sméagol from Lord of the Rings.Wild fish can tell humans apart when they dress differently, study findsRead moreJenny Jandt, a senior zoology lecturer at the University of Otago who helps coordinate the competition, said this year’s line-up was the most diverse yet, with every one of the 21 bugs representing a different taxonomic family.The competition aims to highlight not just the conservation status of bugs and the important ecological role they play, but to foster celebration, Jandt said.Many of the creatures go unnoticed and unrecognised, Jandt said. “You have to look for them. But once you start looking, the world becomes this bigger, more magical place.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

The deportees included 126 people with criminal charges or convictions, the spokesperson said, 80 of whom were allegedly affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang. The spokesperson said 51 had no criminal record.The move comes after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last week seeking access to dozens of immigrants flown to a US naval base in Guantánamo Bay,Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney.The Trump administrationbegan shipping detained immigrants to Guantánamo on 4 February, describing them as the “worst of the worst” and saying that they included “criminal alien murderers, rapists, child predators and gangsters”.Human rights lawyers argued that the US government had not provided proof that any of the detainees had committed serious crimes, while relatives of some of the men denied that they had been involved in wrongdoing.The websiteMigrant Insiderreported that relatives identified one detainee asLuis Alberto Castillo Rivera. The 23-year-old Venezuelan was detained when seeking asylum on the southern border on 19 January,one day before Trump took powervowingto return “millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came”.“He’s innocent,” Castillo’s sister, Yajaira Castillo, told the Spanish news agency EFE, denying her brother was part of Venezuela’sTren de Aragua gang.Thursday’s flight comes two days after Honduranpresident Xiomara Castro announcedthat a deal had been reached with the Trump administration to salvage an extradition treaty that was set to expire on 28 February.The treaty has mostly been used to bring drug traffickers to justice in the United States, but was denounced by Castro in August, at about the same time that avideoemerged of her brother-in-law negotiating illicit campaign contributions with traffickers.The Honduran foreign minister, Eduardo Reina, said on Tuesday that the deal to save the treaty included safeguards against the use of extradition to interfere with the country’s electoral cycle in 2025. Critics denounced the move as an effort to protect the president’s family from the same fate as her predecessor, Juan Orlando Hernández, who last year was convicted of drug-trafficking conspiracy charges in New York. Castro has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Reina had also said that the deal involved the issue of migration. Honduras is one of the few countries in the region that recognized Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s disputed victory in last year’s election and also has cordial, albeit complicated, relations with Washington.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationGuantánamo BayVenezuelaCubaHondurasLaw (US)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The subsequent six-year gap until GoldenEye was the longest break in the history of Bond.It has been four years since the 2021 release of No Time To Die and, with no new film in production, the current hiatus is on course to become 007’s longest ever holiday.Gaining creative control will give Amazon the power to move forward without approval from Wilson and Broccoli, who have acted as careful guardians of the integrity of a character originally created in 1953 by author Ian Fleming.View image in fullscreenBarbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson pictured in London in 2022.Photograph: Suzan Moore/PASteven Gaydos, executive editor of the US film magazine Variety, said he was initially surprised by the deal after reports that Broccoli and Wilson had not hit it off with the new owners,denied by Amazon, and were unhappy at the prospect of several Bond spin-offs.He said: “It wasn’t that long ago that it was reported that Barbara and Michael had sparred with Amazon and there had been a fight over it. But they’re getting older and there is a mountain to climb to achieve what they have done.“It’s a record that will never be matched.

He said: “With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects. Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.”Broccoli, 64, said: “My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honour of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of No Time to Die, and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”Broccoli is the daughter of Cubby Broccoli, who co-founded the series with fellow producer Harry Saltzman. She began working on the Bond films as a teenager in minor roles, before acting as assistant director on Octopussy in 1983 and associate producer on The Living Daylights in 1987. Her first full Bond producer credit was onGoldenEyein 1995.Wilson is Cubby Broccoli’s stepson. A qualified lawyer, he joined Broccoli’s Eon Productions in 1972 and became executive producer on Moonraker in 1979, and moved to producer for A View to a Kill in 1985.Together the pair built Bond into one of the most successful franchises in cinema history, having grossed more than $7.8bn worldwide, behind only the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Spider-Man. The most successful Bond film remains Skyfall, released in 2012, with a worldwide gross of $1.1bn.Eon has been reluctant to spread the Bond name too thin through the kind of spin-offs that have proved fruitful for streaming services, which have cashed in on the popularity of films such as Star Wars or zombie TV show The Walking Dead.A rare foray outside the Bond films was the creation of007: Road to a Million, a reality competition series released on Amazon Prime Video that features nine teams competing for a £1m prize.Explore more on these topicsJames BondAmazonJeff BezosFilm industryAmazon Prime VideonewsShareReuse this content"

The special prosecutor, Onondaga county district attorney William Fitzpatrick, began to detail the charges in court Thursday afternoon.Prison guards Nicholas Anzalone, David Kingsley, Anthony Farina, Christopher Walrath and Matthew Galliher were among the people charged with second-degree murder, according to court documents. The name of the sixth person charged was redacted, so it’s unclear whether they were a guard.All six were also charged with first-degree manslaughter, meaning prosecutors believe they are criminally liable for the conduct of others.After some of the corrections officers were released on bond, one man said: “This is not justice, judge. These people killed a Black man,” as he left the courtroom. One woman was removed after shouting: “Murder, murder.”Body-camera video shows officers pummeling Brooks, whose hands are cuffed behind his back. Officers strike him in the chest with a shoe and lift him by the neck and drop him. The video recorded on the night of 9 December has no sound, but the guards meting out the punishment and watching it appear unconcerned. Brooks, 43, died the next day.An autopsy report issued by the county medical examiner’s office in January concluded that Brooks’s death had been caused by compression of the neck and multiple blunt-impact injuries, and that the manner of death was determined to be a homicide, according to Brooks’s family’s attorneys.Corrections officer Matthew Galliher was further charged with gang assault. Three other prison guards were charged with lesser manslaughter offenses, meaning that prosecutors believe they did not commit murder, but were criminally responsible for the actions of others to some degree. Those include Michael Mashaw, Michael Fisher and David Walters.Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, first announced the murder charges early Thursday afternoon in a statement.“Robert Brooks should be alive today. The brutal attack on Mr Brooks was sickening, and I immediately moved to terminate the employment of those involved. Now, the perpetrators have been rightfully charged with murder and state police are making arrests,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve worked with commissioner [Daniel] Martuscello [of New York’s department of corrections and community supervision] on safety reforms, including installing new security cameras, strengthening the office of special investigations and increasing compensation for our hard-working correction officers,” Hochul said in Thursday’s statement.Hochul had ordered state officials to initiate proceedings tofire more than a dozen employeesimplicated in the attack on Brooks.Brooks had been serving a 12-year prison sentence for first-degree assault since 2017. He arrived at the prison 200 miles (320km) north-west of New York City only hours before the beating, after being transferred from another nearby facility, officials said.Brooks’s son, Robert Brooks Jr, claimed in a federal lawsuit filed in January that his father’s attackers “systematically and casually beat him to death” and that the prison system tolerates violence.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS prisonsUS crimeLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

The court added: “For copyright protection to apply, there must be such a degree of design that the product displays some individuality.The court said that “pure craftsmanship using formal design elements” was not enough, in a judgment that brought to a close the legal saga that began in May 2023.Despite the ruling, Birkenstock defended bringing the case. “We want to ensure that copycats can no longer make money at the expense of our brand,” said the company spokesman Jochen Gutzy.Founded in 1774 in a small community in south-west Germany as a firm focused on making orthopaedic footwear, Birkenstock has grown into a globally recognised brand.Its sandals are popular among celebrities, with the singersKaty Perryand Britney Spears seen wearing the shoes in recent years. They also appeared in the 2023 movie Barbie, when Margot Robbie’s characterswapped high heels for a pink pair.In 2021 the Birkenstock family sold its majority stake in the group to the LVMH-linked equity firm L Catterton and the French billionaire Bernard Arnault’s family holding fund Financière Agache.It launched an international public offering on the New York Stock Exchangein 2023.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The British state is now failing, is not working. The decisions are not being made by politicians.”Truss, who was prime minister for only 49 days and lost her seat in last year’s general election, has become an increasingly marginal figure in British politics but found safe harbour atCPAC, a once mainstream conservative gathering that has embraced Trump’s brand of nativist-populism.‘The deification of Trump will be complete’ at CPAC 2025Read moreVoters are increasingly angry, she claimed, because they keep voting for change only to be disappointed, including in the current prime minister,Keir Starmer. “The same people are still making the decisions. It’s the deep state, it’s the unelected bureaucrats, it’s the judiciary.“And I think what ultimately will happen, what I hope to see, is a movement like you have in the US with Maga [‘Make America great again’], with CPAC, with all these organisations, that ultimately pushes change we all want. We want to have a British CPAC.”Matt Schlapp, the longtime CPAC organiser who has previously exported the brand to countries including Argentina, Australia and Hungary, replied: “It’s a deal!”The head of CPAC Hungary, Miklós Szánthó, was also present at Wednesday’s “international summit” and reminded the audience that political strategist Steve Bannon had once described Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán as “Trump before Trump”.Szánthó earned applause from the audience by declaring: “Hungary is the island of freedom in the liberal ocean of Europe.”He said: “We might be even more thrilled about the return of Donald J Trump to the White House than you are ... I am sure that this world will be a better place for true conservatives and true Hungarians with Donald J Trump in the White House.”Railing against “wokeness”, he urged: “My point is that American and European conservatives should join forces ... in order to keep up the fight.”Bannon, a podcaster and longtime Trump adviser, thanked CPAC’s organisers for standing by Trump in the wake of his election defeat and the 6 January 2021 insurrection when, he said, the Republican party and the conservative Fox News channel abandoned him.But he also pushed deep state conspiracy theories as he warned that, despite Trump’s electoral comeback and blitz of executive orders over the past month, the struggle against liberal forces continued. “If you look at our partners and look at the parties and the politicians and the youth and the grassroots movement throughout the world, Europe, South America, Central America, Asia, it’s now our time,” he said.“This is when it’s going to be the hardest because they’re not going to sit there and go, OK, we see what you guys want to do, you’re about liberty and freedom. They’re not about liberty and freedom.“They’re about controlling the most powerful apparatus in the United States and in all these other countries in world history and they’re not going to give it up unless we take it from them. And when we take it from them we then have to execute on that to make sure we deliver on the promise of liberty and freedom and that is a grind every day of the week.”Officials from countries including Australia, Japan, South Korea also took part along with Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of the formerBrazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, and Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence under Trump.Schlapp closed the session with a resolution on “globalism” to which all assented. It read: “The countries, organisations and activists assembled at this, the second annual CPAC international summit, join our voices in opposition to the globalist cabal represented at the EU, the São Paulo Forum, the UN, the WHO and the World Economic Forum and myriad other organisations funded by leftist elites.“These self-anointed global elites are not only anti-democratic; they have been wrong on every major national and international issue for decades. We wish to thank God for giving society a second chance with the election of President Trump. Each blue binder holding a Trump executive order represents a bold step toward reclaiming freedom and common sense in America’s constitutional republic.”Schlapp added: “As America heals from its four-year experiment with socialism, the world improves. Iran will be weakened and denuclearised. China will be countered and cut out of our digital infrastructure. Criminal gangs will be policed and jailed and human traffickers will be shamed and sentenced. We applaud President Trump’s courage, leadership and resilience. Together, we stand ready to assist him in every step along the way.”CPAC is scheduled to hear from the vice-president, JD Vance, on Thursday and Trump on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsCPACLiz TrussUS politicsMarylandDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

They are the former head coach of the women’s national team Jorge Vilda; the former Spanish football federation sporting director Albert Luque; and the federation’s former marketing chief Rubén Rivera.The episode, which overshadowed the team’s triumph at the World Cup final in Sydney and prompted a national and international debate on sexism and consent, resulted in Hermoso receiving death threats and eventually led Rubiales to resign as the head of the federation.Rubiales, 47, has always insisted the kiss on Hermoso’s lips after the final in Sydney was consensual. “I am absolutely sure that she gave me her permission,” Rubialestold the court in Madridearlier this month. “In that moment it was something completely spontaneous.”The judge disagreed, however. In Thursday’s verdict, José Manuel Clemente Fernández-Prieto ruled Rubiales sexually assaulted Hermoso when he “grabbed the player’s head with both hands and, then, in a sudden manner and without her consent and acceptance, kissed her on the lips”.The judge added: “This action of kissing a woman on the lips has a clear sexual connotation and is not the way people greet those with whom they are not in an emotional relationship.” He also noted that Rubiales had congratulated other members of the victorious team by hugging them and kissing them on the cheek.Fernández-Prieto said Hermoso had made it abundantly clear in her evidence that she had never consented to the kiss, adding that given her previously good professional relationship with Rubiales, the player had no reason to lie.The judge gave Rubiales –whose annual salary at the federation was €675,000– 10 days to appeal against the sentence before the same court. His lawyer has confirmed that he will lodge an appeal.The verdict was welcomed by Spain’s equality minister, Ana Redondo, who said it had sent out a clear message. “I think the important thing here is to underline that a non-consensual kiss is a sexual assault,” Redondo said, adding: “A victim’s words have to be heard and respected, and not questioned.”The Podemos MEP and former equality minister Irene Montero said feminism was changing things. “It’s not so long ago that it would have been unthinkable for the judicial system to recognise a non-consensual kiss as sexual assault.” However, she added, the fines and damages imposed should have been higher.View image in fullscreenHermoso has said the kiss and its fallout turned her life upside down.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesGiving evidence on the first day of the trial, Hermoso was adamant she hadnever consented to being kissed by Rubiales, adding that he had not sought her permission to do so.“I felt it was totally out of place and I then realised my boss was kissing me, and this shouldn’t happen in any social or workplace setting,”she said. “I felt disrespected. One of the happiest days of my life was tarnished.”Hermoso told the court the kiss and its fallout had turned her life upside down and severely affected her family. “I’m a world champion but it seems that even to this day my life has been on standby,” she said. “I honestly haven’t been able to live freely.”In his evidence, Rubiales acknowledged that he had made an error of judgment but maintained that the kiss had been consensual. “It’s obvious now that I made a mistake,” he told the court. “It was spontaneous. I behaved like a sportsperson, like I was one more member of the team. I should have been more cold-blooded and adopted a more institutional role.”Rubiales denied trying to coerce Hermoso into making a statement playing down the incident, saying he had suggested they make a joint statement to calm the situation. Hermoso refused but the federation still released a statement on her behalf.The player said the statement made her feel “that I was participating in something I hadn’t done and in which I didn’t want to participate”. The court heard testimony from Hermoso’s brother Rafael, whosaid Vildahad asked him on the flight back from Australia to “convince” his sister to record a video with Rubiales to show she was not bothered by the kiss.Rubiales initially attempted to brush off the controversy,dismissing critics of his actionsas “idiots and stupid people”. But the incident provoked global outrage, led to his beingprovisionally suspendedby Fifa, and prompted Hermoso to makea criminal complaint.Days later, amid mounting outrage over the kiss – as well as over Rubiales grabbing his crotch while standing next to Queen Letizia of Spain and her 16-year-old daughter, Infanta Sofía, as the team won the World Cup – the federationdemanded that he resign.It also sacked Vilda, who was one of many officials to have applauded a defiant speech Rubiales made to the federation in which he said “I will not resign” five times and hit out at “false feminism” while also seeking to portray himself as a victim and recast the kiss as “a peck”.Explore more on these topicsSpainSpain women's football teamWomen's footballWomen's World CupEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Did you actually want that level of success?tomfowler500If wehad, then we wouldn’t have been on 4AD – because Pixies and Cocteau Twins were on 4AD and neither of them had a Top 10 single. They were popular and respected, but 4AD was not the label to push you up the Billboard charts. I don’t think any of us were built for that treadmill, or those long distances, and it’s hard not to lose your mind. I used to prepare for tours by taking Linguaphone tapes and thinking, “I’m going to learn Italian”. But within two weeks I was pissed out of my mind and shagging around and acting like an animal.Do you have a favourite memory of Chris you’d like to share?Mr_202I was at college with Chris. I went out with him. I knew him closely for a decade, so there’s not a single anecdote that sums him up. He was genuine, honest, likeable, good humoured. Not a shred of arrogance. What you got was really him. He wasn’t putting it on. He was just a joy to be around. I think he obviously went through something very difficult which must have overwhelmed him and ended with him taking his own life, but that wasn’t who he was. When I got the news, my overwhelming feeling was that I just wanted to run out of the room, up the street and away from it. I like to think that now he’d have been very happy, with a big family up in the Lakes.View image in fullscreenLush in 1994 … Chris Acland, Emma Anderson, Miki Berenyi and Phil King.Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesThank you for the Lush reunion gigs and the wonderfulBlind Spot EP. But why was it all over so quickly?Robot3021The tour was always intended as a one-off, partly because I’ve got two kids, was the main breadwinner and wasn’t going to give up my job in publishing for the precarious finances of a band. Emma [Anderson] had her daughter, too. We had a great time making the EP and it was lovely to sell out the Roundhouse, but the problem in bands is always how you navigate bumps in the road. Without Chris as a balancing influence, Emma and myself had a difficult relationship. Sometimes it was great. Sometimes it could be nasty. I didn’t write about it in my book because I didn’t want it to be like Morrissey’s autobiography, with pages of boringly minute detail on the trial. But there was a falling out and, if I’m honest, it still hurts.What were the inspirations behind the new Miki Berenyi Trio album, Tripla?SinthnimanshaTripla is Hungarian for “triple”. I’m half Hungarian and I think what’s nice about the language is that you can pick a word and nobody really knows it. There are three people in the band. It was going to be “three”, but three in Hungarian is “három”, which is a bit close to “harem” – a connotation I don’t really want to explore. But “tripla” sounds quite joyful, and the music is upbeat. I realised that most [pop] lyrics are grounded in being young – love and sex and the energy of youth. It’s harder to find things to write about when you’re older that isn’t gardening or a trip to B&Q, so [on Tripla] there’s green politics and social media and stuff. At my age [57], it can sound like you’re trying to be relevant and young, but those things affect older people just as much. I wrote about how things affect me emotionally, which I have always done.Fingers Crossed by Miki Berenyi review – trauma, stage-dives and stardomRead moreYour memoir, Fingers Crossed: How Music Saved Me from Success,waspretty bleak in places. Are you OK now?ElephonseI was OK when I was going through a lot of what’s in the book. When you write a memoir, you’re writing about a lot of significant moments, but you don’t want to give people the impression your life was wall-to-wall drama. I guess no one would have seen the sexual abuse stuff coming [Berenyi alleged that she was abused by her grandmother], even though a lot of people experience it. I didn’t really talk about it in interviews because I didn’t trust the journalists to handle it properly. I survived, but I didn’t like the Daisy Chainsaw/Babes in Toyland image of ripped clothes, smeared lipstick and a hint of violation. One thing that hadn’t been talked about is how normalised it becomes in your life and how damaging it can be. Some people become promiscuous, some people self-harm or struggle with relationships. I wrote about how I navigated it, and every now and then I’ve had a nod from people who’ve said they went through something similar.What was the most unexpected –or pleasant – response to your memoir?JimFixxThe great reviews were unexpected, but it meant most to me that people praised the actual writing, because it wasn’t ghostwritten. I had so little self-confidence when doing it. I would think: “No one cares about the singer from Lush doing a bloody autobiography.” It was gruelling. So it was nice to realise that sometimes the smaller stories are the most interesting ones.From Spurs fan to Spurs fan, how did theLillies’ single And David Seaman Will Be Very Disappointed About That …come about?CoopertapesSimon Raymonde from Cocteau Twins, Moose [Kevin McKillop] and Russell [Yates] from the band Moose, Chris [Acland] and I used to go see Spurs together. When we beat Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final, Lush were asked to do a flexi for a club fanzine called The Spur. It was a bit of fun that became a news story. When I turned up for the photo session we’d all been out the night before, so I could barely stop myself from vomiting. We all looked absolutely fucked apart from Simon. My sole contribution to the song was to ad lib “3-1, 3-1”, which made Simon very happy.Will you ever go back to the pinkish-red hair you had in Lush? Or is that part of your past?DaveBrettThere’s always an assumption everything I do is thought out and planned – but the only reason I had my hair red was that I’d been mucking about with Crazy Color since I was 14. At 19, I dyed it red and it stayed that way. I’m actually very lazy when it comes to presentation. I cut my own hair and if I find clothing I like that’s it for the next two years. On tour in the 90s, people used to stare at me but I zoned out to the point I couldn’t see it. I wasn’t going to stop dyeing it because some bloke would go: “Oh, you’d look really pretty if your hair was natural.” The reason I stopped was because, once I had children, I thought: “I haven’t time for this.” You’re thankful if you even have time to get dressed.View image in fullscreenBerenyi on stage with Lush in Prague, 1994.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesDid you find the music press a bit cringey in the 90s? It was almost like the writers decided they wereas interesting as the artists.ApexPredatorThere’s this notion that the music press back in the day was just about building bands up to knock them down – but I actually think it’s really hard to write about music well, and especially having to constantly make every band sound unique and not bore everyone witless. It was a hard job, abysmally paid and there were very young people involved. The worst of that period was when you had a muscle-flexing journo trying to score points off a band. It was very tabloid and I don’t think bands were treated particularly well. But I’ve been a freelance subeditor now, so I expect thinking “I hope I get some shifts” is the same as a music journalist hoping to get that next trip to Los Angeles. Everybody’s hustling.What was it like havingRobin Guthrie fromCocteau TwinsproduceLush?nicksleftfootWhen Emma was sending out demos, she sent one to Robin and he was interested in us before we signed to 4AD. Then he wanted to produce us. He was brilliant, lovely. We didn’t have a clue what we were doing but he brought out the best in us. He came to our gigs, turned up at our Peel session as the backseat driver and really looked after us. For someone like him to genuinely care about our music was just brilliant.View image in fullscreenThe Miki Berenyi Trio … Kevin McKillop, Miki Berenyi and Oliver Cherer.Photograph: Abbey RaymondeRide or My Bloody Valentine?buskerdooBoth, because we have personal relationships. [Ride’s] Mark Gardener and [MBV’s] Debbie Googe are two of the loveliest people around. We went on this amazing American tour with Ride when we were really young, and the Valentines were part of my pre-Lush life. I must have seen them 20 times. Both bands’ music is tied up with so many memories that I just can’t be objective.Have you ever found yourself gazing at your shoes while performing?VerulamiumParkRangerNo and I don’t think any of us ever gazed at our fucking shoes [laughs]. If we were looking down it was at our effects pedals. The term “shoegazing” was coined as a sort of insult, so it’s very funny that it’s become a genre. Revenge of the nerds!Tripla is out on 4 April on Bella Union. The Miki Berenyi Trio tour starts the same day, at Rough Trade East, London.Explore more on these topicsMusicThe reader interviewBritpopIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mahmoud Muna – who co-edited the book Daybreak inGazawith Teller – and his nephew, Ahmed Muna, were arrested and held in detention before being released under a five-day house arrest.“We are concerned by recent press reports on the police raid of an educational bookshop in a country which is governed by a parliamentary democracy”, read theSoA’s statement, published on 13 February.Teller said he would have hoped the SoA “would have taken this opportunity to illuminate the evils of state censorship and defend those who seek to practise freedom. Instead, it obscured understanding of the issues with platitudes and irrelevant assertions. It was an abject failure.“I wholeheartedly support writers who are able to remain engaged with the SoA, and I recognise the value in urgent ongoing efforts to force change, but I, regretfully, can no longer tolerate such equivocation from a trade union that purports to represent me,” Teller said.A representative from the SoA said the organisation “is saddened when any of our members decide to leave us”, but that “on this occasion, the SoA did not have enough information to comment on the situation concerning the bookshop in Jerusalem. Nevertheless, we considered that recent press reports provided an opportunity to the SoA to remind our members of its position on book bans.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

However, the charge was changed to “disturbing public order”, according to the booksellers’ lawyer.The family-run Educational Bookshop opened in 1984 and has since become a hub of cultural life in Jerusalem, well-known among academics, journalists and tourists. After the raid, dozens of protestersgathered outside court, andat least ninediplomats from the UK and other European countries attended the hearing on 10 February.More than £30,000 has since been raised via aGoFundMe campaignin support of the Educational Bookshop organised by the London-based Saqi Books, which publishes Daybreak in Gaza. Funds will go towards replacing books that were seized, fixing damages and paying booksellers until Mahmoud and Ahmed are allowed to return to work, as one of the terms of their 11 February release was that they must not return to bookselling for a minimum of 20 days.Alongside fellow independent publisher Pluto Press, Saqi Books is also launching #BooksellingIsNotACrime Day on Saturday, with booksellers invited to put on events, donate a percentage of their profits to the fundraiser or create displays of Palestinian literature.The group Fossil Free Books (FFB), which campaigns for “a genocide free, fossil free books industry”described the SoA’s statementas a “non-statement” of the kind that “does not challenge assaults on freedom of speech” but “confirms them”.However, FFB recommended “staying engaged” with the SoA, suggesting that all authors, illustrators and translators join it, “not because it is currently the union we need”, but to “use its democratic structures to transform it into the union we deserve.”Explore more on these topicsBooksFossil Free BooksGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBooksellersSociety of AuthorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Would it? Until it picked up best film at the Bafta awards, no one had really been taking this papal intrigue drama all that seriously – all the smart money was on one of two very American films: Anora and The Brutalist. (Even more so after Emilia Pérez’s spectacular Karla Sofía Gascón-related blow-out.) But couldConclavepull off a Green Book-style surge to the line, getting past more fashionable and/or artsy efforts through the virtues of sturdy, muscular storytelling?For this is surely the basis of Conclave’s appeal to Oscar voters. Although blessed by brilliant, subtle performances (courtesy of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow among others), and handsomely mounted design and camerawork, Conclave’s great strength is its narrative furniture, a build-out of the microcosm that is the papal court. It has a head start, of course, in its source material: Robert Harris has to be the king of the issue-based suspense novel, and the practised ease of the storytelling is the ballast that keeps the film afloat. (Harris’s screen-adaptation ratio is remarkable, from Fatherland and Enigma back in the day, to the Polanski-directed projectsThe GhostandAn Officer and a Spy.)Conclave, though, gets every benefit from its actors. Fiennes, who has been leavening his work with quite a bit of comedy in recent years, goes back to his frowning, thoughtful best; here he is playing a man uncertain of almost everything, bar his own uncertainty. Is there anyone as good as Fiennes at conveying doubt, at chewing the corner of his lip and briefly glancing away? It’s an absolute masterclass. Tucci is also very good in a more thinly conceived role as the voice of liberalism; Rossellini’s role is likewise a little truncated, asking for a basic indignant toughness. Lithgow’s is probably the juiciest of the supporting roles, as manipulative, duplicitous Cardinal Tremblay.German-born director Edward Berger, who piloted All Quiet on the Western Front to significant Oscar success in 2023, has put Conclave together with seemingly effortless ease, prioritising an unflashy, strong-limbed style that serves the narrative modulations, as well as the performances that push them along. (In a slightly unexpected development, Berger didn’t get a best director nomination, perhaps perfectly illustrating the idea that if you draw attention to yourself, you are not doing it right.)What might perhaps go against it, in the final analysis, is its immersion in old-world politicking; the Academy this year seems interested in turning to distinctively American stories. The Brutalist, Anora, Nickel Boys and even The Substance are, in different ways, looking for meaning in the American heartland; perhaps Conclave will turn out to be a tad too classy for its own good.Explore more on these topicsOscarsBest picture Oscar hustingsConclaveRalph FiennesFilm adaptationsRobert HarrisAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We rate his greatest movies, from Straw Dogs to The Wild BunchByChris TryhornThu 20 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 17.07 ESTShare10. Major Dundee (1965)After making his name as a director of westerns, Sam Peckinpah was given his first shot at making a major studio film – an epic about a tyrannical cavalry officer (Charlton Heston) leading an expedition into Mexico. The production set a template for later Peckinpah films – heavy drinking, personality clashes, battles with the suits, and a final cut not matching the director’s vision. Major Dundee was a victim of its chaotic ambition and it’s easy to see why it flopped on release: even in the 2005 restored version, it is hopelessly unfocused, taking in Dundee’s Moby-Dick-like mission to track down an Apache chief, the dynamics of the US civil war, encounters with the French army and an unconvincing romantic interlude. But it’s interestingly flawed, a sort of dry run for The Wild Bunch, and Richard Harris is entertaining as Benjamin Tyreen, the Irishman who leads the Confederate prisoners in Dundee’s ragtag army.9. Straw Dogs (1971)View image in fullscreenAn experiment in nastiness … Susan George and Dustin Hoffman in Straw Dogs.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyPeckinpah swapped the wild west for the West Country for this still potent experiment in nastiness, later banned from home release in the UK until 2002 because of its controversial rape scene.Dustin Hoffmanand Susan George play the middle-class couple who move to her old village only to be tormented by the leering locals and provoked into an orgy of bloodletting. It’s a product of a very specific time, when film-makers were newly free to explore the nature of violence and question the limits of liberalism – other examples being A Clockwork Orange and Dirty Harry. While influential on action cinema and prescient in its unpicking of bourgeois unease, it is ultimately gruelling and unenlightening – and a grim caricature of Cornwall.8. The Getaway (1972)The second of two back-to-back films Peckinpah made withSteve McQueen, this riveting thriller is very much a vehicle for its star, who had approval over the final cut and recruited Quincy Jones to provide a jazzy score to replace the work of regular Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding. McQueen and Ali MacGraw – who began an affair on set and later married – play Doc and Carol McCoy, a dour latter-day Bonnie and Clyde on the run in Texas after a heist unravels. Peckinpah handles the tense action sequences with consummate professionalism but of all the films in his 1969-74 golden stretch, it’s the least personal or thought-provoking.7. Cross of Iron (1977)View image in fullscreenCarnage … James Coburn and Maximilian Schell in Cross of Iron.Photograph: Studiocanal/EMI Films/AllstarPeckinpah’s talent for shooting action scenes made him a natural fit for directing a war film; his only foray into the genre, told unusually from the German perspective, had the misfortune to be released at the same time as Star Wars and has been overlooked ever since. Amid the carnage of the eastern front in 1943, contemptuous platoon leader Steiner (James Coburn) clashes with his arrogant aristocratic superior Stransky (Maximilian Schell). Nazism is little discussed and arguably downplayed (the only enthusiastic party member suffers a hideous punishment); this is essentially a searing portrait of a band ofBrüderoperating under the extreme duress of brutal warfare, and as such, it’s less unorthodox than it first seems. It proved to be his last decent film, he made just two more – the banal trucker comedy Convoy (1978) and the turgid thriller The Osterman Weekend (1983) – and then, in a curious coda, directed two music videos for Julian Lennon before his death at the age of 59.6. Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974)View image in fullscreenUtterly compelling … Warren Oates (right) in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.Photograph: United Archives/FilmPublicityArchive/Getty ImagesNihilistic, anarchic, repugnant: this is Peckinpah unbound, let loose without studio interference on a low budget in Mexico, and it’s not pretty. And yet this agonising ordeal of self-destruction is utterly compelling and at times pitch-black funny. Warren Oates channels Peckinpah himself as Bennie, a washed-up, shades-wearing piano player turned bounty hunter searching for the grisly proof that a man who impregnated a crime lord’s daughter is dead. Bennie won’t give up on his macabre quest despite his life disintegrating around him; like many Peckinpah characters, he is going down in a blaze of something, but it’s not going to be glory.5. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973)There are enough brilliant moments in this bewitching but sometimes bewildering western to convince you there is a masterpiece struggling to emerge from the various edits that have surfaced since MGM took the film off Peckinpah’s hands at the end of a deeply troubled production. Coburn gives a career-best performance as Pat Garrett, the sheriff hired by Big Cattle to bring down his old buddy, unrepentant outlaw Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson). Peckinpah assembled a fantastic ensemble cast of western legends but there are just too many characters, many of whom are gunned down quickly. Bob Dylan is distracting as Billy’s sidekick Alias, but he also provides the spellbinding soundtrack (featuring Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door) that helps create the film’s lyrical mood.4. Junior Bonner (1972)View image in fullscreenUnwilling to move with the times … Steve McQueen in Junior Bonner (1972).Photograph: Abc/Bill Avery/AllstarThis nuanced, understated family drama demonstrates how versatile “Bloody Sam” could be: there’s nothing more violent here than a comic bar-room brawl. A wistful Steve McQueen plays Junior Bonner, an ageing rodeo rider unable, or unwilling, to move with the times – a classic western archetype in a contemporary setting – unlike his vulgar entrepreneur brother Curly (Joe Don Baker). Ida Lupino gives an outstandingly intelligent performance as Junior’s mother, and the film provides a documentary-like snapshot of Prescott, Arizona, in the summer of 1971. It’s a great shame it flopped, and that Peckinpah didn’t make more films like it. As the director himself put it: “I made a film where nobody got shot and nobody went to see it.”3. The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970)Jason Robards, so often a fine supporting actor, takes centre stage in an inventive, eccentric and unpredictable tale of a man left for dead in the Arizona desert, only to strike water and set up a successful way station. Robards makes magnificent sense of Cable Hogue’s contradictions, there’s touching support from Stella Stevens as the obligatory golden-hearted sex worker, and David Warner’s randy preacher is funny, alarming and sometimes profound. Not everything works – the Benny Hill-style fast motion sequences haven’t aged well – but at its best this is a wise and humane film that comes to a strange but quietly astonishing conclusion.2. Ride the High Country (1962)After working in TV and making a solid debut with The Deadly Companions (1961), Peckinpah really hit his stride with his second film, a supremely assured western that tapped into the elegiac strain that became his hallmark in the genre. Veteran icons Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott are the uneasily paired old friends tasked with transporting gold down from a rough mining town, scene of a disturbingly riotous wedding. “All I want is to enter my house justified,” intones McCrea’s Steve Judd, laying down a marker for all those Peckinpah protagonists trying to make it through a broken world with a modicum of integrity. There is vivid cinematography by Lucien Ballard, in his first of five collaborations with Peckinpah.1. The Wild Bunch (1969)After failing with Major Dundee and then getting fired from The Cincinnati Kid, Peckinpah found himself in the wilderness, his reputation partly restored by the deeply moving TV drama Noon Wine. But the zeitgeist of the late 1960s – the war in Vietnam, political assassinations and the collapse of screen censorship – suited Peckinpah’s temperament and appetite for pushing boundaries. When he got his chance to return to a big screen project, he produced his masterpiece, a western that called time on the genre while inaugurating a new era of cinema.The Wild Bunch became notorious for the unprecedentedly bloody gun battles that bookend the film; viewed today, the violence hardly seems excessive or gratuitous, more of a corrective to the hundreds of films that had airbrushed the harsh realities of the west. It is also superbly choreographed, thanks to Lou Lombardo’s pioneering and hugely influential editing techniques: rapid cutting and varied frame rates, including those slow-motion death spasms that became a Peckinpah staple. What is just as striking is how unpleasant so many of the characters are: the eponymous bunch are reprehensible outlaws, indifferent to the collateral damage their exploits cause, trailed by a loutish posse and locked in a fatal embrace with a brutish Mexican general. Yet somehow we root for the ruthless, brooding Pike Bishop (a sensationally good William Holden) and his comrades as their options narrow and they search for some kind of morality and meaning in the dying days of the old west.Explore more on these topicsRankedWesternsSteve McQueenDustin HoffmanAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps you’ve seen the film adaptations, or dipped into Pride and Prejudice, but what about the more obscure Lady Susan? Writer and professor John Mullan has come up with a handy guide to Austen’s writing.The entry pointPride and Prejudice. What else could it be? It bursts on the first-time reader now, as it must have burst on the first readers in the winter of 1813. It’s the best attraction-disguised-as-antagonism love story ever, with the most irreverent of heroines, the “arch” Elizabeth Bennett, and an hilarious supporting cast (Mr Collins! Lady Catherine de Bourgh!). We love the fencing between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, but all the dialogue is scintillating. Just read that first chapter: a couple of pages of conversation between Mr and Mrs Bennet (we never find out their first names) give you the very anatomy of a marriage.The one to make you cryPersuasion is the one for romantics, and for readers who have lived long enough to know their own mistaken choices. Anne Elliot is subtle and perceptive, soulful and affectionate. Aged 19, she was in love with a dashing but impecunious naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she was persuaded to turn down his offer of marriage. Now she is 27 and she is melancholy and regretful. Then Wentworth comes back into her life, offering a second chance of happiness.The one to drop into dinner party conversationWhen she died, aged only 41, Jane Austen was working on a new book. She left us with eleven-and-a-bit chapters of a novel to be called Sanditon (not to be confused in any way with the three-series ITV drama of the same name). The title is taken from the new-build seaside resort where the typically astute and humorous heroine, Charlotte Heywood, goes to stay. It is peopled by property speculators, hypochondriacs, and an aristocratic would-be seducer. You can patiently explain to your friends that it would have been a cracker, if only its author had lived.The one that might surprise youThis is a novel about two teenage sisters, sensible Elinor (19) and impulsive Marianne (17). Austen recruits your sympathy with Marianne – she scorns pretension and falsehood, she plays moody piano, she dances into the small hours – only to let you see where you erred. On reflection, Marianne says and does many foolish things. She talks to trees; she thinks that a woman in her late 20s “can never hope to feel or inspire affection again”; she throws herself at a mercenary rake; she never understands irony. Elinor, on the other hand, seems in control, but actually seethes with passion and sadness, and has a sense of humour. It is really her story.View image in fullscreenEmma Thompson and Kate Winslet as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood in Ang Lee’s 1995 film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility.Photograph: Columbia/AllstarThe one for aficionadosWhen Austen’s letters began to be published in the late 19th century, many readers were disappointed. Mostly written to her sister Cassandra (who burned what we imagine were the novelist’s more interesting missives), they report the weather, the latest family illnesses, and gossip about Hampshire neighbours. However, once you really know your Austen, aided byDeirdre Le Faye’s brilliant biographical index to the best edition of these letters, you can find all sorts of amusement and slyness. And the odd killer aphorism: “Pictures of perfection make me sick & wicked.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In some ways Austen’s deepest novel, Mansfield Park is an exploration of a put-upon, neglected, highly intelligent young woman with a Brontë-level secret passion (for her unperceptive cousin, Edmund). Fanny must stay true to herself, while observing the idiocies of the entitled Bertrams, who have adopted her, and circumventing the schemes of the charming but diabolical Mary Crawford. A true heroine.The secret to Pride and Prejudice’s enduring appeal? Lizzy Bennet has gameRead moreThe one to make you laugh out loudWhen Austen was 19 or 20, she wrote this novella in letters, whose main correspondent is the beautiful, amoral Lady Susan Vernon, a knowingly sexy widow in her mid-30s, she likes to conquer men, though she is too clever actually to sleep with them. When she is not casting her spell on one beau or another, she is scheming to marry off her irritatingly virtuous daughter. Lady Susan’s wittily cynical letters to her confidante Mrs Johnson (Alicia) are a devilish hoot.The one that will make you feel like a teenager againYou don’t really need to have read any foolish gothic fiction to get Northanger Abbey, though Austen’s satire of absurd novels and their readers is delicious. You just need to have been young, which is the main point of this story of a naive yet perceptive 17-year-old country vicar’s daughter, Catherine Morland. Invited to Bath by a family friend, she loves society’s whirl – and discovers love. The sheer delicious giddiness of young life (including falling for the falsest of false friends, Isabella Thorpe) has never been better done.The masterpieceEmma,Austen’s longest and most elaborately plotted novel is as revolutionary as Madame Bovary or Ulysses. It is narrated almost entirely from the point of view of its heroine, Emma Woodhouse, who is wrong about almost everything. The reader has to share her mistakes and delusions, with no direction from the author to put them right. “Handsome, clever and rich,” Emma, a self-appointed match-maker, meddles disastrously in others’ lives, convinced that she knows what they are thinking. This is high-wire comedy, on the brink of disaster, with Mrs Elton (O, gloriously vulgar, utterly self-admiring Mrs Elton!) as Emma’s distortedsemblable, and only Mr Knightley to bring out her true qualities. It is that cleverest of love stories, where the heroine does not recognise that she is in love until it is (almost) too late. “I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like,” declared the novelist, in mischief. She knew this was not true.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhere to start withJane AustenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s clearly a very personal song, about its author’s late grandfather – even revealing the address of his council house, 11 Wark Avenue. The northern British references – “Chasing a cross in from the wing / Our boy’s a whippet, he’s faster than anything” – are amplified both by Fender’s Geordie vowels and the backing, provided by the Easington Colliery brass band. It’s all very specific and individual – you really don’t hear brass bands, or indeed the mention of whippets in pop very often – and yet Remember My Name seems to have something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about it. You can immediately imagine its soaring melody being sung en masse by a huge festival audience, which is, one suspects, precisely the destiny that awaits it.View image in fullscreenSam Fender: People Watching album art.It’s a reminder of the singularity of Fender’s rise. Both his 2019 debut Hypersonic Missiles and 2021’s Seventeen Going Under went platinum; the latter’s title track sold nearly 2m copies in the UK. He’s just announced a run of vast summer gigs, taking in the London Stadium and three consecutive nights at Newcastle’s St James’ Park: four shows that will see him play to the best part of quarter of a million people. This has happened despite the fact that his music is expressly political, and not in the usual platitudinous box-ticking way. It relentlessly picks away at the bleakest realities of northern working-class life, seldom a fashionable cause: you’d probably have to look back to Design for Life-era Manic Street Preachers – or even further, to the heyday of the Jam – to find rock musicians who made a similar agenda so commercially successful. He is probably the only pop star to have attracted both the praise of august socialist magazine the Tribune forhis critiques of “the callousness of British neoliberalism”and the TikTok hashtag #toptierindiebois.It’s an improbable success, and one which the contents of People Watching seem only likely to bolster. That colliery brass band notwithstanding, there’s a hint of folksiness about Wild Long Lie and Reign Me In, which feels like a fresh musical development, but not an entirely surprising one: in 2021, Fender helmed a BBC documentary about his love of 70s folk-rockers Lindisfarne. But for the most part, the album gently expands on Fender’s trademark sound, with the aid of co-producer Adam Granduciel. His band the War on Drugs share Fender’s audible love of Bruce Springsteen and tight, metronomic Krautrock-influenced rhythms, but their sound also boasts a faint haze of psychedelia and a greater sense of space, both of which are brought to bear on People Watching: in the electronic drone that underpins Arm’s Length, the slide guitar, feedback and synthesiser that arc around Wild Long Lie’s extended coda, the ominous, echo-laden atmosphere conjured on TV Dinner.Sam Fender: People Watching – videoIt’s all very subtly done, keeping the focus on Fender’s voice and songwriting; far from War on Drugs cosplay. It’s a smart move, because more than anything, People Watching reaffirms that Fender is a very good songwriter indeed: strong on melodies (the descending chord sequence of Nostalgia’s Lie is particularly nagging; the see-sawing tune of TV Dinner hypnotic), handy with a roaring, emotive, arena-friendly chorus, and exceptionally gifted with words. The title track shifts from prosaically conversational descriptions of a woman dying in a chaotic care home to something more poetic to gut-punching effect: “Above the rain-soaked garden of remembrance / Kittiwakes etched your initials in the sky / I fear for this crippled island.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

On Chin Up Fender berates himself for struggling with celebrity, “entitled, idle and dumb”, while his friends are struggling to find jobs or heat their homes. Conversely, TV Dinner gives a compelling list of reasons he struggles in a music business from which working-class voices are increasingly excluded and in which he never meets anyone with the same lived experience as him.Fender’s success means that the songs on People Watching are more complex than the bleak home town vignettes of Seventeen Going Under. But they’re no less powerful. Whether his gaze rests on his past, his present, or the gulf that lurks between them, there’s an urgency about what he has to say, its bleakness and realism at odds with the stadium-scale euphoria of the choruses. Whatever else Sam Fender’s unlikely fame may have changed, it hasn’t dimmed the unique potency of his music.This week Alexis listened toAndrew Rumsey – CollodionRecorded in a Wiltshire church – and featuring what sounds like said church’s organ – the title track of singer-songwriter Rumsey’s latest album is fittingly hushed, haunted and shiver-inducing.Explore more on these topicsSam FenderAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockThe War on Drugsalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Luckily, we’ve assembled some of the world’s best selectors to evangelise about the pairs they’re faithful to: from reliable specialist brands to old-school one-ear models, these are the best DJ headphones for crystal-clear sound and to hear that all-important bass.DJs on their favourite headphonesSennheiser HD 25View image in fullscreen£129 at Sennheiser£117 at AmazonI love bass, bass, bass and bass – andSennheisershear my call. I first bought these headphones in 1993 and I now use the HD 25-C-II model. They’re perfect for someone with a little head and ears who requires a fat bottom-end and crystal-clear monitoring. The sound has to have the capacity to push through the noise in a festival space and yet be accurate in a quieter, more intimate setting, and the Sennheiser’s small closed-ear cup gives the best sound isolation.They have to work hard and need to be ridiculously durable, as they’re taken on and off my head repeatedly through each set – the 3m spiral cable (or as I fondly call it, the curly pigtail extension cable) has been an essential lifeline, giving me a huge range of movement. And did I say they take a hammering? They may look cheap and plasticky, but the build is hard to beat and every part is replaceable. They are hard-wearing and hard-working.DJ PauletteReloop RHP-10 MonoView image in fullscreen£57 at Thomann£59 at AmazonI stayed away from lollipops for a long time because these one-ear headphones were always seen as kind of a New York thing – everyone was following Larry Levan. You’re going to buy a Fender Stratocaster because you love Jimi Hendrix; if you love basketball then you’re going to wear whatever LeBron James is wearing. Larry was the superstar DJ at the time, and everybody followed suit. But I’m from Detroit.One of the main reasons I started using a lollipop, though, has to do with protecting my hearing. Most of us DJs play far too loud, not only in the booth but also to hear what we’re cueing. When I would have headphones strapped around my head all the time, they were hurting my ears. With a lollipop, I don’t need to have it on all the time; often I just hold it with my hand.I use Reloops because they’re cheap and utilitarian. It doesn’t have to look sexy, I’m not taking it out to dinner. Let’s look at it like a hammer: it doesn’t need to be titanium, it just needs to do the job. I have some headphones that are $2,000 and I can stand up on stage and everybody’ll think, “Oh my God, he’s so great with those headphones on.” But no, Reloops do the job. I don’t really care about anything else.Carl CraigTechnics EAH-DJ1200View image in fullscreen£139 at Discdjstore£169 at AmazonHeadphones are possibly the most important thing for a DJ to get right. I’ve been using these Technics ones for more than 20 years – the same make as the legendary turntables. The bass sounds really good through them, and I rarely take them off; I just move the headphones past my ears and over my head to hear the monitors. They’re not too bulky, either, and they’re good value for money. The only downside is that in summer the leather headband can get sweaty when the temperature in the club gets hotter. But it hasn’t stopped me from wearing them for most of my career.SeverinoPioneer HDJ-X7View image in fullscreen£179 at Selfridges£161 at AmazonThere are new models of these headphones available but I got these in 2017. I like comfort and want something that’s going to hug my ear. These can flip around and fold up – there are so many nice elements – but they’re really comfortable, which is the main thing. Sometimes, you get headphones that are too tight or too loose. With these, I can have one can on my ear and one on the side of my head, and it’ll sit there nicely.I think you have to splash out on DJ headphones. You can’t go too cheap because you won’t hear what you need to. You need quality of sound. For me, it’s the bass. I need to be able to hear that kick drum because that’s what you mix with. And then everything else needs to be clear, otherwise it’s distorted, especially in a club – because you have to have it quite loud. Most of us now wear ear defenders, so then you have to have the music in the headphones even louder.These have got a bit of gravitas. They’ve got a weight behind them, and they’re sturdy but comfortable. You can knock these around quite a lot but, if you look after them, they will last you a long time.Smokin Joskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The good thing about them is that they’re modular: you can buy a new lead or earpieces separately, which is essential when you’re using them all the time. My headphones generally only used to last about a year (because normally the lead connection would get loose, as you move around a lot behind the decks and the headphone wire gets pulled a fair amount), but the Aiaiais have lasted a lot longer. Apart from the obvious – sound quality (and these are also great to listen to music with at home/travelling/in the studio) – the key feature I look for is whether the headphones will stay on my teeny head. Most brands just fall off!Sophie LloydAudio-Technica ATH-M50xView image in fullscreen£115 at Advanced MP3 Players£127 at AmazonDurability is important to me as my headphones get thrown in record bags etc, so they need to be sturdy – and the M50xs came highly recommended. I love them because they don’t break. They also have a rich, full sound: headphones should make you feel like you’re immersed in the music and able to notice the slightest detail in the mix.These headphones also double up as ear defenders: I remember plonking myself in the middle of the New Regency Orchestra, an 18-piece band that I direct, as we were recording the horn section live. I had the mix of the rhythm section in my ears and was listening to the horns blowing on top through the cans – they certainly protected my ears from being in the direct line of fire of the 12 horns blowing in my face! Plus, they go over the ears and keep them warm, which is handy when I’m DJing in a church for my event Church of Sound – it can get chilly in the winter!Lex BlondinPioneer HDJ-CUE1View image in fullscreen£60 at Argos£54.99 at AmazonI bought these headphones in 2021, and they’ve survived countless festival fields and dark clubs since. A friend recommended them as a great entry-level pair to start getting a bit more serious with. Despite buying other headphones, I do keep finding myself coming back to them more often than not: they do a great job and are Pioneers’ most affordable model. I need them to be comfortable. Great sound, obviously. But also something that can pack down nicely to fit in a bumbag. They’re really flexible, clear on the low end and the finish is clean.Rohan RakhitSony MDR-7506View image in fullscreen£95 at Gear4music£82.56 at AmazonI bought these while I was on tour about a decade ago because I had lost my other headphones. They were less expensive and I had seen people using them. I still have the same ones all these years later because they’re good quality and unpretentious.You can replace the ear cushions, which wear out with heavy use. They also have a cable that looks like an old-school telephone cable, so there’s some flexibility. Also, I think they look cool: simple, functional, not too “aesthetic” like some boutique ‘phones. They’re also quite slick, not some giant silver plastic thing that has EDM written all over it.I can use them also for vocal recordings because they have closed cups, which is the standard headphone style that you will find in most studios. If aliens would arrive on this planet and would ask me what a headphone is, I would probably show them this one.Matias AguayoDJ Paulette’s book, Welcome to the Club, ison sale now.

If you are a parent reading this, the chances are you are in desperate need of a snack/strong coffee/stiff drink. I start these school breaks with great intentions – lots of wholesomeness, baking, arts and crafts, and so forth. But the snack cupboard is now bare, the kids have had a side of cucumber sticks with every meal as a token bit of “green” and there are only so many episodes of Bluey I can take (actually, that’s a lie, but you know, we can’t have it playingallday). To go out with a bang, I’ve got a few last-minute treats up my sleeve.First are theseham and mozzarella rice cakesfrom Yotam Ottolenghi, which look fun to makeandeat. All three of the recipes in this article look great and would go down a treat with my small people. The same goes for this cracking collection of sixkid-friendly recipes, including a stew with dumplings from yours truly. Uyen Luu’s recipe for egg-fried noodles with broccoli and runner beans is a big hit in our house, a real weeknight staple – I just replace the veg with whatever I have to hand.View image in fullscreenAlice Zaslavsky’s traybake pizza.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianI cannot wait to try David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl’s halloumi veggie burgers: they sound right up our street. I’ve gotAlice Zaslavsky’s traybake pizzalined up for Saturday night; the kids will love getting messy making that. We’ll tuck into it with a movie or Gladiators – our regular Saturday night treat – and if I don’t have too much guilt about the amount of sugar consumed, I’ll get them to make these funWilly Wonka chocolate popsfor afters. I’m also keen to give thiscupcake caterpillarby David Atherton a try. I love the idea of using banana, spinach and courgette in the cake batter; it’s fun and wholesome, and my kids will be thrilled with the vibrant green colour.And finally, as Stuart Heritage explains in this lockdown article that features15 tips for cooking with kids, the most important thing is to make food they’ll actually want to eat. It’s all well and good being aspirational and getting them to try something new, but for the best results try offering new dishes alongside the familiar.A new vegetable they haven’t had before? Serve it alongside their favourite pasta. I’m planning on getting the girls to make Yotam’srainbow-layered dip(pictured top) tonight alongside some more familiar cheesy quesadillas. It can take a few attempts before something becomes a win. But if they can help you in the preparation, then there is even more chance they will give it a try. You’ve got them to experience something new and incorporated an educational activity into your day. If that isn’t a half-term win, I don’t know what is.My week in foodView image in fullscreenCondiment shoppers are often spoiled for choice in big cities.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverUnexpected item in the bagging area|If you live in a big city, you probably have your pick of artisanal food shops, piled high with chilli oils and sauces.

But recently I’ve been experiencing a bit of numbness and stiffness in my glutes that none of my usual stretches could address. Could the numbness indicate a possible issue with my nerves?It’s possible it could indicate a tight sciatic nerve, said Morgan Sileo, an orthopedic clinical specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery, the treatment for which could include sciatic nerve flossing.Nerve flossing – also called nerve gliding, nerve sliding or nerve mobilization – gained traction among doctors and physical therapists in the 1980s and 1990s. It is a common technique taught to physical therapy patients recovering from injury or nerve compression conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome. It can be a helpful tool to improve mobility and reduce painful movements, but experts caution that you shouldn’t jump in to it by yourself before knowing a few critical things.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’What is nerve flossing?Muscles can contract and stretch with movement, but nerves can only stretch a little – they’ll usually slacken or become taut to accommodate different bodily positions, says Andrew Dilley, a professor in neuroanatomy at the Brighton Sussex Medical School at the University of Sussex. Dilley and his team of collaborators didsome of the earliest workon visualizing how nerves move in living bodies.Each nerve attaches somewhere along the spine and extends out into a part of the body. Ideally, a nerve should be able to slide smoothly as it adjusts to our movements. But sometimes, through injury, inflammation or trauma, a nerve can get stuck or tighten. This can lead to pain like sciatica, more inflammation, and nerve compression conditions like carpal or cubital tunnel syndrome.The goal of nerve flossing is to coax a nerve to slide more easily by gently and repeatedly pulling the nerve towards one of its ends and then to the other, typically by positioning the body in a particular way to isolate the problematic nerve, then moving usually two body parts slowly and smoothly to get the gliding motion. The nerves typically targeted are the median, ulnar and radial nerves in the arms; and the sciatic nerves in the legs.‘Mother Nature thinks people should shut down’: why we’re so unmotivated in winterRead moreWhen deciding whether nerve flossing is something that might help, a therapist or clinician will first assess whether a nerve is the source of a patient’s pain, says Sileo. Typical symptoms include radiating pain, numbness, or a pins and needles feeling. The location of pain or irritation will indicate which nerve pathway is affected, she says, and the clinician will then prescribe specific exercises targeting that nerve.How does nerve flossing help?Nerve flossing is a relatively new type of therapy, and we don’t yet have a definitive explanation for why it can help, says Dilley. One hypothesis is that if a nerve gets physically stuck and causes hindered mobility, nerve flossing can unstick it and reverse those symptoms. However, Dilley and his team have found no evidence of this in the patients they looked at through ultrasound studies. A second theory is that nerve pain can come from disruptions in blood flow and circulation around neurons – so nerve flossing helps byimproving that circulation. There’s some research supporting this theory, but it has not been proved, says Dilley. The last idea is that moving nerves might help to decrease inflammation, but this is simply a theory right now, and current evidence is scant.Studies on nerve flossing tend to be small and limited. Butresearchdoes suggest that it iseffective at tackling nerve painin places like theneck,armsandlegs, and can help treat conditions likecarpal tunnel syndrome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stephanie Kannas, an occupational therapist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, says that “if people are experiencing numbness or tingling, that’s also a good sign to talk to their health professionals and get guidance to know if nerve gliding would be beneficial”.All experts consulted for this piece emphasized that if you have nerve pain, you should consult a doctor before trying out any nerve flossing exercises by yourself. “If you’re too aggressive, you can actually make the nerve worse,” says Kannas, exacerbating your existing symptoms. A clinician or physical therapist will be able to give you the right exercises for the right nerve, ensure you’re using the proper technique and identify if you’re overdoing it.How do I stay healthy in my 60s?Read moreIt’s important to use proper flossing motions, with your nerve being pulled toward one end and then to the other. Pulling and stretching your nerve from both ends is called “tensioning”, and might cause harm, says Dilley. “Stretching nerves, particularly injured nerves, can cause even more pain and inflammation,” he says.If you’re experiencing a lot of tension or pain with your nerves, see a professional before attempting nerve flossing. “Nerves are very sensitive,” says Sileo, and “they take a long time to heal too.” If you’re healthy, with no nerve pain, Sileo says gentle nerve flossing exercises are fine to do to maintain mobility. But she emphasizes that these exercises are not like other stretches. “It’s not like where you try to touch your toes and hold it for a long period of time,” she says. That is, you’re not supposed to push yourself. Our nerves glide as we move and exercise in daily life, says Dilley. “It’s important for people to keep moving.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On a clear day, its jagged, alluring and yet foreboding topography – stretching outward into the Irish Sea – is easily visible from as far south as Aberystwyth. No wonder it was chosen as the location for the recentHouse of the DragonGame of Thrones spin-off series. It’s also been my constant backdrop for the past few days as I walk theWales Coast Pathexploring the relationship of the people of this land to the sea – how it has shaped society, how humanity has tried to tame it and how the sea will inevitably prevail.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Now, having reached Porthmadog (a town built on reclaimed sand from the Glaslyn estuary), I’m ready to experience the entrancing, wild-looking beauty of the Llŷn up close. I have three walks planned over the coming days. The first is a gentle six-mile stroll from Borth-y-Gest (one bay over from Porthmadog) to Criccieth Castle. As I set out, the tide is retreating at a rate that makes me think someone has pulled the plug on the entire estuary. The small boats bobbing in the bay become statues as they are stranded in the sand.A large jellyfish lies on a beach directly below Porthmadog golf course. Two kids poke it tentatively with a piece of driftwood. Buried in the sand are huge slabs of micro-layered black and grey slate. They look like stranded giants – could these rocks have inspired the Mabinogi story of Brân the Blessed whose gargantuan severed head was carried back to the Llŷn by his loyal knights after a fateful battle with the Irish king Matholwch?From the top of Graig Ddu (Black Rock), I can seeCriccieth Castle, standing broken but proud on the cliffs in the centre of the town. Unlike many of Gwynedd’s Norman castles, this was built in the 13th century by the Welsh king Llywelyn the Great, as a demonstration of his power and authority over rival Welsh princes.The artistJMW Turnerpainted the castle on a tour through Wales in 1835. His watercolour captures a great storm rolling in and breaking over the castle. In the foreground, local people gather to retrieve items being washed up by the sea. It is a theme that has repeated through the centuries. On the night of 27 October 1927, a violent storm – combined with a potent spring tide – hammered into the Llŷn peninsula. The storm surge and waves destroyed homes built below Criccieth castle with such ferocity that it was decided never to rebuild there.View image in fullscreenPwllheli’s West End Parade is the start point of Matthew’s second walk.Photograph: kodachrome25/Getty ImagesThe second of my walks begins in Pwllheli, meandering along the town’s West End Parade and providing impressive views of theRhinogydd mountain range, part ofEryri national park(Snowdonia). The beach below me is empty and the sand dazzling white, though the footprints on it suggest a small army of early morning dog walkers have already been and gone. Marram grass swishes and ruffles as the wind flows through it.This area of Pwllheli was the vision of Solomon Andrews, a Cardiff-based developer and entrepreneur who had been inspired by the Victorian beach resort of Llandudno. Starting in 1893 Andrews built beachfront properties and the West End Hotel onmorfa(salt marsh) situated between the mouth of the Afon Rhyd-hir and the sea. He also constructed a tramway connecting Pwllheli with his mansion, Plas Glyn y Weddw, a few miles up the coast.With so many speedboats and jetskis carving up the sea, Abersoch looks more like a scene from the French Riviera than the coast of north WalesToday, the tramway is part of the Wales Coast Path and I follow it until I reach Traeth Llanbedrog, a pretty mini crescent bay flanked, at the top of its sandy beach, by a row of multicoloured huts. I climb up throughPlas Glyn y Weddw’s ornamental gardens to the top ofMynydd Tir y Cwmwd. The resort of Abersoch – one of the most desirable (and expensive) beach towns on the Llŷn lies directly ahead. In all the days of walking the Welsh coast, I’ve never seen so many speedboats and jetskis carving up the sea. It looks more like a scene from the French Riviera than the coast of north Wales.In the far distance lies Ynys Enlli (Bardseyisland), spiritual home to Cadfan, a sixth-century Welsh saint whose monastery was recognised as one of the holiest sites in all of Europe. Over the centuries Bardsey’s mystique increased thanks to oral storytellers who claimed that the magician Myrddin (Merlin) was buried on the island and perhaps, even, that King Arthur had forged his sword, Excalibur there.View image in fullscreenThe coast path near Porthdinllaen.Photograph: Chris Howes/Wild Places Photography/AlamyMy final walk is on the north side of the Llŷn and promises to be the most challenging – a 13-mile uphill hike from the old herring fishing village ofPorthdinllaento the town ofTrefor, a few miles south of Caernarfon. Across the bay, I can see the red facade of theTŷ Cochpub, an Insta-celebrated watering hole nestled among fishers’ cottages.This section of coast path has been badly eroded – so much so that walkers are diverted inland. When I stop for a coffee at a beachfront cafe in the village of Nefyn, a young woman asks if I will sign a petition to rebuild the path.“It’s so important for the tourist trade. It will be a disaster if it isn’t repaired,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve arrived at Nant Gwrtheyrn, once one of the most important quarries in all of Europe and source of the granite that paved city streets throughout the Victorian world.The dad of two of the Super Furry Animals led a  campaign to transform a derelict hamlet into what is now the Nant Gwrtheyrn National Welsh Language and Heritage CentreMore than 200 people lived in this isolated coastal village at one time but the granite industry fell into decline after the first world war and Nant Gwrtheyrn was deserted by the early 1950s. It would have been left to ruin were it not for the vision of Carl Clowes, an English doctor who relocated in 1970 to a small village a few miles inland. Clowes’s mother was Welsh and he was keen to raise his children as Welsh speakers. The first Welsh Language Act had come into effect in 1967 and Clowes identified a growing need for adults to learn Welsh. He led a community campaign to transform the derelict hamlet into what is now the Nant Gwrtheyrn National Welsh Language and Heritage Centre. When it fully opened in 2003, the Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals played a concert to celebrate. Two of their members, Cian Ciaran and Dafydd Ieuan, had a special reason for performing. Carl Clowes was their dad.The last stage of the walk involves climbing up a stupidly steep road and I’m feeling all of my 57 years as I trudge up the valley. Only later do I learn that it wasn’t until the 1930s that a car succeeded in driving up the hill, so steep was the gradient and so sharp the switchbacks.A glimpse of ancient Wales: the wilder alternative to SnowdonRead moreThe path levels out as it traverses the peaks of Garn Fôr and Garn Ganol. This is where House of the Dragonhas been filming – a nearby disused quarry doubling for Westeros’ Dragonstone Castle. Finally, I make it to Y Tafarn, Trefor’s lone pub. A flock of bedraggled sheep mooch around in the front garden like bored teenagers. I chat with the landlord about all the filming taking place around Trefor as he pours me a pint. I ask him if any of the actors have come in for a drink.“Oh yeah, we had Rhys Ifans last week,” says the landlord, before adding: “Personally, I’m not that fussed with all these celebrities. As Rhys said: ‘You’re the only pub that doesn’t want my photo on the wall.’”Seascape by Matthew Yeomans (University of Wales Press, £18.99) will be published by on13 March.

But after Vladimir Putin sent his troops across the border, the country quickly entered a state of martial law. That meant that both presidential and parliamentary elections were postponed. Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on Zelenskyy, calling the Ukrainian president “a dictator” in light of postponed elections.Why hasn’t Ukraine held elections since the war began?Under Ukraine’s constitution, it is not legal to hold national elections during a period of martial law. ThisForeign Policy articlefrom 2023 outlines practical impediments that largely still hold today.The disruption from air raids has made organisation and vote counting impossible, as well as bringing obvious risks if large numbers have to congregate at polling stations. Voters in the eastern areas worst affected by the war – or occupied – would be disenfranchised against those living in the west. After mass internal displacement and many people leaving the country altogether, there is no system in place for absentee voting and no recent update to the national voter registry. And any resources spent on resolving these issues are taken away from the country’s defence.Even if a ceasefire is agreed, “there is a broad political consensus that there should not be elections earlier than six months after the lifting of martial law”, Orysia Lutsevych said. “And I suspect that martial law will not be lifted quickly if a ceasefire is signed, because of fears that the Russians could break it at any time.”Is Zelenskyy unpopular?Donald Trump’s claim that Zelenskyy has a 4% approval rating appears to have been conjured from thin air: the only suggestion of any source for that figure comes from Russian media outlets citinga “poll” conducted by Zelenskyy critic Oleksandr Dubinskyamong his (deeply unrepresentative) Telegram followers.Wherever he plucked it from, the number doesn’t align at all with the credible available evidence. Zelenskyy himself suggested yesterday that the 4% figure was “disinformation, we understand it’s coming from Russia”.It is true that Zelenskyy’s ratings are a bit lower than they were at the very peak of his popularity, in the early months of the war, when some polls put him at 90% (against a low of 25% prewar).But that would be entirely unsurprising to anyone who has tracked the popularity of leaders in periods of crisis in the past, and is consistent with, for example, George W Bush after 9/11, who went on to win a second term. The most recent available poll shows Zelenskyy at 57% – still an extremely high approval rating when set against his peers across Europe, andcertainly higher than Trump’s.“Very few leaders have as much support as Zelenskyy,” Lutsevych said. “There is no sign of that support collapsing. It seemed pretty clear at his press conference yesterday that he was confident about this, and confident that he has the support of the public and the parliament.”None of this is to say that Zelenskyy is a nailed-on winner as and when an election is called – but we might also note that if he was truly only interested in his own political survival, he might have tried to go ahead with the scheduled election at the height of his popularity. “Even now, he will believe that he can run on the basis of being Ukraine’s defender and have an excellent chance,” Lutsevych said.Why do Russia and the US want elections as a matter of urgency?There is little reason to think that Moscow has any interest in Ukraine other than instability and the dilution of national unity behind the war effort. “They will only agree to a ceasefire if they are able to continue war by other means,” Lutsevych said. “They want a divided society, and they are skilled at this kind of interference. They would prefer not to have Zelenskyy there because he is trusted in Europe, and anyone who replaces him would be starting from scratch.”In the past – before Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas in 2014 – there was a sizeablepro-Russian constituency in Ukrainian politics. But that has largely gone away now, and indeed several pro-Russian parties have been banned. Even those who would remain in that constituency largely live in areas that would likely be under Russian control in any ceasefire, and therefore unable to vote. There is little prospect of a government sympathetic to Moscow taking charge in the foreseeable future.At the same time, Lutsevych said, candidates might emerge who are preferable to Russian interests. “You can imagine a ‘pro-peace, pro-normalisation’ candidate,” Lutsevych said. “They would likely be someone very well separated from the old pro-Russian parties, and they could hijack the discourse. It’s not obvious who that is at the moment, but it’s possible.” Of course, when Ukraine gets back to something like a non-emergency state, they will have every right to take their chances alongside other candidates.Trump was careful to say that his position was “not a Russian thing” and that other countries agreed. It is hard to identify any country saying it other than Russia, though, and certainly not calling Zelenskyy a dictator. “Trump appears to trust Putin,” Lutsevych said. “He is not really interested in internal Ukrainian politics: he wants to establish geopolitical cooperation with Moscow so that he can move on to other strategic objectives, and he’s ready to remove any obstacle to do that.”What do Ukrainians think?The question of whether Ukrainians are demanding fresh elections is separate to the question of Zelenskyy’s popularity – but on this, too, there is little evidence of any mood of public outrage.Pollsthroughoutthe war have found comfortable majorities supporting the idea that elections should not be held until martial law comes to an end.Trump’s intervention is unlikely to change that fact. “If anything it will probably create the opposite result,” Lutsevych said. “And people are comfortable that they are still living in a democracy.“The proof of that is that even under war conditions there are political debates, and people who criticise Zelenskyy publicly. There is independent media, local self-governance, and the right to freedom of assembly. People rally on issues from funding for the armed forces to calling for more information about prisoners of war.” All of that obviously stands in stark contrast to the repressive system in place in Russia.What would a new election look like?When the time comes, Zelenskyy may face credible opposition from someone like Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the four-star general who is now ambassador to the UK. He enjoys high approval ratings of his own, and was sacked aftera widely publicised rift with his boss, complaining about “the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces”.There will be huge challenges to the emergence of something like normal democracy in Ukraine, though. “There are big questions about how the pro-democratic opposition to Zelenskyy organises itself – they don’t have the infrastructure of party activists and resources,” Lutsevych said.“Whatever happens, it is likely that veterans of the war will be prominent in politics and shape the agenda. There are lots of problems with how you rebuild Ukraine and guarantee its future security.” Biting though all of those issues are, they do not suggest that Zelenskyy is anything like a dictator.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpexplainersShareReuse this content"

He leaned on the power of social media. In the past two years his videos have been viewed by hundreds of millions of people.Riding bikes to school shouldn’t be a big deal, but it nearly became extinct in the US after decades of helicopter parenting, automobile-oriented cities and the epidemic of dangerous and toxic car traffic that accompanies them.Like a scientist restoring a threatened species, Balto turned his passion for the benefits of physical activity in young people into a trend that has gone from his current home town in the Pacific north-west to the White House in Washington DC (where he was invited by former president Joe Biden to attend a holiday reception), and beyond. Today, Balto estimates there are more than 200 bike buses across the US.They have been around for a while. In Portland, a“bike train” movement kicked off in 2010when a 24-year-old bike advocate named Kiel Johnson began organising what he referred to as “bike trains” at an elementary school, where riders would join a mass of cyclists at various stops along a route to school. It caught on and in just a few months Johnson had signed up six other schools, won a grant, and had been interviewed by a national television show.View image in fullscreenThe bike bus en route to Alameda elementary schoolPhotograph: Bike PortlandHe also used Facebook to spread information and communicate with other bike train leaders but video – other than one uploaded to YouTube in 2010 that barely reached 1,000 total views – wasn’t part of the picture. “When you joined one of the big bike trains it really felt like you were part of something – we just didn’t have a way to share that,” Johnson recalls now. “Social media didn’t have that ability back then.”It would be another few years before sharing videos on Vine, TikTok and X (then Twitter) would become mainstream. That Johnson found success without the boost of social media, however, showed the viral potential of the bike bus. It also proved to be a challenge, because without viral videos to reach and inspire millions in minutes, Johnson had to do a lot of that work himself. That lack of scalability was one reason he wasn’t able to keep pushing bike trains forward. In 2012, two years after they started, the bike train movement had reached the end of the line.But great ideas have a way of staying alive. Nearly a decade later, while on a trip to Spain, a Californian called Zach Klein came across a large group of schoolchildren riding through the streets of Barcelona and took a video. “Something special is happening in Barcelona,” he posted on X on 18 October 2021. “They call it Bicibús – or Bike Bus.” Klein’s post went viral and waspicked up four days later by National Public Radio, and then spread online like wildfire. One who saw it was Balto.The following spring, Balto, then a physical education teacher at an elementary school, recalled that bicibús video from Spain and decided to try one of his own. He hatched a plan for a “Bike Bus for Earth Day” – a group ride that would meet about a mile away from school and pick up children and parents on bikes along the way.“I think this is the start of something really special here,” Baltosaid from the start of the ride that morning. Turns out that was a massive understatement. The children loved it, and why wouldn’t they? The benefits, after all, of cycling regularly are vast. It’s good for children’s health – mental and physical – and also has aripple effect of advantagesfor the whole family,as any Dutch person will argue. Many of Balto’s students say the best thing about the bike bus is that it’s simply a cool thing to do with friends.But the excitement went way beyond the school. Not only did the students excitedly demand to ride again the following week, but videos went viral beyond anything Balto could have imagined. When he posted his first clip of the Earth Day bike bus on 22 April 2022, it was watched more than 200,000 times. And that was just the beginning.In September 2022, one of his bike bus videos got more than 1m views on TikTok. A week later, a parent posted a video of the bike bus that got more than 2m views overnight. Balto recalls looking at his phone that next morning and yelling: “Holy shit! Holy shit!” to himself. That same day he received emails from NBC, CBS, Access Hollywood and other media outlets.Over the next three years, Balto went from quirky Portland bike activist to a bona fide internet celebrity. Last month, Justin Timberlake joined his bike bus after giving in to prodding by Balto and his legions of followers on TikTok and Instagram. Timberlake was performing that night and showed up beforehand to pedal alongside Balto and hundreds of kids and fans. The video of that ride has 3.2m views. In the past year alone, Balto’s videos have been viewed more than 200m times.1:01Justin Timberlake joins bike bus – videoBalto, who nowruns the nonprofit Bike Bus World, credits social media for building the movement. “Without it, this might have remained just a cool local initiative in Barcelona. But social media made it global. The visibility also helped change public perception about kids biking to school, proving that it’s fun, safe, and scalable.”Balto is right that moments are not movements, but as long as moments can be captured and shared on social media, sometimes movements will follow.Explore more on these topicsCyclingThe alternativesHealth & wellbeingSchoolsSocial mediaCity transportnewsShareReuse this content"

He cited recent elections in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany – where far-right forces are on the rise or in power – as demonstrating how voters had concerns about “unchecked power and the erosion of national society”.Both interventions came after explicit support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party byElon Musk, the richest man in the world who has become Trump’s government-slashing consigliere, and whose appearances on screen at AfD rallies caused shock in Germany and throughout Europe. Musk, too, has thrown about apocalyptic allegations about Europe’s supposed censorship, in particular smearing Britain’s leaders, including the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and voicing support for the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known by the pseudonym Tommy Robinson and currently imprisoned for contempt of court.Badenoch and Farage to vie for attention of Trump allies at London summitRead moreFar from running a mile from these increasing Trumpian characterisations of Europe as a dystopian hellscape, however, Arc underlined how the narrative has become one that some conservatives in Britain and the European continent are only too eager to embrace.Kemi Badenoch, the relatively new leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative party, paid homage on Arc’s first day to the US president’s leadership and repeated a series of Trumpian attack priorities, castigating “pronouns, or DEI, or climate activism”. She was followed on Tuesday byNigel Farage– her rightwing rival and leader of the anti-immigration Reform UK party – who has sought to make much of his relationship with Trump. Echoing a term that has become a rallying cry by Trump and those around him, Farage told Peterson: “Our platform is to re-industrialise Britain.”View image in fullscreenThe leader of the Conservative party, Kemi Badenoch, castigated pronouns and climate activism.Photograph: AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesAs far as Arc’s own description went, it was about “re-laying the foundations of our civilisation” by bringing together “thought leaders and changemakers” who were committed to “a hope-filled vision for the future”. Though not overtly religious, a strong Christian current ran through the event’s discussions, while Stroud, Peterson and other Arc funders make much of their faith.Joining Peterson via a virtual link in a discussion about the opportunities and challenges that AI technology presented to humanity, the Silicon Valley billionaire and Republican supporter Peter Thiel – who has helped to bankroll Vance’s political career – sought answers in Christian theology.“I think there were a lot of classical humanist ways to define human beings and I think those have gotten exploded. I think in a way, the more Christian ones are the only ones that are still left standing,” said Thiel, a founder of the information technology company Palantir and a co-founder of PayPal with Musk.But the conference also demonstrated the increasing reach and ambitions of rightwing US advocacy groups to expand their influence beyond America’s borders. Outside the main auditorium, stands run by organisations including the US libertarian network Students for Liberty and the free market Adam Smith Institute stood alongside groups engaged in Britain’s own “culture wars” – such as History Reclaimed and the “anti-woke” campaign Restore Trust.At one large stand, Focus on the Family, the US-based rightwing evangelical Christian group with 13 offices around the world, was promoting a documentary it aims to stream later this year about the activities of like-minded activists internationally.“This film is about responding to the cultural moment we are in,” said Ken Windebank, minutes after the head of a Slovakian anti-abortion NGO approached him about the possibility of collaborating. He said the film was “intended to galvanise people who are living out their Christian faith and trying to change things”.View image in fullscreenAttenders of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship conference at ExCel London.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PASome wariness still remained among at least a few European attenders of the radical new direction being charted by the US right. An older Austrian Christian Democrat who did not want to be named said he agreed with the sentiment of Vance’s speech in Munich, but was put off by what he regarded as the US vice-president’s aggressive approach. Like many others, too, he also admitted to being at a loss as to what Arc was actually for.“This is clearly extremely well funded, and we’re hearing much that we can agree on. But I’m still sort of left wondering about its role, though it is a great networking opportunity,” he added.Sam LaCrosse, a Trump-supporting podcaster and Christian public speaker from Texas, had no such hesitation: Arc, he said, was for finding common cause between Britons, Americans and others in what he viewed as a global populist uprising.“The Trump wind gave us permission to do what we are doing, and then we have the cultural relevancy of Jordan Peterson here who has naturally pushed him to take on a more expansive role,” LaCrosse said.“But I’m also just happy to be here around people with similar value sets. I’m 27 and it’s a confirmation I’m going down the right path.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsRepublicansConservativesJD VanceDonald TrumpJordan PetersonLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is not a simple thing that tomorrow someone agrees and then it’s done,” she said. “Ukrainians would not be willing to give up territory and they would potentially go against the government.Olga Onuch, now a professor at the University of Manchester, said plans to end the war have become an ‘existential question of the survival of their homeland’.Photograph: Handout“And that’s not simply in a future referendum, that is also in the streets. On top of that, this is a population that is traumatised and also equipped with arms.“So the potential to destabilise the country further, and the region, is great if something was seen to be imposed upon them.”Maria Romanenko, 32, a journalist and activist, said she was “feeling let down, anxious and scared” by Trump’s statements but even more determined to keep arguing thatEuropemust step up its support.As welcoming as she has found the UK, the seriousness of the situation isn’t always fully understood, as was summed up by the barista who told her they found Trump “funny” moments after she had spent the afternoon with displaced Ukrainian families, thousands of whom have attended thewalking toursshe holds to help them integrate into life in Manchester.“It would be funny if you ignore the fact thousands of people are losing lives, losing limbs,” she said.With such loss of life comes self-reproach. “You can just always feel it, the people who have left, they feel this guilt … like they can never be as good as people who have stayed,” Romanenko added.“So there’s always that guilt. It doesn’t really end anywhere. Every Ukrainian will tell you. And if they can’t tell you that, that’s because they were killed and they can no longer speak. Everybody feels like they’re not doing enough.”Natalia Ravlyuk, a trustee at British-Ukrainian Aid, described feeling “completely betrayed” by Trump’s remarks and position onUkraine.“It’s very frustrating to hear such nonsense – that we don’t have a right to defend ourselves. It’s a terror. It’s a genocide. Any agreement signed withRussiais a piece of toilet paper. When has Russia ever kept its promises?

We do want a peace, we all want a peace, but not at any cost.”The shock has also been felt across the Atlantic, said Onuch, who grew up in Canada.“Large portions of the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States who are American citizens, maybe for generations, did support the Republican party and Trump because they were expecting a harder stance,” she said.“If Putin is not stopped in Ukraine, he goes further and he destabilises the rest of the European continent,” she added. “And that will come to the United Kingdom in one way or another.”In a fast unfolding situation, however, the UK’s support has been a significant comfort to many Ukrainians.“Others dallied and dithered slightly. Britain stood up; all parties and all politicians stood behind Ukraine and so did the people of the United Kingdom,” Rewko said. “We were forever grateful for that and we’re pleased to hear the positivity from the current prime minister and the government on their continued support and stance with Ukraine.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

A lot is being lost in the shift to online learningJudith BrettA talking head on a screen is not the same as a flesh and blood person standing in front of youThu 20 Feb 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 17.45 ESTShareWhen I contemplate life in today’s universities I have two comparisons to draw on: my undergraduate days in the late 1960s at the University of Melbourne, and my more than 20 years teaching Australian politics at La Trobe. Of the many changes the one that stands out to me is the loss of the face-to-face in student life and of teaching.When I was an undergraduate, student life was on campus – in the clubs, the caf, the union, the library and in the tutorials where a dozen or so young people and a rare mature-age student would be led in discussion by a tutor, sometimes a new graduate, sometimes one of the tenured staff. Coming from a suburban high school, I knew no one when I started and made my first friends in tutorials as we continued our arguments outside, in the caf or walking downtown to catch our trains home, and gossiped about our fellow students.‘Teaching to an empty hall’: is the changing face of universities eroding standards of learning?Read moreWhen I moved into college in second year, and later into a share house, I could also go to meetings or the pub at night, and to the film society’s Friday night screenings. Without cars or mobile phones, social life depended on running into each other and on informal gathering places. Few people had part-time jobs and most late afternoons in the final years of my degree a dozen or more of us would gather in the mixed lounge for coffee, some food perhaps, and to talk and flirt, making friendships and building networks which have lasted a life time. In those liminal years, between youth and adulthood, as we left our parents’ homes, we were there, present to each other, face to face.I have just finished a biography of the second-wave feminist activist Beatrice Faust, who started at Melbourne University a decade before I did, and recognised the same pattern of intense daily interaction among students. When a decade later in 1972 she started the Women’s Electoral Lobby she turned to her undergraduate networks for recruits.When I started teaching at La Trobe in 1989, campus life was thinner. A suburban university, most of its students still lived in their childhood homes and had jobs. During the day the car parks were full as students drove in for classes but at night the campus was empty, and even during the day many students simply dropped in for class. I’m sure friendships still formed but the campus was no longer the intense social world of my undergraduate days. Perhaps more of it survived at an inner-city campus like Melbourne’s but there too students were taking jobs and cheap student digs were being lost to gentrification.Teaching, though, was still face-to-face. I was lucky to join a department which saw teaching undergraduates as our main raison d’etre and which included a number of gifted and dedicated teachers, including Robin Jeffrey, Joe Camilleri and Robert Manne, all of whom taught first year and took tutorials. Their styles were very different. Robin’s was quirky and occasionally whimsical, Joe’s urgent and Robert’s urbane but all were built on extensive knowledge of their subject matter and rigorous thinking. They modelled for students how to work through a problem, how to organise and interrogate a body of material, how to come to a conclusion. They showed that thinking was hard-won and serious and they invited emotional identification with the process. This more than the informational content is the lasting effect of great teaching, testified to in countless memoirs in which people remember teachers who turned them serious and changed their lives.I’ve thought a lot about what is being lost in the shift to online teaching. Information can be conveyed, and people can be taught protocols, as in the ubiquitous compliance modules, but can they be taught how to think or, more importantly, inspired to want to learn how to think? Perhaps, but I’m not convinced. A talking head on a screen is not the same as a flesh and blood person standing in front of you, face to face, whom you admire and want to emulate or impress. It drains teaching of its emotional pull. And it is hard to fit a complex piece of reasoning on a screen. Dot points are a limited cognitive tool.The shift to online teaching is only one of the developments which has eroded the centrality and quality of teaching in our universities. Others are the availability of research-only positions such as ARC fellowships, which took many gifted senior academics out of the classroom altogether and replaced them with casually employed less-experienced teachers. Many of these were excellent, dedicated teachers but the message sent by the flight of leading academics into research-only positions was that teaching was a second-order activity.The situation is different in the sciences but, to my mind, in the humanities and social sciences, teaching our fellow citizens is the core of our jobs, what the taxpayers pay us to do and the source of our social licence.Judith Brett is a political historian and biographer, and an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University.

Based in Georgetown, South Carolina, the GGCC helps preserve the history ofGullah Geecheepeople, the Africans who were enslaved on the Sea Islands along the Atlantic coast, and their descendants. One such person was Joseph Hayne Rainey, a man born in Georgetown and enslaved until his father purchased his freedom when he was 10. Rainey is who Hemingway immediately thought of following Trump’s order.Rainey was the first Black person elected to the United States congress, where he was known for his support of the 14th amendment, which was ratified in 1868 and stated: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The amendment was necessary to give the roughly4.5 million Black people in the countrycitizenship after emancipation, as a previous supreme court case, Dred Scott v Sandford, had denied citizenship to all people of African descent.Rainey’s support for the laws passed during Reconstruction was deeply informed by his life in enslavement. He spent much of his time in Congress fighting to protect Black Americans and to ensure the 14th and 15th amendments – the latter of which prohibited the federal government from denying a citizen the right to vote based on race, color or previous condition of servitude – were enforced.“The 14th amendment was passed and ratified because once those who were enslaved were emancipated, it was like they didn’t have standing,” Hemingway said. “Where were they in this world now? They were no longer enslaved, so they needed to be made citizens … [Rainey] went from an enslaved person to an emancipated person to a citizen. His personal story reflects the American story.”Now, the amendment that has long granted birthright citizenship is being used by the US president to deny citizenship to the children of recent immigrants. “The Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States,” his EO reads. It “has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’”.Trump’s executive order almost immediately faced several lawsuits from civil rights groups and Democratic attorneys generals, as well asa temporary restraining order from afederal judge. A federal appeals court has denied the administration’s request to reinstate a ban, but the threat still looms, especially as the president has saidhe expects the supreme courtto side with him on the decision.“The first line of the 14th amendment is designed to say that anyone who was born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is a citizen,” said Jamal Greene, a professor at Columbia Law School. “That doesn’t depend on their race or their ethnicity or anything else about them. The only question is whether they’re subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.”Trump’s administration has harped on the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States”, which was understood to refer to people who were not subject to US law, Greene said. That would have meant diplomats from other countries, Indigenous people, who are sovereign, and, potentially, an invading army. But now Trump is trying to use that language to apply to a wide group of people, including children whose parents were not lawfully in the US at the time of their birth.Greene said that those who support such an understanding of the law are suggesting that those people would not have an allegiance to the US. “But that interpretation is not consistent with how it would have been originally understood,” he said. “And it’s also not consistent with the language itself, since jurisdiction is not a reference to allegiance. It’s a reference to whether US laws apply to those people.”‘A double-edged sword’: The Gullah Geechee people in a complex struggle over landRead moreSome are also concerned about the order’s potential reach to citizens, such as Black Americans. The GGCC, for its part, argues that Trump’s order is an attempt to undo some of Rainey’s work. For Rainey, the 14th amendment was not just for Black Americans – it was for everyone. “To all people born unnaturalized into the United States, [the 14th amendment] is the first time in the history of the United States that it actually covered citizenship, including of formerly enslaved people,” Hemingway said. “They were the impetus for this, but it covered everyone. So we have to be very careful when we come and we start attacking it, because it’s not just going to remove citizenship of immigrants, it’s going to remove citizenship of everyone.”Though the restraining order blocks Trump’s plan, the future of birthright citizenship will be undecided until the supreme court hears the case. In the meantime, Hemingway is continuing to promote Rainey’s life and continue his fight.“This is why we speak out to make sure correct history is told … We still have to have the same fight for civil rights. [Rainey’s] actions inform our actions to this day. His story needs to be told more so that we could hold all of our elected officials accountable to the United States constitution. We are in a constitutional crisis. His life explains why we continue the fight.”Explore more on these topicsBlack US cultureCotton Capital: ongoing seriesLaw (US)Trump administrationUS politicsRaceSouth CarolinaGullah GeecheefeaturesShareReuse this content"

His father was a fitter, and his mother a housewife who also worked in the Tickler’s jam factory. He left school at 16 and wound up working at Courtauld’s synthetic textiles factory.Rows of terrace houses, constructed for workers in the booming fish industry, are set out in a grid structure by the docks. Life was similar on all these streets: doors left unlocked, kids out playing. Everyone knew everyone.Yet, fishing dried up in the 1970s and Dasein says people’s lives have been in decline ever since. East Marsh – the Grimsby suburb where Rutland Street lies – is one of the UK’s “tree deserts”, with less than 3% tree coverage. Farnham, in “leafy” Surrey – home to some of the UK’s wealthiest neighbourhoods – has45%.“When I was about five I wanted trees on Rutland Street,” says Dasein. “It was always bloody grey and bleak, there was a harshness to it.”View image in fullscreenRachel McWilliam, Billy Dasein and Carolyn Doyler of East Marsh United with some of the trees planted at Weelsby Academy by the community group.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverLow tree cover is linked with other forms of deprivation. East Marsh is the 25th most deprived ward out of the 32,844 in England, according to theIndex of Multiple Deprivation.More thantwo-thirds of peopleon the street live with at least one form of deprivation, related to either employment, education, health or overcrowding.Neighbourhoods with the most trees have 330% less air pollution and are 4C cooler during a heatwave than neighbourhoods where tree canopy is the lowestWoodland Trust researchDasein realised things had transformed on Rutland Street when he came back to look after his dad in 2013 having left Grimsby 15 years earlier, putting himself through university and earning a PhD. The place had “drastically changed,” he says: people were dealing drugs in the street and everyone he knew had “buggered off”. In the early 2000s, the council sold off the housing stock. Absentee landlords are now “tearing the guts out of our community,” he says. There are more than 300 empty homes in East Marsh, half of which have been empty for at least two years, according to council data.Dasein decided to create a community-benefit society calledEast Marsh United(Emu). High on its list were the trees. “They slow traffic, are associated with lower crime rates, increase desirability of an area, and foster community flourishing,” he says. “Trees are just better for our streets and communities.”View image in fullscreenA mock-up of how Rutland Street would look with trees.Illustration: Create StreetsOver the past two years, he has worked with local people and charities to plant 30 trees in the local park, 96 trees in local schools, and thousands of saplings in woodland and hedgerows. “No one else is going to do it,” he says, “so we might as well crack on.”In the morning, a cold sea fog comes barrelling in off the North Sea. On Rutland Street some houses are boarded up and cracked paving slabs are strewn around. “It’s very Dickensian in a lot of these houses,” Dasein says.Terry Evans, who lives on Rutland Street, says many of the houses here are at the mercy of bitter cold in winter and brutal heat in summer. Evans used to live in a house “with every inch covered in black mould” that made his daughter sick. Once, he says, his wife leant on a wall and her hand went through it. During hot summers, the houses heat up in the sun. “You can put your hand on our windowsill on the inside and it will burn your hand it’s that hot. A bit of shade would be good.”View image in fullscreenMembers of Emu and Rutland Street residents, from left to right Terry Evans, Sian Matthews, Vickii Goodwin and Clare Steadman, who are working to bring more trees to the area.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverEvans says having trees on the street would be “absolutely brilliant”, and could slow the cars down, making the street safer. “It’s going to look better to the people coming into the road – you walk down it and it’s dull at the moment, there is nothing to give it any colour, which is a massive shame”.Trees are a crucial part of urban wellbeing. People living in areas with fewer trees have a higher risk of health problems from poor air quality, according toTree Equity researchfrom the Woodland Trust. On average, richer neighbourhoods have more than double the tree cover per person than poorer ones. Neighbourhoods with the most trees have 330% less air pollution and are 4C cooler during a heatwave than neighbourhoods where tree canopy is the lowest, according to the Woodland Trust research. Modelling by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health found doubling tree cover couldcut heat-related deathsin European cities by nearly 40%.The government has listed East Marsh asa priority areafor planting more trees owing to low tree cover, but some people have said trees would not last in the neighbourhood. In February 2023, Emu organised a planting day to get 36 trees into Grant Thorold Park at the end of Rutland Street, including maples, sweet chestnut and elm. Hundreds of volunteers turned up. “Every single tree is still here,” says Dasein.View image in fullscreenIn 2023. Enum palnted 36 trees in Grant Thorold Park.

They know we need more trees and they understand the symbiotic relationship. In hot weather they’re vital – you can feel the tension in the air as the heat rises.”View image in fullscreenEmu has also begun buying local property to rent out as an ethical landlord.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverYet, planting trees is surprisingly expensive. The government’s Urban Tree Challenge Fund provides up to £270 a tree, but the rest must be found from other sources. Planting in a park costs about £400 a tree, but planting in the street costs significantly more, as it means digging up concrete: 30 trees on Rutland Street would cost about £120,000 in total, says Noble. They still need to find about £100,000 to make this happen.In the next year or so, however, Dasein hopes to finally get the 30 trees he wanted on his street. “For me, if this happens and we see a sweep of trees down here, I will simply think: we’ve really done something,” he says. “Our community deserves beauty – arts, culture, the best that civilisation offers – and most of all, nature.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsThe age of extinctionEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, they were torn apart to create drug factories, causing hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage. Why has the culprit not been brought to justice?Sirin KaleThu 20 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareWhen Hajaj Hajaj decided to rent out his house in south London in the summer of 2020, his daughter, Kinda Jackson, urged him to use a reputable lettings agent for peace of mind. Her father had enough on his plate. Hajaj, a 79-year-old retired garage owner, is the primary carer for his wife, who has Alzheimer’s disease. The income from the rental property in Lewisham is effectively Hajaj’s pension, which he uses to pay for her care.So, when a manager from ImperialPropertyGroup contacted Hajaj about his Gumtree listing, Hajaj arranged to meet them. A sharp-suited British Asian man named Shan Miah arrived in a sports car. He was in his late 20s or early 30s, charming and confident. Heboasted of his business interests in Dubai. “He was doing very well for himself,” Hajaj says.Miah explained that Imperial was different from other lettings agencies. A company of 70 years standing, Imperial had four London offices, employing 121 people, and had sold or rented 83,000 properties, according to its website. It specialised in corporate lets to NHS staff and IT consultants. Imperial would manage the property, dealing with tenants and paying for repairs. Should the tenants leave early, Imperial would cover their rent.View image in fullscreenPolice found 160 cannabis plants worth £160,000 in Hajaj Hajaj’s property.For all this, Imperial charged … nothing. Its fees were 0%. All it required in return was that Hajaj didn’t contact his tenants directly and gave two months’ notice if he wanted the property back. Hajaj assumed that Imperial marked up the rent to the corporate professionals living in the property. He signed with them in July 2020 and for two years, the rent kept coming. Although the bank accounts the money came in from changed every few months, Hajaj did not think this was unusual, as it was a corporate let.In December 2020, Hajaj contracted Covid. He was placed in a coma and spent six months in hospital. He had to relearn how to eat, drink and walk. His family were called to say goodbye to him three times. As he recovered, Hajaj’s thoughts turned to the Lewisham house. It had been nearly two years since he had set foot inside. On 10 May 2022, Hajaj emailed Imperial to request a viewing. “The property has been kept in immaculate condition and with regular interval checks,” replied Imperial’s administrator, Sarah Barnes.I feel sick. I can’t sleep at night. I don’t even like thinking about it any moreHajaj was mollified. He replied to Barnes detailing how important this let was to him. “Please note, the income is mainly covering the full time care which I provide for my wife … [who] unfortunately is suffering from dementia,” he wrote. He told Barnes how he had nearly died. “We wish you and your partner the best of health,” she responded, adding: “It is clear you do not need any extra headache.”But in November 2022, the rent didn’t arrive as usual. Imperial said it would evict the tenants, a process that could take months. Barnes sent court papers, to show proceedings were under way. Under no circumstances, Barnes emphasised, should Hajaj go to the property. “Forcing entry will result in the tenants calling the police,” Barnes wrote. Besides, the property had been inspected on 10 December 2022 and all was well, she added.The months dragged on. Hajaj sent beseeching emails.“I am unable to sleep or concentrate as this is the only income I have … My wife needs 24 hours care. I had to borrow money from the bank at [an] astronomical rate.” This time, Barnes’s response was cold. “Please refrain from constantly emailing … We will not tolerate abuse or unprofessionalism.”The tenants would be legally evicted, Barnes wrote in a subsequent email, by 18 April 2023. That date came and went. Hajaj heard no word from Imperial. So he went to the house. What he found there was worse than he could possibly have imagined.“How can a human being be so hard?” says Hajaj with despair, as he surveys the wreck of his property more than a year later.In October 2023, Michelle Chen skulked outside her property in Milton Keynes. It was 3am and she was on a stakeout. After she listed her house on Gumtree in September 2022, Miah approached her, too. “I checked the Google reviews,” says Chen, 43, an education consultant. “All perfect.”But something was awry. She knew it. Chen lived in the same development as her rental house and passed it daily. None of the lights were ever on, apart from the bathroom and hallway light, which were always on. But Barnes insisted that Imperial had inspected the property recently. “Rest assured, your property is in excellent condition,” she wrote in an email.View image in fullscreenMichelle Chen found holes in the walls and electrical cables drooping from the ceilings.Then, in October 2023, the rent was late. Chen did what she hadn’t done for a year. She rechecked Imperial’s Google reviews.One stood out. “Our house has been turned into a cannabis farm … STAY CLEAR OF THESE CRIMINALS.” It had been written by Jackson, Hajaj’s daughter.“Oh my God,” says Chen, recalling the moment she read the review. “That’s exactly what’s happening in my house.” Chen didn’t know much about cannabis farms, but she knew that the criminals hacked into the electricity supplyto run cabling to the lamps. What if her house exploded? Chen pulled on a coat and headed into the night. In the dark, the house glowered at her. She needed to get back into her property. But who would help her?When Hajaj opened his front door on 22 April 2023, he found a hidden wall, reinforced with steel and secured with three locks. He called the police. Inside, officers found 160 cannabis plants, with a street value of about £160,000. Also present was Niazi Hysa, then 38. Officers handcuffed him and walked him to Lewisham police station, which is next door to Hajaj’s house, scarcely 350m away. “You can’t make this stuff up, can you?” says Jackson, from south London, who is 46 and works in PR.When I meet Hajaj in his house in Lewisham a year later, it is still uninhabitable. The growers punched holes in the ceilings and connected a snaking system of ventilation shafts. They cut through the roof joists to build an internal wall. Hajaj was quoted £200,000 by a builder to fix it.Hajaj’s insurer won’t pay out, because Imperial didn’t take references for the tenants, obtain photo ID or inspect the property. Imperial also never took the tenants to court after they stopped paying rent; this was a ruse, to stall for time. Hajaj has been trying to repair the property himself, but he is nearly 80.View image in fullscreenThe growers punched holes in Hajaj’s ceilings to create a ventilation system and cut through the roof joists, causing £200,000 worth of damage.Hysa appeared before Woolwich crown court on 12 July 2023. The court heard that he had arrived in the UK on a small boat, hoping to earn money to support his wife and then two-year-old daughter, who was unwell. His asylum application had been rejected and he was homeless when he was approached and offered food and accommodation – but no money – in exchange for tending cannabis plants at Hajaj’s house. Hysa said he was afraid to say no to the unnamed person who recruited him. The judge determined that Hysa was a victim of “intimidation”, but nonetheless sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment.“It’s a familiar story,” says Prof Gary Potter, a criminologist at Lancaster University who specialises in cannabis farms. “Illegal immigrants are coerced into cannabis cultivation and treated as criminals, when arguably they are victims.” Many are trafficked and told by people smugglers that they must work for an unspecified amount of time to repay their debts, which can run into tens of thousands of pounds. If they refuse, gangs often threaten their families back home.Human beings are being exploited and put at such riskHysa is Albanian. “The Albanian community has been implicated in cannabis cultivation and there are organised gangs involved in importing cannabis from Albania,” says Potter. In one Imperial property, a two-bedroom house in Dartford, Kent, that was turned into a cannabis farm in 2023, the words “on” and “off” were written in Albanian by a light switch. But Potter emphasises that “most of the people who grow cannabis in the UK are white British nationals”.While Hysa was prosecuted, the Metropolitan police were incurious about the lettings agency that had repeatedly assured Hajaj that all was well in his property. “Generally, the grower gets nicked and dealt with for drug offences,” says a senior police inspector in the south of England, who asked not to be named. After a prison sentence, they may be deported. There is little institutional appetite to go after the organised gangs involved in forcing people into modern-day slavery, he says, because police forces are under-resourced and these investigations are complex and time-consuming, particularly when frightened victims won’t cooperate. “It’s not a priority at all,” he says.When officers found Hysa under a bed, he was hiding beside two sharpened metal poles, presumably for protection. In the Dartford house, the back door was smashed in; security cameras overlooking the rear garden had previously been installed. Cannabis farms are at risk from rival gangs, who seek to steal fully grown plants around the time of the harvest. In December 2021, 25-year-old Xhovan Pepaj wasstabbed to deathin Tunbridge Wells by a gang who were robbing a farm he was cultivating. “Human beings are being exploited and put at such risk,” says the senior police inspector.View image in fullscreenDetritus in Hajaj’s property.Between 2015 and 2024, the Met recorded 8,000 offences related to cannabis farming or cannabis production, according to data provided after a freedom of information request by the Guardian. Charges were brought in less than one-third of cases.“That will be a fraction of the size of the illegal cultivation that goes on,” says Potter. “There will be hundreds of thousands of cannabis farms in the UK.” Britain used to import its cannabis from Morocco and Pakistan, but shifted towards domestic cultivation in the 90s.The pandemic supercharged domestic production, with Met data showing that cannabis cultivation increased 70% between 2019 and 2020(although it has since decreased).This explosion, says Potter, was mostly fuelled by amateur growers turning over a spare room or garage to make some extra income. “With modern technology, such as carbon filters and grow tents, I’ve been in people’s houses where I’ve not been able to smell it until they take me upstairs and open the tent,” he says. “Walk 50 metres in London and you’ll walk past a cannabis farm,” says Potter.Across Britain, farms have been foundin pubs, informer primary schools, indecommissioned nuclear bunkersand even inold police stations. It could be happening on your street – maybe in the house next door. (The next time it snows, look at the rooftops. Cannabis plants need warmth; if snow melts away quickly, that is a giveaway.) In 2018, the Institute for Economic Affairs valued the market at£2.5bn a year. It is immensely lucrative. “As a rule of thumb, £1,000 a plant is reasonable,” says Potter. “If a grower knows what they’re doing, they can easily have four cycles a year.” A four-bedroom house might bring in £400,000 annually.Hajaj emailed Imperial after he realised what had happened. “Please respond and explain to me if you are … aware of what’s been going on,” he emailed on 10 May 2023. “[If you don’t], you are part of the criminals and [have] taken advantage of a sick old man.” Nobody ever got back to him.After she became convinced there was a cannabis farm at her property, Chen tried to regain access. At every step, Imperial blocked her. They cancelled viewings at short notice. They had a fake tenant call her. (Chen knew she was lying when she said she commuted by car to work in London: she had never once seen a car outside the house.)When Chen wouldn’t give up, Imperial threatened her. “[We] will call the law enforcement as you, the landlord, Michelle Chen, are trespassing,” wrote Barnes on 10 November 2023, after Chen knocked on the door of her property. Imperial also stopped paying the rent.View image in fullscreenChen’s property was damaged extensively.Chen says she contacted Thames Valley police four times to ask for help. They told her there was nothing they could do. She couldn’t prove it was a cannabis farm. “I said: ‘What kind of evidence do you want?’” The police officer told Chen she needed to see the cannabis plants. Chen was stunned. “‘You want me to deal with the drug dealers?’” she says. “‘OK, I’m going to go there, I’m going to knock on the door – and if they open the door, I’m going to call you.’ The police officer said: ‘No, you can’t call us unless you’re in danger.’”Chen laughs in disbelief. “If the police leave citizens to deal with drug dealers, that’s really ridiculous, to be honest.”Chen paid a bailiff £4,500 to get into the property on 10 December 2023. She found an abandoned cannabis farm, with plants half grown. Holes had been clawed in the walls. Electrical cables drooped from the ceilings. The plastic sheeting across the floor made the house feel like a crime scene – which, of course, it was. Thames Valley police came to take the plants away, but only, Chen says, after she threatened to fly-tip them in the street. The damage to her property came to about £30,000, of which only £5,000 was covered by insurance, the limit for malicious damage under her policy. Thames Valley police closed the case. “The police don’t care,” says Chen. “I want to be a criminal, because there’s no punishment.”The Guardian has spoken with six people who collectively say they had seven properties turned into cannabis farms after renting them out through Imperial. Online reviews suggest there are more victims. In some cases, cannabis farms went undetected for years; in others, neighbours tipped off landlords as the farms were being set up. The farms or attempted farms were mostly in London, but also in Milton Keynes and Dartford.In each instance, Imperial approached private landlords after seeing adverts posted online. Occasionally, Imperial put legitimate tenants in properties, but when it did it stole their security deposits and sometimes their rent. One mother of three, who rented a property in Feltham, west London, in August 2022 through Imperial, had a month’s rent and her security deposit stolen, totalling £4,375. Her contact from Imperial, who called himself Roberto, had the same number as Shan Miah.Imperial routinely lied to keep landlords away from the cannabis farms, even in the face of overwhelming evidence. When Santosh Chandorkar, a 49-year-old IT director, was told by neighbours in January 2024 that a skip filled with cannabis plants had appeared outside his property in Uxbridge, west London, Imperial insisted that the property had been recently inspected and all was well.When landlords didn’t swallow their excuses, Imperial threatened them. “The corporate client that supplies us with tenants … have now lodged a formal complaint in regards to you, the homeowner,” wrote Barnes to Andrea Petrie, 53, a project manager from south London.View image in fullscreenImperial told Santosh Chandorkar all was well at his home.Petrie’s three-bedroom house in Catford was turned into a cannabis farm in December 2023. At first, Petrie was impressed with the professionalism of Imperial’s approach. “It was very slick paperwork,” she says. But Petrie, an experienced landlord, realised something was awry when Imperial sent her an inventory report when the tenancy commenced without any photographs in it. She checked out the insurance paperwork Imperial had provided, realised it was fraudulent and persuaded the Met to help her regain access to her property. When they found the cannabis farm, “it was very neat and tidy”, Petrie says. “So professional. They did a really good job on the electrics. The officers said it was the nicest cannabis farm they’d ever been to.”In all cases, when the landlords finally regained access, Imperial went dark. It was then the landlords realised everything they had been told about Imperial was a lie. “There’s nothing legal about this,” says Chandorkar. “Everything is a fraud.”Imperial hadn’t been operating for 70 years. It didn’t have four offices or 121 employees. It wasn’t registered with HMRC for money-laundering checks, a legal requirement for all estate agencies, nor was it a member of a property redress scheme, a legal requirement for lettings agencies. The receptionists at the addresses listed on Imperial’s website had never heard of the company. The properties listed for rent or sale on its website did not exist. The real Imperial Group, the company number of which Imperial used in correspondence, is a dormant German cement manufacturer. A weary company secretary confirmed that she had been contacted repeatedly by confused victims of Imperial Property Group.All the paperwork Imperial sent – home insurance documents, records of bank payments, credit reference checks, inventory reports, deposit protection certificates and passport scans – was fraudulent. Sometimes, it was so realistic that even the legitimate companies responsible for issuing the documentation were duped.“They are very clever,” says Anna Stone, a 63-year-old academic who owns the property in Dartford. “They are very convincing. Scams don’t just happen to stupid people.” Now, she won’t deal with a company that is online-only. “I’m back to bricks and mortar,” she says. “I won’t do business with anyone I can’t meet face to face.”Imperial’s victims contacted Thames Valley police, the Met and Kent police. In each instance, bar Hysa’s conviction, the police shut the case without further investigation. When the Guardian contacted the forces, each confirmed that no suspects had been identified, but said this would be reviewed if new information came to light.After Chandorkar’s neighbours tipped him off in January 2024, he says the Met left his brother waiting outside the property from 8pm until 4am. (Chandorkar couldn’t go himself as he lives in Dubai.) The police showed up the next day and let Chandorkar’s brother into the property. He discovered what he believed to be the remnants of a cannabis farm.Chandorkar had another property rented with Imperial, also in Uxbridge, and begged the police to help him regain access. “They said: ‘What evidence do you have? Prove there’s something there.’ I said: ‘All I’m asking is you to investigate this.’”View image in fullscreenChandorkar was alerted to the abuse of his property by neighbours who saw cannabis plants in a skip outside.Chandorkar’s teenage son let himself into the second property in February 2024 and found a cannabis farm. “It was scary, because I’m putting my son at risk,” Chandorkar says. When Chandorkar called the police to let them know, he says an officer insinuated that he broke the law by entering his property. “I said: ‘Am I under investigation?’” he recalls in disbelief.In lieu of police action, Imperial’s victims contacted their MPs. They contacted the Insolvency Service. They contacted Action Fraud – five times. Nothing was done. “We just want answers,” says Jackson, Hajaj’s daughter. “We just want some justice.” She wants to sue Miah on her father’s behalf. But Shan Miah is not his real name. “We’ve got lawyers,” she says. “But who do we sue?”Everyone who met Miah describes a British Asian man of small build who by now would be in his early 30s. Some pronounced his name “Shan”, others “Sean”. He wasn’t the only person who worked at Imperial, but he seemed to be in charge. Miah told Petrie he had been working in property since he was 18. She thinks he was being truthful and that Miah was formerly a lettings agent. “He’s very knowledgable,” she says. “He’s definitely done it in the past.”So who is Shan Miah, the man behind so much misery?In 2019, Imperial approached the family of a 30-year-old plumber from Purley, south London, who prefers not to be named. Something was off. “He offered a ridiculous amount of rent,” says the plumber. He left an online review, warning people off. The person who approached them, he says, was a British Asian man called Taj.Imperial’s Google reviews also hold another clue. Two reviewers also left positive reviews fora lettings agency called Investire, registered to the same address. Before the Imperial website was taken down, the same photography appeared on Imperial’s and Investire’s websites. They used the same office numbers.Tom Greenhalf, 40, a British army bandmaster, was approached by Investire after he posted an advert for his one-bedroom flat in Croydon on OpenRent in March 2018. Greenhalf met Tajruhul Huda, a lettings agent originally from Mitcham, south London. Huda didn’t have a “slimy sales patter”, says Greenhalf. “He was really normal and convincing. He didn’t have to sell me very hard.”Investire agreed to manage his flat for a 5% commission, but the tenancy fell apart. The credit reference check Investire had provided Greenhalf with was fraudulent. It said the lead tenant earned £41,000; in reality, he was on universal credit.View image in fullscreen‘He was really normal and convincing’ … Tom Greenhalf, who was a victim of Tajruhul Huda’s company Investire.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianWhen the tenants moved out, leaving rent arrears, Greenhalf realised Investire hadn’t secured their deposit into a scheme, meaning that Greenhalf could be fined up to three times the value of the deposit. Greenhalf also says that Huda showed another tenant around the flat, took a deposit and disappeared with her money.Greenhalf secured a county court judgment (CCJ) for £4,285 against Huda in 2019, but he never paid. He later found out there was another judgment against Huda, for £5,185. CCJs are wiped after six years, so there may be more, now expired. Victims of fraudulent lettings agencies generally find it impossible to enforce their debts. “You might win an award, but you won’t get your money, because they dissolve the company,” says Ben Reeve-Lewis, the policy manager at Safer Renting, a tenant’s rights advocacy service.In housing circles, this practice is known as “phoenixing”. Reeve-Lewis explains: “You start a limited company and when the pressure is on you dissolve the company and any penalties or fines that go with it. Then you start a new company, sometimes from the same office.”The name Tajruhul Huda is also familiar to Hajaj – one of Huda’s companies paid the rent on his Lewisham house in September 2020.Since 2012, Huda, 34, has set up at least six lettings or estate agencies. In 2012, Huda owned a franchise of a lettings agency called Let’s All Move, headquartered in Croydon. The owner of Let’s All Move, Samer Butt, Huda’s brother-in-law, fled the UK in 2013 after the Met opened an investigation into at least 23 allegations of fraud. A wanted photograph of him was circulated by the police, even appearing in a local newspaper.Enslaved on a British cannabis farm: ‘The plants were more valuable than my life’Read moreHuda’s businesses are not registered with HMRC for money-laundering checks, nor with a property redress scheme. None of his current businesses appear to have employees, physical locations or properties available to rent or buy. Despite the fact that his companies appear to have no legitimate business concerns, Huda bought two properties in St Helen’s, Merseyside, in 2022 and 2023 through one of them, for a total of £360,000.Reeve-Lewis routinely deals with cases of phoenixing. Local authority trading standards officers are responsible for enforcing regulations, but after 15 years of cuts, officers are overwhelmed by the scale of the criminality. A2018 reportfound that there were just 2.46 environmental health officers to inspect private rented accommodation for every 10,000 properties in London. “There are so many of these buggers around,” Reeve-Lewis says. The Guardian has seen evidence of Huda using a variety of aliases – David, Roberto, Shan Miah – retiring each when they have outlived their usefulness. He has opened and closed businesses, careful never to own assets in his name, lest his creditors come after him. He remains, to all intents and purposes, a ghost. There is little trace of him online, no public social media accounts or photographs, although a private Instagram account, believed to be his, offers a trace of his worldview. In the “about” section, Huda has written “koinophobic”, which means afraid of living an ordinary life. In May 2024, he phoenixed again, openinga new online lettings agency, Tajhana. It is not registered with a property redress scheme and has no properties for rent, nor any employees. The Guardian attempted to reach Huda for comment through multiple channels, but received no reply.After nearly two years, Hajaj’s house is almost ready for new tenants. Putting it back to a habitable state has drained his life savings. “It’s ruined his retirement,” says Jackson. “He feels completely failed by the system. Criminals were able to do this and he’s left to carry the can on his own.”For Hajaj, the stress has proved almost unendurable. “I feel sick,” he says. “I feel bad. I can’t sleep at night. I’ve had enough with it. I don’t even like thinking about it any more.”Meanwhile, through his newly launched company, Huda is in the process of buyinga five-bedroom detached housein St Helen’s. The property last sold for £515,000 nearly four years ago. The newly renovated home has a summer house, a garden room and a store room.“Why wouldn’t he start again?” says Jackson. “He’s living the life of Riley while all these victims are suffering. And no one is doing a thing about it.”Explore more on these topicsCannabisDrugsCrimeUK criminal justicePolicePropertyRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Composite: Alex Mellon for the Guardian : Getty ImagesI saw first hand how prisons are having to use segregation units for acutely mentally ill inmates who should not be in prison at allByAlex SouthThu 20 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareAs a former prison officer, I have opened thousands of cell doors. For almost a decade, I unlocked cells in residential blocks, healthcare units, first night centres, close supervision centres and segregation units. The twist and click of a key in the lock came to feel like background noise to me. But there are some occasions I remember more vividly than others. Sometimes the person inside wasn’t so keen on coming out.One of those challenging incidents took place a few years ago, while I was on shift in asegregation unitin a busy London jail. Prisoners are sent to the seg for a variety of reasons – fights, assaults on staff, possession of contraband – but normally for no longer than a week or two. The seg was made up of 18 single cells spread over two storeys. I was in a team of six, all of us in full riot gear. We were moving a mentally ill prisoner who had destroyed his cell and then flooded it with sewage because he believed we were planning to implant a chip in his brain. His story is not an isolated one. In 2024, the chief inspector of prisons published a report showing that prisons are having to wait anaverage of 85 daysto send acutely mentally unwell prisoners to secure hospitals.The government has responded to the overcrowding crisis by letting some prisoners out early. Given that prisons were operating at99.9% capacity, I’m not sure there was any other option. But theearly releasescheme isn’t a long-term solution. Data published by the Ministry of Justicehas shown that recalls to prison haveincreased by 42%since the early release scheme was implemented. No prison officer in the country will be surprised by that. According to the most recent figures, assaults on prison staff occur almost hourly,suicides by prison inmateshave risen by nearly 25% and 70% of inmates feel unsafe. But numbers don’t do justice to the human impact of all this. They can’t show you what it’s really like.Officers are on the frontline every day, struggling to keep inmates and themselves safe. When there is a fight, someone has to break it up. A suicide attempt: someone must do CPR. A hostage incident: someone needs to negotiate. And when there is a person in “the box” – a single empty cell within the segregation unit – someone has to be the one to unlock that door. Someone has to be the one holding the shield. And, at the end of the day, that person puts on their coat and walks home.Back in January 2016, I lived no more than five minutes from the category B prison in London where I worked. I’d been a prison officer for a few years by that point, but the uniform still felt bulky and ill fitting. When I arrived, walking through the gatehouse and past the lockers crammed with batons and cuffs, the air felt just as cold inside the prison as it did outside. But the smells were nastier, particularly in the unit I’d been assigned to that day.In the segregation unit there were pools of shit leaking out from under the white screens erected opposite cell 6. The screens were in place to prevent faeces and urine hitting officers as they walked past. For the most part they were effective. But if a prisoner was persistent enough, they could aim it just right so when the mixture of shit and piss and water hit the screens, it slid down and under. Mensah (not his real name), a tall prisoner in his 50s, had smashed the observation panel and was posting what he affectionately termed “shit parcels” through it several times a day.He’d had enough practice at dirty protests. He was well known in all the London jails. He went from seg to seg destroying each cell he was put in, immersing broken furniture in the flood he’d caused by smashing the sink and taking apart the plumbing. He’d done a long time in Broadmoor, thehigh-security psychiatric hospital, but had eventually been considered stable enough to be returned to prison. Sadly, his period of stability did not last long. He was clearly mentally unwell, more than happy to live in a sea of his own detritus and convinced that almost every passing female officer was his wife. “What the fuck are you doing working in this place, Marie?” he would scream at every woman he saw.It wasn’t just the smell that hit you as soon as you walked into the seg. It was the noise too. The other seg prisoners would kick their cell door repeatedly, bang after bang after bang that reverberated throughout the unit, so relentless that it felt like the walls were shaking. They’d shout and bang and smash their observation panel, shards of glass sometimes exploding from the rectangular window in their cell door.The seg was like a smaller version of a residential wing. There were cells, an exercise yard, a servery for meals, and a desk on the ground floor where staff completed paperwork and answered phone calls. An office on the ground floor was reserved for what were known as adjudications. Each weekday the duty governor would sit behind a polished mahogany table, with a painting of the queen hanging above them, to hear the charges for which officers around the jail had placed prisoners on report: possession of a phone, fighting, assault, destroying prison property, threatening and abusive behaviour. On the day of their hearing, the prisoners would file noisily into the seg before being locked in a holding room to wait their turn. One by one they walked into the office to see the governor. But most of them didn’t have to stay on the seg. Almost all returned to the wing, carrying a punishment as well as their paperwork: loss of association (banned from mixing with others) maybe, or denied access to the prison shop, known as the canteen, for a couple of weeks.I remember thinking that it seemed particularly unfair to give a prisoner seg time given the smells emanating from Mensah’s cell. The two prisoners in the cells either side of him had been returned to their wing for the rest of their confinement period.In the seg, at the far endof the ground floor landing, was a cell known as “the box”. It was just an empty room. No bed, chair, or toilet. The most violent and disruptive prisoners were held in there, though not for long. Almost as soon as someone was put in the box, governors were making plans to try to have them moved back to a normal cell. That’s still the process today. The box is sometimes the safest place for a prisoner to be; they have no access to materials they could use to harm themselves or others. But locking a man in a literal box is no one’s idea of rehabilitation. It’s a last resort.There was no one in the box that day. There were 16 men locked in their cells, awaiting a regime of phone call, exercise and shower. Some weren’t bothered about going out in the yard, but most wanted a shower and a phone call. So the staff were tasked with facilitating a minimum of 16 individual regimes throughout the day while simultaneously making sure that no two prisoners were unlocked at the same time and ensuring that each man was checked on at least once an hour. It was a busy and challenging unit. Even if prisoners were considered safe to go on the yard together, they had to be escorted there one at a time by a minimum of two officers. This was problematic in 2016, but with the staffing crisis as dire as it is today, it is impossible to imagine how such a regime can be delivered without compromising both staff and prisoner safety.View image in fullscreenAlex South.Photograph: Suzie HowellIn very exceptional circumstances, a prisoner would be considered so dangerous that they were only unlocked by a senior officer plus six officers, each wearing a full kit of blue fire-retardant overalls, leg guards, arm guards, balaclava, helmet and stab vest. When I joined the prison service in 2012, stab-proof vests didn’t exist for officers. Nor did Pava – pepper spray that was rolled out in all-adult male prisons in 2020. The use of Pava iscontentious, but at the very least it recognises the increased danger facing prison officers today. Staff assaults were once comparatively rare. That is no longer the case. But while physical support measures may have increased, the emotional support available to frontline prison staff is lacking. Analysis released last year found that prison and probation staff took the equivalent of more than770 years’ worth of mental health sick leavein 2023.That particular day, I made my way towards the unit with an experienced seg officer named Rob (he asked me not to use his last name). He was a good friend of mine. When a prisoner from the wing I worked on was being segregated, it was almost always Rob who would be there to meet us. It was almost always him I saw after a serious fight or assault. Almost always him waiting on the concrete steps leading to the segregation unit to escort the cuffed man inside. And I was relieved every time. Rob knew the seg inside out, knew all the paperwork and adjudication charges and regime timings. And he knew the men too, the ones who were regulars, who handled seg life far better than they did being on the wing. Seg officers were often disliked by prisoners because they represented an even closer form of confinement. But Rob was respected.We walked past one of the wings housing more than 300 men. Most of the cell windows looking out on to the green remained intact. The majority of these prisoners were employed as barbers, servery workers or corridor cleaners. The nature of their jobs meant that most of them were out of their cells a lot, so they rarely felt the need to smash things. From the outside, there were no obvious signs announcing the approach to the segregation unit unless you knew what to look for. As we stepped on to the path outside, the grass rustled with the noise of rats picking through the litter. Above us, the cell windows were smashed. From inside came the constant thumping of men booting their door.At least one seg prisoner was not kicking his door. Instead he was dangling his legs out of the window. Most prisoners destroyed their surroundings because they were bored, fed up, angry. But Maxim (not his real name) wasn’t angry. He was cheerful, if anything. He waved at us, then shouted something in Russian. He was something of a celebrity in the prison, having been repeatedly segregated for damage to prison property. That wasn’t an offence which would normally warrant segregation, but with Maxim it felt like the only option left. Because the damage he was causing wasn’t ordinary. He wasn’t breaking his furniture or ripping up bedsheets. He had turned his cell into a kitchen. It wasn’t entirely clear how. He’d removed the base plates from prison-issue kettles and wired them up to the light fitting to make miniature stoves.An officer on night patrol caught him doing this in the early hours of the morning, so his electricity had been switched off. Maxim wasn’t hurting anyone as he set about making himself a meal, but it was a fire risk. For most prisoners, losing their electricity supply would mean game over: no cup of tea, no TV, no lights. And yet when the officer walked past Maxim’s cell again an hour or so later, the lights were back on. Maxim was stretched out on his bed watching TV with a cup of hot tea in his hand. Again, no one was really sure how he’d done it. Rob and I rounded the corner beneath Maxim’s window and climbed the steps to the segregation unit. The moment we were inside, the smell was all I could think about. The kind of smell that gets into your throat and makes your eyes water. I rarely wore my balaclava for planned removals, but that day I couldn’t get it on quick enough. I changed into my control and restraint kit in the adjudication room, the queen smiling at me as I slammed the visor of my helmet down.Mensah knew we were coming He’d done this many times before. We stopped outside his door – six of us, ready to go. Rob held the shield before him, elevated at a slight angle. I stood slightly behind and to the right of him while another officer mirrored me on the left. Rob’s voice was loud and steady.“Mensah, go to the back of your cell. Hands on your head.”When he spoke, the seg quietened. Prisoners peered through the crack between their cell door and the doorframe.“Yeah, guv, I already am,” said Mensah. “It’s all good, guv. I won’t fight.”Rob nodded at the senior officer, who reached round the shield and unlocked the door, then stepped back immediately. Rob leaned forward and pushed the cell door open. From my position, I could just about see Mensah stood at the back of the cell, facing the wall, wearing only boxers and socks. The cell was a mess. Broken table legs were scattered about the floor, bits of paperwork floated in the water from the smashed sink, a mug full of watery shit was balanced on the end of the bed.Mensah turned. With his hands still on his head, he started walking towards us, his feet occasionally knocking against furniture and detritus.“Keep going. Keep your hands on your head.”Rob and Mensah were going through the motions. But they both knew how this would go. Mensah took small steps, his smile getting wider. He was inches from the shield. As instructed, Mensah took his hands from his head, slowly. But he didn’t turn around. The tension was palpable. I stayed in position. The three staff behind pressed in closer.“Mensah,” said Rob.Any second.I saw Mensah’s right fist as it clenched. Rob held the shield firm.And then, bang. Mensah punched the shield. Rob dropped his head and drove the shield forward, pushing Mensah back into the cell. In a second the steady control of command and compliance was gone, everyone was splashing around, and Mensah was yelling about killers and spies and government agents. He was spinning and kicking, his limbs flailing and ours too as we tried to grab hold of him. He slipped in the water and crashed to the ground. Two of us managed to get hold of his arms while Rob supported his head to make sure his nose and mouth stayed clear of the stinking water. The noise around us was deafening. The other prisoners were kicking their doors and thumping their kettles against the windows.When we did eventually get Mensah to his feet, he calmed slightly.“They’re trying to put metal chips in me,” Mensah said.“No one is going to hurt you,” Rob said. “We just want to put you in a clean cell. You can’t stay in here. We’re going right next door. The cell is ready.”“But if the cell is dirty, they can’t get the chips in. If it’s clean, it’s too easy for them.”Mensah turned and growled at me. But he knew Rob, and even in his confusion he seemed to trust him. His hands were filthy, calloused and swollen and streaked with cuts. As we walked slowly out of the cell, rotating our little unit out of the doorway, I looked back and saw that Mensah had written “fuck govment” on the wall above his bed. But not in pen – he wasn’t permitted to have a pen. He’d written it in his own faeces.Hard as that job was, I knew I was lucky. My encounter with Mensah was extremely unpleasant, but at least I knew I was safe. I was surrounded by experienced officers who took pride in their work and understood the nuance of the job. Today, that is rare. Nearlyhalf of prison officersresign after less than three years. And I also felt certain that I was doing the right thing. Mensah may not have understood why he needed to leave that cell, but we did. We did our best to keep him safe until he got the help he needed. It is even harder for staff to do the right thing now, when there are so few of them and prisons are so overcrowded, conditions so poor and basic resources so sparse.Mensah embodied the paradox which so often curdles inside prison staff. He was pitied and yet reviled. Pitied because he lived in his own shit, and no one in their right mind would choose to live like that. Reviled because it was us he threw the shit at. There were many officers who seemed to have endless reserves of resilience, but there were others who were cruel and antagonising, who said things to wind prisoners up behind their door but were nowhere to be seen when it was time for the door to be opened.Mensah shouldn’t have been in that segregation unit. He shouldn’t have been in prison. He should have been in hospital. But where? When I spoke about his case to a forensic psychologist who had prior experience as an operational prison officer, he said: “We work with what we’ve got.” And what we had was not a lot. A shortage of beds inside medium- and high-security hospitals means a prisoner experiencing acute mental distress might have to wait months to be transferred to a hospital. The staff inside those hospitals do an incredible job, but they couldn’t make the process any quicker. And Mensah had to go somewhere. He was serving an imprisonment for public protection(IPP) sentence for possession of an offensive weapon. He’d first been jailed in 2006. Ten years later, he was still behind bars with no release date, no goals to set, no plans to make. Mensah’s original offence had involved threats but no actual violence. Yet now his violence was real. We were witnessing the impact an indeterminate sentence can have on a person’s mental state.Mensah was also a prolific drug user. Maybe that made things easier for him, a kind of escape. It certainly wasn’t difficult for him to get hold of the illicit substances. In recent years,drug rehab wingshave been introduced in prisons across England and Wales with the intention of breaking prisoners’ addictions. But simply labelling a wing “drug free” is not enough. It is certainly not enough when drones can deliver packages direct to cell windows. The staggering rise in drone incidents in prison demonstrates just what staff are up against. A freedom of information request by the Guardian found there were1,296 drone incidents at prisonsin England and Wales in the 10 months to the end of October 2024, a tenfold increase since 2020.‘If you decide to cut staff, people die’: how Nottingham prison descended into chaosRead morePrisoners like Mensah aren’t the norm – most men in segregation units will serve their designated seg time and then return to the wings – but nor was it an anomaly. There are men like him in segs up and down the country. Sometimes they reach their release date and there’s no legal reason to hold them any longer, so they’re let out on to the streets, confused and agitated and barely able to manage their own personal hygiene, never mind navigate the outside world. Sometimes they make it to a secure hospital, and after a few months’ treatment they return to prison stabilised, at least temporarily, with the right medication and support.And so Mensah was moved between the segregation unit and the healthcare unit, spending a few days at a time in each to give the staff a bit of respite before he was transferred to another prison. There he would resume his dirty protests. On one occasion he also pulled all his teeth out. After that he was transferred not to a hospital but to yet another prison.Investing in prisons means investing in people. That includes the staff. Prisons are made safe by officers who know those environments well, who understand the unique challenges they pose and who have the time to develop relationships with the prisoners in their care. Those skills come with time. Experience won’t come from the three years most prison officers spend in the job before deciding it’s not worth it. The cuts made to public services have been catastrophic. Austerity has stripped our prison service to the bone. And yet while many would prefer to look away, there are those who keep showing up, despite knowing exactly what they will face when they get there.By the end of 2021, I’d had enough. Staffing shortages had made the job too unsafe. We were at the point of letting prisoners out for association just once every three days. That kind of regime leads to boredom, frustration, acute psychological illness and devastating violence. After prisoner-on-prisoner murders at two of the jails where I worked, I waited for decent staff-support programmes that never came. The rate at which prison officers are now leaving the service should alarm us all. And it should be the catalyst for change. Because reform isn’t possible without officers there to unlock the doors.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here we look at what causes sinkholes, whether they are becoming more common and what can be done to prevent them.What are sinkholes?Sinkholes are large pits that appear in the ground when the underlying rock either collapses or is washed away, dissolved in water or degraded through other processes. In Britain they are typically 5 to 10 metres deep but can reach down more than 50 metres.How do they form?Some sinkholes form when soluble rock such as chalk, gypsum or limestone is dissolved by acidic rainfall or groundwater, causing the overlying ground to collapse. Others form when underground caves collapse. Yet more form when loose material under the surface is eroded by flowing water.What can trigger sinkholes?Heavy rain, surface flooding and drought can all trigger sinkholes by destabilising underground cavities. Mining, burst water mains and construction work, which affects surface drainage and the loads that ground has to bear, can also be a factor.Sinkholes around the world – in picturesRead moreAre some areas more prone to sinkholes?Absolutely. The Mendips, parts of Wales, the Peak District and the northern Pennines which sit on carboniferous limestone, a hard sedimentary rock made of calcium carbonate, are all hotspots. Areas of Dorset, Hampshire and the Chilterns, where clay and sand sit on chalk, are also vulnerable. The riskiest spot in Britain is around Ripon in North Yorkshire, which sits on gypsum, a soft mineral that dissolves much more easily than limestone.Was Godstone vulnerable?Yes. Godstone sits on weakly cemented sands that are prone to erosion and flushing by running water. Andrew Farrant, the British Geological Survey’s regional geologist for south-east England, said it was normally not a problem unless there was a sudden change in the hydrogeology. That could happen if someone dug a large hole below the local water table, or if there was heavy rainfall, flooding or a sudden ingress of water from a burst pipe.What about Godstone’s historic sand mines?Godstone sits on a network of tunnels and sand mines that date back to the 17th century.Mapspublished in 1872 reveal an entrance to an old sand mine very close to the site of the Godstone sinkhole, Farrant said. Two other old mines have entrances south of the sinkhole, on the east side of the road. There could be further sand mines in the area that are not recorded on maps, he added.So what might have happened in Godstone?It is impossible to be sure without more information. “It’s probable that the sinkhole is due to a burst water main flushing out weak unconsolidated sands from beneath the road over a period of time, creating a cavity which then collapsed when it got big enough,” Farrant said. But the sinkhole might have been caused by the collapse of an old, unrecorded sand mine, he added. A leaking pipe could have weakened the rock and led to the collapse of a mine, if one extended under the road, though it’s possible that a mine roof collapsed and broke the water main.Dr Arya Assadi Langroudi of the University of East London favours the burst water main theory. “The high pressure water from the damaged pipe likely ‘boiled’ the sandy soil beneath the surface, creating cavities that led to the ground collapsing,” he said. A second sinkhole formed on the high street shortly after the first.Are sinkholes becoming more common?Hard to know. Many sinkholes are never recorded, not least because the vast majority form in remote parts of Wales, the Peak District and the Pennines. But there are sporadic surges in sinkhole formation, usually linked to prolonged spells of heavy rainfall. The wet winter of 2012 triggered a spate of chalk mine collapses in south-east England. “I would be very wary of saying that the number of sinkholes appearing across the UK has increased over the last five years or so,” Farrant said.That may change with global heating and more extreme weather. Geologists expect heavier rainfall to exacerbate sinkhole formation, but also collapses of old mine shafts, sewers, drains and culverts. “Many of our older Victorian culverts and drains simply weren’t designed to cope with some of the demands placed on them due to changes in climate and increases in population and urban development,” Farrant said.Can we prevent sinkholes?In vulnerable built-up areas, ensuring sufficient drainage is crucial, said Assadi Langroudi. “If the ground can be stabilised, investing in proper drainage infrastructure can prevent the dangerous combination of water and loose sand from leading to further collapses,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSinkholesSurreynewsShareReuse this content"

This drove Anglo to a $3.1bn net loss in 2024, from a $283m profit the previous year.The latest writedown of De Beers, which once controlled 90% of the world’s diamond market, means the company is now valued at $4bn.Anglo laid bare the ongoing losses at De Beers after setting out a plan last year to sell the diamond business as part of a historic corporate overhaul to defend the company againsta £34bn takeover plot by the Australian miner BHP.Anglo hopes to guard the company against further unsolicited advances from BHP, which attempted to force the board to offload two Johannesburg-listed subsidiaries, the platinum miner Amplats and the iron ore miner Kumba, in order to complete a takeover.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least part of the company is expected to be purchased by the government of Botswana, which hosts many of the company’s diamond mines.Explore more on these topicsAnglo AmericanMiningSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, USAid and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)contributed$55m in emergency assistance.ButUSAidworkers with knowledge of the agency’s mpox response said that not all of that money has been disbursed and is now frozen under the administration’s orders to stop nearly all humanitarian aid.In addition to the funding freeze, USAid workers were evacuated from the country at the end of January, according to court filings. Until weeks ago, the United States was a leader in coordinating response efforts.One USAid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said in planning meetings: “Immediately it’s eyes on USAid of, ‘What are you guys going to do?’ And so everybody’s lost right now.”The aid freeze has meant that some provinces in the country who depend solely on USAid funds have been stripped of any resources to contain the virus, the worker said.“We were working on creating a sustainable system that can respond not just to the current mpox outbreak but can be used in the future for any other outbreak and now we’re not sure if that will succeed,” said a second USAid worker with knowledge of the mpox response.“Just like all these increased cases of Ebola and Marburg in neighboring countries, it’s not if, but when the next one in the DRC will be and how the country is going to be ready.”Cutting off resources to contain the current outbreak only increases the chances of mpox spreading to more countries, experts said.“Disaster and catastrophe are the appropriate words for shutting down USAid. It’s not just about people overseas who will be affected but there’s a likelihood of mpox or the next pandemic spreading to the United States,” said a US-based researcher who studies infectious diseases and asked for anonymity because of ongoing projects with the National Institutes ofHealthand CDC.A global outbreak of mpox in 2022 led to more than 100,000 cases in 122 countries and marked the first time that the disease had spread outside of central or westernAfrica. That outbreak has largely been contained and the number of cases is low, in part due to widespread vaccination efforts.The more recent outbreak in DRC is a distinct variant from the mpox virus that caused the 2022 outbreak.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio issued guidance that life-saving humanitarian assistance – including for food and medicine – may still be dispersed through a waiver despite the funding freeze. USAid workers said that while they have been seeking a waiver to continue mpox programming in the DRC, one had not been approved yet.WhileTrump administrationofficials have said their aim is to reduce wasteful spending and fraud, public health researchers criticized the speed and ferocity of the cuts.“If you’re gonna do these types of cuts, they have to be mindful,” said Amesh Adalja, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of public health.“There’s this unpredictability that you can’t have if you’re trying to run a disease control program.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When that’s pulled, Adalja explained, “making decisions about vaccine allocation, vaccine programs, testing strategies, is missing expert input, and that makes it harder for it makes it harder for control efforts”.While much of the agency’s programming remains halted, the future of USAid continues to be challenged in court cases. One federal judgeruledlast Thursday that the aid freeze must be temporarily halted and gave the government five days to comply. Aid workers said the ruling has created confusion on how to restart programs that may be simply axed again shortly.Though USAid employees said in interviews they are most concerned about finding ways to continue the agency’s aid work, the last several weeks have been personally taxing as well, according to court testimony.Three USAid workers described the chaos of being pulled from the Democratic Republic of Congo on 28 January as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing federal workers. After protests broke out in Kinshasa, the embassy issued an order to evacuate. But with foreign aid frozen, Washington offices closed and many colleagues placed on administrative leave, USAid employees had little communication and were forced to fund their own evacuations.Trump disrupting US bird flu response as outbreak worsensRead moreWorkers described being shuttled into boats with their families with just enough space to hold a carry-on bag each on their laps or a backpack – many leaving pets and most of their belongings behind. Now, back in Washington, their careers still remain in limbo.“I have been experiencing health consequences related to extreme stress, anguish and sleep deprivation due to worrying about staff, partners and the situation in general in DRC and not being able to respond in the way that I normally would,” a USAid employee using the pseudonym Nancy Doe said in a 11 February filing.Morse, the professor at Columbia University, notes that the US pulling out from the WHO in tandem to shutting down USAid work is a “double hit”. The United States was the biggest donor of the WHO and also benefited from sharing research with other countries it will no longer be privy to.“If we blindfold ourselves and tie our hands, we’re not going to make ourselves safer,” said Morse. “We will just be less aware of what’s killing us or what’s making us sick.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS foreign policyUSAidWorld Health OrganizationMpoxnewsShareReuse this content"

The deportees included 126 people with criminal charges or convictions, the spokesperson said, 80 of whom were allegedly affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang. The spokesperson said 51 had no criminal record.The move comes after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last week seeking access to dozens of immigrants flown to a US naval base in Guantánamo Bay,Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney.The Trump administrationbegan shipping detained immigrants to Guantánamo on 4 February, describing them as the “worst of the worst” and saying that they included “criminal alien murderers, rapists, child predators and gangsters”.Human rights lawyers argued that the US government had not provided proof that any of the detainees had committed serious crimes, while relatives of some of the men denied that they had been involved in wrongdoing.The websiteMigrant Insiderreported that relatives identified one detainee asLuis Alberto Castillo Rivera. The 23-year-old Venezuelan was detained when seeking asylum on the southern border on 19 January,one day before Trump took powervowingto return “millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came”.“He’s innocent,” Castillo’s sister, Yajaira Castillo, told the Spanish news agency EFE, denying her brother was part of Venezuela’sTren de Aragua gang.Thursday’s flight comes two days after Honduranpresident Xiomara Castro announcedthat a deal had been reached with the Trump administration to salvage an extradition treaty that was set to expire on 28 February.The treaty has mostly been used to bring drug traffickers to justice in the United States, but was denounced by Castro in August, at about the same time that avideoemerged of her brother-in-law negotiating illicit campaign contributions with traffickers.The Honduran foreign minister, Eduardo Reina, said on Tuesday that the deal to save the treaty included safeguards against the use of extradition to interfere with the country’s electoral cycle in 2025. Critics denounced the move as an effort to protect the president’s family from the same fate as her predecessor, Juan Orlando Hernández, who last year was convicted of drug-trafficking conspiracy charges in New York. Castro has not been accused of any wrongdoing.Reina had also said that the deal involved the issue of migration. Honduras is one of the few countries in the region that recognized Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s disputed victory in last year’s election and also has cordial, albeit complicated, relations with Washington.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationGuantánamo BayVenezuelaCubaHondurasLaw (US)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They are facing prosecution on charges they supplied the famed British boy band star with narcotics.The ruling drops charges againstthree key defendants: Rogelio Nores, an Argentinian businessman with US citizenship who had accompanied Payne during his trip to Buenos Aires; Gilda Martin, the manager ofthe Casa Sur Palermo hotel where Payne died on 16 October; and Esteban Grassi, the hotel’s main receptionist.Javier Milei faces impeachment calls after Argentina cryptocurrency collapseRead moreThe charge of negligent homicide carries a sentence of one to five years in prison inArgentina.A toxicology report from tests taken after an autopsy revealed that Payne, 31, had alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system when he fell from the balcony.Prosecutors argued that Nores had failed to comply with his duties of care by leaving Payne alone while inebriated. The court sided with defense attorneys who contended that Nores had no legal, moral or social duty to care for Payne. He also was outside the hotel at the time of his friend’s death.The two hotel employees, Martin and Grassi, were in the Casa Sur lobby on 16 October when they saw Payne severely intoxicated and decided to take him to his room with the help of others, investigators determined.Prosecutors said that the men should have kept Payne away from his hotel room, where a balcony posed a clear danger, until the singer could receive proper medical care. On Wednesday, the court ruled that prosecutors failed to prove how taking Payne to his hotel room “constituted unlawful, unruly, clumsy, reckless, imprudent or negligent conduct”.The court also ordered the other two defendants in the case – Ezequiel David Pereyra, a former employee at Casa Sur Hotel and Braian Paiz, a waiter who had served Payne at an upscale Buenos Aires restaurant – to remain in detention on charges that they supplied Payne with narcotics in the days, even hours, leading up to his death.Because the charge they face carries a sentence of four to 15 years in prison, the court said that preventative detention was justified.Payne’s sudden death drew an outpouring of grief around the world from heartbroken fans of One Direction, among the best-selling boy bands of all time.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaAmericasLiam PaynenewsShareReuse this content"

They also reflected the troubled history between the two allied nations: US forces have invaded Mexico at least 10 times and in 1846 claimed nearly half of the country’s territory for the US.US adds Mexican cartels to list of foreign terrorist organisationsRead moreSheinbaum said she would also propose a second constitutional reform that would stiffen the penalties for Mexicans and foreigners who engage in arms trafficking. Most guns used in crimes in the country are trafficked from the United States.She also repeated a pledge that Mexico would expand itslegal actionagainst US gun manufacturers, which her government accuses of negligence in the sale of weapons that end up in the hands of drug traffickers.The lawsuit could lead to a new charge of alleged complicity with terrorist groups, Sheinbaum said.Donald Trump’s decision targeting eight Latin American drug-trafficking groups – including several Mexican cartels – is the latest step in the US president’s intensifying crackdown on gang members.The measure covers eight Mexican organized crime groups, including the two biggest factions, theJalisco New GenerationandSinaloa cartels, as well asMS-13, the Salvadorangang founded in Los Angeles, andTren de Aragua, a group rooted in Venezuela.Mexico has long opposed the move, arguing the cartels are not motivated by political ends like others on the terror list, but by profit.The designation could shift the legal landscape for US asylum claims, potentially hurting migrants who are forced to pay extortion or ransoms to cartels, as they could be accused of supporting a terrorist organization.Trump signed anexecutive orderon his first day back in the White House saying that the cartels “constitute a national-security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime”.The move has raised speculation about possible military action.Tech billionaireElon Musk, who has been given a prominent role in theTrump administration, suggested the designation “means they’re eligible for drone strikes”.Since Trump returned to power, the US military has increased its airborne surveillance of the cartels along the border between the two countries, while the CIA has stepped up drone flights over Mexico to hunt for fentanyl labs – though Sheinbaum said that this was with Mexico’s permission.Explore more on these topicsMexicoClaudia SheinbaumTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The invertebrates have rows of pudgy legs and skin speckled like a galaxy, and areconsidered “living fossils”, having remained virtually unchanged for 500m years.“They are from this ancient lineage and they are unique,” says On Lee Lau, who works in the collections team at Tūhura Otago Museum and backed the creature to win the country’s annual bug of the year award.“They seem very soft and like a slow-moving, stumpy kind of caterpillar,” Lau said. “But they have that dark secret where they’re really amazing hunters, and can shoot slime out of their oral papillae.”Velvet worms are not actually worms or caterpillars, despite their names and resemblance. Rather, they are considered something of a missing link between worms and insects and are so distinctive from other invertebrates they have their own taxonomic rank below “kingdom” and above “class,” called Onychophora.View image in fullscreenTheHolacanthella duospinosa,or Giant Springtail, was also a nominee in the competition.Photograph: Frank Ashwood/SuppliedThePeripatoides novaezealandiaeis one of roughly 30 velvet worms endemic toNew Zealand. They typically reside on the forest floor, where they shoot jets of sticky fluid on to their prey, before dissolving it into a soup and slurping it up. Velvet worms are thought to live for roughly five years and produce 10 to 20 offspring annually. Some, including the winner, hatch their eggs internally and bear live young.The elusive velvet worms are difficult to study as they can be hard to find, and while the winning species is thought to have a stable population, they are subject to threats such as habitat loss and predators, according to theDepartment of Conservation. Globally,insect numbers are plummetingdue to intensive agriculture, urbanisation and climate change.The Entomological Society of New Zealand launched thebug of the yearcompetition in 2023, inspired by the country’s wildly popularbird of the year competition. The popularity of the bug awardsis growing, with this year’s competition generating the highest number of voters so far – nearly 10,000.The velvet worm won with 2,652 votes, just 110 points ahead of the runner-up – an endemic apple-green praying mantis. Other contenders included a wingless fly that hitches rides on bats, a slug that looks remarkably like a gherkin, an exquisite lichen-coloured moth, and a sea slug named after Sméagol from Lord of the Rings.Wild fish can tell humans apart when they dress differently, study findsRead moreJenny Jandt, a senior zoology lecturer at the University of Otago who helps coordinate the competition, said this year’s line-up was the most diverse yet, with every one of the 21 bugs representing a different taxonomic family.The competition aims to highlight not just the conservation status of bugs and the important ecological role they play, but to foster celebration, Jandt said.Many of the creatures go unnoticed and unrecognised, Jandt said. “You have to look for them.

The crime of insurrection carries a long prison sentence and, theoretically, could attract the death penalty, though South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997.Yoon’s lawyer, Kim Hong-il, condemned the “illegal probe” against the suspended president, arguing the “investigating body has no jurisdiction”.2:02How the South Korean president's martial law declaration unfolded – video“The declaration of martial law was not intended to paralyse the state,” Kim said at the hearing, which ended after just 13 minutes.He said the martial law order had meant to “alert the public to the national crisis caused by the legislative dictatorship of the dominant opposition party, which had crippled the administration” – a reference to the Democratic party, which has a majority in the national assembly.Yoon, a 64-year-old ultra-conservative who became president in May 2022, has been in prison sincehe was arrestedlast month after tense standoffs between the authorities and his personal security detail.There was heavy security around the court building on Thursday, with the Yonhap news agency reporting that about 3,200 police officers had been mobilised.Prosecutors have accused Yoon of being the “ringleader of an insurrection”. He has been suspended since parliament voted to impeach him in mid-December.His lawyers have condemned the criminal investigation as illegitimate and challenged the legality of his indictment, arguing that it was within his power as head of state to declare martial law. They told reporters last week that it was “an act of governance and cannot be subject to judicial review”.Ladders, noodle stations and K-pop: how the arrest of South Korea’s president unfoldedRead moreLater on Thursday, Yoon also attended a parallel impeachment trial in the constitutional court that has entered its final phase. The court’s acting chief justice, Moon Hyung-bae, said the next hearing would be held on 25 February, during which Yoon and the parliament, which is presenting the case against him, will give final remarks.Yoon’s future hangs in the balance. If the constitutional court sides with parliament, he will be permanently removed from office and a new president elected within 60 days.Witnesses testifying to the constitutional court on Thursday, included the prime minister, Han Duck-soo, who has also been impeached and awaits the court’s decision on his fate.“I am deeply burdened by the despair that each and every one of our people felt due to such extreme politics that took place before, during and after emergency martial law,” Han said. “All procedures dealing with the emergency martial law must be carried out fairly and reasonably … so that there is no further spark of national division.”Much of Yoon’s impeachment trial has centred on the question of whether he violated the constitutionby declaring martial law, which is meant to be reserved for national emergencies or times of war.His decree lasted only around six hours as the opposition-led parliament defied troops to vote it down. But it has plunged Asia’s fourth-biggest economy intomonths of political turmoil, with protests, two presidential impeachments and a surge of online disinformation by Yoon’s supporters.The next hearing in Yoon’s criminal case is schedule for 24 March.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Quezon City, the country’s most populous city, declared a dengue outbreak on Saturday after 10 deaths since the beginning of the year.However, there are concerns the village bounty programme may inadvertently backfire, if people start propagating mosquitoes to reap the rewards, department spokesperson Albert Domingo said.Domingo said he was not condemning the move, but added: “If you are willing to give prize money for something, maybe we could consider contests for cleanliness,” with neighborhoods competing to clear away areas with stagnant water.The project also sparked concern on social media, with commenters warning of potential mosquito farming for profit. “We must make sure that our solutions are sustainable and have no unintended consequences,” read one comment on one of Cernal’s posts about the initiative. “Reevaluate this project because I don’t find it effective” another comment read.In response to the criticisms, Cernal emphasised in a Facebook post that he had “no ill intentions” with the programme.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificInsectsDengue fevernewsShareReuse this content"

The Financial Times reported the ships were about 150 nautical miles off the coast of Sydney.The ships’ presence off Australia’s coast closely follows an incident in the SouthChinaSea last week, in which a Chinese fighter jet released flares in front of an Australian military plane.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe ships have not crossed into Australia’s territorial waters – 12 nautical miles from the coastline – but are inside Australia’s exclusive economic zone (200nm). The ships have not breached international law and the defence force has said its monitoring of the fleet is “routine”.Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, said while the ships’ passage off Australia’s coast was “not unprecedented” it was unusual.“We are keeping a close watch on them and we will be making sure that we watch every move,” Marles told Sky News.“And whenever this mission is over on the part of the Chinese task group, we will assess everything we have seen to make a proper assessment of exactly what they were trying to achieve through this mission.”Australia’s air force and navy were monitoring the ships, he said.“This is not unprecedented but an unusual event,” Marles said. “Just as they have a right to be in international waters … we have a right to be prudent and to make sure that we are surveilling them, which is what we are doing.”In a statement on Thursday, the defence department said it “routinely monitors all maritime traffic in Australia’s exclusive economic zone and maritime approaches”.“Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace, under international law, particularly the UN convention on the law of the sea.”Kyiv’s White House wooing implodes as Zelenskyy tells the truth about Trump | Julian BorgerRead moreThe ships’ arrival off Australia’s coast comes as the commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, met with Marles and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in Australia.Paparo is scheduled to meet Australia’s chief of joint operations in Canberra on Thursday.A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Guo Jiakun, declined to comment on the ships’ presence in Australia’s EEZ when asked on Wednesday, saying he was “not familiar” with the situation.According to earlier Chinese media reports, the PLA-Navy frigate, cruiser and replenishment vessel have been conducting “real-combat” exercises in an unspecified part of the Pacific Ocean over the past month.The three Chinese vessels’ voyage down Australia’s east coast is understood to be the farthest down Australia’s east coast Chinese naval ships have sailed outside an official military visit to Australia.Chinese ships sailed into Sydney Harbour in 2019 but that visit was undertaken in coordination with the Australian government.Paparo told the Honolulu Defense Forum earlier this month that China’s escalating military demonstrations of force towards Taiwan were “not exercises; they are rehearsals” for an invasion or blockade of the autonomous island.Despite the Chinese Communist government never having ruled Taiwan, Beijing claims the island as an inviolable part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to annex it.Paparo said China had shown “clear intent and capability” to attack Taiwan. Most recently, China conducted a massive simulated air and sea blockade of Taiwan in October as Taipei marked its national day.In an incident on 11 February, a Chinese PLA-AF J-16 fighter aircraft released flares near an Australian P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft as it was flying what Australia has said was a “routine maritime surveillance patrol in the South China Sea”.“This was an unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre that posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,” the Australian government said, noting there was no damage to aircraft nor injuries.China rejected Australia’s protests over the incident, saying the Australian plane “deliberately intruded into China’s airspace” and undermined its national security.The flare incident was the latest of a number of contested run-ins between military craft from the two countries, followinga similar aircraft encounter in the same area last yearand a highly controversial report ofa Chinese ship deploying sonar in close proximity to Australian navy diversin 2023.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This followed a 20.5% increase from 2021 to 2022, with an average of $337 paid in 2021.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailVoluntary contributions, while optional, go towards things such as sporting and music programs, stationery, out-of-school care and excursions.South Australian parents contributed the highest amount in fees in 2023, at $646 a student, followed by Victoria ($592) and Queensland ($439).Sanjeev Gupta was once seen as Whyalla’s ‘saviour of steel’. Seven years later, he may walk awayRead moreThe Greens leader,Adam Bandt, will speak at the Australian Education Union federal conference on Friday, where he will accuse the major parties of underfunding public schools for decades and shifting costs on to families struggling with the cost of living.“In Australia, one in three big corporations pays no tax. $0 tax,” he will say.“Meanwhile, public school parents are now paying over $1.2bn in public school fees each year, or $465 per public school child.“Our mission is to make the billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share, so everyone can get the education they need.”Chart showing school feesThe Greens have pledged to abolish public school fees and charges as part of their education election commitment, with additional funding of $2.4bn over forward estimates to cover the shortfall. Their policy is also for public schools to be fully funded by 2026.The education minister, Jason Clare, hasstruck deals with all states and territories, excluding New South Wales and Queensland, to fully fund schools within a decade, while also removing a 4% loophole that allows jurisdictions to claim their total funding share onnon-school related expenses like capital depreciation.Speaking to reporters last week, Clare said the funding would be tied to “real and practical reforms” to improve outcomes among public school students.“I want to fix the funding of our schools and I want to tie it to the sort of reforms that are going to help children who fall behind when they’re little to catch up and to keep up and to finish high school,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It proposes giving Washington $500bn worth of natural resources, including oil and gas.Waltz said Kyiv was wrong to push back against the US president’s approach to peace talks with Moscow, given everything the US had done for Ukraine. He denied accusations the US had snubbed Ukraine and America’s European allies by excluding them from talks earlier this week with Russia. This was routine “shuttle diplomacy”, he said.“Some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv … and insults to president Trump were unacceptable,” Waltz later told reporters at the White House.“President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with president Zelenskyy, the fact that he hasn’t come to the table, that he hasn’t been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered.”On Wednesday,Trump called Zelenskyy “a dictator”who refusedto hold electionsand blamed Ukraine for the war. Zelenskyy, for his part, said Trump wasliving in a Kremlin “disinformation bubble”and that he wished Trump’s team were “more truthful”.The world’s richest man Elon Musk, who is leading Trump’s huge US government overhaul, also attacked Zelenskyy on Thursday, claiming Ukrainians “despised” their president and that Trump was right to leave him out of the talks withRussia.The tech boss launched into a tirade against Zelenskyy on his X social network, accusing him without evidence of running a “massive graft machine feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers.”“He knows he would lose in a landslide, despite having seized control of ALL Ukrainian media, so he canceled the election. In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine,” Musk wrote. In fact a recent poll shows that 57% of Ukrainians trust their president.The US’s rapiddumping of Zelenskyy as an allywas underlined when Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, cancelled a press conference in Kyiv. Journalists were summoned to the presidential palace to ask questions after his meeting with Zelenskyy but were stood down.Later Zelenskyy said he had a “good discussion” with Kellogg. It covered the battlefield situation, how to return Ukrainian prisoners of war, and “effective security guarantees”. He said he was grateful to the US for its assistance and bipartisan support, adding: “It’s important for us – and for the entire free world – that American strength is felt.”Kellogg is seen as the most pro-Ukrainian of Trump’s entourage. He did not take part in a meeting earlier this week between the US and Russia in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. One Ukrainian official said Kellogg had been sidelined from the peace talks, adding that Zelenskyy was in an “engaged” frame of mind and “highly motivated”.The envoy is due to leave Kyiv on Friday after a three-day trip. It was unclear if he would take up Zelenskyy’s proposal that they visit the frontline and talk to senior commanders, who are fending off a superior and advancing Russian force in the war-torn east.Ukrainians aresceptical any deal with Moscow will stickand believe Vladimir Putin’s original war goals – to conquer as much territory as possible – are unchanged. The US vice-president, JD Vance, said on Thursday that talks with Russia were making progress. “I really believe we are on the cusp of peace in Europe for the first time in three years,” he said, adding that Trump was determined to stop the war.Vance told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland: “I think with president Trump, what makes him such an effective negotiator, and I have seen this in private, is that he does not take anything off the table … Everything is on the table. And of course that makes the heads explode in America because they say: ‘Why are you talking to Russia?’”There were further signs that theTrump administrationnow considers Ukraine an adversary, and is working against it on a diplomatic level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The resolution condemns Russian aggression and reaffirms Ukraine’s sovereignty and pre-2014 international borders, before Russia annexed Crimea and started a covert military takeover of the eastern Donbas region.This is the first time since the war started that the US has failed to back the resolution. About 50 countries are likely to support it, including the UK and most EU governments, it is understood.The White House was blocking a similar statement from the G7 group of countries blaming Russia for the conflict, theFinancial Times reported. It said US envoys had objected to the phrase “Russian aggression” and had not signed off on a plan to allow Zelenskyy to address G7 leaders by video.Meanwhile, the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the White House could be willing to lift sanctions on Russia, or increase them, depending on Moscow’s readiness to negotiate. Bessent visited Kyiv this week, presenting Zelenskyy with the demand for minerals and saying it was “payback” for previous US military assistance.Bessent said he had received assurances Ukraine would sign the deal. On Wednesday, however, Zelenskyy said the US had provided $69.2bn in assistance under the Biden administration – far less than the figure the new White House is demanding. He said an agreement depended on the US giving security guarantees for a postwar settlement.European leaders have offered support to Ukraine,including Britain’s Keir Starmer and France’s Emmanuel Macron. Zelenskyy said he spoke on Thursday to Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen. “We deeply appreciate Denmark’s clear stance on a true peace – the peace we all strive for, that must be securely guaranteed,” he wrote on social media.The Kremlin has reacted with jubilation to Trump’s unprecedented attacks on Ukraine and to hisfalse claimZelenskyy has a 4% popularity rating. The actual figure is 57%, according to the latest opinion polls. “The rhetoric of Zelenskyy and many representatives of the Kyiv regime leaves much to be desired,” Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said.Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said he was stunned at how quickly Trump’s stance on Ukraine had evolved. “‘A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,” Medvedev posted on X.He added in English: “If you’d told me just three months ago that these were the words of the US president, I would have laughed out loud. Trump is 200 percent right.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineTrump administrationRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyUS foreign policyEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

You’ve got to talk to everybody involved in the fighting.”The remarks landed well at a transformed Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where establishment Republicans that once dominated the stage have been replaced by nationalist figures including Steve Bannon, Britain’s Nigel Farage, and the tech billionaire and “department of government efficiency” operatorElon Musk.The conference’s shift over the years mirrors the broader changes in Republican politics since Trump’s first nomination – at the 2016 event, Trump finished third in the conference’s straw poll with just 15%, behind Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.This year, thousands of conservatives near and far have flocked toCPAC, many donning “Make America great again” (Maga) apparel and America-centric costumes, including a Statue of Liberty outfit and flag shirts.The nationalist vibe at CPAC was further reflected by the presence of prominent European rightwing and Trump-friendly figures, including András László, a Hungarian member of the European parliament and president of the Patriots for Europe foundation.Speaking to the Guardian on the sidelines of the conference, László defended the Trump administration’s existential stance on European politics.“We need to have honest discussions, even if they are difficult to have,” László said, echoing Vance’s criticisms of European speech restrictions. “What are we fighting for? Sovereignty and democracy for Ukraine if we don’t practice it at home? We need to stop stifling freedom of speech, have more discussion, even if sometimes that might be painful for some people.”His organization, which launched last year and is now the third-largest group in the European parliament, with 86 members from 13 states, has been gaining influence across the continent, reflecting the same nationalist currents reshaping American conservatism.The conferencealso drew Liz Truss, Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister, who crashed the UK economy with tax cuts for the wealthy before resigning after just 49 days in office. Reinventing herself as a rightwing populist, Truss used her CPAC platform to claim her political failures were actually the fault of shadowy elites.“The British state is now failing, is not working. The decisions are not being made by politicians,” Truss said, claiming her country was controlled by a “deep state” while calling for a British version of Trump’s movement. “We want to have a British CPAC.”Hours before his appearance at CPAC, Vance had posted alengthy critiqueof traditional US and European foreign policy writ-large on X, dismissing concerns about the administration’s stance on Ukraine as “moralistic garbage” and defending its push for peace negotiations.“President[Donald] Trumpand I have made two simple arguments: first, the war wouldn’t have started if President Trump was in office; second, that neither Europe, nor the Biden administration, nor the Ukrainians had any pathway to victory,” Vance wrote.Vance got more specific on the CPAC stage, suggesting that the US’s military commitment to European allies could be contingent on their domestic policies, particularly targetingGermany.“Germany’s entire defence is subsidised by the American taxpayer. There are thousands upon thousands of American troops in Germany today,” he said. “Do you think the American taxpayer is going to stand for that if you get thrown in jail for posting a mean tweet?”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationJD VanceDonald TrumpUS politicsCPACUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

But it did not come out of nowhere.The US president has left the already badly frayed western alliance in disarray with adevastating social media attackon his Ukrainian counterpart, just hours after he had alreadyimplicitly blamed Kyivfor Russia’s invasion.After much of what he said appeared to echo Kremlin talking points, including falsehoods about Zelenskyy’s popularity being at 4% (a recent poll put it at 57%), Ukraine’s president attributed it to Trump being trapped in a Russian“disinformation bubble”.Vance poses immigrants as ‘greatest threat’ to US and Europe in CPAC speechRead moreIn fact, Trump may be the author of his own misconceptions aboutUkraine– or at least responsible for having built the bubble himself, by surrounding himself with prominent figures who have often seemed to echo the Russian line.A year before he left European leaders mortified at last week’sMunich security conferenceby accusing them of threatening their own democracies with supposed free speech restrictions,JD Vance– now Trump’s vice-president – was already questioning military support for Ukraine.“How long is this expected to go on? How much is it expected to cost?” hesaid, complaining of a “lack of strategic clarity” in US and allied goals.It was one of Vance’s milder comments. Last year helabelled Zelenskyy “disgraceful”when he visited Washington last year to lobby Congress for military aid, and days before Russia’s invasion in February 2022 he told Trump’s former aide Steve Bannon he did not “really carewhat happens to Ukraine, one way or the other”.As stories emerged of Russian atrocities, he doubled down, telling Bannon: “I don’t care enough about what’s going on over there that I’m going to step in, get a bunch of our citizens killed and pour more and more money into the war sinkhole.”Other members of Trump’s inner circle long associated with a pro-Russian viewpoint also include Tulsi Gabbard, newly confirmed as director of national intelligence, and Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who remains one of the president’s most influential backers.Gabbard has been accused ofparroting Kremlintalking points and was challenged on the subject at her recent Senate confirmation hearings – particularly her decision to blame the Russian invasion on Ukraine, as Trump has now done.“This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden admin/Nato had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns,” she wrote, as Russian missiles struck Ukrainian cities.Carlson, meanwhile, conducted aface-to-face interviewwith Vladimir Putin last year as the war raged, which some commentators said the Russian leader used to broadcast a message to Trump and other US conservatives. Carlson was ridiculed for a Pravda-esque video segment praising Russian supermarkets for having coin-operated shopping trolleys, which all western supermarkets have had for decades.In fact when Pete Hegseth, Trump’s new defence secretary, gave a speech shortly after Vance’s in which he said the US would no longer be “primarily focused” on European security and that Ukraine would never be allowed to join Nato – appearing to simply hand Russia key concessions in the negotiations over ending the war without getting anything in return – he was condemned by the Republican senator Roger Wicker, chair of the Senate’s powerful armed services committee.“I don’t know who wrote the speech – it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool,” Wicker said.But Wicker – and recently Mike Pence, Trump’s former vice-president, who wrote on social media, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war” – are rare Republican voices of dissent. The Reaganite hawks from Trump’s first term such as Pence, Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger, who might have advised a US president to hold the line against Russian expansionism into Europe, have been purged.Regardless, Trump may need little outside prompting to feel friendly towards Russia, or Putin, for whom he has long displayed personal admiration. Russian interference on Trump’s behalf during his victorious 2016 presidential election campaign against Hillary Clinton was well-documented by the US intelligence community – and Trump has since developed a hatred of those agencies such as the FBI and CIA, who pointed it out.View image in fullscreenTrump meets Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, in Helsinki in 2018.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersIn particular, an inquiry conducted by thespecial counsel, Robert Mueller, into alleged collusion between the campaign and Russia, was bitterly resented by Trump, who denounced the allegations as a “hoax”.And in 2019 Trump attempted to pressure Zelenskyy to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and the business interests of his son, Hunter, in Ukraine, in return for US military assistance – an apparently clear abuse of presidential power for Trump’s personal political gain, and which led to his first impeachment.What’s more, his new righthand man Elon Musk, who supported Ukraine with Starlink satellite service to help repel Russia’s invasion,tangled with Zelenskyyin 2022 after suggesting Ukraine abandon Crimea permanently to Russia and drop its ambitions to join Nato. In recent days, Musk has targeted Zelenskyy on social media in personal terms – perhaps providing the inspiration for Trump’s dismissal of the Ukrainian president as “a modestly successful comedian”.Yet the causes of Trump’s latest breach with Zelenskyy are equally likely to be immediate and devoid of outside influences, saidCharles Kupchan, a fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations.“Part of it is Mr Trump’s thin skin and his response to what he sees as criticism,” said Kupchan, a member of the White House national security staff in the Obama and Clinton administrations.“I think he sees himself as going out and trying to help Europe and help Ukraine – and instead, he’s been met with a wave of criticism. And I see his calling Zelenskyy a dictator, blaming him for starting the war, as a kind of impulsive, angry response.”Kupchan believes that given Trump’s whims, the relationship could be suddenly repaired under pressure of self-interest.“Trump’s relationship with leaders blows hot and cold. He’s had good meetings with Zelenskyy,” he said. “If you look at Trump’s history, one day he’s good buddies with Macron and then they fall out. I don’t think there is an enduring nature to Trump’s relationships with foreign heads. It’s very much: what have you done for me today?“At the end of the day, Trump wants a deal to end the war. If he’s going to get that, he needs a working relationship with Zelenskyy … If Trump goes over the heads of Zelenskyy and European allies, to cut some kind of deal with Putin, it will not stick.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpRussiaEuropeUS politicsUkraineUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

InFrance, our moral compass is not guided by north or south, but by justice. We do not avert our eyes from any crisis or violation of international law. A country under attack is a country under attack, and an aggressor country is an aggressor country – this distinction does not change based on whether the country is in the north or the south.“That is why France at once condemns violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza and the West Bank, the 7 October terrorist attacks against Israel, the war of aggression led byRussiaagainst Ukraine, and the atrocities perpetrated by the Sudanese armed forces and the RSF in Sudan. That is why it is fully committed to maintaining the ceasefire in Lebanon, after working towards its adoption alongside the United States.”Thursday’s meeting of foreign ministers from the G20 – an intergovernmental forum comprising 19 sovereign countries, the European Union, and the African Union – will not be attended by the Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, in a sign of the Trump’s administration’s antipathy towards multilateral institutions. Instead the US is sending a relatively junior diplomat.Rubio said he was not attending due to what he described as the G20’s anti-American agenda. He told the press: “My job is to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism. I think the whole topic of the G20 gathering is one that I don’t think we should be focused on, talking about global inclusion, equity, and these sorts of things.”The US has also declined to send Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, to a meeting of G20 finance ministers next week. Bessent said on X that he would not participate in the event because of obligations in Washington.Barrot said the task of the G20 was to strengthen international law, including through a reform of global governance.He said: “Every second we waste on the path to multilateralism reform fuels claims its institutions are illegitimate. France would like to see crucial projects for the future of peace and global governance to be completed between now and 2026, when our country will hold the presidency of the G7.”David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, is also expected to focus on Ukraine in his remarks, as well calling for stability in the Middle East and action on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Explore more on these topicsG20FranceUkraineRussiaDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Mi like mi coffè very importante,” the first verse begins.He goes on to sing: “Mi money numeroso, I work around the clocko. That’s why I’m sweating like a mafioso,” and: “Life is like spaghetti, it’s hard until you make it.”Cash won the Eesti Laul, Estonia’s Eurovision selection process, on Saturday and will represent the country in the contest in Basel in May – unless Italy gets its way.Codacons, a consumer association, has lodged an appeal to the European Broadcasting Union questioning whether “it’s appropriate to allow a song that offends a country and an entire community” to be part of the competition.“Notwithstanding the freedom of artistic expression that must characterise events such as Eurovision, we cannot help but raise doubts about the inclusion of a song that is offensive to a plurality of individuals in a competition followed by audiences all over the world,” Codacons said in a statement.“Indignation has been expressed by numerous citizens [over a song] whose lyrics contain stereotypes aboutItalyand Italians – the usual cliches of coffee and spaghetti, but above all the mafia and the ostentation of luxury, which conveys a message of a population tied to organised crime.”Gian Marco Centinaio, a senator with the far-right League, has produced aparty flyerfeaturing a screenshot of Cash drinking coffee from a paper cup in the video for the song and the caption “whoever insults Italy must stay out of Eurovision”.Centinaio wrote on Instagram: “This singer should come to Italy to see how good people work before writing such stupid songs full of stereotypes.”However, the indignation appeared to be outweighed by bemusement and appreciation by Italians who commented beneath the song’s video onYouTube. “I will vote for Estonia!” wrote one.Repeating some of the lyrics, another wrote: “‘No stresso, no stresso, don’t need to be depresso’ – as an Italian, I think I’m going to get this tattooed.”Another wrote: “As an Italian I am amused but also confused but also offended but also honoured.”Others said the song was better than Italy’s potential entry for Eurovision, a ballad by the singer Olly that won last week’s Sanremo music festival.The festival usually determines who represents Italy at Eurovision, although winners can then decide if they want to participate. Olly is keeping Italy on tenterhooks, saying on Wednesday that he needed time to rest and to make a decision “with a clear mind” as he was still processing his Sanremo victory.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionItalyEstoniaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

No injuries were reported.The explosions on Thursday happened on a day when Israel was grieving afterHamas returned the bodies of four hostages from Gazaas part of a ceasefire deal. The bus explosions were reminiscent of bombings during the Palestinian uprising of the 2000s, but such attacks are now rare.Explosives were found on two other buses but did not detonate, police spokesperson Asi Aharoni told Channel 13 TV. Israeli police said the five bombs were identical and equipped with timers, and bomb squads were defusing the unexploded bombs.Investigators in white coveralls searched for evidence inside the burned-out metal shells of the buses, which blew up in a parking lot in Bat Yam, a city outside Tel Aviv.The city’s mayor, Tzvika Brot, said it was a miracle no one was hurt. The buses had been parked after finishing their routes, he said.Defence minister Israel Katz accused “Palestinian terrorist organisations” of carrying out the blasts.“Preliminary report – suspected terror attack. Multiple reports have been received of explosions involving several buses at different locations in Bat Yam,” the police said in a statement.The head of the bus company, Ofir Karni, said they immediately ordered all bus drivers to stop and conduct a “thorough inspection”. They resumed their routes once they were found to be safe.Netanyahu’s office said he was receiving updates from his military secretary. The Shin Bet internal security agency was taking over the investigation, police said.“We need to determine if a single suspect placed explosives on a number of buses, or if there were multiple suspects,” police spokesperson Haim Sargrof told Israeli TV.Sargrof said the explosives used on Thursday matched explosives used in the West Bank, but he declined to elaborate.The Israeli military said early on Friday it had imposed restrictions on Palestinian movement and sealed off parts of the West Bank amid its ongoing security operations there.Israel’s military has repeatedlycarried out raids on suspected Palestinian militants in the West Banksince Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attack sparked the devastating war in Gaza. As part of that crackdown, Israel has greatly restricted entry into Israel for Palestinians from the occupied territory.A group identifying itself as a branch of Hamas’ military wing, the Qassam Brigades, from the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem, posted on the messaging app Telegram: “We will never forget to take vengeance for our martyrs as long as the occupation is on our lands.” The group did not claim responsibility for the attack.Tulkarem and two refugee camps in the city have been a focus of Israel’s broad military offensive in the West Bank, since the ceasefire in Gaza took effect on 19 Jan. In the past, militants have entered Israel and carried out shootings and bombings in Israeli cities.Brot urged residents to stick with their routines but also stay vigilant, telling Channel 13 TV that schools will be open Friday and public transport will be operating.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Mahmoud Muna – who co-edited the book Daybreak inGazawith Teller – and his nephew, Ahmed Muna, were arrested and held in detention before being released under a five-day house arrest.“We are concerned by recent press reports on the police raid of an educational bookshop in a country which is governed by a parliamentary democracy”, read theSoA’s statement, published on 13 February.Teller said he would have hoped the SoA “would have taken this opportunity to illuminate the evils of state censorship and defend those who seek to practise freedom. Instead, it obscured understanding of the issues with platitudes and irrelevant assertions. It was an abject failure.“I wholeheartedly support writers who are able to remain engaged with the SoA, and I recognise the value in urgent ongoing efforts to force change, but I, regretfully, can no longer tolerate such equivocation from a trade union that purports to represent me,” Teller said.A representative from the SoA said the organisation “is saddened when any of our members decide to leave us”, but that “on this occasion, the SoA did not have enough information to comment on the situation concerning the bookshop in Jerusalem. Nevertheless, we considered that recent press reports provided an opportunity to the SoA to remind our members of its position on book bans.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

However, the charge was changed to “disturbing public order”, according to the booksellers’ lawyer.The family-run Educational Bookshop opened in 1984 and has since become a hub of cultural life in Jerusalem, well-known among academics, journalists and tourists. After the raid, dozens of protestersgathered outside court, andat least ninediplomats from the UK and other European countries attended the hearing on 10 February.More than £30,000 has since been raised via aGoFundMe campaignin support of the Educational Bookshop organised by the London-based Saqi Books, which publishes Daybreak in Gaza. Funds will go towards replacing books that were seized, fixing damages and paying booksellers until Mahmoud and Ahmed are allowed to return to work, as one of the terms of their 11 February release was that they must not return to bookselling for a minimum of 20 days.Alongside fellow independent publisher Pluto Press, Saqi Books is also launching #BooksellingIsNotACrime Day on Saturday, with booksellers invited to put on events, donate a percentage of their profits to the fundraiser or create displays of Palestinian literature.The group Fossil Free Books (FFB), which campaigns for “a genocide free, fossil free books industry”described the SoA’s statementas a “non-statement” of the kind that “does not challenge assaults on freedom of speech” but “confirms them”.However, FFB recommended “staying engaged” with the SoA, suggesting that all authors, illustrators and translators join it, “not because it is currently the union we need”, but to “use its democratic structures to transform it into the union we deserve.”Explore more on these topicsBooksFossil Free BooksGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBooksellersSociety of AuthorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The body remains unidentified, the military said.ArmedHamasmilitants wearing black and camouflage placed four black coffins on a stage in a cemetery in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis before giving them to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) amid growing international criticism of the group’s highly choreographed handover ceremonies.View image in fullscreenA poster of Oded Lifshitz calling for his return to Israel when it was still believed he was alive.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe ICRC, which is mandated to maintain impartiality, issued an unusual statement after the bodies were returned to Israel, saying the transfer should not have been public.“These operations should be done privately out of the utmost respect for the deceased and for those left grieving. We have been unequivocal: every release – whether of the living or the deceased – must be conducted with dignity and privacy,” the organisation said. The United Nations said the staging was “abhorrent and cruel” and “flies in the face of international law”.The Israeli army held a ceremony attended by a rabbi upon receiving the bodies, and then transferred them to caskets draped in the Israeli flag before they were driven to Tel Aviv.The transfer of the four bodies marks the first release of bodies in the fragile month-old ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. In its first stage, which expires in early March, 33 living and dead Israeli hostages and soldiers are supposed to be exchanged for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Bibas and her children – who Hamas claims were killed in an Israeli airstrike in the early days of the war – became an indelible symbol of the attack of 7 October 2023. Without Israeli confirmation of their deaths, relatives clung to hope, marking Kfir’s first and second birthdays and his brother’s fifth. Shiri Bibas’s parents were killed in the Hamas offensive, and her husband, Yarden, was taken captive andreleased earlier this month.Lifshitz, a peace activist and retired journalist, had not previously been confirmed as dead.His wife, Yocheved Lifshitz, was released by Hamas in November 2023.0:50Hamas releases bodies of four Israeli hostages from Gaza – videoThe sombre mood across Israel on Thursday contrasted with the sense of joy and relief that has accompanied the recent return of living hostages.Israelis lined the road in the rain near theGazaborder to pay their respects as the convoy carrying the coffins drove by. In Tel Aviv, people gathered, some cyring, at what has come to be known as Hostages Square outside Israel’s defence headquarters.“This is one of the hardest days, I think, since 7 October,” said Tania Coen Uzzielli, 59, a museum manager, who had gathered in the square with about 100 others. “I think the feeling of personal guilt is something each of us carries – that maybe we could have done more, that maybe we didn’t do enough to prevent this tragedy.”View image in fullscreenPeople gathered at Hostages Square carrying Israeli flags with yellow ribbons to symbolise their demand for the release of the remaining hostages.Photograph: Mostafa Alkharouf//Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn a statement, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said: “The hearts of an entire nation lie in tatters.“On behalf of the state of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely,” he said.Lifshitz’s son, Yizhar, told Israel’s Army Radio: “The release of my father … is part of the terrible tragedy of those who went in alive and were murdered inside. To the people who prayed for my father and wanted a different end [I say]: continue. There are still a lot of living people inside whom we need to pray and work for.”Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, said: “I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Oded Lifshitz after he was taken hostage by terrorists in Gaza, and I extend my heartfelt condolences to his daughter Sharone and his wife Yocheved.“When I met Sharone in Downing Street, she showed remarkable strength in the face of the most difficult circumstances. The news of her father’s death is a tragedy. It is my hope that the peace he worked to see in the region through his charity work and activism will be achieved.“My thoughts are also with the Bibas family, who have faced immense pain as they awaited news of Shiri and her sons Kfir and Ariel.“We must see all remaining hostages released, and the ceasefire upheld.

Amid fears over the ceasefire’s future after a near-collapse last week, the Palestinian groupsaid on Wednesdayit was ready to release all of the remaining hostages in a single exchange if the truce agreement moved forward to a second phase next month.The offer came as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, signalled his readiness to talk about a second phase after an extended delay, by appointing one of his closest advisers, Ron Dermer, a US-born cabinet minister and former ambassador to Washington, to lead the Israeli delegation.Netanyahu has long resisted any talk about the second phase, which would involve a complete military withdrawal from Gaza and effectively end the war. Much of his far-right coalition government opposes such a step if it leaves Hamas as a significant force inside the strip.About 48,000 people have been killed in Israel’s war in Gaza, which has caused a devastating humanitarian crisis and levelled much of the territory to rubble. About 1,200 people were killed in the 7 October attack, and 250 taken hostage.With agenciesExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It received about a quarter of the cargoes.There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by western companies, nor that they were aware that their products were being moved on to Russia by the Indian firms.The direct sale of aircraft parts to Russian airlines and firms has been banned by the UK and the EU and is heavily restricted by US authorities.Western allies have struggled, however, to deal with the scores of intermediary firms that have moved in to prop up Russia with western-made goods and technology.The UK government highlighted its concerns in January when issuingnew guidancefor exporting businesses on “countering Russian sanctions evasion”. Firms were told to “undertake due diligence to ensure that the end destination of these products is not Russia”.Moscow importing western aircraft tyres despite ban, says Ukraine agencyRead moreThe analysis of Indian customs databy Investigate Europesuggests that as of last September goods were still reaching Russia via India, often within days of their original dispatch.A dozen Indian intermediaries appeared to have acquired parts from western firms that later went to Russian buyers between January 2023 and September 2024.Two UK companies accounted for about 120 of the shipments identified in the customs data.Step Aviation is registered to a Latvian national. Of the more than 60 cargoes worth over $3m that Step appears to have sent to Indian firm Shaurya Aeronautics, almost all were passed on to three buyers in Russia.In October, the US applied economic sanctions on Shaurya for sending sensitive dual-use parts to Russia, part of a wave of action “to diminish and degrade Russia’s ability to equip its war machine”.Shaurya has not been targeted with sanctions from the UK or EU. There is no record of Step sending items to Shaurya after October. Step did not respond to a request for comment.A second firm, ASL Aerospace, based in Devon, appears to have sent about 60 shipments from the UK and US to four Indian firms that were then re-exported to Russia.ASL Aerospace sent cargo from the UK to the Indian firm, Agrim Aviation Private Ltd, which arrived in September, according to the customs data.Agrim was named and placed under sanctions by the US authorities on 1 November for “likely” diverting US-made products to the Russian aviation industry. It has not been targeted by the UK or the EU.There is no suggestion that ASL Aerospace traded with Agrim after the Indian firm was added to the US “entity list”, placing it under stricter export controls.Bryan Poulier, chief executive of ASL Aerospace, said his company would not be “complicit in the trade of aircraft parts to Russia through any sanctioned company” and that they made strenuous efforts to track their products.He said: “ASL Aerospace takes stringent measures in its supply chain to prevent such trade to sanctioned parties including, but not limited to: subscription and monitoring through Creditsafe’s [Politically Exposed Persons] and Sanctions Screening tools, which provide real-time checks with its obligations; and the requirement, for every sale by ASL Aerospace, of an end user statement. The EUS verifies end use, ensures compliance with export regulations, prevents misuse and limits the supplier’s liability.”Airbus and Boeing to halt supply of aircraft parts to Russian airlinesRead moreDavid Tannenbaum, a sanctions compliance expert and partner Pole Star Global, said western governments had targeted intermediaries in Turkey and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan but that India had not been a major focus.Tannenbaum said: “It’s been a game of whack-a-mole for [the authorities]. They seem to be using sanctions primarily to try and sort of target the intermediaries but those entities are replaceable, right? It’s not even that the companies are [always] newly created.”Customs data suggest that since 2023 the US aerospace giant Boeing sent at least 80 cargoes to India that were later re-exported in part or in whole to Russia.Most of these trades, including fasteners, valves, fuel sealants and a battery, went via an Indian buyer, Ascend Aviation.The US applied economic sanctions on the company and its two directors on 30 October 2024 for being part of “sanctions evasion networks”. The EU and the UK have not followed suit. There is no data to suggest that Boeing traded with the company after September 2024.A Boeing spokesperson said: “In March 2022, we suspended major operations in Russia, including providing parts, maintenance and technical support for customers.”The customs data also suggest that Airbus subsidiary Satair sent 12 cargoes to the same Indian firm between September 2023 and May 2024. All later went to Russian buyers, including the country’s biggest airline, state-owned Aeroflot, the records show.An Airbus spokesperson said: “Airbus and Satair are acting in compliance with the laws and regulations and are actively committed to prevent sanctions circumvention and diversion”.India has refrained from condemning Vladimir Putin over Russia’s full scale invasion ofUkraine, and has sought a friendly relationship with Moscow. None of the Indian companies responded to a request for comment.An Indian government spokesperson has said they do not believe the firms were in violation of local legislation but that the companies would be advised about the latest international export controls.Explore more on these topicsRussiaAerospace industryBoeingAirline industryIndiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There were 477 stolen last week – they cost £4.50 each.”View image in fullscreenManeki-neko are seen as a symbol of good luck in Japanese culture.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThis amount would mean the chef lost a total of £2,146.50 during one week.The City of London police said it had not received any reports of theft from the restaurant.The maneki-neko figurines are believed by some within Japanese culture to bring good luck and have been a feature in the Lucky Cat restaurants.Reflecting on his empire of more than 80 restaurants globally, Ramsay said: “It does get a bit scary, in terms of how big it is and the global impact.“The team are incredible and there are some amazing chefs throughout.“Opening, in 1998, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, I would never have thought it would be here today – this year we celebrated 24 years at three star Michelin.”Ramsay also told Ross that his daughter Holly Ramsay, 25, and Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty are planning a “Christmas wedding”.Peaty, 30, did not seek his permission but did talk to him about the engagement. “He said ‘Holly is just the perfect woman. I’d like to get your blessing – from you and Tana for her hand in marriage’. It was that sort of amazing moment. Everything went quiet.

He subsequently became unwell and was pronounced dead at 1.53pm.An investigation has begun into his death, with the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) carrying out independent inquiries into the incident.The man’s family were being supported by specialist officers and updated on the progress of the investigation.An IOPC spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we are independently investigating the circumstances of a 27-year-old man’s death following his arrest by Border Force officers at Manchester airport on Wednesday 19 February.“Our investigation follows a referral from the Home Office which detailed how the man was due to travel from the airport on Wednesday and was stopped after displaying unusual behaviour.“He was subsequently arrested by officers and taken to a holding area where he became unwell and paramedics were called. Sadly, he was pronounced dead at 1.53pm.“After being notified of the man’s death, we declared an independent investigation into the circumstances at 4.29pm on Wednesday. IOPC investigators were sent to the scene to begin gathering evidence.”The IOPC’s director, Amanda Rowe, said: “First and foremost, our thoughts are with the man’s family and loved ones, as well as all those affected by his death.“When someone dies after being taken into custody, it is important for there to be a thorough investigation to understand what has happened.“We have been in touch with the man’s family to explain our role and will keep them updated as the investigation progresses.

Nearly a year ago, another jury convicted him of misdemeanor reckless endangerment but could not reach agreement on the murder charge and a charge of official misconduct. With the support of Glass’s family, prosecutors decided to try him again for second-degree murder. Jurors also had the option of convicting him on lesser charges.A second officer indicted in Glass’s death pleaded guilty previously to a misdemeanor. Charges against two other officers from the state’s gaming division were dropped in December. A judge ruled that they were not covered by aColoradolaw that makes it a crime for officers to fail to intervene to stop a fellow officer from using excessive force.After his SUV got stuck, Glass told a 911 dispatcher he was being followed. He also made other statements suggesting he was paranoid, hallucinating or delusional and experiencing a mental health crisis, according to Buen’s indictment.When Buen and other officers arrived, Glass refused to get out. Video footage from officers’ body cameras showed Glass making heart shapes with his hands to the officers.The officers fired bean bag rounds and shocked Glass with a Taser, but that failed to make him exit the car. He then took a knife he had offered to surrender at the beginning of the encounter and flung it out a rear window, which had been broken by a bean bag, toward an officer, according to the indictment. At that point, Buen fired five times at Glass.“Lord hear me, Lord hear me,” Glass was heard saying moments before he was shot.Sally Glass said her son had depression and was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. She said he was “having a mental health episode” during his interaction with the police.The $19m settlement reached in 2023 was the largest in state history for a death involving the police. Clear Creek county, where Glass was shot, agreed to establish a crisis response team and for its sheriff’s office to train and certify all deputies in crisis intervention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The program focuses on encouraging officers to intervene if they think a fellow officer is going too far or needs to step away from an incident.“Speak up and say something, and stop the onslaught,” Simon Glass, the victim’s father, said in a previous interview. “None of them did what they should have done that night, and if they had, he’d be alive.”Since 2005, there have been 205 cases of non-federal law enforcement officers being arrested for murder or manslaughter resulting from on-duty shootings, according to a database compiled by Stinson at Bowling Green State University.Of those, 68 were convicted of a crime and 42 are pending.Nine were sentenced for murder with sentences ranging from 81 months to life in prison, with an average sentence of 18 years, Stinson and his fellow researchers found.Convictions are rare because jurors are reluctant to second-guess the split-second decisions of officers in potentially violent encounters, Stinson said. That has not changed in recent years despite increased use of police body cameras and more attention from the public.“I would have predicted a decade ago we’d see more convictions,” Stinson said. “But what we’re seeing is business as usual in law enforcement. Policing does not change quickly.”Explore more on these topicsColoradoUS policingUS crimeMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The agency’s work is the wellspring of scientific advancement in the US, and helped make the country a dominant force in health and science.“They will have drastic effects on all of us – this is not hyperbole, this is fact,” said Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors and an anthropologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey.The orders “will kill”, Wolfson said, as advances in the treatment of diseases as diverse as cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes are delayed.“Donald TrumpandElon Muskare taking a sledgehammer to the greatest biomedical infrastructure in the world to extend tax cuts,” Wolfson said.Trump appears to agree to cut checks to Americans to share portion of savings from Doge cost-cuttingRead moreNIH-funded basic or applied research has also contributed to386 of the 387drugs the Food and Drug Administration approved between 2000 and 2019, and more than100 Nobel prizeshave been awarded to scientists based on NIH-funded work. NIH grants often fund basic research conducted at universities and colleges across the country, touching every state and nearly every congressional district.Since taking office, the Trump administration has issued a bevy ofexecutive ordersand administrative actions that seek to fundamentally alter American health and science agencies – from appointing the nation’s foremost vaccine critic to head the Department of Health and Human Services to scrubbing websites of information the administration finds objectionable.Trump’s executive orders prohibit grant funding containing along list of wordsassociated with “diversity, equity and inclusion”; attempt tocut scientific research fundingby $4bn;fired thousandsof employees and stopped recruitment; imposedcommunications blackouts; and blocked committees from meeting to evaluate new scientific research, effectively freezing funds.Together, those orders have sown a sense of chaos and fear throughout the agency and academia, even as many are tied up incourt battles.That has left the most severe proposal, a 15% cap on “indirect costs”, hanging like thesword of Damoclesover scientific research – forcing institutions to impose sweeping spending freezes and casting the future of whole labs into doubt.“I have to decide as a professor whether to take new students into my lab, and I don’t know if I can afford them,” said Rutgers University biochemist and professor Annika Barber.Barber added that she was supposed to spend her Thursday afternoon reviewing grant proposals for the NIH at a legally mandated review committee. The meeting was canceled with less than 24 hours notice as theTrump administrationhas put a hold on submissions to the Federal Register, a legal requirement for upcoming meetings.“As of today, there are no NIH study sections going forward, which means we are not funding the grants scored last fall and not funding the grants meant to be scored this spring,” she said. “That means there is a six-month funding gap … That is going to close small labs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The group has brought together unions representing professors, scientists such as Chatelaine and health workers to fight the cuts.“We will fight them in the courts – we will talk to our elected leaders and we will fight them in the streets,” said Wolfson. “That’s a guarantee.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs or the federal workforce, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMedical researchHealthDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He worked in Minneapolis public schools to help prevent STIs and unintended pregnancies by educating students, testing and counseling patients in clinics, and tracking STI rates and trends.All of these layoffs are “a major hit to America’s health infrastructure”, said Guthrie, who had an outstanding performance review so was stunned to see his performance listed as the reason for termination.While all of the public health fellows were told they were being laid off, some never received letters, Guthrie said, adding: “The whole process has been dominated by chaos and confusion.”The state, tribal, local and territorial departments where they were deployed “are already starting to feel the effect of our absence”, Guthrie said.“For some of my colleagues, they are filling gaps at host sites that would simply not get filled otherwise,” he said. “These organizations simply don’t have the funds to hire people.”When one CDC employee attempted to log into their laptop on Wednesday morning, they received an error message and realized they were locked out of the system, unable to communicate with their team or even say goodbye. They’d been laid off overnight and because they have not yet received a letter, they don’t know the reason for their termination. This employee had years of experience and excellent performance reviews, and was not probationary.Employees in probationary periods were especially hard-hit in this round of layoffs. That status has nothing to do with their performance, unlike employees who may be put on probation in the private sector. Rather, it usually means they have been in their current position for less than two years, and thus they don’t have the same legal protections as other federal workers.One terminated employee who has been in the same position for four and a half years was surprised to receive notice that their job was considered probationary and they were being let go, despite high praise on performance reviews. They are appealing the decision to human resources, but have not received responses yet.Form letters sent to terminated employees say that they “are not fit for continued employment” because their “ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency’s current needs”, and their performances have “not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency”.Former CDC employees told the Guardian they are now part of a class-action wrongful termination appeal to the US Merit Systems Protection Board – joining about 2,000 federal employees represented by the Washington law firm James & Hoffman.The leader of the merit board was herself reinstated by a judge on Wednesday after the Trump administration tried to fire her.“If you’re going to terminate my position, don’t tell me it’s because of my performance,” said another employee who worked as a CDC contractor for four years before entering a probationary period after being hired permanently.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Elon Musk at the White House earlier this month.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersEmployees who were locked out of their systems with little or no notice are now scrambling to collect their final paychecks, apply for unemployment, return equipment, and understand their benefits.The longtime employee who was locked out on Wednesday told the Guardian they were not given the proper documentation in order to apply for unemployment.“When I called HR, the team simply did not know what to do and I was left with, ‘Please call back tomorrow, we will have better guidance,’” the employee said. “Folks don’t even have essential documents to properly separate from the agency.”The employees said they haven’t been offered details on whether their annual leave will pay out, or even how long their health insurance will last.“I still need to communicate with my center in terms of what is happening with my final paycheck, how do I return my equipment, and I have no idea how they intend to do that,” said the employee who worked at the CDC for five years.The so-called “department of government efficiency,” known as Doge, has targeted certain agencies for layoffs in a purported bid to cut back on government spending, despite representing a very small portion of the federal budget.“They feel fake,” the employee said. “It seems like a giant scam that they were trying to see if it would work, and it did … I can’t believe that I lost my job as a result of this group of people.”The layoffs cap a stressful month for CDC staffers rushing to implement Trump’s flurry of executive orders.“We were working around the clock. If not working, I couldn’t sleep – for weeks, since the administration came in – thinking of all the things we had to do to meet those orders,” said the employee who was at the CDC for four and a half years.Critics say Trump’s executive orders to reshape the NIH ‘will kill’ AmericansRead moreAll the while, they were waiting to learn if they would keep their job – a “dream job” that has become “a nightmare”.“It was really part of my identity – I lived and ate it around the clock,” the employee said. “That was such a big part of my life … I feel betrayed.”The employee urged former supervisors and teammates to check in on the wellbeing of terminated staffers, some of whom report experiencing depression and anxiety.“All of us have always looked at CDC as being the final goalpost for a public career,” said the longtime employee.“It feels like I worked so hard to be where I’m at, only to look back and see an empty space. I know I did the work, but it’s rapidly being taken away.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs or the federal workforce, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsUS healthcareDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

This year those figures dropped to 41% and 13% respectively.Public confidence in air traffic controllers has also dipped – from 40% of Americans last year to 35% this year.There have been a series of aviation collisions in recent weeks. On 30 January an American Airlines planecollidedwith an army helicopter above the Potomac River in Washington DC, killing all 67 people on both the plane and helicopter. It was the US’s deadliest aviation disaster since 2009 when a Colgan Air plane crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people on board, as well as a person on the ground.The day after the Washington DC collision, a medical transport jet carrying a child patient, her mother and four other peoplecrashedinto a north-east Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven people. Several homes were also engulfed in flames as a result of the crash.On 6 February, a small commuter planecarrying10 people across Alaska’s Norton Sound crashed in the western part of the state, killing all 10 people onboard.Then on Monday a Delta Air Lines jet carrying 80 passengers and crewcrash-landedat Toronto Pearson airport andflipped over. Twenty-one people weretransportedto the hospital following the crash but everyone survived.Delta offers $30,000 to passengers in Canada plane flip – ‘no strings attached’Read moreFollowing the string of crashes there has been a spike in Google searches for “Is it safe to fly,”according tomultiplereports, as well as “How many plane crashes in 2025” and “Why are planes crashing”.The AP-NORC poll was conducted from 6 to 10 February, and surveyed 1,112 adults.On 14 February, theTrump administrationbeganfiring hundreds of employeesat the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), including some who maintain critical air traffic control infrastructure.According to the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists (Pass) union, “several hundred” workers received termination notices that day. They did not include air traffic controllers, but the union said positions terminated included maintenance mechanics, aeronautical information specialists, environmental protection specialists, aviation safety assistants and management administration personnel.The FAA has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAir transportPlane crashesWashington DC plane crashTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

McConnell formally announced his retirement in aSenatefloor speech on Thursday.“Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,” McConnell said.“Every day in between, I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to do their business right here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.”The announcement comes one year after McConnellsaid he wouldstep down as Senate Republican leader after nearly two decades in the post, making him the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history. McConnell became Republican leader in 2007, after first joining the Senate in 1985.“One of life’s most under-appreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,” McConnell said last year. “So I stand before you today … to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.”Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota, has since taken over as head of the conference. McConnell indicated he would still serve out the rest of his term, but his decision to relinquish the leadership role spurred speculation about his potential retirement.Thune praised McConnell’s “remarkable service to the Senate, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and our nation”, saying his predecessor’s legacy would “remain a lasting reflection of his steady vision, determination, and service to the country he loves” in a statement released on Thursday.“Over decades of tireless work, his mastery of Senate procedure, commitment to the institution, and dedication to the rule of law have shaped the course of American governance for generations to come,” Thune said.“His leadership has strengthened the Senate’s role as a deliberative body and delivered historic achievements, from advancing the judiciary to championing Kentucky’s interests.”But McConnell’s “mastery of Senate procedure” has stoked severe censure fromDemocrats, who accused him of exploiting chamber rules to advance his political agenda. That criticism reached a fever pitch in 2016, when McConnell relied on Republicans’ Senate majority to block Barack Obama’s supreme court nominee, Merrick Garland, from receiving a hearing.At the time, McConnell argued it would be inappropriate to consider a nominee to a lifetime appointment in a presidential election year. And yet, when liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died less than two months before the 2020 presidential election, McConnell did not hesitate to fill her seat with Donald Trump’s nominee.In his 2020 memoir A Promised Land, Obama described McConnell as a shrewd tactician who used every tool at his disposal to paint the Democratic president’s proposals as “partisan, controversial, radical – even illegitimate”.“Short, owlish, with a smooth Kentucky accent, McConnell seemed an unlikely Republican leader. He showed no aptitude for schmoozing, backslapping, or rousing oratory,” Obamawrotein his memoir. “But what McConnell lacked in charisma or interest in policy he more than made up for in discipline, shrewdness, and shamelessness – all of which he employed in the single-minded and dispassionate pursuit of power.”In recent weeks, McConnell has appeared more willing to directly challenge Trump, sparking intense criticism from the president. McConnell has repeatedly voted against Trump’s most controversial cabinet picks – includingRobert F Kennedy Jr, the new secretary of health and human services, andPete Hegseth, the secretary of defense – anddenouncedthe president’s pardons of January 6 insurrectionists.“No one should excuse violence – and particularly violence against police officers,” McConnell said of the pardons.Trump has returned the fire,suggestingMcConnell had stepped down as Republican leader because he was “not equipped mentally” for the job and accusing him of letting the party “go to hell”.In the remarks on Thursday, McConnell indicated he would not change his ways and would instead use his final months in office to send a message about America’s place on the global stage.“Thanks to Ronald Reagan’s determination, the work of strengthening America’s hard power was well under way when I arrived in the Senate,” McConnell said.“But since then, we’ve allowed that power to atrophy. And today, a dangerous world threatens to outpace the work of rebuilding it. So, lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term: I have some unfinished business to attend to.”McConnell’s Senate seat is expected to remain in Republican hands, as he won his last re-election in 2020 by roughly 20 points. Daniel Cameron, the former Kentucky attorney general who lost a gubernatorial race in 2023, hasalready indicatedhe will campaign for the seat, and the representative Andy Barrsaidhe also might seek the Republican nomination.Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky who was re-elected in 2023, will almost certainly face pressure to enter the race. But even thewidely populargovernor would face an uphill climb to win the seat, as Republicans have held both of Kentucky’s Senate seats since 1999.Explore more on these topicsMitch McConnellUS SenateRepublicansUS politicsUS CongressMerrick GarlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The five-week jury trial is scheduled to start on 24 February in Mandan, Morton county.“This case is an emblematic example of a Slapp lawsuit – a way of weaponizing the legal system by wealthy and powerful people to silence their critics by dragging them through long, stressful, expensive litigation where winning is almost irrelevant,” said Kirk Herbertson, a New York attorney and the US director for advocacy and campaigns for EarthRights International.View image in fullscreenKelcy Warren, chair and chief executive officer of Energy Transfer Partners.Photograph: Aaron M Sprecher/Bloomberg via Getty Images“This was not a Greenpeace event. They were not controlling what the people coming in were doing … there is nothing in the court filings that show Energy Transfer suffered actual harm due to actions by Greenpeace,” added Herbertson. “This case feels more like a trophy hunt and an attempt to shut down free speech rather than an actual good faith attempt to seek remedies for harm.”Energy Transfer first filed a Rico lawsuit in 2017 alleging federal racketeering and state tort claims. At the time Kelcy Warren, the company’s billionaire founder and a major donor toDonald Trump, told CNBC that the company was “greatly harmed” by Greenpeace.“Everybody’s afraid of these environmental groups and the fear that if you fight back it may look wrong … but what they did to us is wrong and they’re going to pay for it,”said Warren. Warren has previouslysaidenvironmental activists should be “removed from the gene pool” and a Wall Street Journal profile of himdetailedhis relentless pursuit against green groups.The federal racketeering case was dismissed on 14 February 2019, but seven days later Energy Transfer re-filed a virtually identical suit in North Dakota state court. Energy Transfer is suing three Greenpeace entities, claiming that they are a single organization rather than independent members of the Greenpeace network.After six years and thousands of filings, this will be the first case under the new Trump administration to test what the first amendment will look like.The lawsuit centres around nine statements made by Greenpeace during the Indigenous-led protests – none of which were original to the group, while three were taken from two letters written by another organization, including one with more than 500 signatories. Greenpeace argues that the statements are legitimate expressions of the first amendment protected right to speech.Energy Transfer is also seeking to hold Greenpeace liable for actions taken by protesters that have no proven connection to the group.“Greenpeace is a great big target. If you’re trying to send a message to the world, go after Greenpeace,” said James Wheaton, a longtime journalism law professor at Stanford and UC Berkeley who founded the First Amendment Project. “The pipeline lawsuit is a classic Slapp suit.More than 330,000 individuals and 430+ organizations including Amnesty International, the American Federation of Teachers and Indigenous Environmental Network have signed anopen letterdenouncing the lawsuit as meritless – and an attempt to rewrite history by claiming that Greenpeace orchestrated what was an Indigenous-led movement.We’ve been involved with trial monitoring in places like Cambodia and Ecuador that were easier to monitor than this caseScott Wilson BadenochThe Standing Rock tribe has always asserted that the pipeline is a violation of its sovereignty as it crosses unceded historical and sacred Sioux territorial lands. The tribe wants a federal court to shut down the pipeline,and in October filed a lawsuit accusing the army corps of engineersof unlawfully allowing it to operate without an easement, a complete environmental assessment or sufficient emergency spill response plans.“The tribe was 100% responsible and autonomous in their decision making and how they protested … this Energy Transfer lawsuit is aimed at creating a mortal blow through the legal system to a legacy non-profit that has done some of the most important environmental protection advocacy in US history,” said Scott Wilson Badenoch, a former chair of the American Bar Association’s Environmental Justice Committee and veteran international trial monitor.He added: “It is utterly clear that Slapp suits are bad faith to their very core … the venue choice in this case is obviously part of what makes it a Slapp. The jury pool seems to be impossibly tainted … We’ve been involved with trial monitoring in places like Cambodia and Ecuador that were easier to monitor than this case in the United States of America.”Badenoch is among a team of independent prominent civil rights attorneys and advocates who will monitor the trial amid growing concerns about judicial bias and violations of due process – and the threat posed by the case to free speech and the right to protest.Judge James Gion was assigned to the case from another North Dakota jurisdiction after every single judge in Morton county recused themselves due to conflicts. Yet the judge has denied requests from Greenpeace’s legal team to move the case to a different court due to concerns about potential jury bias. In 2024, 75% of voters in Morton county backed Trump. During his first term, Trump ordered an expedited review of the Dapl project after it was hit with obstacles by the Obama administration.Another concern for the independent committee of observers is the size of the courtroom, which has very limited seating. Gion denied a motion from Greenpeace to livestream proceedings, ruling that this would interfere with Energy Transfer’s “right to a fair trial”. A key pretrial hearing on 4 February was held online without public access. Yet the court in Morton county has previously permitted Court TV to livestream homicide trials. A request by the trial monitoring committee for live streaming was also denied.In recent weeks, mysterious rightwing mailers have arrived at the homes of local residents that Greenpeace alleges could further taint the jury pool. The mailers, made to look like a newspaper and dubbed “Central ND News,” contain articles slanted against the pipeline protest or in favor of Energy Transfer, among stories about immigration and community news. None of the articles have named bylines. A publisher’s note in a January edition similarly is not signed with a name but instead by “Central ND Times Publishers.”View image in fullscreenIndigenous activists protest the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota on 1 December 2016.Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty ImagesThe stories within the mailer slant in favor of fossil fuels. One article in the January edition, next to a chart of gas prices around the state, is an interview of a former protestor who now says she believes the protestors created “a local ecological disaster” and approves of the pipeline. A February edition features a business leader who claims the protests primarily caused “division”.Greenpeace sought to investigate whether the mailers were paid for, directly or indirectly, by Energy Transfer, but the judgedeniedits request for discovery on the issue. Warren, the Energy Transfer CEO, made a donation to a political action committee that then paid a publishing company affiliated with the group behind the mailer, ExxonKnewsreportedin December.The judge has also allowed Energy Transfer to seal thousands of pages of evidence that appear to include details of the pipeline’s safety history. The Standing Rock tribe’s opposition to the pipeline is in part due to the risk posed by leaks in Lake Oahe, the primary source of water for the community. The company, which operates in 44 states, has a chequered environmental health and safety record, and was responsible for the worstpipeline fuel leaks in 2024.On Tuesday, the judge denied all the motions for summary judgments filed by Greenpeace’s attorneys in April 2024, and argued last June. Greenpeace is represented by Davis Wright Tremaine, a firm known for representing first amendment cases.An Energy Transfer spokesperson said: “Our lawsuit against Greenpeace is not about free speech as they are trying to claim. It is about them not following the law. We support the rights of all Americans to express their opinions and lawfully protest. However, when it is not done in accordance with our laws, we have a legal system to deal with that. Beyond that we will let our case speak for itself.”Energy Transfer is represented by Gibson Dunn & Crutcher – the firm that represented Chevron against Steven Donziger, the environmental advocate sued by the firm after helping Amazonian communities in Ecuador win a landmark pollution case. “This appears to be part of a broader strategy by the fossil fuel industry to weaponize the courts against activists and weaken organizations like Greenpeace in retaliation for their advocacy,” said Donziger, a member of the trial monitoring committee.In an era of massive, massive wealth inequality, it’s not that surprising to see a trend of using money to suppress speechShayana “Shane” KadidalThe monitoring team also includes Marty Garbus, who has represented numerous high-profile figures such as Leonard Peltier and Nelson Mandela; Indigenous rights lawyer Natali Segovia of the Water Protector Legal Collective; and Jeanne Mirer, president of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.Slapps and related legal tactics are being increasingly used globally to silence environmental and social justice activists,especially by fossil fuel corporationsand the ultra-wealthy.Warren previously issued aSlapp lawsuitagainst Texas lawmaker Beto O’Rourke after he critiqued Warren’s massive profits during the 2021 Texas winter storm. (The case wasdismissed.) Trump hasfiled almost 4,100 lawsuitsover the past three decades, including seven defamation suits as a private citizen.Climate advocacy groups file two lawsuits against Trump administrationRead more“We are generally used to seeing government as the biggest threat to free speech. But in an era of massive, massive wealth inequality, it’s not that surprising to see a trend of using money to suppress speech and kind of control democratic processes,” said Shayana “Shane” Kadidal, senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.Earlier this month Greenpeace International filed a lawsuit in a Dutch court to recover “all damages and costs it has suffered as a result of ET’s back-to-back, meritless lawsuits”. This is the first test ofa new European lawaimed at curbing malicious lawsuits intended to silence journalists, rights activists and public watchdogs. In the US, two bipartisan efforts to pass federal anti-Slapp legislation have not gone anywhere.“This lawsuit is an attempt to divide the movement, but it has not been successful,” said Deepa Padmanabha, Greenpeace’s senior legal adviser. “Energy Transfer and the fossil fuel industry do not understand the difference between entities and movements. You can’t bankrupt the movement. You can’t silence the movement. There will be a backlash and a price to pay when you pursue these kinds of tactics.

Shares of its rival retailer Target were down 1.6%, with Amazon 0.9% lower.The news dragged down stock markets with all the major US indices falling in morning trading.Walmart’s lower than expected guidance is a warning that US consumer spending is slowing, said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, a Walmart investor.“At the moment the labor market is still strong,” he said, adding that if Walmart’s soft guidance is followed by a decline in jobs, “it would be a strong signal that economic growth is slowing”.Walmart said annual sales are expected to rise between 3% and 4%. Analysts had expected 4% growth.Trump says US prices ‘could go up’ as he threatens new tariffs on trade partnersRead moreAs one of the first major US retailers to shed light on the crucial holiday quarter and the current year, Walmart’s forecast hints at how the retailer expects to fare underDonald Trump’s additional tariffs on goods made in China, and the threat of 25% tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada.Despite issuing disappointing guidance, Walmart sees US shoppers as “resilient” and focused on value, its chief financial officer, John David Rainey, said on a post-earnings call.He said the retailer did not include an assumption of new US tariffs in its guidance, but said Walmart can manage any new duties well, without offering details.“We’re one month into the year, so I think it’s prudent to have an outlook that is somewhat measured. We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves, there is certainly some unpredictability in any environment that we have, but we feel really good about our ability to navigate that,” Rainey said.US retail sales experienced their largest monthly decline in two years in January, hampered by frigid temperatures, wildfires and motor vehicle shortages.The disappointing figures from the retail giant follow alackluster reportfrom McDonald’s.

Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties.The layoffs are part of theTrump administration’s intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the so-called “department of government efficiency” by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept abuyout offerfrom the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline.From weather apps to taxes: the trickle-down effects of Trump’s federal worker firingsRead moreIt’s unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation’s revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the US, which is $36tn in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3bn in back taxes from rich tax dodgers.The IRS has roughly 90,000 employees total across the United States, according to the latest IRS data. People of colormake up 56% of the IRS workforce, and women represent 65%.In addition to the planned layoffs, the Trump administration intends to lend IRS workers to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to assist with immigration enforcement. In aletter sent earlier this month, the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, asked the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, to borrow IRS workers to help with ongoing immigration crackdown efforts.Representatives from the IRS and US treasury did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The subsequent six-year gap until GoldenEye was the longest break in the history of Bond.It has been four years since the 2021 release of No Time To Die and, with no new film in production, the current hiatus is on course to become 007’s longest ever holiday.Gaining creative control will give Amazon the power to move forward without approval from Wilson and Broccoli, who have acted as careful guardians of the integrity of a character originally created in 1953 by author Ian Fleming.View image in fullscreenBarbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson pictured in London in 2022.Photograph: Suzan Moore/PASteven Gaydos, executive editor of the US film magazine Variety, said he was initially surprised by the deal after reports that Broccoli and Wilson had not hit it off with the new owners,denied by Amazon, and were unhappy at the prospect of several Bond spin-offs.He said: “It wasn’t that long ago that it was reported that Barbara and Michael had sparred with Amazon and there had been a fight over it. But they’re getting older and there is a mountain to climb to achieve what they have done.“It’s a record that will never be matched. They kept turning over the card and coming up with an ace, over and over.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects. Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.”Broccoli, 64, said: “My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honour of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of No Time to Die, and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”Broccoli is the daughter of Cubby Broccoli, who co-founded the series with fellow producer Harry Saltzman. She began working on the Bond films as a teenager in minor roles, before acting as assistant director on Octopussy in 1983 and associate producer on The Living Daylights in 1987. Her first full Bond producer credit was onGoldenEyein 1995.Wilson is Cubby Broccoli’s stepson. A qualified lawyer, he joined Broccoli’s Eon Productions in 1972 and became executive producer on Moonraker in 1979, and moved to producer for A View to a Kill in 1985.Together the pair built Bond into one of the most successful franchises in cinema history, having grossed more than $7.8bn worldwide, behind only the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Spider-Man. The most successful Bond film remains Skyfall, released in 2012, with a worldwide gross of $1.1bn.Eon has been reluctant to spread the Bond name too thin through the kind of spin-offs that have proved fruitful for streaming services, which have cashed in on the popularity of films such as Star Wars or zombie TV show The Walking Dead.A rare foray outside the Bond films was the creation of007: Road to a Million, a reality competition series released on Amazon Prime Video that features nine teams competing for a £1m prize.Explore more on these topicsJames BondAmazonJeff BezosFilm industryAmazon Prime VideonewsShareReuse this content"

Long before theEaton firebegan its destructive march through the California foothills last month, the beekeeper was already on perpetual alert: watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California, cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees that surrounded the property.When the Santa Ana winds picked up, Nancy, Bruce’s wife and business partner, was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures included an old robot toy from the 1965 TV show Lost in Space, as well as a threadbare T-shirt from Occidental College, the school where Bruce and Nancy first met – and where he would go on to work for more than 35 years.The scorched remains of the Chaparral Mountain Honey Company beehives now, and the apiary before the California wildfires.The scorched remains of the Chaparral Mountain Honey Company beehives now, and the apiary before the California wildfires.“This was not our first time evacuating,” said Clara. During the 2009Station fire, Bruce had stayed back with about 10 other neighbors to defend their block using the water in his pool. But this fire was different. At 2.37am Bruce and Clara were woken by the sheriff’s emergency alarm. It was pitch-black, and each trip out to the car was terrifying. Less than an hour after they drove away, the fire had engulfed their home, their hives and every drop of honey they had.“This will be my 49th year as a beekeeper,” Bruce, 75, said. “I’ve had fire losses in the past, but nothing like this.”This couple has re-created the sights and smells of a Senegalese market in Brooklyn: ‘Experiences keep people coming back’Read moreBruce and Nancy startedChaparral Mountain Honey Companyin the early 1980s. “I fell in love with the bees, maybe even a little bit before I fell in love with Bruce,” said Nancy, 66.Since 1996, their home had served as the heart of their operation, with 188 hives spread across their property, as well as the nearby artist ranch and surrounding mountains. Nature was what drew the couple to this particular quarter ofLos Angeles. When they talk about their neighbors, they are also referring to the great horned owls, the mountain lions and the foxes that the Steeles, both diehard environmentalists, have spent their lives protecting.Beekeepers all across the world are grappling with theongoing decline in bee populationsdue to the climate crisis, habitat loss and the widespread use of pesticides. “[Beekeeping] was going to be a significant part of our income going into the future,” said Nancy.The Steeles’ losses extend well beyond $210,000 (and counting) in destroyed honey reserves. They have also had to cancel their lucrative almond contract, at a time of year when just about all the commercial beekeepers in the US descend on northern California to help pollinate the almond flowers. (Without bees, we would not have almonds, and California produces80% of the world’s almonds.) Sales at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County’s annualBug Fairalso made up a good portion of the couple’s income.A comparison of a photo of a father and daughter stand outside a burnt-out house, and a photo of a home surrounded by lush vegetation.Carla and Bruce Steele on the porch of their incinerated family home now, and the house before the wildfire.The loss – decades’ worth of equipment (some that is not even made any more), 30,000 pounds of honey, hives, the oak trees, their family home and the bees – is incalculable. AGoFundMepage is aimed at helping the beekeepers recover, but the $40,000 in donations they have received so far will cover only a fraction of the necessary costs.This woodworker perfected her craft during a summer of racial justice protestRead moreChaparral Honey Company started out with only a handful of hives. As it grew, so did its loyal following, and a modest but dependable income. At the Steeles’ booth at the Bug Fair, customers were always clamoring for gallons of their famous wildflower honey. “We meet so many people from all over, and they’re just obsessed with my parents, obsessed with the honey, because it’s basically just my dad doing all the beekeeping and extracting and bottling. And then my mom manages the entire business,” said Clara, who happens to be allergic to bees.Before retiring in 2024, Bruce worked as the environmental health and safety manager at Occidental College, presiding over fire safety protocols. Nancy spent the entirety of her career protecting natural resources, saving land from being sold off to developers in historically Black and middle-class Altadena, alongside her work at theCaliforniaAir Resources Board and as executive director of the Council for Watershed Health in Los Angeles. Clara is a programme officer at the Roy and Patricia Disney Family Foundation, which focuses on social justice.Now that the fires are contained, the Steeles must contend with the mudslides that occur when rain hits the nearby denuded mountain ranges. They have taken up temporary residence in the basement of longtime friends. They have no intention of selling their land in Altadena. “We want to rebuild,” said Nancy. “It’s our home.”Man standing outside his burnt out beehivesBruce Steele and the remains of his beehives now, and the beehives before the wildfire.What first drew you to beekeeping?Bruce:It is incredibly time-absorbing, but it’s a doorway into understanding the universe. We went from two colonies to eight or nine the first year, and then I think it was the second year I got stung in the forehead and had an allergic reaction. I was working in a hospital at the time so I got my shot of epinephrine, and then I decided: well, what the heck. I had a conversation with my body and said, “We’re gonna do this, so we’ve gotta figure this out.”‘Barberry and saffron’: bakery startup bringing a taste of Iran to BrooklynRead moreHow much of your beekeeping business was lost in the fire?Nancy:We are still counting all the jars, but I’d say 30,000 pounds of honey. I was going through the house and I was seeing all these piles of jars, broken glass, and thinking about how some of them were empty and ready to be filled, and others were filled with honey orders that didn’t go out.Bruce:There was so much equipment. I had hundreds and hundreds of three-quarter-depth boxes that burned; I don’t even have a full count yet. Stainless steel tanks. I lost all my extracting equipment. I’ve had to cancel my almond contract this year. There is nothing left of the hives.Do you have a sense of when you’ll be able to have bees and start making honey again?Nancy:No. We had small business insurance, but it won’t cover our losses. It will be something, but I still have to fill out [all the spreadsheets]. We’re hearing that the price to rebuild is probably going to be at least double what insurance will cover, if not more.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresThe New Face of Small BusinessBeesFoodWildfiresLos AngelesCaliforniaSmall businessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But can he do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke?This question is ridiculous and annoying. Of course he can – he’s done it on rainy nights in Fort Lauderdale multiple times in just the last year and half. There arewhole compilationsof him doing all of his usual Messi things in terrible weather throughout his career. Even the dialog the question/meme supposedly replaces – let’s see if Messi can overcomethispiece of weather-based adversity! – seems pointless when the player in question has already, for all intents and purposes, completed football at the highest level.This week, though, one could be gently forgiven for utilizing an American version of the question in a post, a headline, or as a lighthearted way to make your friends groan. As Messi andInter Miamiprepared to open their 2025 campaign with a visit to Sporting KC in the first round of the Concacaf Champions Cup, it was clear the conditions would be a big part of the story. The temperature in Kansas City dropped to 3F (-16C) on Tuesday, the original date which was delayed due to snowfall. At kickoff on Wednesday night it was only a few degrees warmer, and by the end of the night they hovered at just below 0F (-17C). It was not quite the coldest game at kickoff between MLS teams ever – that would be Colorado’s 2018 Champions Cup game against Toronto FC, clocking in at 3F – but it was close enough.For Inter Miami and Lionel Messi, a club-defining season awaitsRead moreCould Messi do it on a damn near Siberian night in Kansas City? Of course he could. The Argentinian managed to create the match’s one moment of magic, settling an aerial ball while surrounded by defenders, shifting past those defenders with his signature hypnotic control, and finishing at an acute angle in the second half for the game’s only goal.

This was the coldest game in which Messi has ever played at senior level – the record low temperature in any country he has played in during his career is far above where it was at kickoff. The Argentinian, like most of his teammates, opponents, and fans in the stands, seemed viscerally uncomfortable for most of the match’s opening stages. Most players wore fleece neck gaiters that were occasionally pulled up over their heads. Marscherano started the game hatless with a vest and undershirt. By midway through the first half, he had a gaiter, a hat, a jacket and an overcoat. At one point, Messi was shown on the broadcast running to the sideline during a break in action, having new hand warmers inserted into his gloves.“I’ve never been through anything like that,” Mascherano said. “After 10 minutes [the players] couldn’t feel their hands or their feet … I’m very proud of them. It was impossible to play in these conditions. It’s inhumane.”View image in fullscreenPlayers from both sides wore plenty of winter gear on the field.Photograph: William Purnell/USA Today SportsIf the tone of that quote sounds somewhat familiar to your ears at this time of year, you may be a US soccer fan. In each of the past three seasons, an early-season game in a cold-weather location has drawn the ire of at least one coach or player who was willing to speak up about it.“An absolute joke that we had to play today,” LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo said last year, when his teamplayed Real Salt Lake in a snowstorm. He later called the game “one of the worst professional sporting events I’ve ever seen in my life,” and was fined for his comments. Cherundolo’s luck didn’t change much this year – LAFC’s Champions Cup loss at Colorado on Tuesday was played in similar conditions as Kansas City on Wednesday: 7F at kickoff.This type of game has become a fixture on the American soccer calendar. In 2022, the US men’s national team hosted Honduras in a February World Cup qualifier in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The temperature at kickoff was 3F, also reported at -15 F (-26C) with wind chill.

And this is to say nothing of the SnowClásico – the United States’ 2013 World Cup qualifier in Colorado v Costa Rica that was played in a driving snowstorm – or the 2013 MLS Cup final, played in a frigid Kansas City with one side of the pitch so frozen that goalkeepers had trouble keeping their footing, or Minnesota United’s very first home game in 2017, beset by a blizzard in a loss to Atlanta United.At this point, playing through the cold is as endemic to American soccer as the MLS salary budget and constant long-distance travel. Chances are it will only become more common – especially if MLS follows through with its current exploration of switching to a fall-to-spring calendar, which would necessitate either a long winter break or some creative scheduling to get around the cold entirely.As he so often has, though, Messi laid waste not just a meme but also a train of thought; that the challenges of playing in the United States will trip up even the world’s best players.“There is one guy that can turn the game over and he did,” said Sporting KC head coach Peter Vermes of Messi. “It’s what he does to the whole world, anyone who plays against him.”And, indeed, wherever he plays, and whatever the weather is.Explore more on these topicsLionel MessiInter MiamiSporting Kansas CityMLSConcacaf Champions LeagueUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The plaque features the words “Magical, Alluring, Galvanizing and Adventurous” andthe city commission confirmedit was a reference to Maga.“Maga is profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy and most importantly, Maga is explicitly a Nazi movement,”Kluwe, who was part of the Minnesota Vikings for most of his career, said. “You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that’s what it is.”Former NFL player Chris Kluwe to sue Vikings over anti-gay commentsRead moreHe added that since Trump started his second term in power, the Maga movement had, among other things,sought to erase trans people, aimed to reintroduce segregation and fired military veterans and “the people overseeing our nuclear arsenal”. Kluwe then said he would “engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience” and walked on to the meeting’s stage.There were cheers, laughter and applause for Kluwe’s words while one person told him to “get the heck out”. He was handcuffed by law enforcement officials and carried out of the chamber. The 43-year-old was charged with disrupting an assembly and was released after four hours in custody. He later said on social media that the police were “polite and professional.”All seven members of the Huntington Beach city council are conservatives and one member, Gracey Van Der Mark, said there was “nothing peaceful” about Kluwe’s protest. She said he was guilty of “causing alarm among those in attendance, including two young students”.Kluwe was outspoken on social issues during his NFL career, which lasted from 2005 to 2013, and heclaimed he was eventually releasedby the Vikings because of his beliefs and his support for same-sex marriage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 2021 US Open ­champion then approached the umpire’s chair two games into the match, to alerted officials to his presence.After a discussion with the tournament director, security officials ejected the spectator before the match resumed, which Raducanu eventually lost. Raducanu slipped 4-0 behind before battling back to send the first set into a tie-break but eventually fell to a 7-6 (6), 6-4 defeat.On Tuesday the 22-year-old posted a message on Instagram to assure fans that “I’ll be OK”. Raducanu said she was “proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match. Thank you to Karolina for being a great sport and best of luck to her for the rest of the tournament.”The Professional Tennis ­Players Association said on Thursday that ­Raducanu’s experience highlights a “pervasive issue” affecting players.A PTPA statement read: ­“Tennis players and professional athletes worldwide must be able to focus on their jobs – training and competing – free from fear of ­harassment or abuse. The recent high-profile incident in Dubai, where security swiftly removed a disruptive fan from a top player during a premier tournament, ­underscores a pervasive issue.“Such disturbances are not confined to elite events; they also occur with unsettling regularity at lower-tier tournaments, exacerbated by the influence of online betting.“We commend the Dubai security team’s efforts, and we recognise the lingering toll these kinds of incidents take on players’ performance and welfare.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisDubainewsShareReuse this content"

Are we underestimating the effect of these things? Did the pitch mics at the Bernabéu pick up Nico González in the pre-match huddle saying: “Lads, we’ve all absorbed the news about the related third-party transaction rules being declared improper. I am as a consequence bang up for this.” Did the cameras detect Savinho whispering: “Guys, we are now free to seek our own definition of market value. This commercial potential is hugely energising. Hit me early over the top.”‘We’ve been the worst this year,’ Guardiola says after Real Madrid thrashingRead moreThere will be suggestions that sport doesn’t work like this. Some will object that the logic doesn’t stand up because Newcastle’s players should also have been running on pure, uncut sovereign fund deregulation vibes, equal partners in a joyful 5-5 draw. Who can really say for sure? In the end, all that really seemed certain at the Bernabéu was that City’s Big Tribunal Energy had mysteriously dissipated.English champion teams have found themselves outmatched in this competition before. Although perhaps never quite like this. The likes of Blackburn at least had the good manners to look confused, angry, ready to do someone. City collapsed like a rain-sodden cardboard box, a sporting entity with no resistance, no fibre. A 3-1 defeatreally could have been anything at all.At the end of which three things seem true. First, the current iteration of this great team is now done. This was its last dance, a chance to go down, if not with all guns blazing, then with all guns gently ticking over in search of forensic incision.Instead, City were meek in a way that still comes as a shock to those yet to see it in the flesh. In Spain the buildup to this game was dominated by a debate overthe precise meaning of a key English swearword, with linguists and native speakers consulted on the nuances of Jude Bellingham’s controversial red card F-word. Pep Guardiola’s team have at least offered some clarity. People of Spain, watch the highlights back. This is what completely fucked looks like.The second certainty is that City will be back. This is not the end, because the end cannot exist now for clubs with these resources. Not only will the project endure, the project is already clearing new lines of finance via its elite tribunal game. Defeat in Spain, a single bad season. These losses can be absorbed when the sport is stratified as never before.The third thing relates to Guardiola himself, who once again delivered his public response like a man strapped to a wheel of pain, unable to process defeat, failure or elements beyond his reach. City will rebuild. But does Guardiola really have the will and the capacity to curate another era?With this in mind it is necessary to emphasise just how bad City were in Madrid. The numbers don’t get near it. By the end, City had 12 shots to Madrid’s 15. They shaded the possession and passing. In reality, this was a night of humiliation for Guardiola, his team olé’d about the place, rondo’d off, treated like cones. As early as the 20th minute it was startling Madrid were still only 1-0 up as those white shapes romped around the empty spaces, the crowd gushing idly over its favourites, clapping Raúl Asencio like proud parents as he completed a back pass.Kylian Mbappébarely broke into a sprint while compiling his hat-trick. But then, why sprint when the space is already there?View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé celebrates after scoring his second goal.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/APNone of this is unusual in outline. Things fall apart. Great teams decay and regenerate. Play enough times and you will eventually lose. The wider question for a manager who is obsessed with legacy and the due rewards of history is how much did Guardiola’s own errors contribute to this? And how successful has his time at City been when it comes to the greatest prize?“We have achieved something unique in our country and in Europe, we have won once and we have been there many times,” Guardiola told Spanish TV. It is a generous definition of unique. There are those in Spain who like to dwell on Guardiola’s relative failures in Europe given the scale of resources at his disposal.His 2011 Barcelona team are still the greatest of the century, a total re-gear of what it meant and felt and looked like to dominate elite football. But it does seem odd now that the creator of that team has won the competition once in 14 seasons since, reaching two finals, losing to Spurs, Monaco, Chelsea and others along the way. This despite having total patronage for his vision, the greatest riches, best facilities and most elite intelligence ever made available to any manager.The current season is Guardiola’s worst in European competition. The last seven games have brought five defeats andone win against Club Brugge. There has been for the first time a sense of being behind the curve.Paris Saint-Germain tore City apartplaying like a classic Pep team. Madrid did the same playing like a modern iteration, deep possession and rapid attacks.Guardiola has also made micro-mistakes. Abdukodir Khusanov’s deployment out of position at right-back against Mbappé-Vinícius felt like a kind of hazing ritual. What was meant to happen here? Khusanov, who has never played in a game like this, would suddenly discover miracle innate right-back capacities?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnother surprise at the start was the absence of the injured Erling Haaland, ruling out an emotional reunion with Antonio Rüdiger, his defensive spirit animal, the centre-half who completes him (last season’s meeting in Madridwas basically an extended man-hug, the 90-minute supercut of the Heathrow arrivals scene in Love Actually).Haaland was missed for more than his goals. He is also an angry, rage-fuelled leader. But how is it that Guardiola has allowed his team to become so reliant on a single player in every position, let alone a one-shot goalscorer? How is it he seems to have so few leaders, but plenty of fearful avatars of the blueprint? The great midfield obsessive has neglected his key area, failing to add in the summer when it must have been clear this was required. Kevin De Bruyne is still the only approved element of spontaneity, even in his new slower gear, still gamely chugging about like a routemaster bus on its way to a wedding. Nobody in the squad comes close to replicating those attributes.View image in fullscreenThe defeat in Madrid was City’s fifth in their last seven Champions League games.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty ImagesAsked if he has the will to drive this process, goaded a little by the home crowd chanting “Guardiola stay”, he answered: “Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. I want to continue.” It will be fascinating to watch this happen. Nobody really knows how Guardiola sees his future. Contract extensions are ultimately meaningless. The outcome of City’s financial charges will have a huge bearing. Which way will Pep jump?Rebuilding a team on this scale is an exhausting process. History suggests even great managers tend to get 10 years running ahead of the tide. Guardiola has been doing it for close to 20. His cultural impact is all pervading, to the extent it has become a self-fuelling competitive advantage as clubs appoint managers on the basis of their pencil-sketch similarity to the master.Perhaps that cycle has finally completed itself. Maybe Guardiola’s final hybrid shape is the all-conquering version of big men at the back, a big quick man up front and a midfield of core technical mastery.If so it feels fitting that team should play out their own farewell against Madrid, the celebrity counterpart to Guardiola’s more orderly collectivism, with their half a billion euros front four, with Carlo Ancelotti out there striding his touchline looking like a renaissance duke persuaded reluctantly to star in an advert for alpaca wool tailored overcoats.City and Madrid can both continue to present themselves as insider-outsiders, victims of the tyranny of hoi polloi, forced to obey rules made by others, wings constantly clipped. The project will endure and refresh, with or without the architect of its most beautiful moments. All angles considered, that tribunal victory probably is the most significant result of the week.Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaManchester CityKylian MbappéfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We hand out honours and dishonours from the latest round of actionJohn BrewinThu 20 Feb 2025 09.13 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 10.42 ESTShareGoing upFeyenoordThese are high times for Dutch football, though the country’s traditional power, Ajax, can only watch from the Europa League as Feyenoord and PSV downed Italian giants. At the San Siro, Feyenoord were able to ride out their former star Santiago Giménez scoring an opening-minute goal and performing a non-celebration celebration. Pascal Bosschaart continues as Feyenoord’s caretaker manager but whatever happens, he’ll always haveMilan, and this tactical triumph. Eighteen-year-old Zépiqueno Redmond led the attack and was replaced by former Philadelphia Union and Inter Miami striker Julián Carranza, who would score the crucial equaliser. It ended 1-1 on the night and Feyenoord went through 2-1 on aggregate; they will face either Inter or Arsenal when Friday’s draw is made.Club BruggeIf Belgium’s golden generation of émigrés is fading, the resurgence of the country’s club game has been most welcome. Brugge, the 1978 European Cup finalists, have a proud history and fervent support. But they are the smallest team left in the draw, although they are fully deserving of their place afterbeating the reigning Europa League champions, Atalanta. Bergamo was supposed to be where Brugge’s dream died. Simon Mignolet, once of Liverpool, saved a penalty but the Belgians were already 5-2 up in the tie. Brugge’s first win in Italy since 2003 was achieved thanks to a mix of veterans and players who may help form the next generation of Belgian stars. Swiss midfielder Ardon Jashari was outstanding too.BenficaAnother big name from the competition’s days as the European Cup, Benfica rode out the storm against a dangerous, determined Monaco. Vangelis Pavlidis notched his seventh goal in the competition this season from the penalty spot having set up Kerem Akturkoglu for the opening goal. With the tie level, Orkun Kokcu’s control and finish came to the rescue, as he charged in from midfield to score the winner in a tie that ended 4-3 on aggregate. He twanged a hamstring, too, in the process of celebrating. Bruno Lage’s team have the toughest possible draw in the next round – either Barcelona or Liverpool await – but in Pavlidis and their attacking play, they can be a threat to both teams.View image in fullscreenBenfica’s Vangelis Pavlidis got the better of Monaco’s Radoslaw Majecki from the penalty spot.Photograph: Octávio Passos/UEFA/Getty ImagesHeading outManchester City“Nothing is eternal,” said Pep Guardiola, though he had perhaps forgotten Real Madrid’s stranglehold on this competition, and their continuing ability to wound him. “We have been extraordinarily extraordinary in the past, but not any more,” he continued but in such a sound defeat, one preluded by City’s manager claiming his team had just a “1%” chance of progressing, there must be disappointment. If this is the end of the cycle, then the Abu Dhabi-Catalan partnership yielded just one Champions League title, when many more were possible.This was a meek surrenderunrecognisable from much of City’s Guardiola era. Now he must decide whether he gets to lead the club’s next cycle.City’s zombified figures are haunted by ghosts of themselves in Bernabéu exit | Barney RonayRead moreMilanA disastrous week for Serie A. Inter are the last men standing after Milan, Atalanta and Juventus crashed out to teams from far less wealthy leagues. Theo Hernández’s red card for two bookable offences, the seconda speculative divethat was correctly ruled as simulation, turned Milan’s tie with Feyenoord in the Dutch team’s favour. After Giménez scored early, Milan’s four-man attack faded, with Rafael Leão and João Félix giving enigmatic performances and Christian Pulisic well short of his usual drive. Sérgio Conceição threw everything at the Rotterdam team, taking off both Pulisic and Yunus Musah in search of an answer, but Milan’s attacking was substandard. “It’s a big defeat for me,” said the Milan coach. “I am responsible for this defeat. We should have been better on a mental level.”JuventusIf this week was bad for Serie A, a real battering to their coefficient chance of having five participants in next season’s group stage, it was almost as bad for the US contingent. Celtic’s Cameron Carter-Vickers joined the throng after Bayern Munich’s last-minute equalisersettled the tie in the Germans’ favour. Timothy Weah was on the scoresheet for Juventus in Eindhoven, his goal thumped from the edge of the box, but PSV struck back quickly and eventually progressed thanks to a winner from Ryan Flamingo. Weah and Weston McKennie exited. PSV’s Richy Ledezma, with just one cap for the USMNT, could celebrate, while his teammates and compatriots, Sergiño Dest, Ricardo Pepi and Malik Tillman, all absent through injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those who did perhaps forgot the depth of his talent and self-belief. Sure, Manchester City’s defence could hardly have been more accommodating, but he grabbed the occasion with both hands. Credit Carlo Ancelotti, ever the arch strategist, who has found a way to assimilate Mbappé and still get full use of Rodrygo and Vinícius Júnior. How? An old-style 4-4-2, with Jude Bellingham off the left. “I wanted to define an era, to make history at Real Madrid,” Mbappé said afterwards, and the first target is winning theChampions League.Julián Carranza, FeyenoordCarranza was tasked with succeeding Giménez at De Kuip. A bout of illness meant he was not fit enough to start the second leg at San Siro, but he eventually had his say as a substitute. The former MLS striker was bought with the knowledge that Giménez would be sold. His first Champions League goal knocked out Giménez’s new club – a decent start, then, towards replacing the Mexican. Following a beauty of a cross from the on-loan Wolves defender Hugo Bueno, Carranza’s goal was right out of the Giménez playbook.Chemsdine Talbi, Club BruggeThe 19-year-old grabbed two goals to end Atalanta’s hopes, becoming the youngest Belgian to score in the Champions League knockouts. Though, being a dual national, he may still declare for Morocco, who host the Africa Cup of Nations in December. If elite clubs already know all about Talbi, his command of the tie with Atalanta will have only raised interest. He’s confident, too. “I am not surprised how well we played,” he said. “We know what we can do.” Lille or Aston Villa will get the chance in the next round to see his talents at close hand.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueFeyenoordClub BruggeBenficaManchester CityMilanJuventusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is my response to him |  Austin KillipsRead moreIt also calls for a review and adjustment of policies “permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women’s sports”.Coe told thePiers Morgan Uncensored YouTube channelthat Trump was “right on the principle” but said: “I’m not going to get into the local conditions that he is setting about visas and all that, that is very much a US issue.”He added: “I welcome the commitment to maintaining the integrity of women’s sport. For me, this is absolutely about the integrity of competition. I am by nature a social liberal, I really do not choose, nor do I have any predisposition to tell people how to live their lives, but when it comes to the biology of sport it is very, very clear cut. And actually I am surprised it has been as contentious a discussion as it has become.”World Athletics is set to toughen its rules on eligibility to compete in female sport with the introductionof a cheek swabto determine if an athlete is biologically female. It intends to treat transgender athletes and athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) alike under its new policy, and cites research that shows a performance gap between the sexes even before the onset of puberty.“When it comes to the female category in elite sport, it has to be sacrosanct,” Coe, who is one of seven candidates to be the IOC’s next president, added in the interview with Piers Morgan. “The reason, I think, it is so important is that you cannot have young girls coming into the sport and sensing or feeling that at any stage there is a glass ceiling to their ability to perform at the highest level.“You simply cannot have this lack of clarity. So [in] World Athletics, we were very clear, we followed the science and I think that is critical, I think we have used language that is moderate.

He was the light in the gloom of an FA Cup exit against Bournemouth, looking the epitome of a gifted Argentinian midfielder as soon as he was introduced for his debut. One start for David Moyes’s team and Everton fans were singing Alcaraz’s name after he marked the occasion with an assist plus an80th-minute winnerat Crystal Palace last Saturday.One taste of a Merseyside derby, meanwhile, and the feeling was mutual. “Loco, loco,” says Alcaraz, shaking his head and smiling about the mayhem that was thefinal Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. “It was a mad derby, a crazy match. We were ahead, we were behind and then we managed to get a draw at the end of a pulsating game. To say that was my first derby wearing this shirt is fantastic. I really enjoyed it.”After £800m and four years, Everton’s new stadium makes its grand debutRead moreAlcaraz was involved in the buildup to James Tarkowski’s 98th-minute equaliser and first on the scene when Curtis Jones grabbed Abdoulaye Doucouré after the final whistle. The experience was reminiscent of a previous chapter in the 22-year-old’s career. Alcaraz came to international attention after scoring a 118th-minute winner for Racing Club against Boca Juniors in the 2022 Champions Trophy final. He celebrated Doucouré-style in front of the opposition fans, sparking a brawl that resulted in red cards for Alcaraz, a Racing teammate and five Boca players, including a substituted player and an unused substitute. Two Boca players had been sent off earlier in the game and so, with only six Boca players remaining on the pitch, the final was stopped and Racing won 2-1. That’s one way to clinch a trophy.“I’m really, really competitive and aggression is a part of my game but I have other technical qualities as well,” admits the midfielder, who shook the hand of the referee Facundo Tello by way of an apology after receiving his red card against Boca. “What you will find when I pull on this shirt is that I just want to give my best. I’m very competitive and give 100% all the time. Off the pitch I am a pretty chilled, laidback sort of guy. I am not going out all the time. I might have a stroll out to the shopping centre but I am happy by myself. You need to rest a lot to play football so I am happy resting up and recuperating. I watch a bit of TV and I go on PlayStation.”It is two years and three months since Alcaraz won the Champions Trophy with Racing Club. YetEvertonare his fourth different club since then, and the third this season alone (he was able to sign on loan from Flamengo this month as the Brazilian season, which overlaps with the Premier League dates, had ended). He left Argentina for Southampton in January 2023, joined Juventus on loan in January 2024 and featured in Southampton’s first Premier League game of this season before moving to Flamengo for a club-record €18m (£14.9m) last August. The midfielder’s brief time in Brazil was frustrating.He struggled to secure a regular starting role under Filipe Luís, although the former Atlético Madrid and Chelsea left-back blamed himself for that. “I’m sad,” said the Flamengo coach. “I feel like it’s my failure, his failure for not working out in my hands. Given the investment made, that was my concern, a big investment and I’m not getting the best out of him.” Filipe Luís added: “I love Alcaraz.” Everton, who have an option to buy the midfielder in the summer, held a longstanding interest and moved to make him the first – and so far only – signing of Moyes’s second spell in charge.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz battles for the ball with Luis Díaz during the final Merseyside derby at Goodison.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA“There was contact and interest before I went to Brazil but it didn’t come off in the end,” Alcaraz admits. “It didn’t work out but I was really pleased that a Premier League club of Everton’s stature had shown interest. I was happy during my time in Brazil with Flamengo but stuff happened that involved other people, and not directly me, so even before Everton revived their interest when I was in Brazil I was thinking I would love to come back to the Premier League because it is the best league in the world and I like a challenge. I wanted to challenge myself and what better way than to do so at a big club like Everton. With that initial interest and subsequent interest I didn’t need any convincing.”Without wishing to sound like an overbearing grandparent, isn’t it about time you settled down? Alcaraz replies: “Currently it’s a loan deal until the end of the season but yes, I would like to settle down and make it longer. I would like to be playing in this shirt for a longer period for sure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Immediately that calmed me, relaxed me and gave me confidence. I am really happy here. I know what a big challenge it is playing for Everton but I think the confidence from the manager, his coaching staff and my teammates means I can do my thing and prove who I am as a player.”Jack Harrison, a fluent Spanish speaker, has been instrumental in helping Alcaraz settle at Everton. Having spent a year in charge at Real Sociedad, Moyes’s Spanish must be helpful too? “He only says: ‘Hola,’” says Alcaraz. “But it’s no problem because we have Jack. To be fair, the manager speaks really clearly to me, his English is very clear, so I don’t have any problem. My English is good enough to follow when it is a team talk or it is directed to me. Jack’s Spanish is great. We spend a lot of time together in training and off the field. We even share a maté [a South American herbal drink] together. He played under [Marcelo] Bielsa at Leeds and the backroom staff there so he was used to having maté. Now I’ve got him back on it.”Explore more on these topicsEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With hindsight and our different experiences, we say to ourselves that we should have revealed it from the start. The message that I especially want to give is that we realise that the most important thing is happiness.”Bompastor and Abily were previously teammates at the French club Lyon, where they won two and five Women’s Champions League titles respectively, and both starred in the French national team for prolonged periods on the international stage, both surpassing 150 senior international caps.Asked what had held them back from disclosing their relationship in public sooner, Abily said: “We were still two well-known players. We were already associated with many things. We didn’t want it to be just that. We are working together at the moment, but it won’t be like this [working at the same club] our whole life either. We don’t work together because we are a couple. We work together because we complement each other.”Bompastor, who succeeded Emma Hayes as the Chelsea head coach, continued: “Revealing my life together with Camille, our relationship, after – as I say in the book – these 13 years of lies, is still a subject on which we are not entirely comfortable today. We are rather discreet and we like to have a completely normal life. Growing up, feeling attracted to a woman, not knowing what’s going on, not understanding what’s going on, not having the answers and also not having people around you with whom you can talk about the subject, it’s not easy.”Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

That was all it took for Manchester City’s fragile hopes of a Bigger Cup comeback at the Bernabéuto be extinguishedas Pep Guardiola’s side were exposed to their kryptonite – a very fast forward running on to a long ball. Kylian Mbappé jogged away from Rúben Dias and John Stones, and lifted the ball over Ederson with a single, devastating touch. Stones hobbled off injured moments later, and he may as well have taken the rest of his team with him. Mbappé wasn’t finished; the Real Madrid forward added another two beautifully taken goals in a merciless individual display. He has now scored seven Big Cup goals against City – the same as Lionel Messi – and for three different clubs to boot. In a competition that has, in the last decade, become essentially Real Madrid v Everyone Else (with Madrid leading 5-4 since 2015-16) the other 15 sides still in the perspex bowl for Friday’s last-16 draw must contemplate how to beat the defending champions, who have found a way to get the best out of their new superstar striker.Aston Villa and Liverpool are also in the hat for the last 16. They met away from the Bigger Cup spotlight on Wednesday night, playing outa Premier League thrillerat Villa Park. The visitors led through Mohamed Salah but, perhaps as perturbed as the rest of us by the sight of Marcus Rashford in claret and blue, ended up falling behind to hosts desperate to climb back into European contention. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s deflected equaliser set up a grandstand final 30 minutes, and when Dominik Szoboszlai rolled the ball across an open goal to substitute Darwin Núñez, the narrative appeared to have been written. Instead, the much-maligned striker blazed the ball high into the North Stand. Núñez then failed to convert a one-on-one and Villa missed chances to twist the knife further, but if Liverpool are to topple from their perch this season, this is surely the moment that will cap the highlight reel.That, of course, is a very big if. Even though Liverpool have drawn half of their eight league games since the turn of the year, they still sit in relative comfort, eight points clear of Arsenal. The Gunners do have the chance to apply some pressure this weekend – if they beat West Ham on Saturday. The gap would be reduced to five before Arne Slot’s side face a tricky trip to face … Pep Guardiola’s flying circus at the Etihad. Getting turned over byReal Madridand Liverpool inside a week, their former arch-rivals in Bigger Cup and the Premier League respectively, would be a sad indictment of City’s stark regression this season. While Villa and Liverpool went toe-to-toe until the final bell, Guardiola’s latest battle with Real Madrid felt like a rematch too far. City barely laid a glove on their hosts in the Bernabéu cauldron, and now welcome a team 17 points above them in the table. City’s Premier League reign is over, but they at least have another chance to climb off the canvas and deliver a telling blow in the title race. Either that, or hope Núñez leaves his shooting boots at home again.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEOne for the footy hipsters, join Rob Smyth for piping hot Europa League clockwatch action, with some achingly cool ties including Real Sociedad v Midtjylland, Ajax v Union Saint-Gilloise and, of course, Bodø/Glimt v FC Twente.QUOTE OF THE DAY“It’s a really interesting question I’ve always wanted to answer.

From my point of view, knowing them, it’s been incredible that these players have had to go through that.Luis Rubiales found guilty of sexually assaulting Spanish footballer Jenni HermosoRead more“Not only winning the World Cup and handling the media on the outside of it, but they were in the court case and speaking out. It’s incredibly brave of all the individuals and the team collectively.”Rubiales was found guilty on Thursday of kissing the striker Jenni Hermoso without her consent after Spain’s World Cup final defeat of England and was ordered by the court to pay a fine of more than €10,000. The 47-year-old was acquitted of coercion, having been accused of pressuring Hermoso to say the kiss was consensual.“They are fighting for change not just in that court case but in their federation,” said Bronze. “As an England team we have made changes in our team, not for the same reasons. As we watch on, we stand by the Spanish players, we wish them the best, we want them to get what they deserve, and we want them to just enjoy the football as well.“I was there last season at Barcelona, and watching players go through the ordeal after the World Cup was challenging.

To use our platforms to push those things forward and make change for little boys and girls, that is something we hold really dear to our hearts.”Bronze added that it was important for male athletes to not be stigmatised for doing the same: “For females to stand up and to speak out stereotypically is seen as a sign of bravery and empowerment. It tends to go the other way for the male side and that’s quite sad … Anyone speaking out is a sign of bravery. To be vulnerable is a sign of bravery because it’s a hard thing to do.”Sarina Wiegman, sitting to Bronze’s right, said she was “absolutely very proud” of the way players are using their platform. “It shows a lot about the togetherness of the team,” England’s manager said. “You are not alone and sharing these experiences within the team and then the wider world resonates.

The results have been used by the head coach,Thomas Frank, whose team are renowned for their high energy and intensity.A note in Brentford’s 2023-24 accounts published this week revealed that the club received a £3.23m tax credit last year, although the Guardian has been told that part of the payment was backdated for a claim made the previous year.The R&D tax credit scheme was set up in 2013 to provide incentives for businesses to innovate in science and technology for the public good but has attracted considerable controversy because its cost has ballooned from an initial £1.1bn to £7.5bn a year in the most recent figures.The Times reported earlier this week that Chelsea have claimed £2m in R&D tax credits between 2020 and 2023, and Nottingham Forest £607,000 last year, with both clubs declining to discuss what projects the money was awarded to support.View image in fullscreenBrentford have found success in the Premier League based on the data-led approach pioneered by their owner Matthew Benham.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PABrentford have been more open, with sources at the club pointing to several research papers that have been published in academic journals over the past two years. The club recruits about half a dozen PhD students every year to conduct research, with the results published and fed back to the football department.The performance director, Ben Ryan,a former rugby player who coached Fiji’s sevens team to win gold at the 2016 Olympics, has co-authored some of the work, and Frank also takes a keen interest.Recently published work includes a comparison of the positional demands of thePremier Leagueand France’s Ligue 1, a study on the impact of match location on players’ high intensity running speed and a similar piece of work looking at high-speed running and sprinting based on the quality of the opposition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardiola’s side also have the worst defensive record of the Premier League’s top eight and welcome the highest scorers, Liverpool, on Sunday.Asked why City’s had shown little resilience this season, Akésaid: “Maybe because there’s been a lot of setbacks this season, maybe more than we’ve been used to. It’s a new experience for everyone. How we dealt with it [at Madrid] obviously wasn’t good enough. We have to try to do that better in the next few games especially – against top teams as well. We have to make sure we’re more resilient, stronger in those situations when things go against us.”Aké had entered the fray in the eighth minute against Madrid as a replacement for the injured John Stones. The Dutchman said City had not played sensibly: “We had to stay stronger, maybe defend a little bit deeper, accept that they could have the ball a little bit longer. Sometimes we want to do things too quickly and we’re not resilient enough so then spaces get created and with the pace and the strength they have it’s difficult to contain them with the forwards they have.”Liverpool are clear at the top and have a 17-point advantage over City, who are fourth. Arne Slot’s side, who won the reverse fixture2-0 in December, have not lost in 22 Premier League matches as they aim to win their first title in five years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool play at ­Manchester City on Sunday having drawn four of their past eight league games.“I can accept every miss, ­especially from a player who scored two very important goals awayat Brentford[on 18 January] and that scored for us in the home gameagainst Villa[in ­November],” Slot said. “I would prefer him to score but the word ‘chance’ says it all. It is a chance and not 100% that it goes in.“I can accept misses but what is harder for me to accept is his behaviour after the chance. It got too much in his head, he was not the usual ­Darwin who works his ass off and makes sure he helps the team. He was too ­disappointed he missed that chance. Maybe we will never know but maybe that was why he was just a fraction short the moment afterwards [when Martínez won the ball].”View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Darwin Núñez sends his shot over the bar at Aston Villa with the score level at 2-2.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersNúñez has struggled in front of goal this season, scoring four times in 21 appearances in the Premier League. “I will tell him that you can miss a chance but you cannot miss out on work rate,” Slot said. “That is the life of a striker: he will miss chances and score some. It is part of the job of a No 9; you miss when people expect you to score. It is not part of the job of a No 9 to slow down in work rate. And that is something we will talk about.”Shortly after Slot had spoken Núñez posted amessage on X, ­promising to give everything until his final day at ­Liverpool. An initial message that might have been perceived as ­critical of fans was hastily deleted. It started: “Two three weeks ago, Darwin was the best, Darwin gave us the three points, but yesterday I was unlucky enough to miss a goal and I am once again the ‘worst’ and the failure.”An updated version soon appeared, which said: “I wasn’t the best three weeks ago nor am I the worst now. If I fall, I get up. You will never see me lower my arms. I’m going to leave everything until the last day I have to be here in Liverpool.

Technically, he is available. He was also declared symptom-free within 48 hours of the collision, and has completed the 12-day recovery process, but, in a welcome sign of just how seriously this Scottish setup takes these injuries, their medical and coaching staff decided he ought to have another week’s rest anyway.Russell would technically have been allowed to go back on to the field against Ireland since he passed his Head Injury Assessment, but the team preferred to err on the side of caution.“Every brain injury is different,” the head coach, Gregor Townsend, said. “I’m not a medical expert, but obviously one was a bigger -incident because it required Darcy to go to hospital.“Finn had actually passed the standard HIA but just had some memory loss, so we made the -decision not to put him on. But following the game he was symptom-free, and as he has progressed from light exercise, to skills training, to contact training, he’s been fine.”Scotland deserve credit for their caution, and for setting a good example for all levels of the game. “I believe Scotland have always been at the forefront of concussion-management and research,” Townsend said.“As a head coach you want to make sure that you’ve got the information in front of you to evaluate how much of a risk it is to play. It is definitely easier to make those decisions when you’re talking about a muscle injury, but this is different, which is why we just felt it was right that Darcy doesn’t play this weekend.”Graham’s omission is one of three changes to the team. He is replaced by the Glasgow wing Kyle Rowe, while Pierre Schoeman and Jamie Ritchie have moved up from the bench in a switch with the men they’re replacing, Rory Sutherland and Matt Fagerson, who both started against Ireland.Quick GuideSix Nations: England v Scotland teamsShowEngland:M Smith (Harlequins); T Freeman (Northampton), O Lawrence (Bath), H Slade (Exeter), O Sleightholme (Northampton); F Smith (Northampton), A Mitchell (Northampton); E Genge (Bristol), L Cowan-Dickie (Sale), W Stuart (Bath), M Itoje (Saracens, capt), O Chessum (Leicester), T Curry (Sale), B Earl (Saracens), T Willis (Saracens).Replacements:J George (Saracens), F Baxter (Harlequins), J Heyes (Leicester), T Hill (Bath), C Cunningham-South (Harlequins), B Curry (Sale), H Randall (Bristol), E Daly (Saracens).Scotland:B Kinghorn (Toulouse), K Rowe (Glasgow), H Jones (Glasgow), T Jordan (Glasgow), D Van der Merwe (Edinburgh), F Russell (Bath, co-capt), B White (Toulon); P Schoeman (Edinburgh), D Cherry (Edinburgh), Z Fagerson (Glasgow), J Gray (Bordeaux), G Gilchrist (Edinburgh), J Ritchie (Edinburgh), R Darge (Glasgow, co-capt), J Dempsey (Glasgow).Replacements:E Ashman (Edinburgh), R Sutherland (Glasgow), W Hurd (Leicester), S Skinner (Edinburgh), G Brown (Glasgow), M Fagerson (Glasgow), J Dobie (Glasgow), S McDowall (Glasgow).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It means Townsend is going to stick with the 6-2 split between forwards and backs, even after the strategy backfired against Ireland after the two injuries meant their spare scrum half Jamie Dobie ended up playing most of the game on the wing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are going to be a lot of contestable kicks, and when teams kick to you, you naturally end up doing more kicking. And if the game does develop into a real contest on the floor, we also know we’ve got the personnel there to make sure we’re taking those opportunities.”Townsend was not too concerned about any of the pundits’ pre-match chit-chat about whether or not Scotland’s forwards are underpowered. He has the confidence of a coach whose team have now won four of these games in four years.“It’s great to be able to be part of a Scotland team that has been winning against England because in my time as a player and a supporter that didn’t happen very often,” he said, “but they’re favourites because playing at home is so important, on the back of a very good win, too.”So long as Russell is fit to play, you guess Scotland are absolutely fine with it being that way.Explore more on these topicsScotland rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Rugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is unlikely to play again this season and, as he will be out of action when Andy Farrell names his British & Irish Lions squad, Feyi-Waboso’s chances of touring Australia are hanging by a thread.Finn Russell fit to face England as Scotland name side for Six Nations clashRead moreThe 22-year-old has been at the centre of a saga over the past two months and Exeter made their feelings clear on Thursday with a terse statement that revealed the wing aggravated his shoulder in a rehab session with England during the first rest week of theSix Nations. Steve Borthwick had hoped that Feyi-Waboso might be available for the back end of England’s campaign but he is now set to be out until late May.The England assistant coach Richard Wigglesworth said: “We needed to make sure he was going to be right so he got tested properly here, significantly tested. It wasn’t right so then the surgery option then came. As an attack coach, I would be lying [if I didn’t think] ‘It would be nice if Manny was …’ but it wasn’t like that. There were all these hurdles that he was going to have to get over and failed at one, a fair bit away from returning to play. Part of being a professional rugby player is that you have to deal with these things. Knowing Manny as we do, he’ll be diligent, he’ll get back, and we’ll look forward to when he is.”The Professional Game Partnership – signed last summer and worth £33m a year to the clubs – is a step towards central contracts and gives Borthwick a greater degree of control over the 17 players, including Feyi-Waboso, on enhanced deals. Crucially, they also give him “final say” over all sports science matters including operations.The Feyi-Waboso saga is a messy one in what can be considered the first major test of the PGP. Soon after Feyi-Waboso suffered the injury, Exeter were keen for him to undergo surgery and the club booked him for an operation. It was believed that was the player’s preferred option. It then transpired he would have a second scan which raised two possibilities: to have surgery or to attempt to rehab his shoulder without the operation and potentially returning for the back end of the Six Nations.View image in fullscreenRichard Wigglesworth, England’s attack coach, talks to the players during a training session at Pennyhill Park.Photograph: Dan Mullan/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesWhen naming his squad for the Six Nations on 14 January, Borthwick said unequivocally that Feyi-Waboso would be having surgery but that did not prove to be the case due to a delay in the process. Amid that delay, the Exeter wing went down the rehab route and Borthwick was adamant it was the “player’s decision”. When called into camp last week, England put him through a series of tests; Feyi-Waboso reinjured his shoulder and finally went under the knife on Wednesday.It raises questions as to why two months elapsed between Feyi-Waboso sustaining the injury and having surgery and why there has been such confusion. The PGP was supposed to give Borthwick greater control, and with it clarity, but having three parties involved has drawn out the process. “I think it certainly would have happened quicker, without doubt,” Exeter’s director of rugby Rob Baxter said in January. “We had things booked, ready to go, decisions ready to be made a week ago, and then the process you have to go through now has certainly slowed things down.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Martin has started England’s last 11 matches but, having been unable to train last week, he was dropped to the bench with Leicester clubmate Ollie Chessum replacing him in the starting XV. After a setback in training, however, Martin drops out of the 23 with Hill in line to win his third cap and his first in four years.The 25-year-old is a flanker by trade but fills in at lock for Bath sporadically and England’s captain and second-row Maro Itoje is in no doubt as to Hill’s qualities. “He is a player I have admired for a number of years, seeing him do his thing at Worcester and then at Bath,” Itoje said. “In his last stint with England I also played with him there. He is a supreme athlete. He looks like Clark Kent and Superman with his glasses. He is a man carved out of Greek stone. I am very happy that I hopefully get an opportunity to play with him.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamRugby unionSix NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Colombia, then Australia and Japan await the USWNT, who will test their mettle with a mix of new names and trusted talent in the 10th SheBelieves Cup.Ahead of the game, one lasting veteran with a sharp wit, tenacious style, and too-often unsung impact will be honored for reaching 100 caps: 31-year-old Georgia native Emily Sonnett.Sonnett’s positional forays include time at full-back, center-back and defensive midfielder. That versatility has helped influence Sonnett’s staying power in one of the world’s elite sports teams. In the words of star forward Sophia Smith during atraining sessionfrom October: “This is our girl. She’s played every role for this team you could possibly think of, and we love her.”How Catarina Macario’s USWNT return and young prospects will impact SheBelieves CupRead moreSpeaking to the Guardian, Sonnett described her evolution as the natural byproduct of a fiercely competitive environment.“I sometimes joke, it’s kind of like survival of the fittest,” she says. “How can I accumulate all these positions? Because that’s the point that I’m in, in my career, to be able to make rosters, to become desirable to make rosters … I enjoy playing center-back, but I also enjoy understanding that I fill a lot of roles, and if that allows me to play and serve the team in a way, I can do that.”Sonnett was selected first overall in the 2016 NWSL Draft by Portland Thorns, and helped the west coast juggernauts win the NWSL championship the following season. She has won two NWSL championships, one NWSL Challenge Cup, was named to the NWSL Best XI in 2018, and NWSL Second XI in 2019.But as ever-present as she has been, Sonnett’s entry to the USWNT was far from a given.“I think the one thing I think about for my personal journey, it didn’t come quickly, she said. “I wasn’t seeing starts or a lot of game time early on. I actually never thought I’d reach 100 caps. I’ve never been a true starter for this team. So maybe that created a little more of this work ethic that you have to bring excellence every day to make rosters, to make the game day roster, just for friendlies, to even get on the field. If you’re bringing that step-by-step, goal-oriented mentality, you might accidentally stay around for a little longer than you think.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a run that includes two World Cups, two Olympics and myriad international tournaments beyond that. But her experience and example may prove even more essential than ever before.This February, with NWSL still in preseason, just 12 of the US’s 22 gold medalists are on the SheBelieves Cup roster. As Hayes looks to build a wider pool of talent, she’s named four uncapped players, and 10 who’ve clocked four or fewer appearances for the USWNT. Sonnett is one of just three players with 100 caps or more in camp (and one of six with over 30), making her a clear veteran in the squad.Earlier this month, in an interview with US veteran Ali Krieger on ESPN, Emma Hayes described Sonnett as “someone who is diligent in the background, is always doing everything she can possibly do. And my message is, be ready.”“I’m probably someone who leads a lot by example, and being coachable,” Sonnett says. “How can I do my best to be seen by other new players or returning players? So that’s like a constant reminder for everyone that we have to be working hard, but also applying what we’re learning.”Sonnett describes the present moment with Hayes as one where layers of complexity are continually added in, as the team builds toward their next big run in 2027.“I think what I really appreciate about Emma and her staff, they’re always forward thinking, always layering in,” Sonnett says. “I think the Olympics was the tip of the iceberg of how they can teach in such a short amount of time.”Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamUS sportsWomen's footballEmma HayesShareReuse this content"

We convened a panel of writers to discuss what they’re most looking forward to this yearAlexander Abnos,Jon Arnold,Joseph LoweryandGraham RuthvenThu 20 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTShareI’m most excited about…Seeingmore really good soccerin 2025. Over the last few years, it feels like the quality of the average coach inMLShas noticeably increased. Only a handful of MLS teams are still holding on to the “let’s play a 4-2-3-1 and defend in a mid-block” era with both hands. Pretty much every team has a distinct, observable style.JWThe rich getting richer. While not in line with my typical rooting interests, MLS has needed a super team or two to emerge to give fans someone to root against. Now, there are more ways than ever for teams that want to spend big to do so. Sure enough, we go into the year with tons of interest (and a fair amount of opposition to) heavy-hitters such asInter Miami, LAFC and the defending champion LA Galaxy.JAAtlanta United being good again. When they first came into the league, everything about this club felt like the future of MLS. Exciting football. Big-name signings who weren’t ageing European stars. Sell-out crowds at an incredible stadium. And yet at some point Atlanta lost their way. This year, though, they have spent $30m on top-end talent and have a proven MLS winner for a head coach.Atlanta Unitedmatter again.GRIt’s all aboutthe next weird moment. MLS’s unpredictability is a big part of what makes it a compelling league to watch, on a season-long, week-to-week and even play-to-play basis. There is less variance now than there was before, sure, but the league still retains that special bit of wackiness that can only come about when the quality isn’t the best in the world and payrolls are capped. I want goals scored off unexpected body parts and major upsets in the playoffs. I wantblizzards,as many raccoonsas possible, and the addition of some new cult heroes to the lore.AAView image in fullscreenMiami won the Supporters’ Shield in 2024, for the best regular season record in MLS.Photograph: David Santiago/APHow many trophies, and which ones, will Messi and Inter Miami lift?(They can get up to five: MLS Cup, Supporters’ Shield, Club World Cup, Leagues Cup, Concacaf Champions Cup)Two?Two. This Inter Miami squad should be among the favorites for all of these, save the Club World Cup where getting out of the group would be quite the feat. But with fine margins separating the domestic and continental favorites (and with a bit of PTSD from watching Miami flail in knockout tournaments last season), I’m limiting myself to theShieldandMLS Cuphere.JLOne. Given the huge teams at the Club World Cup, the slog of the MLS season for a team reliant on veteran players (with considerable injury histories) and the unknown of how Javier Mascherano will lead a senior team after having only coached Argentina youth squads in the past, I’m only envisioning one trophy lift. Put me down for Miami to top América in theChampions Cupfinal of Concacaf’s dreams.JAHow USL can rival MLS: quirks, streaming and, yes, promotion and relegationRead moreJustone. Maybe I’ve watched too much of Manchester City lose their battle against their own mortality this season, but Lionel Messi and co. are another year older. And they’ll face a gruelling schedule with the (pointless) Club World Cup smack bang in the middle. Can Messi stay injury free? Will Luis Suárez’s knees hold out? I have concerns over their ability to win multiple trophies, but they will winMLS Cup.GRIn a perfect world where nobody gets injured, conditions are flawless, and every new signing acclimatises in short order, I think Miami get three of these five trophies. In the real world, I’m going to be the designated hater here and sayzero. I just have too many questions about the ability of an inexperienced coach like Javier Mascherano to make all the right adjustments at the right times to win the Shield, like Tata Martino did masterfully last season. Meanwhile, the health of the big four is far from a guarantee, and I still don’t trust this team defensively even with some new additions.AAView image in fullscreenEmmanuel Latte Lath joined Atlanta United from Middlesbrough this offseason.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThe trend that will define MLS in 2025…Speed.Really, this trend defined last offseason for the eventual MLS Cup championLA Galaxy, when they added two blazing wingers in Gabriel Pec and Joseph Paintsil. With that in mind, it wasn’t a shock to see Atlanta United load up on speed this winter, adding Emmanuel Latte Lath and Miguel Almirón. MLS is getting faster, and Atlanta will benefit from getting ahead of the curve, much like the Galaxy did in 2024.JLAmbition.While it would be great to see every MLS team in the US Open Cup, the new system that sees some teams play Leagues Cup and others in the historic cup competition will give more teams more to play for. It may make for stranger rosters in league matches as the fixtures start to stack up but ultimately will make things exciting for longer in more MLS cities.JACould a new rule finally give MLS much-needed transfer gossip?Read more‘Cash-for-player’ trades.The new transfer mechanismthat has already facilitated intra-league deals for Luciano Acosta, Evander, Dejan Joveljić and Jack McGlynn, but the impact could be even greater in the summer window when clubs and GMs have had more time to figure out what and who they want. MLS has needed something like this rule for a long time.GRThe end of expansion.The addition of San Diego FC brings the league to an even 30 teams, and for the first time in a generation there does not seem to be a push to add any more. That means 2025 can fairly be seen as the beginning of a new era – one in which won’t be aSeattle Soundersor Atlanta United walking through the door to shake up the way things are done upon introduction. Any innovations from here on must come from within (or via takeover).AAView image in fullscreenGregg Berhalter’s first stop after his USMNT job is with the Chicago Fire.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesThe most impactful offseason addition will be…Gregg Berhalter. Look, I don’t think theChicago Fireare going to be great in 2025. They’re at least one good window away from being a top-tier team. I also don’t love the idea of giving one person sporting and coaching control of an MLS team in 2025. But Berhalter has, wisely, cleaned house and added five starters, including Ivory Coast winger and former Lille standout Jonathan Bamba. He’ll bring a useful tactical approach to the table, too. A sleeping giant is stirring.JLBrandon Vázquez. The 26-year-old California native became surplus to requirements at Monterrey, but mostly not for anything he did wrong. Now, he’s going to lead the line for an Austin team that has totally retooled the rest of its attack and should give him plenty of service that he can turn into goals – just like he did during his previous MLS stops.JAEric Ramsay’s road from Shrewsbury to Minnesota via Manchester UnitedRead moreChris Henderson, who was lured from Inter Miami to reunite with Garth Lagerwey (with whom he worked in Seattle) and head up Atlanta United’s roster rebuild. An MLS Cup champion as a player with the 2000 Kansas City Wizards, Henderson is widely considered the best executive in MLS. He wasted no time in making a splash, breaking the league transfer record to sign Latte Lath and bringing Almirón back to ATL after a spell at Newcastle United. Both additions will make Atlanta much stronger.GREvander.It’s not often that a great team can jettison the talisman powering their success and improve as a result, but that might be whatFC Cincinnatihave managed by dealing Acosta to FC Dallas, then acquiring Evander from Portland in a $12m cash trade. The Brazilian scored 15 goals with 15 assists for a Timbers team without the type of well-rounded supporting cast Cincy boasts, and in Kévin Denkey he’ll have an ideal target striker to play off of.AAEast playoff teams:Unanimous:Atlanta United, Charlotte FC, Chicago Fire, FC Cincinnati, Columbus Crew, Inter Miami, Orlando City,New York Red Bulls.Lowery and Ruthven:Philadelphia Union.Arnold and Abnos:NYC FC.West playoff teams:Unanimous:Colorado Rapids, Houston Dynamo, LA Galaxy, LAFC,Minnesota United, Seattle Sounders.Lowery:Austin FC,Real Salt Lake, San Diego FC.Arnold:Austin FC, Saint Louis City,San Jose Earthquakes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without the Copa América interrupting his club season, Messi will hit 30 goals in 2025.JLDenis Bouanga.The spoils will be shared in Miami, but Bouanga will be the main man in LA – provided they can keep him in southern California all year. He can again hit 20 goals even if (especially if?) he gets another big-name summer acquisition to help him out this year.JABouanga.LAFC may be under-utilising Olivier Giroud due to manager Steve Cherundolo’s approach, but their attacking game is funnelled through Bouanga in open space. He’s scored 45 goals over the last two seasons. He’ll be prolific once more in 2025.GRMessi.Even far from his peak, the World Cup winner’s technique and reading of the game alone mean he’ll be in position to match and probably top his goal count from last season.AAFor Inter Miami and Lionel Messi, a club-defining season awaitsRead moreMVPMessi.The dude won the MVP award in fewer than 1,500 minutes last year. He barely has to step on the field to lock this one up with the voters. In a non-Messi world, though, Pec, Bouanga, and Evander are all top-tier MVP candidates.JLMessi.With no Copa América and World Cup qualification mostly locked up, we should have even more moments of Messi magic this year than last – and last year he did enough to win over the voters.JAMessi.The guy is the greatest of all-time. I’m doubtful he’ll play enough minutes to finish as top scorer, but nobody can deliver a moment of magic like the Inter Miami No 10.GRPec.He’ll take on a much bigger role for the defending champs with Riqui Puig out for most of the year recovering from a torn ACL, and he showed last season that even playing alongside Puig he can rack up the game-winning contributions. That said … I’ll admit I’m saying this mostly to break up the Messi monotony. If he can win MVP playing the lowest percentage of his team’s games of any MVP in the history of North American men’s pro sports and with his team doing just as well without him, it’s likely all he needs to do in the eyes of voters is exist.AALionel Messi has missed half the MLS season. Should he be MVP?Read moreSupporters’ ShieldInter Miami.I don’t expect them to get quite so hot in front of goal this year, so setting another points record is off the table. But after Miami shored up the backline this winter? I’m having a really hard time betting against a team that I think is the deepest and most talented MLS has ever seen.JLLAFC.As other contenders deal with the Club World Cup or other competitions, I expect LAFC to put plenty of focus on the league. With a deep roster comfortable with Cherundolo, they can lift the trophy again.JALAFC.There’s a big question mark over Cherundolo’s ability to navigate past the best teams in the biggest matches, but LAFC’s depth will make them a regular season powerhouse, just as it did in 2024.GRFC Cincinnati.This team returns most of the team from a solid 2024 but with upgrades at playmaker (Evander), striker (Denkey), and left back (Lukas Engel). All that, and Matt Miazga returns from injury to anchor the backline. Their defensive depth makes me a little wary, but overall I think they have all the tools to maintain good form over the course of a long season.AAView image in fullscreenThe LA Galaxy lifted their sixth MLS Cup in club history last season.Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesMLS CupSigh. I’m no fun. It’sInter Miamiagain, for the reasons I just listed above. Still, because the margins are razor-thin in MLS just like always, FC Cincinnati, LAFC, the Seattle Sounders, and the LA Galaxy are all great picks here, too.JLGive me theSeattle Sounders,a team that has retooled in typical fashion, often gathers steam in the second half of the year and should be forged in the fire of knockout competition by the time the playoffs roll around after taking part in the CCC and Club World Cup.JAInter Miami.Boooooring, I know. But Brad Guzan won’t stand on his head in another Round One match. Mascherano might be more proactive in rotating his ageing stars throughout the regular season. Ultimately, Messi and his mates will get their moment of glory and the symbolic image MLS can use to say the whole thing was worth it.GRAtlanta United.It’s going to take time for a new head coach’s ideas to take root, but that head coach, Ronny Deila, has experience turning a just-decent regular season into an MLS Cup (NYC FC, 2021). With Latte Lath on board and Almirón back in familiar confines, there are plenty of reasons to think that the cup will return to Atlanta after some years in the wilderness.AAExplore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsAtlanta UnitedAustin FCCharlotte FCChicago FireFC CincinnatiShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ask any DJ what their most important bit of kit is and they’ll tell you it’s what goes around their head. Whether playing off a laptop, CDJs or decks, a pair of decent headphones is your portal to the mix and an essential element to get right.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Luckily, we’ve assembled some of the world’s best selectors to evangelise about the pairs they’re faithful to: from reliable specialist brands to old-school one-ear models, these are the best DJ headphones for crystal-clear sound and to hear that all-important bass.DJs on their favourite headphonesSennheiser HD 25View image in fullscreen£129 at Sennheiser£117 at AmazonI love bass, bass, bass and bass – andSennheisershear my call. I first bought these headphones in 1993 and I now use the HD 25-C-II model. They’re perfect for someone with a little head and ears who requires a fat bottom-end and crystal-clear monitoring. The sound has to have the capacity to push through the noise in a festival space and yet be accurate in a quieter, more intimate setting, and the Sennheiser’s small closed-ear cup gives the best sound isolation.They have to work hard and need to be ridiculously durable, as they’re taken on and off my head repeatedly through each set – the 3m spiral cable (or as I fondly call it, the curly pigtail extension cable) has been an essential lifeline, giving me a huge range of movement. And did I say they take a hammering? They may look cheap and plasticky, but the build is hard to beat and every part is replaceable. They are hard-wearing and hard-working.DJ PauletteReloop RHP-10 MonoView image in fullscreen£57 at Thomann£59 at AmazonI stayed away from lollipops for a long time because these one-ear headphones were always seen as kind of a New York thing – everyone was following Larry Levan. You’re going to buy a Fender Stratocaster because you love Jimi Hendrix; if you love basketball then you’re going to wear whatever LeBron James is wearing. Larry was the superstar DJ at the time, and everybody followed suit. But I’m from Detroit.One of the main reasons I started using a lollipop, though, has to do with protecting my hearing. Most of us DJs play far too loud, not only in the booth but also to hear what we’re cueing. When I would have headphones strapped around my head all the time, they were hurting my ears. With a lollipop, I don’t need to have it on all the time; often I just hold it with my hand.I use Reloops because they’re cheap and utilitarian. It doesn’t have to look sexy, I’m not taking it out to dinner. Let’s look at it like a hammer: it doesn’t need to be titanium, it just needs to do the job. I have some headphones that are $2,000 and I can stand up on stage and everybody’ll think, “Oh my God, he’s so great with those headphones on.” But no, Reloops do the job. I don’t really care about anything else.Carl CraigTechnics EAH-DJ1200View image in fullscreen£139 at Discdjstore£169 at AmazonHeadphones are possibly the most important thing for a DJ to get right. I’ve been using these Technics ones for more than 20 years – the same make as the legendary turntables. The bass sounds really good through them, and I rarely take them off; I just move the headphones past my ears and over my head to hear the monitors. They’re not too bulky, either, and they’re good value for money. The only downside is that in summer the leather headband can get sweaty when the temperature in the club gets hotter. But it hasn’t stopped me from wearing them for most of my career.SeverinoPioneer HDJ-X7View image in fullscreen£179 at Selfridges£161 at AmazonThere are new models of these headphones available but I got these in 2017. I like comfort and want something that’s going to hug my ear. These can flip around and fold up – there are so many nice elements – but they’re really comfortable, which is the main thing. Sometimes, you get headphones that are too tight or too loose. With these, I can have one can on my ear and one on the side of my head, and it’ll sit there nicely.I think you have to splash out on DJ headphones. You can’t go too cheap because you won’t hear what you need to. You need quality of sound. For me, it’s the bass. I need to be able to hear that kick drum because that’s what you mix with. And then everything else needs to be clear, otherwise it’s distorted, especially in a club – because you have to have it quite loud. Most of us now wear ear defenders, so then you have to have the music in the headphones even louder.These have got a bit of gravitas. They’ve got a weight behind them, and they’re sturdy but comfortable.

The good thing about them is that they’re modular: you can buy a new lead or earpieces separately, which is essential when you’re using them all the time. My headphones generally only used to last about a year (because normally the lead connection would get loose, as you move around a lot behind the decks and the headphone wire gets pulled a fair amount), but the Aiaiais have lasted a lot longer. Apart from the obvious – sound quality (and these are also great to listen to music with at home/travelling/in the studio) – the key feature I look for is whether the headphones will stay on my teeny head. Most brands just fall off!Sophie LloydAudio-Technica ATH-M50xView image in fullscreen£115 at Advanced MP3 Players£127 at AmazonDurability is important to me as my headphones get thrown in record bags etc, so they need to be sturdy – and the M50xs came highly recommended. I love them because they don’t break. They also have a rich, full sound: headphones should make you feel like you’re immersed in the music and able to notice the slightest detail in the mix.These headphones also double up as ear defenders: I remember plonking myself in the middle of the New Regency Orchestra, an 18-piece band that I direct, as we were recording the horn section live. I had the mix of the rhythm section in my ears and was listening to the horns blowing on top through the cans – they certainly protected my ears from being in the direct line of fire of the 12 horns blowing in my face! Plus, they go over the ears and keep them warm, which is handy when I’m DJing in a church for my event Church of Sound – it can get chilly in the winter!Lex BlondinPioneer HDJ-CUE1View image in fullscreen£60 at Argos£54.99 at AmazonI bought these headphones in 2021, and they’ve survived countless festival fields and dark clubs since. A friend recommended them as a great entry-level pair to start getting a bit more serious with. Despite buying other headphones, I do keep finding myself coming back to them more often than not: they do a great job and are Pioneers’ most affordable model. I need them to be comfortable. Great sound, obviously. But also something that can pack down nicely to fit in a bumbag. They’re really flexible, clear on the low end and the finish is clean.Rohan RakhitSony MDR-7506View image in fullscreen£95 at Gear4music£82.56 at AmazonI bought these while I was on tour about a decade ago because I had lost my other headphones. They were less expensive and I had seen people using them. I still have the same ones all these years later because they’re good quality and unpretentious.You can replace the ear cushions, which wear out with heavy use. They also have a cable that looks like an old-school telephone cable, so there’s some flexibility. Also, I think they look cool: simple, functional, not too “aesthetic” like some boutique ‘phones. They’re also quite slick, not some giant silver plastic thing that has EDM written all over it.I can use them also for vocal recordings because they have closed cups, which is the standard headphone style that you will find in most studios. If aliens would arrive on this planet and would ask me what a headphone is, I would probably show them this one.Matias AguayoDJ Paulette’s book, Welcome to the Club, ison sale now.

Even armed with a sword several times your own size and weight, you are often outmatched by the incredible creatures in this action game. In Monster Hunter Wilds, out next week, you are also frequently outmatched by the weather. A routine hunt for some relatively unthreatening creature can go awry as storm clouds gather, bringing with them some terrifying lightning-dragon that will eat you for breakfast. Monsters entangle with each other, tearing with teeth and claws as you turn tail and head for the hills.Over the past couple of weekends, players have been able to get hands-on with Wilds in beta tests, trying out the exquisite character creator and a couple of hunts against a horrid lion (Doshaguma) and an overgrown poisonous chicken (Gypceros). As someone old enough to have played these games on the PlayStation 2, and then later with my fingers contorted uncomfortably around a PlayStation Portable during a student year abroad in Japan, I am amazed and delighted by what Monster Hunter has become. What was once a stiff and densely complex game that hid all its thrills behind a barricade of mushroom-gathering quests is now a fluid, inviting and globally popular spectacle of a thing.Monster Hunter World, 2018’s entry, broke Capcom records and reached 23m sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Evidently it still excites him; he’s been front and centre on a lot of Wilds’ promotion. “It’s really energising for our team to watch so many people play the game at the same time,” he told me at the most recent Tokyo Game Show, where over 250,000 people turned up to try out forthcoming games. “There’s a lot of things we can only discover by watching players pick up the game and try it out, things we don’t ever get to see in our own testing. We’ve got a few of the dev team undercover on the booth so they can watch how players are responding.”Ryozo Tsujimoto takes players through the Monster Hunter Wilds beta testThe main innovation in Wilds is how the monsters interact with each other. Previously herbivores would potter about grazing in herds, but it’s only with the additional power of the current generation of consoles that the team had been able to create a seamless ecosystem where they’ll come across each other and get into turf wars. “Having creatures travel together in a realistic way is challenging in terms of making it look plausible,” says Yuya Tokuda, Wilds’ director. “If they all moved in perfect sync it would be a bit uncanny and unconvincing as a pack animal behaviour. But if each individual monster was a complete wildcard, like they were before, it would be untenable to keep it all together. Striking that balance between herd and pack behaviours while having individuality for each creature … that was a lot of work, and we had to get it going from nothing.”‘Even more vicious and threatening than before’: the fantastical creatures of Monster Hunter WildsRead more“I think it’s finally let us make the humans be part of the same ecosystem as everything else in the game,” adds Kaname Fujioka, the art director. “The depiction of a totally seamless ecosystem where there’s not even a loading screen between the base and the map itself is something that has only been possible on this generation.”Monster Hunter’s creators have traditionally done their natural-behaviour research out in the real world on a kind of global team safari, getting a feel for different natural surroundings and recording ambient soundscapes that would later appear in the games. They’ve been to Argentina, Chile and Patagonia, places so remote that they had to subscribe to a satellite phone service because their phones wouldn’t work. This time around, Covid restrictions kicked in right around the time that they would have been out on these research expeditions, so they had to make do with watching a lot of nature documentaries – except Tokuda, who has what he describes as a “significant number” of pet lizards. He has created a special environment at home for them to roam around.View image in fullscreenMonster Hunter Wilds.Photograph: CapcomExpectations are high for Wilds. Its publisher Capcom is on a run at the moment, having had several more big hits since the last Monster Hunter game in 2018, including popular remakes of its older Resident Evil horror titles – but Monster Hunter remains its makers’ very biggest game. In fact it’s now one of the world’s biggest. At one point during its first open beta test last November, more than 460,000 people were playing Wilds at the same time.Tsujimoto is confident that Worlds can hold its own among gaming’s apex predators. “Any big blockbuster game is our competition now,” says Tsujimoto. “That’s the turf we’ve chosen.”Monster Hunter Wilds is out 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So exciting, in fact, it’s kept players coming back to the Tomb Raider series for nearly three decades. Theoriginal trilogywas successfully remastered and rereleased last year. Now a new collection has been recovered from the attic and put on show, like a family heirloom on the Antiques Roadshow. But will this turn out to be the gaming equivalent of a priceless Ming vase? Or a commemorative ashtray from when Prince Andrew married Fergie?A lot will depend on your personal history with Lara Croft. Those of us who wasted entire English Literature degrees watching her fall off things will thrill at the sight of every rusty key and sinister spike pit. My 13-year-old son, however, took one look at the blocky visuals, asked if I definitely had the enhanced graphics turned on, and walked out of the room shaking his head in pity. Bloody kids.There are three games in this collection. The standout title is Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation. First released in 1999, it is set in the ruins of ancient Egypt, which feels equally long ago. Like all the best games in the series, it combines expansive, atmospheric environments with smart puzzles that are satisfying to solve. There are some lovely moments of Lara lore, like the scene that explains how she got her iconic leather backpack. (Although not how it’s able to contain six guns, eight medipacks, countless keys, the Amulet of Horus, a grenade launcher and a kayak.)View image in fullscreenEgypt reveals its treasures in Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered.Photograph: AspyrAt the time of launch, Last Revelation was criticised for lacking innovation. But looking back, and at what came next, maybe we didn’t know how good we had it. Bloody kids.Chronicles was the fifth Tomb Raider game released in five years. The team at Derby-based studio Core Design was burned out, by all accounts, and fed up with being forced to deliver yet another instalment in time for Christmas. The result is a game that is technically serviceable, but feels flat and soulless. The locations are uninspired and devoid of atmosphere. The visuals are bland and gloomy. It feels like Lara is just going through the motions. She can walk a tightrope now, and there’s a bit of stealth, as was the fashion at the time. But these are tedious tricks, and they aren’t enough to distract from the fact that the magic is gone.However, it’s the final offering which marks the low point of this collection, and the entire series. The Angel of Darkness was the first Tomb Raider outing for PS2. It was released in 2003, which you can tell just by looking at it. The game opens on a rainy evening in Paris, apparently; the dismal industrial buildings and empty warehouses make it feel like a damp night in Croydon. Lara is a vision in double denim, complete with the obligatory cropped jacket and hiphugging bootcut jeans of the era. It feels like you’re on a quest to find out what happened to the other members of B*Witched.View image in fullscreenStealthily does it … Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered.Photograph: AspyrMaybe the tightness of the clothes have restricted Lara’s ability to navigate environments with her usual grace and dexterity. Her movements are sluggish and clunky in this game, her jumps awkward. She is weaker than she’s ever been; a new stamina meter limits her ability to hang off ledges, and you have to build up her strength by pushing crates around before she can handle more physically taxing tasks. This is as dull and annoying as it sounds.Lara has a new love interest, Kurtis, who is incredibly irritating and looks like he plays bass for Linkin Park. (Maybe they met at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party.) There’s more stealth nonsense, which involves Lara crouching slightly as though she’s suffering from digestive issues, and a badly executed attempt to introduce some open world elements. The whole thing is messy, frustrating and depressing.It’s also intriguing if you’re interested in the history of video games and how they’re made. Yes, there’s a clear failure to maintain what made Tomb Raider so special in the first place: Lara’s agility and autonomy, clever puzzles, actual tombs. This game is too busy trying to keep up with the Joneses; or rather, the Metal Gear Solids and Grand Theft Autos that were so popular at the time. But there are also hints at ideas that series such as Assassin’s Creed and Uncharted would go on to execute brilliantly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps it was the limitations of the technology at the time. Maybe it was poor team management, or the pressure to hit shareholder deadlines before the game was ready. Probably a combination of all these things. In any case, while The Angel of Darkness is tiresome to play, it’s interesting to look at as a historical artefact.The same is true of Chronicles, as an example of what happens when you try to produce creative work in a sweatshop. But The Last Revelation is vintage Tomb Raider. So for £25 you get a well-crafted, enjoyable game, a strange curio, and a flawed but fascinating piece of gaming history.

It’s to expose the regime’s criminalityThu 20 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 20.36 ESTSharePolitical power boils down to two things: votes and money. But when money buys presidents, senators and judges, votes are merely the sales receipts. What’s left is money, and the purpose of power is to get more of it.Trump’s non-billionaire followers appear thrilled that Elon Musk and his so-called “department of government efficiency” are burning down the government. “Imagine if Trump hadn’t met and talked with Elon Musk that all this progress on efficiency may not be taking place or at such a fast pace needed before the midterms,” comments holy666 on aFox News storyabout the mass layoffs of federal employees.Firings at the IRS elicit particular glee. Writes EnemyCitizen: “A beautiful thing about Mr Trump’s approach is that internal revenue will slow down and Congress will have to sober up and stop passing appropriations bills that apply our hard-earned money to frivolous political agendas. No more blank checks, Congress!”In fact, what the megalomaniacal multibillionaire is destroying is everything – minus the policing functions, of course – that we pay taxes for, including such frivolous agendas as food inspection, flood mitigation and Medicare. This is how kleptocracies work. Taxes are collected from the hoi polloi. The more benign government functions – housing the poor, postponing climate apocalypse – are abolished. But the rest of these functions do not entirely disappear. Rather, it is farmed out to private enterprise, which undertakes what it’s paid to do with minimum expense and maximum profit (and we all know corporations never commit waste, fraud or abuse).One of the diabolical features of an anti-state state like our current regime is its ability to turns acts of resistance against the state against themselvesWatchdogs are eliminated, bribery islegalized. The most corrupt carry off the greatest rewards. And bereft of revenue, social services wither, the infrastructure crumbles, and the prisons fill with the destitute and the resistant.Maga wants to starve the bureaucracy. But it still wants money. And with the wealthiest awaiting gigantic tax breaks, they need it from the rest of us. With the Internal Revenue Service in effect transformed into a shell corporation laundering the money of the ultra-rich, why should we pay taxes?The IRS is being speedily organized for this rerouting. Doge isaxingas many as 15,000 law-abiding and knowledgeable civil servants. It is trying to coerce the agency to give Elon’s AI-wielding AV squadunfettered accessto the system containing the personal and financial data of every American taxpayer, small business and non-profit.Not only would this arrangement provide an armory of intelligence to be deployed against the president’s enemies – according to alawsuitfiled by taxpayer advocates, unions and small business alliances, it would give Musk access to his rivals’ profit and loss statements, payrolls, tax records and information about IRS investigations into their (or his own) suspected tax fraud. “No other business owner on the planet has access to this kind of information on his competitors,” assert the plaintiffs, “and for good reason.”These are all good reasons to withhold your taxes.Can the tactic work? Is it right? Morally and politically motivated tax nonpayment has an honorable, if not always successful, history. After the Roman empire’s destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD Jewish people refused to pay Rome’s “temple tax”. Rome responded by destroying more temples.Gandhi’s salt tax protest, on the other hand, was the first step toward India’s independence from the British empire. The American Revolution was a tax revolt, and that worked – although some colonists resisted taxes levied by the revolutionaries and, after independence, the states as well.More recently, American opponents of wars, nukes and abortion have refused to pay all or portions of their taxes in protest. Many went to prison for it. InCivil Disobedience, Thoreau wrote of weighing the benefits and costs of any given action. He believed all taxation was illegitimate as long as the US condoned slavery. “If [the injustice] is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then I say, break the law,” he concluded.One of the diabolical features of an anti-state state like our current regime is its ability to turns acts of resistance against the state against themselves. Principled prosecutors and agency heads resign rather than carry out the president’s illegal orders – leaving only Maga flunkies in their places. Civil servants quit rather than pervert the services or science they’ve devoted their careers to – leaving the work unguarded and the workforce decimated, precisely as the wrecking crew intends.So it is with tax resistance. Every dollar that does not come into Washington’s coffers is justification to cut another dollar. You may remember that the vanguard of 21st century far right populism was the Tea party, an anti-tax movement.It’s never been more important to stay tuned in | Margaret SullivanRead moreIn theNew Republic, Liza Featherstone points out that the destruction of popular government programs is not “a goofy misstep on this administration’s part. Rather, it’s exactly the point.” Whether firing park rangers, defunding daycare centers, or deep-sixing job-creating clean-energy projects in red states, the programs’ “popularity is precisely what the Trump-Musk administration dislikes about them. For anti-government ideologues, it’s important that people not have good experiences with the government.”And if people have bad experiences with the government – if they contractbird flubecause the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no longer have the wherewithal to control and prevent disease; if bridges collapse because the funds to repair them are cut off – well, there’s proof that the government can’t do anything right, and deserves to be destroyed.In fact, after it outsources the government, the regime would be smart to keep calling it the government. When IRS.com loses a taxpayer’s refund and assigns a bot to sort out the problem, the taxpayer will blame IRS.gov.Thanks to intentional staff shortages at the IRS, your missing tax payment might go unnoticed, just as the Trump family’s multibillion-dollar fraud escaped the agency’s auditors for decades. But if tax evasion is a secretive act, tax resistance is civil disobedience, a public, political act. The reason to withhold your taxes is not to cheat the government of much-needed funds. It is not even to cheat the crooks now running the country, satisfying as that may be. It is to expose the criminality of what is being done – and not done – with the money the state has a legal and moral obligation to collect and then to distribute, to serve all the people.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five booksExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTax and spendingTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

In fact, I was the first example he gave of someone ruining women’s sport.“Last year”, he said while announcing hisKeeping Men Out of Women’s Sports executive order, “a male cyclist posing as a woman competed in the 800-mile Arizona Trail Race – a very big deal in cycling – and obliterated the women’s course record by nearly five and a half hours.”He’s right: I did snag the record from Alex Schultz (a man) who had previously bested the record held by Lael Wilcox (a woman). A few months after my effort, all of our paces were shattered by a Lithuanian ultra-distance phenom.You see, my interest in this event was spurred by its co-ed leaderboard. Events like the Arizona Trail Race are not bound by governing bodies in any traditional sense. The rules boil down to little more than “pedal alone and in good faith under your own power”. An event that involves riding across the length of Arizona and traversing the Grand Canyon with a bicycle on your back is as much a competition as an actualizing exercise for the masochists who choose to sublimate through sport.View image in fullscreenThe author at the Trek World Cup.Photograph: Dominique PowersNot that it got me anywhere, financially.My fleeting record run was the talk of two niche cycling publications, a few subreddits, and generated enough clout for an REI cashier to grant me a full refund on a pair of absolutely destroyed shoe gaiters. It failed to secure me anything meaningful like industry sponsorships – tangible support that would have made my pursuits in sport tenable.Instead, my winsonly served to generate more artifacts for the right’s culture wars, while I remained unable to garner even a sliver of the institutional recognition that friends and fellow competitors with similar palmares have found.Transgender people lost the inclusion battle in sport ages ago. International governing bodies for competitions inrunning,cycling,chess,swimming,dartsand more have repeatedly caved to pressure and helped shift the Overton window to exclude trans people from public life more broadly. The world’s least gracious winners insist on kicking sand in our eyes.Trump’s executive orderis a perfect scam: he and his acolytes get to talk endlessly about the fake specter of trans athletes “invading” women’s sports, while never putting any of their attention, immense political cache and funding access towards things that would meaningfully elevate the state of women’s sports. Instead, they get to fixate their hate and attention on every transsexual woman who dares show up to a rec T-ball league with her friends.Meanwhile, the women who simply want to compete and labor as athletes are left in the cold.In my field of cycling, conditions haven’t been this dire in ages if you’re a woman in the US trying to progress to the vaunted European peloton. Last year saw the shuttering of two institutions: theJoe Martin Stage Racewent from postponed to falling off thecalendarafter 46 years, and the longest-running women’s professional team, DNA Pro Cycling,closed up shopafter 12 years of being the premier pipeline for American women hoping to advance to the international peloton. For women looking for a team or a race that could potentially catapult their career forward, things are the worst they have been in thelast decade.View image in fullscreen‘My winsonly served to generate more artifacts for the right’s culture wars.’Photograph: Dominique PowersConsider this: when you watch a professional race, it’s common for an announcer to regale spectators with the resumes of the women on the start line. Many of them are record-shattering athletesandalso hold full-time jobs as doctors, researchers orinvestment bankers. These remarks always come in good faith, but as a means of contrasting us against the men – who usually have enough money and support thrown behind them to make a living as athletes – they speak to the sad state of affairs in women’s sport.And soon, things for women’s sports will get even worse. Because it bears repeating, as clearly as possible: their project contains no measures that help female athletes at the professional level as laborers, and certainly nothing that even gestures towards new investment opportunities for girls pursuing their dream. It’s a free market that devalues women’s labor at every turn.In fact, the only action items referencing funding simply establishes a precedent forrescindingmoney from organizations investing in women and girls who have given their lives and bodies to sport. In this new reality, all women lose. In fact, everyone loses – except for the people cashing checks and amassing political power.They found a scapegoat, and all they have done is enrich themselves withfive-figure speaking fee tours, while taking the oxygen out of the room. The only lane they’ve made is one that encourages women to quit competing fora life of news appearances and college campus speaking tours.They are, for lack of a better word, cowards who don’t want to do the actual work of empowering and supporting athletes.So my argument is quite simple. Maybe you take umbrage with trans people in sports, and in turn me (whatever, you won that battle). But if you purport to care about women’s sports, about girls getting a fair chance at competing, you need to ask yourself why, at the height of a historic moment of sweeping and unchecked austerity measures, the loudest and wealthiest people in the room have built a movement that culminated in this: an executive order that establishes a precedent to strip funding away from women in sport.Explore more on these topicsCyclingOpinionWomenTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a sustained act of civil disobedience by the civil service. Amid the malignant lies of the current regime, federal workers are steadily telling the truth.This strategy is more methodical than it at first seems. Yes, the distress andanger among federal workersis palpable. But the more anarchy Donald Trump’s executive orders and Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) operation loose upon the world, the firmer the federal employees are standing. Their protest might even be seen as a political short squeeze.Starting on 28 January, federal employees refused to leave their posts in spite of Musk’s campaign to bully them out. On the subreddit for federal employees, they exhortedeach othernot to quit. Their rallying cry soon became: “Hold the line, don’t resign.” Although 2 million workers were pressured to quit, only 75,000 of them took what looked like a sketchy “buyout” deal.Then, this past week, when on the job mass firings started, staying at work became impossible.Thousands of employees,many of them with excellent performance reviews, were terminated on the hollow pretext that their “performance has not been adequate to justify further employment”.But as these employees cleared out their desks, a vocal group refused to vacate their faith in the civil service’s excellence. They have, in short, opposed the lie that they and their colleagues are being fired for cause. In this way, they’ve converged on the policy that Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the great Soviet dissident, called “personal non-participation in lies”.Musk’s rampage through government shows us how we can finally close the book on what Trumpism is all about | Osita NwanevuRead moreOn Reddit,one posterencouraged federal employees to think with a view to the public record. They should write letters, the poster urged, on behalf of the “trashed colleagues”. It was imperative to put on paper that these colleagues “did indeed have good performance despite the firing”.The poster offered a list of reasons to write these letters, among them that references help workers get new jobs. But the biggest reason to praise colleagues who have been fired under false pretenses is that, as the poster wrote, “it’s the truth.”This campaign to tell the truth is not the work of to-the-barricades types. Those being harassed, demonized and fired are middle-class workers in agencies established by elected officials in Congress. Their remit includesconducting cancer research,preventing firesandsupporting veterans. By refusing to let Doge distort their service as wasteful or inadequate, they have taken a stand that the rest of us should emulate.Solzhenitsyn believed ideology itself was built of lies – the delusion that human society can be remade, from the top down, by social engineers serving an autocrat. This is exactly the kind of program spelled out inProject 2025and being enacted by Trump’s increasingly totalitarian executive orders.Right now, it’s hard to imagine Musk or Trump will ever go bust. But emperors rise and fall. Those two have bet against America“Our path is not to give conscious support to lies about anything whatsoever,” Solzhenitsyn wrote in a 1974 essay called Live Not by Lies. “Though lies embrace everything, we will be obstinate in this smallest of matters: Let them embrace everything, but not with any help from me.”In more 2025 terms, the civil service appears to be initiating a kind of short squeeze on the broligarchy. This is a maneuver akin to the so-called Gamestop affair of 2021, in which tiny-dollar investors banded together to put the screws to major hedge funds.During the pandemic, funds like Melvin and White Square were sellingGameStopshort – betting on it to fail. Keith Gill, a young financial educator, believed they were wrong, and he put his money on the company. Others wanted in. Not only was the video game store a fan favorite, but, in bleak Covid days, there was something inspiring about being believers in solidarity as opposed to friendless fatalists.Sound familiar? To stand with the US’s civil service today – to continue to believe in a government of, by, and for the people – is a risk. Not only will your wise-guy friends sneer at you, but you could miss out. If the big payouts are in nihilistic plays like crypto or Maga or Project 2025, you’ll feel like a jerk for putting your chips on dippy stuff like making roads and helping the poor.View image in fullscreen‘Their dominant slogan was just like that of the federal workers: “Hold the line.”’Photograph: Andrew Kelly/ReutersBut keeping faith is not as stodgy a project as you might think. With the GameStop short squeeze, everyman investors developed a boisterous lexicon of populist solidarity and above all tenacity. They enjoined one another tohodlthe GameStopstonkwithdiamond hands.Their dominant slogan was just like that of the federal workers: “Hold the line.” And it worked. When they held, they kept the price of GameStop high and the hedge funds couldn’t afford to cover their short bets. Melvin Capital broke down, as did White Square.But back to the federal employees. The second they received the 28 January “Fork in the Road” email trying to drive them out, thousands did what the GameStop apes had done four years earlier: went to Reddit. It was electric. A campaign to save America from Trump-Musk crystallized. “When Tyranny becomes Law, Rebellion becomes Duty,”posted oneanonymous federal worker.“Who knew that the fight against tyranny was me looking at some spreadsheets and trying to make Americans healthier?”another said. It was on. “They just createdthe imaginary deep state they convinced everyone they were fighting against.”And then it came: “Diamond. Fucking. Hands.”The GameStop words. “You made me double check which sub I was in,” someone said, with laughing-crying emoji. Here was the ethic of holding fast to something you believe in, even while tyrants conspire to destroy it.The feds held on. And even now, even among the jobless, they are refusing to lose faith in the American project. “Take up space, put a face to the stories,” said a recent poster to the fednews subreddit. “Make it uncomfortable for them. Let them know the human toll it takes.”Right now, it’s hard to imagine Musk or Trump will ever go bust. But emperors rise and fall. Those two have now bet against America. If the rest of us stay steadfast, they very well might, like those hedge funds, hit a bruising kind of margin call.We are on the road for democracy and justice | Bernie SandersRead moreMusk could have to answer for Tesla’srecent precipitous losses. There have beeninternational boycottsof Tesla andcreative, energized and widespread campaignsagainst it. Steve Bannon, one of the marquee Maga influencers, recentlysavaged Muskas anti-Maga, calling him “a parasitic illegal immigrant” who “wants to impose his freak experiments and play-act as God without any respect for the country’s history, values or traditions”.Trump, for his part, may have to face his 34 felonies one day, andpay the more than $500mhe owes. Axios recentlyreportedon a mounting revolt against Doge among Republicans in Congress. Then there are the people.In icy temperatures on Monday, thousands took to the streets, shouting: “No Kings on Presidents Day.” The goal ofthe organizerswas to protest against “anti-democratic and illegal actionsof the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies”. Andthe legal actions againstthe Trump administration are piling up – more than 75 opposing his executive orders,with more being filed every day.Even people without conscience can be brought up short by realities like the erosion of their fortunes, their standing and their bases of support. The GameStop apes used to say: “I like the stock” when people asked them why they wouldn’t sell. If you like the civil service, hold the line. Keep the faith. The Trump-Musk administration wants the American people to shut up, pack up our desks and resign our roles as citizens.

On the opposite side have been authoritarian states, led mainly by the Soviet Union, followed, after the demise of the Soviet Union, byRussiaandChina.But all this is rapidly changing.Russiaand China have morphed into oligarchies, run by small groups of extraordinarily wealthy people.The US has been moving from a democracy to an oligarchy as well – and is doing so at lightning speed underDonald TrumpandElon Musk.The new poles are coming to be global democracies versus a global oligarchy. The United States is emerging on the side of global oligarchy.Trump’sremarks late on Tuesday– siding fully with Russia’s narrative of blaming Ukraine for the war there – signals more clearly than any other recent statement that the US is prepared to jettison its European allies and switch sides to embraceVladimir Putin’s Russia.Even Trump can be cajoled into doing the right thing – you just have to know which buttons to press | Kenneth RothRead moreEarlier on Tuesday, senior American and Russian officials agreed not only to seek to end the war inUkraine, but also, in the words of the secretary of state Marco Rubio, to explore “the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians”, both geopolitically and economically.Trump’s phone call with Putin last week also reflected Putin’s view of the world – that Russia and the US are “two great nations” that should not only negotiate Ukraine’s fate directly but also together address even weightier global affairs.Just after the call, Trump posted that he and Putin had “reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many! We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together.”The phone call occurred on the same day, not incidentally, that Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, declared that the United States would not supportUkraine’s desire for Nato membership.And on the same day, the SenateconfirmedTulsi Gabbard, widely seen as sympathetic to Putin, as the next director of national intelligence.At last week’s Munich security conference, JD Vance – the man whorefuses to saythat Trump lost the 2020 presidential election – accused Europe of abandoning the values of democracy by excluding the far right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) from government.Vance’s bizarre comments came just days before Germany’s general election. He had earlier met the AfD’s co-leader Alice Weidel.The AfD is a rightwing extremist party. In 2017, Björn Höcke, an AfD party leader in the eastern state of Thuringia,complainedthat Germans were “the only people in the world who’ve planted a monument of shame at the heart of their capital” – Höcke was referring to the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust – and that Germany needed “nothing less than a 180-degree turnaround in the politics of remembrance”.In 2018, the AfD party leader Alexander Gaulanddismissed“Hitler and the Nazis” as “just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history”.In 2023, AfD politiciansmet with other far-right extremiststo discuss an “overall concept, in the sense of a master plan” for the “remigration” of “migrants” to their countries of ethnic origin – no matter whether those migrants were asylum seekers, permanent residents or German citizens.The AfD wants to end German military aid to Ukraine and restart the Nord Stream pipelines through which Russia used to supply Germany with natural gas.So what is Vance doing embracing the AfD? Why has Musk also promoted the AfD on his X platform?There should be no doubt about what is happening. The Trump-Vance-Musk regime wants to empower the nationalist far-right in Europe in order to divide European democracies and weaken the western alliance.This potentially emboldens further Russian military incursions like the 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine.It strengthens the global oligarchy.Commentators in Moscow are claiming that the American-led effort to isolate Russia over Ukraine has ended and are celebrating Trump’s support for Russia’s narrative about who started the war in Ukraine.We are on the road for democracy and justice | Bernie SandersRead moreAfter Trump’s phone call with Putin, Russia’s main stock market index jumped 5%, to its highest point since last summer, and the ruble gained against the dollar to its strongest level since September.The Trump-Vance-Musk regime is not only undermining democracy in the US. It is also laying the foundation for undermining democracies around the world.It is making the world safe for oligarchy.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

A lot is being lost in the shift to online learningJudith BrettA talking head on a screen is not the same as a flesh and blood person standing in front of youThu 20 Feb 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 17.45 ESTShareWhen I contemplate life in today’s universities I have two comparisons to draw on: my undergraduate days in the late 1960s at the University of Melbourne, and my more than 20 years teaching Australian politics at La Trobe. Of the many changes the one that stands out to me is the loss of the face-to-face in student life and of teaching.When I was an undergraduate, student life was on campus – in the clubs, the caf, the union, the library and in the tutorials where a dozen or so young people and a rare mature-age student would be led in discussion by a tutor, sometimes a new graduate, sometimes one of the tenured staff. Coming from a suburban high school, I knew no one when I started and made my first friends in tutorials as we continued our arguments outside, in the caf or walking downtown to catch our trains home, and gossiped about our fellow students.‘Teaching to an empty hall’: is the changing face of universities eroding standards of learning?Read moreWhen I moved into college in second year, and later into a share house, I could also go to meetings or the pub at night, and to the film society’s Friday night screenings. Without cars or mobile phones, social life depended on running into each other and on informal gathering places. Few people had part-time jobs and most late afternoons in the final years of my degree a dozen or more of us would gather in the mixed lounge for coffee, some food perhaps, and to talk and flirt, making friendships and building networks which have lasted a life time. In those liminal years, between youth and adulthood, as we left our parents’ homes, we were there, present to each other, face to face.I have just finished a biography of the second-wave feminist activist Beatrice Faust, who started at Melbourne University a decade before I did, and recognised the same pattern of intense daily interaction among students. When a decade later in 1972 she started the Women’s Electoral Lobby she turned to her undergraduate networks for recruits.When I started teaching at La Trobe in 1989, campus life was thinner. A suburban university, most of its students still lived in their childhood homes and had jobs. During the day the car parks were full as students drove in for classes but at night the campus was empty, and even during the day many students simply dropped in for class. I’m sure friendships still formed but the campus was no longer the intense social world of my undergraduate days. Perhaps more of it survived at an inner-city campus like Melbourne’s but there too students were taking jobs and cheap student digs were being lost to gentrification.Teaching, though, was still face-to-face. I was lucky to join a department which saw teaching undergraduates as our main raison d’etre and which included a number of gifted and dedicated teachers, including Robin Jeffrey, Joe Camilleri and Robert Manne, all of whom taught first year and took tutorials. Their styles were very different. Robin’s was quirky and occasionally whimsical, Joe’s urgent and Robert’s urbane but all were built on extensive knowledge of their subject matter and rigorous thinking. They modelled for students how to work through a problem, how to organise and interrogate a body of material, how to come to a conclusion. They showed that thinking was hard-won and serious and they invited emotional identification with the process. This more than the informational content is the lasting effect of great teaching, testified to in countless memoirs in which people remember teachers who turned them serious and changed their lives.I’ve thought a lot about what is being lost in the shift to online teaching. Information can be conveyed, and people can be taught protocols, as in the ubiquitous compliance modules, but can they be taught how to think or, more importantly, inspired to want to learn how to think? Perhaps, but I’m not convinced. A talking head on a screen is not the same as a flesh and blood person standing in front of you, face to face, whom you admire and want to emulate or impress. It drains teaching of its emotional pull. And it is hard to fit a complex piece of reasoning on a screen. Dot points are a limited cognitive tool.The shift to online teaching is only one of the developments which has eroded the centrality and quality of teaching in our universities. Others are the availability of research-only positions such as ARC fellowships, which took many gifted senior academics out of the classroom altogether and replaced them with casually employed less-experienced teachers. Many of these were excellent, dedicated teachers but the message sent by the flight of leading academics into research-only positions was that teaching was a second-order activity.The situation is different in the sciences but, to my mind, in the humanities and social sciences, teaching our fellow citizens is the core of our jobs, what the taxpayers pay us to do and the source of our social licence.Judith Brett is a political historian and biographer, and an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University.

Even though I consider myself “hip to the jive”, I’ve always anticipated that one day I won’t understand a reference, and my finger bones will simply be too tired to look it up. That I’ll have an interaction with a teen and they will say a word I’ve never heard before, or use it in the wrong context, and it will confuse and startle me, like an elderly horse. It is natural and correct. We all age and need to triage our energy into other things, like getting through the days.What I didn’t expect, in the year 2025, was to be at odds with many young people on subjects associated with sex and dating. Generally I consider this a “none of my business” area, like maths and the internal lives of men, and am very happy to be blissfully ignorant of whatever the youth are up to inside the bedroom. But I keep encountering their commentary surrounding Problematic Age Gaps (PAGs).There has been discourse about PAGs forever but these aren’t your PAGs of yore, when a 60-year-old man was called out for marrying a 20-year-old. It seems as though there’s been a shift in judgment and concern about age-gap relationships where there is a clear power imbalance to judgment and concern aboutanykind of age gap.Men say ‘I love you’ first – but are they really more romantic than women?Read moreAn example is the many comments in TikTok and Reddit threads about the US pop star JoJo Siwa’s new relationship with the Sydney influencer and actor Kath Ebbs. Siwa is a 21-year-old woman in a queer relationship with a person who is 27 years old. I’ve seen comments that there’s “something off” about this, that it’s “really weird”. I posted that I thought everyone should calm down a bit about the age gap in this situation and I was called a predator for supporting it. Please, I don’t have enough energy to predate anyone!Admittedly I am the Problematic part in my own PAG, as I am 42 and in a relationship with a 32-year-old – but we are in similar life stages, and she finds it offensive that people might think someone like me (a buffoon) could mind control her into a healthy relationship. The main time the age gap arises as an issue is when she laughs at me for having done “secretarial studies” in high school (fair).Not only are Siwa and Ebbs both in their 20s, not only is it a queer relationship, but this is a situation where the power dynamic is not all age-based, with Siwa having been wealthy and famous basically from birth. It seems that these sorts of factors are being dismissed and some young people are finding it inherently problematic for two people with any sort of age gap to date – while also being more open about gender and sexuality than any generation before. Oneviral tweet proclaimsthat “at 25, I wouldn’t even date a 21 year old”.I don’t think teenagers should be with 30-year-olds. But these situations are just not the same as two queer people in their 20s datingSome of this is understandable.Young peopletoday have grown up in a world obsessed with pitting different generations against one another. Of course there’s also the inevitable swing away from what came in the generation before. Many of these young people are wary of oversexualisation, exploitation and sex scenes in movies. They feel a need to protect themselves, and each other, which I get and totally respect – I just think they have swung too far the other way, like rebounding to someone who is the complete opposite of your ex, when the real solution is someone normal in the middle. It’s become too black and white, and the power dynamic aspect, along with any nuance at all, has been tossed out in favour of a strict age-difference cutoff and a big stamp that says SICKOS.Being in an age-gap relationship myself doesn’t mean that I am automatically going to defend all age-gap relationships. I still find it gross when men have a pattern of only dating young women. I think many of them are hacks who want to date 21-year-olds because 35-year-old women know too much about men.I don’t think teenagers should be with 30-year-olds. But these situations are just not the same as two queer people in their 20s dating. It’s not the same as 50-year-old Sarah Paulson dating 82-year-old Holland Taylor, something else I’ve alsoseen calledstrange and problematic. If everything is otherwise normal, I think when you are old enough to have had several significant relationships and be facing menopause you can date Holland Taylor.‘It felt like a divine calling’: meet the single marriage celebrants refusing to give up on loveRead moreThe issue is that the nuances of each situation don’t seem to matter any more; we are trending towards having the same arbitrary rule applied across all relationships, ranging from “half your age, plus seven” to “any age gap is wrong”. You can’t tell if a relationship is inherently wrong just by applying a number.I don’t mean we shouldn’t cast a critical eye over relationships. I don’t condone men using this sentiment to justify being creepy losers. But I do mean more nuance should be applied to situations where two fully grown adults are consenting and healthy and happy.Most importantly, accusations of grooming and predation should not be levelled willy-nilly. Accusing every relationship with a five-year age gap of being problematic, or involving grooming, heavily diminishes the very real and very common practices of abusers. It dilutes the concept, it fuzzies the borders of what we are looking out for and it makes the real baddies harder to identify.I am not rousing on young people, nor do I think they are foolish. I think they are trying to protect themselves and each other. I understand the impulse, I just think it could be deployed with more care and thought. I may be a startled elderly lesbian horse with a PAG but we are ultimately on the same side.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsOpinionWomenYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, the debate has largely focused on how to revive the ailing German economy after two years of recession and how to control migration, which has fuelled support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.The conservative CDU/CSU leader, Friedrich Merz, has swerved speaking about the need for massive borrowing to pay for a surge in defence spending because many of his supporters oppose extra debt. The Social Democratic (SPD) chancellor, Olaf Scholz, isdodging discussionof sending German troops to Ukraine as part of a possible European security force if a ceasefire agreement is reached because part of his political base is either anti-militarist or Russia-friendly. After an emergencyEuropean summiton Ukraine in Paris on Monday, an irritable Scholz said talk of boots on the ground was “highly inappropriate”.Neither of the main contenders to run Europe’s largest economy dares tell the domestic electorate just how dire Germany’s security situation is looking, now that Donald Trump is pursuing a quick deal with Vladimir Putin – apparently largely on Moscow’s terms – to stop the fighting inUkraineand draw down US forces from Europe.“Nobody wants to get caught speaking the truth before the election,” says Jan Techau, a former defence ministry speechwriter who is now director of Europe at the consultancy Eurasia Group. “In the worst-case scenario, if Trump pulls off this deal with Putin and carves up Europe into spheres of influence,Germanyis very exposed.”Unlike France and the UK, Germany does not have its own nuclear deterrent, and its armed forces are rusty and understaffed after three decades of self-disarmament since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is struggling to fully equip a brigade of 5,000 troops todeploy in Lithuaniaas part of Nato’s deterrent presence.Scholz declared aZeitenwende(turning point) within days of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and created a€100bn (£82bn) special fundto buy defence equipment. But he failed to follow up and convince Germans that times have truly changed and that the country must shed its postwar aversion to all things military. While military and intelligence officials say Russia could be ready to attack a Nato country by 2030, experts say it will take decades for Germany to fix its forces at the current rate.“Even the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has not created a sense of urgency in Germany – a sense that time to rebuild the military is not infinite,” says Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff of the German Council on Foreign Relations. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy has calculated that, at the current procurement pace, it would takenearly 100 yearsuntil the army had as many artillery howitzers as it possessed in 2004.When the special fund runs out at the end of 2027, it will leave a€30bn a yearbudget hole just to keep defence spending at Nato’s current target of 2% of GDP. It will take almost double that amount to reach the likely objective of 3% or more, which allied leaders are expected to set in June. If Trump starts pulling US troops out of Europe, the bill will rise even higher.Merz has said if he wins the election, he will start by cutting wasteful welfare spending and kickstart economic growth with tax cuts before considering extra borrowing. He has hinted that he isopen to reformingthe constitutional “debt brake” that severely limits government deficits to create more fiscal space for defence investment, and perhaps even tojoint borrowingwith European partners to fund common defence equipment.The conservative frontrunner has blasted Scholz for his lack of leadership in the EU andhas vowedto restore Germany’s damaged relations with France and Poland, work more closely with the UK and take a lead in Europe’s response to the war in Ukraine. Unlike Scholz, he supports supplying Kyiv with long-requestedTaurus medium-range missilesable to hit targets inside Russia, subject to agreement among European partners. A close parliamentary colleague says Merz is deeply pro-European and Atlanticist, and understands that Germany will have to borrow fast to boost defence.However, the real questions are whether he will have sufficient political capital to borrow massively for defence and to fix Germany’s broken infrastructure; whether he will have the parliamentary super-majority needed to reform the debt brake; whether he has the sense of urgency that has been largely missing during the past three years of centre-left government; and how far his likely SPD coalition partners will let him go in squeezing welfare to pay for defence.By failing to prepare public opinion for the coming storm, Merz is storing up trouble for himself when the time comes, very soon, to make wrenching choices on public spending and borrowing.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionUkraineRussiaEuropeOlaf ScholzNatocommentShareReuse this content"

But what exactly is meant by that? An economic difference? Of the 20 leading global economies,several are in the south. In the south, some countries are many, many times richer than their neighbours. A climate difference? The climate crisis affects every country in the world, and especially small island states and the poorest countries. The10 greatest emitters, if we go by CO2emissions per inhabitant, are split between countries in the north and south.Are we talking about a migration difference? A huge number of migrations are between countries in the south. A political divide? In both the north and the south, there are those who support collective solutions, and conversely, those who support efforts to withdraw from global affairs. In both the north and the south, there is competition between regional powers. In both the north and the south, there are countries that comply with international law and others that flout it.Yes, we are living in a fragmented world, but is this happening at the line of geographical division between north and south? Certainly not. The UN doesn’t recognise this artificial division either. It focuses on categories of countries that need the most international support.The real line of division is the one that separates those that support the international rules-based order from the rest. The discussion we should be having, atG20meetings and everywhere else, is not the clash between north and south, but between those that support the law and those that support power by force.View image in fullscreenThe French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAInFrance, our moral compass is not guided by north or south, but by justice. We do not avert our eyes from any crisis or violation of international law. A country under attack is a country under attack, and an aggressor country is an aggressor country. This distinction does not change based on whether the country is in the north or the south.That is why Franceat once condemnsviolations of international humanitarian law in Gaza and the West Bank, the7 October terrorist attacksagainst Israel,the war of aggression led by Russia against Ukraine, and the atrocities perpetrated bySudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan. That is why it is fully committed to maintaining the ceasefire in Lebanon, after working towards its adoption alongside the US. That is why it is working to bring an end tothe clashes in the Great Lakes region, where M23 rebels continue to violate the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is why France is workingso that Syrian men and women can live in peaceand freedom in a sovereign, peaceful Syria that is reintegrated in its regional environment. And I have travelled to each of these regions to strongly reassert our beliefs.Because France does not use double standards. And the voice of France, which tirelessly defends equality and law, will continue to be heard, at a time when law is contested, if we strengthen international law. This implies that there is a role for everyone to play in global governance, and therefore, that it must be reformed. Every second we waste on the path to multilateralism reform fuels claims its institutions are illegitimate. France would like to see crucial projects for the future of peace and global governance to be completed between now and 2026, when our country will hold the presidency of the G7.As the 80th anniversary of the UN’s creation approaches, let us move forward with determination so that our institutions reflect today’s world, and so that a rightful place can be given to our African partners in global governance, the UN security council and international financial institutions. We must also make progress on practical implementation ofthe Paris pact for peoples and the planetinitiated by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Because no country should have to choose between fighting poverty and fighting climate breakdown. Because we need private funding so that development assistance is sufficient, and because we must innovate to support developing countries.I believe that South Africa would like this to be a key aspect ofits current presidency of the G20. It can count on France’s full support.Jean-Noël Barrot is the foreign minister of FranceDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A banker, a social welfare recipient and an asylum seeker are sitting at a table. There are 12 cookies in front of them. The banker takes 11 cookies and says to the social welfare recipient: “Watch out, the refugee wants your cookie.”It came back to me as I witnessed a young white mother completely losing it at the checkout. At first I thought it was the prices that had caused her fury, though there was no indication of that; I was probably just projecting my own anxieties about money on to the woman’s tantrum. It took me a moment to realise that she was accusing another woman, also a mother but not white, of standing in her way on purpose. She shouted that this was her country and we should all step out of her way and that soon we would see. Two people told her to be quiet and one older woman went to calm her down, but there was no chance. The young white mother chose to stay loud and angry, and she knew exactly at whom.In the run-up to federal elections this Sunday, there seems to be no topic as pressing in the German media as migration. Almost all the political parties have been busy for weeks fighting a phantom called the criminal immigrant, whom they all promise to deport or “re-migrate”, depending on the respective party’s language – or they will make sure the criminal immigrant doesn’t get here in the first place by levering out the asylum law.News about devastating attacks such as the one last week in Munich, where a car rammed into the crowd at a trade union rally,killing two people, unfortunately fuels the climate of fear that the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has been creating for more than a decade and is now profiting from the most. Thesuspect in the attackis a young Afghan man. No word, of course, about the fact that the victims, a mother and her daughter, were an immigrant from Algeria and her child, since it defeats the object of the ultranationalist narrative.Sadly, almost all German political parties over recent weeks have been engaged in a race to claim that they will deport the most asylum seekers in the name of law and order. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats, has already increased the amount of deportationsby 70%in just over three years, a fact he proudly reminded voters of during the so-called “chancellor duel” TV debate.Scholz’s opponent and potential successor, the Christian Democrat Friedrich Merz, wants to go a step further andpreventasylum seekers from entering the country, whileexpatriating peoplewith dual citizenship who commit a crime. Mass proteststook placein every big city this month after Merz shattered a taboo andaccepted supportfor his plans from the AfD. By the way, Merz was chair of the supervisory board at the German division of the US investment company BlackRock until 2020. Heisthe banker from the cookie joke.But in these dark times, when the election campaign is heavily inflected with racist discourse, there is a flicker of hope on the German political landscape, namely the only party that has refused to tune in to the xenophobic choir: Die Linke(“The Left”). And finally that approach is paying off: while in December support for Die Linke had shrunk to 3% in the polls – with the party predicted not even to meet the 5% threshold for entry to the Bundestag – it has now, only two months later,caught upand is currently polling 7%. It has done this by standing its ground and remaining the only political alternative to an anti-immigration alignment in German politics.After Merz refused to shun AfD support for his proposed crackdown on asylum seekers, there was uproar in the Bundestag. But it was aspeech in the chamberby the Die Linke co-leader Heidi Reichinnek that went viral on social media. In a heartfelt and emotional reaction to Merz’s cooperation with the far right, Reichinnek, 36, expressed outrage over the fact that a party calling itself Christian Democrat made a deal with “rightwing extremists”: “Only two days after we commemorated the liberation of Auschwitz here [in parliament] … you are working with those who carry on the same ideology.”The video ofReichinnek’s fiery speechcaused asurge in membershipas well as an influx of new social media followers for Die Linke. The AfD had been by far the most popular German party on TikTok but in just a few days, Die Linke had overtaken it. “Queen Heidi”, as young supporters call their new icon, speaks in favour of economic redistribution, the decriminalisation of abortion and an unrestricted right to asylum – and she does so with an enthusiasm that is utterly lacking among the rest of the German political sphere.Die Linke’s appeal is spreading among younger people, who make up only a minority of voters. However, among children and teenagers under 18, apoll showsthat Die Linke is the most popular party by far. It will be interesting to see how this effect plays out in the coming years, but even the 7% of voters Die Linkemight reachon Sunday could be decisive in this election.This is not because the party could end up supporting a coalition: policy differences are too deep for that. But it should mean a stronger opposition, one that is prepared to call out violations of human rights as well as economic policies that favour billionaires. The cookies will not be split evenly by next week, but they will continue to be counted and monitored, by a new generation fed up with the most vulnerable groups being played off against each other.Fatma Aydemir is a Berlin-based author, novelist, playwright and a GuardianEuropecolumnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s a staple of my diet. I don’t like that, at the best of times, it takes up maybe a fifth of my grocery budget.I also don’t like that as a country, we’ve been all too quick to blame rising food prices on inflation. We’ve quickly made inflation a priority for our policymakers, while the cost of living is the key issue of the upcoming election.Now, before you write me off as a naive 20-year-old who’s never paid a bill in her life – I’m not.The cost-of-living crisis is hitting my generation too. We all know inflation has a lot to do with it, but inflation isn’t the only factor driving this surge – the climate crisis continues to fuel cost-of-living pressures and push up prices.Take my chocolate for example. Cacao plants can’t yield cacao beans which make chocolate in temperatures above 32C.Analysis by independent research group Climate Centralexamined regions where cacao beans are harvested and found that in the last decade, most experienced on average an extra six weeks a year where the temperatures in these regions were above this limit. Excessive heat, caused by global heating, reduces the quantity of beans harvested and drives up chocolate prices.1:27Footage shows coral bleaching at Western Australia's Ningaloo Reef  – videoPoliticians have divorced the climate crisis from the issue of cost of living, allowing their often dismal records on climate and environment to escape scrutiny. This benefits no one but the major parties, as they talk about the cost of fuel, food and electricity one moment, and approve a fossil fuel extension which will drive up these very costs the next.As a country, we cannot be complacent when climate collapse is so clearly a cost-of-living issue.Coffee is another household staple that can only grow in specific and is extremely sensitive to changes in weather conditions. Theprice of coffee is increasing steadilyas the planet heats. Rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall have the potential to wipe out entire crops.Global heating is alsodriving up the prices of orange juiceby damaging crops in the biggest orange-producing regions. Droughts and heatwaves have reduced the production ofolive oilin countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece.All this to say that the climate crisis isn’t just on our screens in the form of raging bushfires and devastating floods, it’s hitting our hip pockets right now. It’s the reason more of us than ever have to say no to the things we love, or find cheaper alternatives.It’s also worsening an already volatile rental market. Asinsurance premiums riseand insurance companies refuse to cover at-risk properties; as people move out of areas prone to climate-driven disasters; as every rental inspection has lines snaking around the block; prices are surging.As we head towards the federal election, we must broaden our understanding of the cost-of-living issue. We must be informed voters with a clear sense of the issues that will determine how we will cast our ballots.If we don’t, we risk a deepening crisis.Living expenses will continue to skyrocket. Politicians will continue pointing fingers at each other across parliament’s chambers, then head back to their offices to sign off on yet another coalmine expansion that will only worsen the myriad of intergenerational crises we face. And we won’t have thepolitical literacyto hold them accountable.My generation, and the generations to come, will be hit the worst.We owe it to ourselves to know the full picture and to ensure that when we vote in a few months we cast our ballot with climate action – and our future – in mind.Anjali Sharma was the lead litigant in Sharma v environment minister, the landmark court case against the then federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, which called for a duty of care to protect children against the impacts of the climate crisisExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionCost of living crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

Ratings are in freefall; once the most watched thing on TV, these days the soap is lucky if it cracks the top 20. But an anniversary like this gives EastEnders an opportunity to not only celebrate itself, but to reaffirm its own mission statement. And it has gone about this by going on an absolute tear.With little else to lose, EastEnders has spent the last few weeks wildly swinging for the fences. Don’t mistake this for hyperbole, either. Just look at last Thursday’s episode where – and I promise I’m not making any of this up – Phil Mitchell embarked on a long monologue about all the different things he’s survived (alcoholism, drug addiction, illness, heart attacks, an actual shooting), then travelled back in time and murdered a younger version of himself, before the ghost of his dead mother arrived and urged him to kill himself. It was utterly bizarre, but it was also incredible. Had a big budget streaming show attempted something this daring, it would be lauded to the heavens. But this is old workday EastEnders, and so the whole thing passed without comment.Still, this impeccable form meant that EastEnders went into Thursday full of confidence. And it needed it, because this was the big anniversary live episode. In the past, live episodes of EastEnders have been marked by a pleasing shonkiness, with actors forgetting lines, or visibly twitching when they’re supposed to be dead, or calling Ian Beale by his actor’s name and then looking more terrified than any human in all of history. Still, even by previous standards, this episode had an awful lot of ground to cover.The Vic had been destroyed (again), trapping a number of characters, one of whom was in labour. But also to clear up was the aftermath of a six-week whodunnit about Cindy Beale’s attempted murder to deal with (she had already died once before; but forget it: it’s Walford). Plus, there was the continuing saga of Phil Mitchell’s efforts to kill himself and a brand new Bandersnatchesque twist where viewers got to decide which hunk Denise Fox should end up with. All said, it was shaping up to be spectacular.But then came the reality. There was no Cindy in the live episode and, aside from one very brief shot at the end, no Phil either. Anyone expecting any more time-travelling homicides will have come away bitterly disappointed. The Denise storyline was something of a damp squib, too. After a weirdly breezy pep talk from Linda Carter (who was somehow able to brush off the fact that the pub she used to work in had just exploded, at the exact same time that she watched Phil Mitchell attempt to shoot himself in the head), she knocked on the door of the hunk she had the least sexual chemistry with, and that was that.Sonia’s birth was also dealt with in a strangely businesslike manner, save for the fact that she named her baby Julia, after the show’s co-creator Julia Smith. Instead, the bulk of the episode was devoted to a number of romantic exchanges between Martin Fowler (trapped under a girder) and Stacey Slater (much less trapped under a girder). The reason for this quickly became apparent; a paramedic stated that Martin would probably die once the girder was lifted. Spoiler – he did.It was all very sad but, for those of you keeping score, live EastEnders episodes are now officially a very bad time to be Stacey Slater’s romantic interest. Her boyfriend Bradley Branning died on the 25th anniversary, and now Martin’s gone too. Just as a piece of practical advice, whoever ends up with Stacey next should probably give serious consideration to booking a nice long holiday for the duration of February 2035. Better to be safe than sorry, after all.Storylines aside, though, the main takeaway of the episode was how extraordinarily proficient it all was. The performances and execution were flawless. Not a single thing went wrong. It is the first time that EastEnders has properly nailed a live episode. So while it might not have been particularly memorable, from a technical standpoint this was a clear demonstration that EastEnders knows exactly what it’s doing.The hope must have been that this experiment would put more eyeballs on EastEnders. Regardless of what happened in the episode itself, you’d have to hope that it works. It might no longer be the ratings behemoth it once was, but this was proof that EastEnders still has an awful lot to be proud of.EastEnders Live aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsEastEndersTelevisionSoap operaDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I went out with him. I knew him closely for a decade, so there’s not a single anecdote that sums him up. He was genuine, honest, likeable, good humoured. Not a shred of arrogance. What you got was really him. He wasn’t putting it on. He was just a joy to be around. I think he obviously went through something very difficult which must have overwhelmed him and ended with him taking his own life, but that wasn’t who he was. When I got the news, my overwhelming feeling was that I just wanted to run out of the room, up the street and away from it. I like to think that now he’d have been very happy, with a big family up in the Lakes.View image in fullscreenLush in 1994 … Chris Acland, Emma Anderson, Miki Berenyi and Phil King.Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesThank you for the Lush reunion gigs and the wonderfulBlind Spot EP.

Emma [Anderson] had her daughter, too. We had a great time making the EP and it was lovely to sell out the Roundhouse, but the problem in bands is always how you navigate bumps in the road. Without Chris as a balancing influence, Emma and myself had a difficult relationship. Sometimes it was great. Sometimes it could be nasty. I didn’t write about it in my book because I didn’t want it to be like Morrissey’s autobiography, with pages of boringly minute detail on the trial. But there was a falling out and, if I’m honest, it still hurts.What were the inspirations behind the new Miki Berenyi Trio album, Tripla?SinthnimanshaTripla is Hungarian for “triple”. I’m half Hungarian and I think what’s nice about the language is that you can pick a word and nobody really knows it. There are three people in the band. It was going to be “three”, but three in Hungarian is “három”, which is a bit close to “harem” – a connotation I don’t really want to explore. But “tripla” sounds quite joyful, and the music is upbeat. I realised that most [pop] lyrics are grounded in being young – love and sex and the energy of youth. It’s harder to find things to write about when you’re older that isn’t gardening or a trip to B&Q, so [on Tripla] there’s green politics and social media and stuff. At my age [57], it can sound like you’re trying to be relevant and young, but those things affect older people just as much. I wrote about how things affect me emotionally, which I have always done.Fingers Crossed by Miki Berenyi review – trauma, stage-dives and stardomRead moreYour memoir, Fingers Crossed: How Music Saved Me from Success,waspretty bleak in places. Are you OK now?ElephonseI was OK when I was going through a lot of what’s in the book. When you write a memoir, you’re writing about a lot of significant moments, but you don’t want to give people the impression your life was wall-to-wall drama. I guess no one would have seen the sexual abuse stuff coming [Berenyi alleged that she was abused by her grandmother], even though a lot of people experience it. I didn’t really talk about it in interviews because I didn’t trust the journalists to handle it properly. I survived, but I didn’t like the Daisy Chainsaw/Babes in Toyland image of ripped clothes, smeared lipstick and a hint of violation. One thing that hadn’t been talked about is how normalised it becomes in your life and how damaging it can be. Some people become promiscuous, some people self-harm or struggle with relationships. I wrote about how I navigated it, and every now and then I’ve had a nod from people who’ve said they went through something similar.What was the most unexpected –or pleasant – response to your memoir?JimFixxThe great reviews were unexpected, but it meant most to me that people praised the actual writing, because it wasn’t ghostwritten. I had so little self-confidence when doing it. I would think: “No one cares about the singer from Lush doing a bloody autobiography.” It was gruelling. So it was nice to realise that sometimes the smaller stories are the most interesting ones.From Spurs fan to Spurs fan, how did theLillies’ single And David Seaman Will Be Very Disappointed About That …come about?CoopertapesSimon Raymonde from Cocteau Twins, Moose [Kevin McKillop] and Russell [Yates] from the band Moose, Chris [Acland] and I used to go see Spurs together. When we beat Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final, Lush were asked to do a flexi for a club fanzine called The Spur. It was a bit of fun that became a news story. When I turned up for the photo session we’d all been out the night before, so I could barely stop myself from vomiting. We all looked absolutely fucked apart from Simon. My sole contribution to the song was to ad lib “3-1, 3-1”, which made Simon very happy.Will you ever go back to the pinkish-red hair you had in Lush? Or is that part of your past?DaveBrettThere’s always an assumption everything I do is thought out and planned – but the only reason I had my hair red was that I’d been mucking about with Crazy Color since I was 14. At 19, I dyed it red and it stayed that way. I’m actually very lazy when it comes to presentation. I cut my own hair and if I find clothing I like that’s it for the next two years. On tour in the 90s, people used to stare at me but I zoned out to the point I couldn’t see it. I wasn’t going to stop dyeing it because some bloke would go: “Oh, you’d look really pretty if your hair was natural.” The reason I stopped was because, once I had children, I thought: “I haven’t time for this.” You’re thankful if you even have time to get dressed.View image in fullscreenBerenyi on stage with Lush in Prague, 1994.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesDid you find the music press a bit cringey in the 90s? It was almost like the writers decided they wereas interesting as the artists.ApexPredatorThere’s this notion that the music press back in the day was just about building bands up to knock them down – but I actually think it’s really hard to write about music well, and especially having to constantly make every band sound unique and not bore everyone witless. It was a hard job, abysmally paid and there were very young people involved. The worst of that period was when you had a muscle-flexing journo trying to score points off a band. It was very tabloid and I don’t think bands were treated particularly well. But I’ve been a freelance subeditor now, so I expect thinking “I hope I get some shifts” is the same as a music journalist hoping to get that next trip to Los Angeles. Everybody’s hustling.What was it like havingRobin Guthrie fromCocteau TwinsproduceLush?nicksleftfootWhen Emma was sending out demos, she sent one to Robin and he was interested in us before we signed to 4AD. Then he wanted to produce us. He was brilliant, lovely. We didn’t have a clue what we were doing but he brought out the best in us. He came to our gigs, turned up at our Peel session as the backseat driver and really looked after us.

We went on this amazing American tour with Ride when we were really young, and the Valentines were part of my pre-Lush life. I must have seen them 20 times. Both bands’ music is tied up with so many memories that I just can’t be objective.Have you ever found yourself gazing at your shoes while performing?VerulamiumParkRangerNo and I don’t think any of us ever gazed at our fucking shoes [laughs].

We rate his greatest movies, from Straw Dogs to The Wild BunchByChris TryhornThu 20 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 20 Feb 2025 17.07 ESTShare10. Major Dundee (1965)After making his name as a director of westerns, Sam Peckinpah was given his first shot at making a major studio film – an epic about a tyrannical cavalry officer (Charlton Heston) leading an expedition into Mexico. The production set a template for later Peckinpah films – heavy drinking, personality clashes, battles with the suits, and a final cut not matching the director’s vision. Major Dundee was a victim of its chaotic ambition and it’s easy to see why it flopped on release: even in the 2005 restored version, it is hopelessly unfocused, taking in Dundee’s Moby-Dick-like mission to track down an Apache chief, the dynamics of the US civil war, encounters with the French army and an unconvincing romantic interlude. But it’s interestingly flawed, a sort of dry run for The Wild Bunch, and Richard Harris is entertaining as Benjamin Tyreen, the Irishman who leads the Confederate prisoners in Dundee’s ragtag army.9. Straw Dogs (1971)View image in fullscreenAn experiment in nastiness … Susan George and Dustin Hoffman in Straw Dogs.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyPeckinpah swapped the wild west for the West Country for this still potent experiment in nastiness, later banned from home release in the UK until 2002 because of its controversial rape scene.Dustin Hoffmanand Susan George play the middle-class couple who move to her old village only to be tormented by the leering locals and provoked into an orgy of bloodletting. It’s a product of a very specific time, when film-makers were newly free to explore the nature of violence and question the limits of liberalism – other examples being A Clockwork Orange and Dirty Harry. While influential on action cinema and prescient in its unpicking of bourgeois unease, it is ultimately gruelling and unenlightening – and a grim caricature of Cornwall.8. The Getaway (1972)The second of two back-to-back films Peckinpah made withSteve McQueen, this riveting thriller is very much a vehicle for its star, who had approval over the final cut and recruited Quincy Jones to provide a jazzy score to replace the work of regular Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding. McQueen and Ali MacGraw – who began an affair on set and later married – play Doc and Carol McCoy, a dour latter-day Bonnie and Clyde on the run in Texas after a heist unravels. Peckinpah handles the tense action sequences with consummate professionalism but of all the films in his 1969-74 golden stretch, it’s the least personal or thought-provoking.7. Cross of Iron (1977)View image in fullscreenCarnage … James Coburn and Maximilian Schell in Cross of Iron.Photograph: Studiocanal/EMI Films/AllstarPeckinpah’s talent for shooting action scenes made him a natural fit for directing a war film; his only foray into the genre, told unusually from the German perspective, had the misfortune to be released at the same time as Star Wars and has been overlooked ever since. Amid the carnage of the eastern front in 1943, contemptuous platoon leader Steiner (James Coburn) clashes with his arrogant aristocratic superior Stransky (Maximilian Schell). Nazism is little discussed and arguably downplayed (the only enthusiastic party member suffers a hideous punishment); this is essentially a searing portrait of a band ofBrüderoperating under the extreme duress of brutal warfare, and as such, it’s less unorthodox than it first seems. It proved to be his last decent film, he made just two more – the banal trucker comedy Convoy (1978) and the turgid thriller The Osterman Weekend (1983) – and then, in a curious coda, directed two music videos for Julian Lennon before his death at the age of 59.6. Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974)View image in fullscreenUtterly compelling … Warren Oates (right) in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.Photograph: United Archives/FilmPublicityArchive/Getty ImagesNihilistic, anarchic, repugnant: this is Peckinpah unbound, let loose without studio interference on a low budget in Mexico, and it’s not pretty. And yet this agonising ordeal of self-destruction is utterly compelling and at times pitch-black funny. Warren Oates channels Peckinpah himself as Bennie, a washed-up, shades-wearing piano player turned bounty hunter searching for the grisly proof that a man who impregnated a crime lord’s daughter is dead. Bennie won’t give up on his macabre quest despite his life disintegrating around him; like many Peckinpah characters, he is going down in a blaze of something, but it’s not going to be glory.5. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973)There are enough brilliant moments in this bewitching but sometimes bewildering western to convince you there is a masterpiece struggling to emerge from the various edits that have surfaced since MGM took the film off Peckinpah’s hands at the end of a deeply troubled production. Coburn gives a career-best performance as Pat Garrett, the sheriff hired by Big Cattle to bring down his old buddy, unrepentant outlaw Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson). Peckinpah assembled a fantastic ensemble cast of western legends but there are just too many characters, many of whom are gunned down quickly. Bob Dylan is distracting as Billy’s sidekick Alias, but he also provides the spellbinding soundtrack (featuring Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door) that helps create the film’s lyrical mood.4. Junior Bonner (1972)View image in fullscreenUnwilling to move with the times … Steve McQueen in Junior Bonner (1972).Photograph: Abc/Bill Avery/AllstarThis nuanced, understated family drama demonstrates how versatile “Bloody Sam” could be: there’s nothing more violent here than a comic bar-room brawl. A wistful Steve McQueen plays Junior Bonner, an ageing rodeo rider unable, or unwilling, to move with the times – a classic western archetype in a contemporary setting – unlike his vulgar entrepreneur brother Curly (Joe Don Baker). Ida Lupino gives an outstandingly intelligent performance as Junior’s mother, and the film provides a documentary-like snapshot of Prescott, Arizona, in the summer of 1971. It’s a great shame it flopped, and that Peckinpah didn’t make more films like it. As the director himself put it: “I made a film where nobody got shot and nobody went to see it.”3. The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970)Jason Robards, so often a fine supporting actor, takes centre stage in an inventive, eccentric and unpredictable tale of a man left for dead in the Arizona desert, only to strike water and set up a successful way station. Robards makes magnificent sense of Cable Hogue’s contradictions, there’s touching support from Stella Stevens as the obligatory golden-hearted sex worker, and David Warner’s randy preacher is funny, alarming and sometimes profound. Not everything works – the Benny Hill-style fast motion sequences haven’t aged well – but at its best this is a wise and humane film that comes to a strange but quietly astonishing conclusion.2. Ride the High Country (1962)After working in TV and making a solid debut with The Deadly Companions (1961), Peckinpah really hit his stride with his second film, a supremely assured western that tapped into the elegiac strain that became his hallmark in the genre. Veteran icons Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott are the uneasily paired old friends tasked with transporting gold down from a rough mining town, scene of a disturbingly riotous wedding. “All I want is to enter my house justified,” intones McCrea’s Steve Judd, laying down a marker for all those Peckinpah protagonists trying to make it through a broken world with a modicum of integrity. There is vivid cinematography by Lucien Ballard, in his first of five collaborations with Peckinpah.1. The Wild Bunch (1969)After failing with Major Dundee and then getting fired from The Cincinnati Kid, Peckinpah found himself in the wilderness, his reputation partly restored by the deeply moving TV drama Noon Wine. But the zeitgeist of the late 1960s – the war in Vietnam, political assassinations and the collapse of screen censorship – suited Peckinpah’s temperament and appetite for pushing boundaries. When he got his chance to return to a big screen project, he produced his masterpiece, a western that called time on the genre while inaugurating a new era of cinema.The Wild Bunch became notorious for the unprecedentedly bloody gun battles that bookend the film; viewed today, the violence hardly seems excessive or gratuitous, more of a corrective to the hundreds of films that had airbrushed the harsh realities of the west. It is also superbly choreographed, thanks to Lou Lombardo’s pioneering and hugely influential editing techniques: rapid cutting and varied frame rates, including those slow-motion death spasms that became a Peckinpah staple. What is just as striking is how unpleasant so many of the characters are: the eponymous bunch are reprehensible outlaws, indifferent to the collateral damage their exploits cause, trailed by a loutish posse and locked in a fatal embrace with a brutish Mexican general. Yet somehow we root for the ruthless, brooding Pike Bishop (a sensationally good William Holden) and his comrades as their options narrow and they search for some kind of morality and meaning in the dying days of the old west.Explore more on these topicsRankedWesternsSteve McQueenDustin HoffmanAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s clearly a very personal song, about its author’s late grandfather – even revealing the address of his council house, 11 Wark Avenue. The northern British references – “Chasing a cross in from the wing / Our boy’s a whippet, he’s faster than anything” – are amplified both by Fender’s Geordie vowels and the backing, provided by the Easington Colliery brass band. It’s all very specific and individual – you really don’t hear brass bands, or indeed the mention of whippets in pop very often – and yet Remember My Name seems to have something of the self-fulfilling prophecy about it. You can immediately imagine its soaring melody being sung en masse by a huge festival audience, which is, one suspects, precisely the destiny that awaits it.View image in fullscreenSam Fender: People Watching album art.It’s a reminder of the singularity of Fender’s rise. Both his 2019 debut Hypersonic Missiles and 2021’s Seventeen Going Under went platinum; the latter’s title track sold nearly 2m copies in the UK. He’s just announced a run of vast summer gigs, taking in the London Stadium and three consecutive nights at Newcastle’s St James’ Park: four shows that will see him play to the best part of quarter of a million people. This has happened despite the fact that his music is expressly political, and not in the usual platitudinous box-ticking way. It relentlessly picks away at the bleakest realities of northern working-class life, seldom a fashionable cause: you’d probably have to look back to Design for Life-era Manic Street Preachers – or even further, to the heyday of the Jam – to find rock musicians who made a similar agenda so commercially successful. He is probably the only pop star to have attracted both the praise of august socialist magazine the Tribune forhis critiques of “the callousness of British neoliberalism”and the TikTok hashtag #toptierindiebois.It’s an improbable success, and one which the contents of People Watching seem only likely to bolster. That colliery brass band notwithstanding, there’s a hint of folksiness about Wild Long Lie and Reign Me In, which feels like a fresh musical development, but not an entirely surprising one: in 2021, Fender helmed a BBC documentary about his love of 70s folk-rockers Lindisfarne. But for the most part, the album gently expands on Fender’s trademark sound, with the aid of co-producer Adam Granduciel. His band the War on Drugs share Fender’s audible love of Bruce Springsteen and tight, metronomic Krautrock-influenced rhythms, but their sound also boasts a faint haze of psychedelia and a greater sense of space, both of which are brought to bear on People Watching: in the electronic drone that underpins Arm’s Length, the slide guitar, feedback and synthesiser that arc around Wild Long Lie’s extended coda, the ominous, echo-laden atmosphere conjured on TV Dinner.Sam Fender: People Watching – videoIt’s all very subtly done, keeping the focus on Fender’s voice and songwriting; far from War on Drugs cosplay. It’s a smart move, because more than anything, People Watching reaffirms that Fender is a very good songwriter indeed: strong on melodies (the descending chord sequence of Nostalgia’s Lie is particularly nagging; the see-sawing tune of TV Dinner hypnotic), handy with a roaring, emotive, arena-friendly chorus, and exceptionally gifted with words. The title track shifts from prosaically conversational descriptions of a woman dying in a chaotic care home to something more poetic to gut-punching effect: “Above the rain-soaked garden of remembrance / Kittiwakes etched your initials in the sky / I fear for this crippled island.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

On Chin Up Fender berates himself for struggling with celebrity, “entitled, idle and dumb”, while his friends are struggling to find jobs or heat their homes. Conversely, TV Dinner gives a compelling list of reasons he struggles in a music business from which working-class voices are increasingly excluded and in which he never meets anyone with the same lived experience as him.Fender’s success means that the songs on People Watching are more complex than the bleak home town vignettes of Seventeen Going Under. But they’re no less powerful. Whether his gaze rests on his past, his present, or the gulf that lurks between them, there’s an urgency about what he has to say, its bleakness and realism at odds with the stadium-scale euphoria of the choruses. Whatever else Sam Fender’s unlikely fame may have changed, it hasn’t dimmed the unique potency of his music.This week Alexis listened toAndrew Rumsey – CollodionRecorded in a Wiltshire church – and featuring what sounds like said church’s organ – the title track of singer-songwriter Rumsey’s latest album is fittingly hushed, haunted and shiver-inducing.Explore more on these topicsSam FenderAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockThe War on Drugsalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a cliche because it’s true, and it could be the motto forPixar’s best creations– its animations have revealed the hidden feelings oftoys,monsters, evencars. That idea powers Win or Lose, the studio’s latest TV series – and in the moments where it commits to its ethos fully, it delivers a powerful appeal for empathy with a knowing smile.We watch the Pickles, a middle-school kids’ softball team led by blustering dad-coach Dan (Will Forte), as they play a crucial match. They win! Thus they have the chance to play in the state championship seven days later, which is as scary as it is exciting. That is the foundation every instalment is built on. Like a sporting version of multiple-perspective arthouse classicRashomon, we keep replaying the same week’s events – but through the eyes of a new person each time.First up is Laurie (Rosie Foss), who fears she is only on the Pickles team because her father is the coach. She is correct: she cannot play at all. When batting, pitches fly past her as she stands frozen; in the field, high balls cause her to lose her bearings and fall flat on her back. As peers and parents watch her fail, the beads of sweat on Laurie’s brow coalesce to form Sweaty (Jo Firestone), a malevolent sprite who lives on Laurie’s shoulder, audible and visible only to her, taunting the girl by vocalising her myriad worries.It’s a decent premise but, with the opening episode running to less than 18 minutes, there’s no time to truly flesh out the otherwise interesting characters devised by writer-directors Carrie Hobson and Michael Yates. Laurie is a child of divorce, but her flaky, tarot-reading mother, Carole (Rhea Seehorn), is underused; and Sweaty – who has grown to the size of a rotund adult man by the time the championship game arrives, weighing Laurie down – is, for viewers who have been wooed by the sophistication of the Inside Out films, quite a basic manifestation of nagging insecurity. “Let’s just replay all the mistakes you made today!” and so on.Far better is the second episode. It’s a richer, funnier tale about Frank (Josh Thomson), the umpire of the game and a teacher at the school. Flamboyant and assertive in his shouts of “Strrrrrrrriiiiike!” during the match, Frank becomes a different person as soon as the game is over. His joy in being strict, fair and precise has turned him, in his early 30s, into an unhappy loner.Frank loves fantasy novels and, whenever hostile people or difficult emotions come his way, his defences go up in the form of a magically manifesting shield and suit of armour. At first, that happens when players’ parents disagree far too vehemently with his umpiring calls – but in his personal life, Frank’s problems are more serious. His fear of emotional commitment has robbed him of the love of his life, and his reluctant entry into the world of dating apps – rendered as a perilous video game – prompts a test of courage he might not pass.It’s a tender, wise story, packed with delightful supporting characters and such corking throwaway gags as the walls of Frank’s lonely apartment being hung with a framed picture of his mother, and a much larger photo of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If most of Win or Lose turns out to be this good, it will be close to aPixarclassic.That, however, feels less likely, given the controversy that has burdened the show. A forthcoming episode focuses on star player Kai, voiced by transgender actor Chanel Stewart. Stewart revealed that Kai was conceived as a transgender character but wasthen changed to a cisgendered girl. Disney’s explanation for the U-turn, that “we recognise that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline”, doesn’t gel with Win or Lose as we’ve seen it so far. If kids watching the show can cope with characters wrestling with crippling anxiety, low self-esteem and the terror of never finding romantic love, then chances are they can handle ruminating on being “born in a girl’s body, but [feeling] like a boy”.Win or Lose’s lack of trans representation merely puts it on a par with virtually every other show on TV, and might ordinarily have passed by unnoticed. But it’s another reason why it feels like a swing and a miss.Win or Lose is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsPixarTV reviewTelevisionAnimation in filmreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even armed with a sword several times your own size and weight, you are often outmatched by the incredible creatures in this action game. In Monster Hunter Wilds, out next week, you are also frequently outmatched by the weather. A routine hunt for some relatively unthreatening creature can go awry as storm clouds gather, bringing with them some terrifying lightning-dragon that will eat you for breakfast. Monsters entangle with each other, tearing with teeth and claws as you turn tail and head for the hills.Over the past couple of weekends, players have been able to get hands-on with Wilds in beta tests, trying out the exquisite character creator and a couple of hunts against a horrid lion (Doshaguma) and an overgrown poisonous chicken (Gypceros). As someone old enough to have played these games on the PlayStation 2, and then later with my fingers contorted uncomfortably around a PlayStation Portable during a student year abroad in Japan, I am amazed and delighted by what Monster Hunter has become. What was once a stiff and densely complex game that hid all its thrills behind a barricade of mushroom-gathering quests is now a fluid, inviting and globally popular spectacle of a thing.Monster Hunter World, 2018’s entry, broke Capcom records and reached 23m sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Evidently it still excites him; he’s been front and centre on a lot of Wilds’ promotion. “It’s really energising for our team to watch so many people play the game at the same time,” he told me at the most recent Tokyo Game Show, where over 250,000 people turned up to try out forthcoming games. “There’s a lot of things we can only discover by watching players pick up the game and try it out, things we don’t ever get to see in our own testing. We’ve got a few of the dev team undercover on the booth so they can watch how players are responding.”Ryozo Tsujimoto takes players through the Monster Hunter Wilds beta testThe main innovation in Wilds is how the monsters interact with each other. Previously herbivores would potter about grazing in herds, but it’s only with the additional power of the current generation of consoles that the team had been able to create a seamless ecosystem where they’ll come across each other and get into turf wars. “Having creatures travel together in a realistic way is challenging in terms of making it look plausible,” says Yuya Tokuda, Wilds’ director. “If they all moved in perfect sync it would be a bit uncanny and unconvincing as a pack animal behaviour. But if each individual monster was a complete wildcard, like they were before, it would be untenable to keep it all together. Striking that balance between herd and pack behaviours while having individuality for each creature … that was a lot of work, and we had to get it going from nothing.”‘Even more vicious and threatening than before’: the fantastical creatures of Monster Hunter WildsRead more“I think it’s finally let us make the humans be part of the same ecosystem as everything else in the game,” adds Kaname Fujioka, the art director. “The depiction of a totally seamless ecosystem where there’s not even a loading screen between the base and the map itself is something that has only been possible on this generation.”Monster Hunter’s creators have traditionally done their natural-behaviour research out in the real world on a kind of global team safari, getting a feel for different natural surroundings and recording ambient soundscapes that would later appear in the games. They’ve been to Argentina, Chile and Patagonia, places so remote that they had to subscribe to a satellite phone service because their phones wouldn’t work. This time around, Covid restrictions kicked in right around the time that they would have been out on these research expeditions, so they had to make do with watching a lot of nature documentaries – except Tokuda, who has what he describes as a “significant number” of pet lizards. He has created a special environment at home for them to roam around.View image in fullscreenMonster Hunter Wilds.Photograph: CapcomExpectations are high for Wilds. Its publisher Capcom is on a run at the moment, having had several more big hits since the last Monster Hunter game in 2018, including popular remakes of its older Resident Evil horror titles – but Monster Hunter remains its makers’ very biggest game. In fact it’s now one of the world’s biggest. At one point during its first open beta test last November, more than 460,000 people were playing Wilds at the same time.Tsujimoto is confident that Worlds can hold its own among gaming’s apex predators. “Any big blockbuster game is our competition now,” says Tsujimoto. “That’s the turf we’ve chosen.”Monster Hunter Wilds is out 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bridget picks up her daughter’s stuffed rabbit, sniffs it, says “It stinks!”, then kisses it anyway. It hints at the radical self-acceptance our widowed protagonist seems determined to instil in her children – but it’s also testament to the amount of Bridget lore heaped into this film.In Helen Fielding’s second book, Bridget and Mark are struggling along in their new relationship, trying to overcome their differences and the fronts they put up for one another. On the way out of a Debenhams Colour Me Beautiful appointment, her mum supplies a rare insight: that Bridget’s favourite book as a child was The Velveteen Rabbit, in which the most loved toy is the one whose fur has been rubbed off – the one which, perhaps, stinks. “That’s what happens when people really love each other,” Pam explains. “It doesn’t happen to ones who have sharp edges, or break if they get dropped … you have to be brave and let the other person know who you are and how you feel.”Were the film-makers also referencing Bridget’s own infamous rabbit costume, and the bizarre episode, also in the second book, in which she finds a disturbed young boy, naked and clutching a rabbit, in Mark’s bedroom? Who can say. But reader, I was a goner.Barbara SpeedGhostly tunes from Oliver! at bedtimeMy expectations were not high forBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, but I wept half a dozen times and laughed about the same – which is about six times more than I was expecting on either count. The tears came faster than the laughs: the first when we see spectral Colin Firth haltingly singing “I’d do anything” to his young son, to soothe him to sleep.Horrifically button-pushing, of course – grieving wife and son try to gain comfort from the ever-more-hazy memory of a much-missed husband and father – but shockingly effective. I still can’t quite work out why. Maybe it’s that, for me, the idea of a small, dark-haired, chess-loving boy being bereaved is especially upsetting. But actually, I think it’s probably particular to Firth himself.Some actors seem to immediately access audience emotions and he – like, say, Judi Dench – is one of them. It’s something about good eyes and consistent understatement and unassailable dignity even when resigning oneself to feelings you’d rather not have (like, in the first film, falling for an utter loon like Bridget Jones). Anyway, it got me.Catherine ShoardThe son sings at the concertFor me, 2016’sBridget Jones’s Babyis up there withMamma Mia! Here We Go Againas one of the most fun, self-consciously silly sequels of the last decade. So I was hoping for more of the same with the fourth Bridget Jones film, and boy did I get it: I audibly cackled in the cinema more than once.What I wasn’t expecting was for the new film to be a properly sad, moving study of grief.By the time Bridget’s son Billy performs the song his father used to sing to him at his school concert, tears were running down my face. An earnest, grieving child singing angelically is obviously a moment designed to make us bleary-eyed, but this doesn’t feel gratuitous – it serves the plot, in that by Billy’s teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) arranging this performance, he reveals his kindness to Bridget, cementing himself as a worthy suitor. It speaks to how we all grieve differently, and how amazing it feels when someone takes the time to understand what we really need.I cried a bit more when, in the film’s final scene, Billy is wearing the same reindeer-emblazoned turtleneck that his father was wearing when he first met Bridget – what I initially thought was a wink to keen-eyed fans of the franchise, until multiple closeups of the jumper were shown, followed by a picture of Colin Firth in it as the credits rolled. Oh well. We’ve never watched Bridget Jones for its subtlety, after all. But, with this latest film, we can turn to Bridget not just when we want to laugh, but also when we need a good cry.Lucy KnightDead DarcyI cracked within mere minutes at the sight of Mark Darcy in his long black coat, briefcase in hand. He walks up to Bridget and, with his little boy grin that she’s always brought out in him, greets her as “Mrs Darcy”, ready to unite together against one of those ghastly dinner parties she’s always dreaded. But then, he disappears. Bridget is alone. Mark is dead.View image in fullscreen‘I was left an all-cried-out husk’ … Colin Firth and Renée Zellweger in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Jay Maidment/APIt didn’t matter that I’d already grieved him for years, given that he died in the third book, or that I’d seen this moment about 20 times before in the trailer. I was floored by the memories of a relationship I’ve been rooting for since I was barely a teenager: specifically, the unbearably romantic scene in the first film, where Mark forgets he is sitting with Bridget and her urban family over a feast of blue soup and marmalade, because his big brown eyes are too lost in staring at this chaotic woman who he likes very much, just as she is.Perhaps what I’m trying to say, very inarticulately, is that I’ve fancied the sideburns off this human rights lawyer for nearly quarter of a century – and while Bridge has always been the hero of her own story, I love Mark for making her swoony dreams come true. I probably owe my own hopeless romantic disposition to him. So, of course, two hours later, after his ghostly presence returned to sing I’d Do Anything to his mini-me son, then later stood in the audience to clap his boy performing said song at a concert, I was left an all-cried-out husk.Hollie RichardsonThe griefMy dad died in December. While his illness was long and slow, his death felt sudden and shocking. Anyone who has seen a loved one go through dementia will know how it was; he faded until there was nothing for the disease to take from him any more. He was 64.I watched the fourth Bridget Jones film three weeks after his funeral, and spent most of it a sobbing wreck – not just because of how it captures the crushing sadness of losing someone essential, but also for its gentle guidance on how to move on.The message that your loved one will always be a part of you, that you don’t need to “let them go” to rediscover life, and that it isn’t a disservice to them to feel joy, had me feeling lighter than I had in weeks.Bridget knows that her children are still the part of Mark that she can hold and love. And in my dad’s final days in the hospital, I was able to tell him that I was pregnant, that he was the first person in our family to know, and how much I hoped that they would be just like him.Bridget Jones helped me to see my pregnancy – so early in the days of my dad’s loss – in a new light. While I could hardly register the joy of one thing against the heartbreak for another, I realised that whoever this little person will be, my dad will be a part of them, too – and that didn’t mean forgetting him to move on. It meant embracing him more than ever.A shirtless Leo Woodall also didn’t hurt …Emmy GriffithsChiwetel Ejiofor finally gets a romcom leadView image in fullscreen‘One of the best actors of his generation’ … Chiwetel Ejiofor in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Jay Maidment/APThe pleasures of Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy are unexpected, not least because many of them have a melancholy, elegiac edge you don’t normally associate with romantic comedy. Even its optimism is tinged with loss and regret, and with questions about what happens when someone dies. None of this applies to the early scenes with Chiwetel Ejiofor as the pragmatic science teacher Mr Wallaker. He and Bridget don’t hit it off straight away, which of course means, according to the Rules of Romcom World, that they’re destined to get together later on.This is Ejiofor’s first leading romcom role and I wouldn’t say he was miscast, even if, as Mr Wallaker, he does give off a bit of a Superman pretending to be Clark Kent vibe. Nevertheless, it isn’t until he and Bridget share supervising duties on a school field trip and he takes his shirt off that she begins to see the light. And it isn’t until he’s comforting her nine-year-old son about the loss of his father that you’re reminded Mr Wallaker is being played by one of the best actors of his generation. “Your dad is everywhere,” he says, which is when I got something in my eye.Anne BillsonThe flawed parentingI had an odd moment watching Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, a film, I should add, I’d needed some arm-twisting to go and see (not helped by the Guardian only giving ittwo stars). As Bridget’s son completed his solo of I’d Do Anything, I found myself about to clap. In the cinema! Can you imagine?Thank God, I pulled myself together just in time – but the feeling was real. I was unexpectedly captivated by this gentle, not-riotously funny film about a single mum and her vulnerable, loving children. In fact I almost welled up with pride at our (non-British) national institution, Renée Zellweger.But above all, as I watched Bridget negotiate her complicated life with characteristic ambivalence and uncertainty, I found myself thinking about the job I’d done as a (non-single) parent – reflecting on the times I could have been kinder, gentler and more loving with my own children. And, to my surprise, that really touched me.Samuel JamesView image in fullscreen‘I found myself thinking about the job I’d done as a parent’ … Mila Jankovic and Renée Zellweger in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Jay Maidment/APFriends – and exes – growing old togetherThe latest Bridget Jones movie is bookended by two parties. The first is the kind unworthy of the name – a dinner with acquaintances, where every conversation is a lightly veiled attempt to find out who is losing at life.The second is a house party with all Bridget’s loved ones in attendance, her friends Jude, Tom and Shazza, and her ex, Daniel Cleaver, showing the kids how to make vodka cocktails, everyone tipsy and dancing in a sunsetting glow. One of the pleasures of middle age and beyond, not spoken about often enough, is the fact of the friends you have known for decades, people who have seen you through small mistakes and big ones, through hangovers, grief, success and failure, breakups, maybe breakdowns, who have seen you at your worst but still somehow seem to like you quite a lot. If you’re lucky, this might include an ex or two – the ex who didn’t screw you over, but just wasn’t right for you, who knows you as well as anyone could. This film is a moving reminder to hang on to those exes. And hang on to those friends. You can make new friends, as they say, but you can’t make old ones.These friendships are difficult to depict on screen, unless you have been filming with the same cast for 24 years. Did I arrive in the office after Mad About the Boy and compare it toBoyhood, the movie Richard Linklater famously filmed with the same actors over more than a decade? Yes. Did the film editor roll her eyes? Also yes. But I stand, at least partly, by the comparison. The latest Bridget Jones captures as well as anything I have seen the poignancy and joy of having friends who sustain you through a lifetime.Kira CochraneView image in fullscreen‘Friends who sustain you through a lifetime’ … Renée Zellweger and Sally Phillips in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Jay Maidment/APHugh Grant in hospitalI can’t profess to be a Bridget Jones lifer. In fact, I only raced through the first two instalments in the week before Mad About the Boy’s release, in order to get vaguely up to speed with the saga. Those first two films – likable, daffy, a portal back to a lighter, more optimistic age – did not at all prepare me for the emotional devastation of what is surely the saddest film ever to feature a scene where children are instructed in how to make a cocktail called a Filthy Bitch.That moment was engineered, of course, by Daniel Cleaver: Hugh Grant’s cheerful cad and the character who represents the most tangible link to those lighter, earlier outings. Continuing Grant’s preposterous run of scene-stealing supporting parts in the last decade, Cleaver plays a vital, mood-lifting role in the latest film, armed and ready at all times with a smutty, absurdist zinger whenever things are getting too introspective. Which made the scene in which Bridget rushes to see Cleaver, who has been hospitalised with a heart scare, hit all the harder. In a rare moment of sombre self-reflection, he realises quite how lonely his decades-long misadventures have made him, lamenting in particular the son he hasn’t ever gotten – or tried particularly hard – to know. It turned the character suddenly, poignantly 3D, bringing to mind all the real-life people who found themselves in a similar situation, sat on a hospital bed, filled with regrets – though (unlike Cleaver) lacking the opportunity to make up for them.I can’t say with certainty that it was the scene that made me sob the loudest, but it definitely was the moment that caught me the most blubbingly unawares.Gwilym MumfordView image in fullscreenEmotional devastation … Hugh Grant and Renée Zellweger in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.Photograph: Universal Pictures/APFriends keeping our essence aliveThe first bit of BJ4 that got me was Bridget’s lovely dad, in his dying days, telling his widowed daughter that it wasn’t enough to survive, she also had tolive. Much of Mad About the Boy dwells on her fears around how to keep the late Mark Darcy’s memory alive for their children, and as others have said, the film’s most tear-jerking moments are those explicitly about preserving Mark in song, in celibacy and by shunning awful so-called memorial dinners with pitying “friends” (theCosmo and Woney!) for a much more fitting ad hoc pub wake with her gang, over blue cocktails (hopefully made from authentic string-based colouring).That’s what really pranged me deep in my core: yes, we keep the memories of the dead alive, but that our oldest, closest friends keep the essence of each other alive, that profound depth of mutual understanding allowing us still to be just the way we are, even when assailed by mercilessly shifting societal norms or viperish school gate mums – or, in the now rather venerable Daniel Cleaver’s case, the fall of Rome for a certain type of Kings Road-preying rogue. Having had devoted friendships with two saucy scallywags myself, one of whom is sadly no longer with us, I love and recognise Bridge and Cleaver’s bond – always pushing each other to make their respective lives a bit bigger, whether through pursuing more shags or reconciling with estranged sons.And seeing the same cast a quarter of a century on reminds me how lucky I am to remain so tight with the three women I watchedthe first film with as 12-year-old girls. We thread each other’s core past selves through our present, and get to watch these histories refracted anew in the four funny little daughters who have expanded our gang. Obviously I wept at the sad bits of BJ4 but these are the notions that made me cry happy tears. At one point in the film, rationalist science teacher Mr Wallaker and romantic Bridget tussle over whether the soul really exists. The truly beautiful Mad About the Boy is conclusive evidence that it does.Laura SnapesExplore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsBereavementDeath and dyingFamilyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The subsequent six-year gap until GoldenEye was the longest break in the history of Bond.It has been four years since the 2021 release of No Time To Die and, with no new film in production, the current hiatus is on course to become 007’s longest ever holiday.Gaining creative control will give Amazon the power to move forward without approval from Wilson and Broccoli, who have acted as careful guardians of the integrity of a character originally created in 1953 by author Ian Fleming.View image in fullscreenBarbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson pictured in London in 2022.Photograph: Suzan Moore/PASteven Gaydos, executive editor of the US film magazine Variety, said he was initially surprised by the deal after reports that Broccoli and Wilson had not hit it off with the new owners,denied by Amazon, and were unhappy at the prospect of several Bond spin-offs.He said: “It wasn’t that long ago that it was reported that Barbara and Michael had sparred with Amazon and there had been a fight over it. But they’re getting older and there is a mountain to climb to achieve what they have done.“It’s a record that will never be matched. They kept turning over the card and coming up with an ace, over and over.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects. Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.”Broccoli, 64, said: “My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli. I have had the honour of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of No Time to Die, and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”Broccoli is the daughter of Cubby Broccoli, who co-founded the series with fellow producer Harry Saltzman. She began working on the Bond films as a teenager in minor roles, before acting as assistant director on Octopussy in 1983 and associate producer on The Living Daylights in 1987. Her first full Bond producer credit was onGoldenEyein 1995.Wilson is Cubby Broccoli’s stepson. A qualified lawyer, he joined Broccoli’s Eon Productions in 1972 and became executive producer on Moonraker in 1979, and moved to producer for A View to a Kill in 1985.Together the pair built Bond into one of the most successful franchises in cinema history, having grossed more than $7.8bn worldwide, behind only the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Spider-Man. The most successful Bond film remains Skyfall, released in 2012, with a worldwide gross of $1.1bn.Eon has been reluctant to spread the Bond name too thin through the kind of spin-offs that have proved fruitful for streaming services, which have cashed in on the popularity of films such as Star Wars or zombie TV show The Walking Dead.A rare foray outside the Bond films was the creation of007: Road to a Million, a reality competition series released on Amazon Prime Video that features nine teams competing for a £1m prize.Explore more on these topicsJames BondAmazonJeff BezosFilm industryAmazon Prime VideonewsShareReuse this content"

Still, here they are, playing in front of backdrops reading “UH” on what is being called a farewell tour, although they make it clear from the stage that they’re not done making albums.Guitarist Mick Box is the sole survivor from the lineup that released 1970’s … Very ’Eavy … Very ’Umble, but aged 77, sporting long, grey hair, he still rocks so heroically he should have a preservation order on him. Canadian vocalist Bernie Shaw, who joined in 1986, brings a similar operatic style to the late original vocalist David Byron, and at a relatively youthful 68 hits notes so high you suspect some can only be heard by animals. The whole band are grinning, and when Shaw yells “Let’s have some fun, Birmingham!”, the seated audience rise to their feet and stay there, even if standing all night might be a challenge for a few.View image in fullscreenNotes so high only animals can hear … Bernie Shaw sings with Uriah Heep At Symphony Hall, Birmingham.Photograph: Steve Thorne/RedfernsShaw promises they’ll “hit every decade” and the set list duly stretches from 1970’s Gypsy to 2023’s tuneful Hail the Sunrise without ever straying too far from their early rockers, which were replete with lyrics about demons and wizards. Box has real range: he straps on an acoustic guitar at one point, but when Shaw promises “heavy metal like it used to be”, Box’s playing is truly blistering. When powerhouse drummer Russell Gilbrook, 60, suddenly has to take a short break owing to a cramp, Box quips “this middle-aged stuff really gets us down”, to widespread laughter. Perhaps if they’d had a cultural touchstone hit like Paranoid or Smoke on the Water they’d be as revered as contemporaries Black Sabbath or Deep Purple. Still, the keyboard-drenchedJuly Morningis quite the epic, and as the clock approaches the two-hour mark, it’s hard to disagree when Box insists: “There’s life in the old dog yet!”At Bristol Beacon, 20 February, thentouring the UKuntil 27 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMetalPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a cruel irony, then, that many of us who make it that far will begin to lose our sense of who we are due to dementia. If you’re 65, you’ve got about a one in 20 chance of developing the most common form, Alzheimer’s disease, in the next decade. At 75, it’s about one in seven, while those fortunate enough to reach 85 face a one in three chance.Given the toll this illness takes on sufferers and those around them, hundreds of millions of families around the world are desperate for a medical breakthrough – and for years, headlines have suggested that it might be imminent. Scientists had identified the cause of Alzheimer’s, they promised, and potential cures were already being tested.The subtitle of Doctored – Fraud, Arrogance and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s–serves as a spoiler as to how that story ends, at least for the moment. The fraud uncovered by a rag-tag group of researchers into academic integrity and extensively documented here by Charles Piller, an investigative journalist for the magazine Science, feels like the kind of scandal that should have had wall-to-wall coverage. And yet, outside scientific circles, it remains relatively low-profile.The story is complicated, but a summary might go like this: for decades, something called the amyloid hypothesis has dominated research into Alzheimer’s, determining how billions of dollars of public and private funding into new drugs was spent. The brains of people who had died with it showed clumps of sticky protein – called amyloid plaques – between neurons. It seemed logical that these might be responsible for the disease’s symptoms. And while this became the main line of inquiry, it never quite delivered on its early promise. Many people with amyloid plaques didn’t have signs of Alzheimer’s, for example. Something seemed to be missing.And then came what seemed like decisive proof: a 2006 paper from the University of Minnesota, which went on to become one of the most cited in the field, showed that a sub-type of amyloid led to memory impairment. It wasn’t until 2022 that scientific sleuthssuggestedthat key images on which the research relied might have been Photoshopped to better fit the hypothesis. At first, the scientists fought back against the claims, but the 2006 paper has now beenretracted, as have others based around the same findings. As the book explains, investigations continue and several key figures involved deny any knowledge of wrongdoing.Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than readThe implication is that years of work and billions of dollars spent on Alzheimer’s research may have been carried out on the basis of fraudulent evidence. The scale of the harm caused and damage done is likely to be incalculable.Piller handles the difficult material patiently and meticulously, as you would expect of an experienced specialist reporter. As the book continues, it becomes an ever more uncomfortable read: the tale starts with the alleged fakery of images by one, or a handful, of scientists. By the end, we’re left wondering if any research can really be trusted.Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than it is to read. Piller tries to humanise his narrative with pen portraits of key figures, but his habit of doing several of these in a row – and formulaically telling us everyone’s place of birth and what their parents and grandparents did – gets repetitive and frustrating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It’s a supernatural parable of imperial anxiety and sexual hysteria: the bizarre and unclassifiable story of three demure and porcelain-white schoolgirls and one teacher who on Valentine’s Day 1900 – with the 19th century over and the Victorian age less than a year to run – simply vanish in the burning sun while on a picnic excursion to the forbiddingly vast monolith Hanging Rock in southern Australia. No one here uses the Indigenous name Ngannelong and the only Indigenous character is a tracker.They disappear while exploring its rugged forms and inlets, which weirdly resemble the faces of Easter Island statues. Like the Marabar Caves in Forster’s A Passage to India, Hanging Rock is the centre of some unknowable enigma, almost audibly humming or throbbing with insects, a phenomenon that resists being subdued by the outsider’s rational law.The film is a classic of the Australian new wave and, in its sun-stricken hallucinatory strangeness, one to put alongside Ted Kotcheff’sWake in Frightor Nic Roeg’sWalkaboutfrom 1971; it is a movie that influenced much later Australian films such as Greg McLean’sWolf Creekand Ray Lawrence’sJindabyne. It fascinatingly affects the mannerism of a true-crime cold case, but it is not based on anything from real life; author Joan Lindsay said it came to her in a dream. (A newbiography of Lindsaypoints out that this great novel was not published until she was 71, after a lifetime of feeling marginalised and erased as a creative artist – another possible explanation for the vanishing.)Perhaps bizarrely, the obvious real-world point of reference occurred after both novel and film: the press paranoia surrounding the Chamberlain baby case in 1980, in which a two-month-old disappeared without trace while the family was on a camping holiday near the awe-inspiringly gigantic rock Uluru, and where the police and courts disbelieved the mother’s (finally vindicated) claim that a dingo had taken her baby. (It was the subject of Fred Schepisi’s filmEvil Angels– AKA A Cry in the Dark – in 1988, with Meryl Streep.)‘Clambering about in Victorian boots was brutal’: how we made Picnic at Hanging RockRead moreRachel Roberts plays English headteacher Mrs Appleyard, a widow who is privately plagued by memories of summer holidays with her late husband in Bournemouth. She has permitted certain girls to go on a picnic to Hanging Rock, while those who have displeased her must stay on the school grounds. These dreamily sweet teenagers, longing for romance and love and nursing crushes on each other, are like the vestal virgins of some votive cult: the cult of Saint Valentine, in fact. There is something almost hypnotised in their behaviour, as if they know what is to happen, that they are to be secret sacrifices to a hidden god or be returned to their planet of origin.When the catastrophe is revealed, it convulses the school and the surrounding townships, disclosing a suppressed misery and fear, and simple exhaustion. Is it that the girls in their diaphanous white dresses represent the most vulnerable side of an effete colonial people, who are destined to evaporate in the heat and dust? Or that they represent a willed romantic self-immolation in the face of repression – a striking part of the case is that one missing girl is recovered, without her corsets. The film’s mystery still shimmers.Picnic at Hanging Rock is in UK and Irish cinemas from 21 February, and in Australian cinemas from 14 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsAustralian filmPeriod and historical filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Brothers Thad and Hazen struggle to make a living logging and sawing firewood on their rugged, isolated smallholding in Montana’s Beartooth mountains, bordering Yellowstone national park. Their father had laboured at this business until illness took his savings and his life, leaving his sons with a mountain of medical bills, and a lien for unpaid property taxes that brings them to the verge of losing their family home. The brothers are reluctantly drawn into the dirty, risky work of poaching, shooting black bear out of season for their skin, skull and claws, and even more valuable gallbladder. “Hazen could find and excise this organ by feel, his face pointed up and away, his eyes closed with concentration, his hands moving around the hot insides of the animal as if he were rummaging through a junk drawer.”Sacajawea, the brothers’ “sporadic mother”, returns after many years away, parks her “hippy van” outside their house and gets a job in the health food store in town. Thad is 27 years old to Hazen’s 26, and has taken on the role of responsible adult, his brother living a prolonged, chaotic adolescence. Thad is angry at their mother. She left shortly after teaching him how to read: “he remembered for a long time thinking if he had continued to stumble over words, his mother would have never gone”. Hazen is content to have her home, fishes for her and, without his brother realising, the two form a close relationship.Wink’s descriptions of nature are superbly precise and vivid, never anthropomorphising the world and its non-human inhabitantsThe criminal contact for their poaching is the Scot, a man with a reputation for murderous violence; he wears a kilt and plays bagpipes, but his national identity is dubious, as is his status of “father” to a girl in her late teens to whom Hazen is attracted. The Scot has a lucrative and dangerous mission for the men: to gather antler fall in Yellowstone that he can sell on to a maker of expensive chandeliers for people who want to decorate their homes with symbols of the wild. What follows is an atmospheric and superbly executed drama as the brothers journey into the interior, “a land that harboured no people, just rocks and snow and trees and the twisting braids of rivers”.There is ample whitewater, white-knuckle action, but if this were a conventional adventure story, the ratcheting of tension might have been released predictably in climactic scenes with law enforcement or the Scot. These thriller elements are present, and skilfully realised in the narrative, but Wink proceeds far more interestingly, developing Beartooth into an expansive and convincing novel of family relationships: the difficult and loving one between Hazen and Thad, and between Thad and his mother. Sacajawea, after remaining silent for much of the narrative, gets the novel’s longest monologue, deepening the reader’s understanding of her family story, and her connection with the brothers’ father, which ultimately helps her reconnect with Thad.The landscape is a powerful presence in the novel, a place of turbulent rivers, ominous canyons and rapidly shifting seasons in which “one day the cottonwoods were fully clad in gold, and the next they were stripped bare”. Wink’s descriptions of nature are superbly precise and vivid, never anthropomorphising the world and its non-human inhabitants.The western trope of the strong, self-reliant individual contending with a lyrically described environment and its gnarled human inhabitants, driven by violent impulses and private moral codes, is upturned by Wink’s close, convincing and unsentimental observation of people and nature. This realism extends to his understanding of how corporations, banks and federal and local government determine the scope and possibility of ordinary American lives, the power of the individual dwarfed by society and big money, vulnerable to a single turn of bad luck, ill health or simply the travails of ageing. This makes Beartooth an emotionally rich and compelling piece of storytelling, and an almost incidentally political novel.When Thad fixes the roof of the family house, looking out at the Absaroka mountains “stretching back all the way to the eternal winter of the Beartooth Plateau”, recalling his father in a state of some relief from the intensity of grief, and perhaps of gratitude for his love and labour, it’s a potent symbol of the power of hope and those transformative acts that might remain in the hands of the individual.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s the customary slavishly admiring portrait of its subject, the Danish goalkeeper who anchoredManchester Unitedto a string of league titles and Denmark to the European Championships, but you are left with a sense that, somehow, Peter Schmeichel is a big enough character to justify it. Inevitably, the film also acts as yet another outpost of the “Football, bloody hell!” documentary industrial complex, with one more airing of the footage of United’s Champions League final triumph.Admittedly, there’s now an extra dimension to Clive Tyldesley’s strangulated shrieks as United scored their winner: this was Schmeichel’s last game for the side, having unexpectedly announced his exit from the team earlier in the season. It’s a piquant moment when he raises the cup as his last act. And while he’s talked about it before, it’s still a little sad to hear him say: “Of course it was a massive mistake leaving Manchester United.” Schmeichel talks about how changing his mind might have been interpreted as a sign of weakness by manager Alex Ferguson, and perhaps he might be right, but you can feel the jolt when he shows up to play against United for Manchester City, and gets the cold shoulder from former compadre Gary Neville.Though this film is very much the official version, it does mine some interesting family and psychological seams. Schmeichel’s Polish-born jazz-musician dad was, he says, a double agent for both sides during the cold war (the price of getting out of Poland), and evidently passed on his musical gifts; there’s an amusing clip from a Danish version of This Is Your Life when Schmeichel Sr tells his son to work on being a pianist: “It’s never too late, you can still make it.” As a corrective to Schmeichel’s notorious on-field aggression, there’s a quite a bit of soft-focus emoting on show here, mostly in connection to his footballing son Kasper, but he does manage a measure of honesty over the dislikable elements in his character that propelled his career: “I know deep down, if I hadn’t have been like that, it wouldn’t have happened for me.”Schmeichel is atHome, Manchester, and on digital platforms from 21 February.Explore more on these topicsSport filmsDocumentary filmsManchester UnitedDenmarkEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

On a clear day, its jagged, alluring and yet foreboding topography – stretching outward into the Irish Sea – is easily visible from as far south as Aberystwyth. No wonder it was chosen as the location for the recentHouse of the DragonGame of Thrones spin-off series. It’s also been my constant backdrop for the past few days as I walk theWales Coast Pathexploring the relationship of the people of this land to the sea – how it has shaped society, how humanity has tried to tame it and how the sea will inevitably prevail.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Now, having reached Porthmadog (a town built on reclaimed sand from the Glaslyn estuary), I’m ready to experience the entrancing, wild-looking beauty of the Llŷn up close. I have three walks planned over the coming days. The first is a gentle six-mile stroll from Borth-y-Gest (one bay over from Porthmadog) to Criccieth Castle. As I set out, the tide is retreating at a rate that makes me think someone has pulled the plug on the entire estuary. The small boats bobbing in the bay become statues as they are stranded in the sand.A large jellyfish lies on a beach directly below Porthmadog golf course. Two kids poke it tentatively with a piece of driftwood. Buried in the sand are huge slabs of micro-layered black and grey slate. They look like stranded giants – could these rocks have inspired the Mabinogi story of Brân the Blessed whose gargantuan severed head was carried back to the Llŷn by his loyal knights after a fateful battle with the Irish king Matholwch?From the top of Graig Ddu (Black Rock), I can seeCriccieth Castle, standing broken but proud on the cliffs in the centre of the town. Unlike many of Gwynedd’s Norman castles, this was built in the 13th century by the Welsh king Llywelyn the Great, as a demonstration of his power and authority over rival Welsh princes.The artistJMW Turnerpainted the castle on a tour through Wales in 1835. His watercolour captures a great storm rolling in and breaking over the castle. In the foreground, local people gather to retrieve items being washed up by the sea. It is a theme that has repeated through the centuries. On the night of 27 October 1927, a violent storm – combined with a potent spring tide – hammered into the Llŷn peninsula. The storm surge and waves destroyed homes built below Criccieth castle with such ferocity that it was decided never to rebuild there.View image in fullscreenPwllheli’s West End Parade is the start point of Matthew’s second walk.Photograph: kodachrome25/Getty ImagesThe second of my walks begins in Pwllheli, meandering along the town’s West End Parade and providing impressive views of theRhinogydd mountain range, part ofEryri national park(Snowdonia). The beach below me is empty and the sand dazzling white, though the footprints on it suggest a small army of early morning dog walkers have already been and gone. Marram grass swishes and ruffles as the wind flows through it.This area of Pwllheli was the vision of Solomon Andrews, a Cardiff-based developer and entrepreneur who had been inspired by the Victorian beach resort of Llandudno. Starting in 1893 Andrews built beachfront properties and the West End Hotel onmorfa(salt marsh) situated between the mouth of the Afon Rhyd-hir and the sea. He also constructed a tramway connecting Pwllheli with his mansion, Plas Glyn y Weddw, a few miles up the coast.With so many speedboats and jetskis carving up the sea, Abersoch looks more like a scene from the French Riviera than the coast of north WalesToday, the tramway is part of the Wales Coast Path and I follow it until I reach Traeth Llanbedrog, a pretty mini crescent bay flanked, at the top of its sandy beach, by a row of multicoloured huts. I climb up throughPlas Glyn y Weddw’s ornamental gardens to the top ofMynydd Tir y Cwmwd. The resort of Abersoch – one of the most desirable (and expensive) beach towns on the Llŷn lies directly ahead. In all the days of walking the Welsh coast, I’ve never seen so many speedboats and jetskis carving up the sea. It looks more like a scene from the French Riviera than the coast of north Wales.In the far distance lies Ynys Enlli (Bardseyisland), spiritual home to Cadfan, a sixth-century Welsh saint whose monastery was recognised as one of the holiest sites in all of Europe. Over the centuries Bardsey’s mystique increased thanks to oral storytellers who claimed that the magician Myrddin (Merlin) was buried on the island and perhaps, even, that King Arthur had forged his sword, Excalibur there.View image in fullscreenThe coast path near Porthdinllaen.Photograph: Chris Howes/Wild Places Photography/AlamyMy final walk is on the north side of the Llŷn and promises to be the most challenging – a 13-mile uphill hike from the old herring fishing village ofPorthdinllaento the town ofTrefor, a few miles south of Caernarfon. Across the bay, I can see the red facade of theTŷ Cochpub, an Insta-celebrated watering hole nestled among fishers’ cottages.This section of coast path has been badly eroded – so much so that walkers are diverted inland. When I stop for a coffee at a beachfront cafe in the village of Nefyn, a young woman asks if I will sign a petition to rebuild the path.“It’s so important for the tourist trade. It will be a disaster if it isn’t repaired,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ahead of me is a long, gentle crescent bay. At the top of its pebble beach lies a set of old, alien-looking buildings that sit below a hollowed-out cliff face. I’ve arrived at Nant Gwrtheyrn, once one of the most important quarries in all of Europe and source of the granite that paved city streets throughout the Victorian world.The dad of two of the Super Furry Animals led a  campaign to transform a derelict hamlet into what is now the Nant Gwrtheyrn National Welsh Language and Heritage CentreMore than 200 people lived in this isolated coastal village at one time but the granite industry fell into decline after the first world war and Nant Gwrtheyrn was deserted by the early 1950s. It would have been left to ruin were it not for the vision of Carl Clowes, an English doctor who relocated in 1970 to a small village a few miles inland. Clowes’s mother was Welsh and he was keen to raise his children as Welsh speakers. The first Welsh Language Act had come into effect in 1967 and Clowes identified a growing need for adults to learn Welsh. He led a community campaign to transform the derelict hamlet into what is now the Nant Gwrtheyrn National Welsh Language and Heritage Centre. When it fully opened in 2003, the Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals played a concert to celebrate. Two of their members, Cian Ciaran and Dafydd Ieuan, had a special reason for performing. Carl Clowes was their dad.The last stage of the walk involves climbing up a stupidly steep road and I’m feeling all of my 57 years as I trudge up the valley. Only later do I learn that it wasn’t until the 1930s that a car succeeded in driving up the hill, so steep was the gradient and so sharp the switchbacks.A glimpse of ancient Wales: the wilder alternative to SnowdonRead moreThe path levels out as it traverses the peaks of Garn Fôr and Garn Ganol. This is where House of the Dragonhas been filming – a nearby disused quarry doubling for Westeros’ Dragonstone Castle. Finally, I make it to Y Tafarn, Trefor’s lone pub. A flock of bedraggled sheep mooch around in the front garden like bored teenagers. I chat with the landlord about all the filming taking place around Trefor as he pours me a pint. I ask him if any of the actors have come in for a drink.“Oh yeah, we had Rhys Ifans last week,” says the landlord, before adding: “Personally, I’m not that fussed with all these celebrities. As Rhys said: ‘You’re the only pub that doesn’t want my photo on the wall.’”Seascape by Matthew Yeomans (University of Wales Press, £18.99) will be published by on13 March.
