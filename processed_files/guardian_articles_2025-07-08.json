Is it a pain? James Gunn’s dim reboot is bothThe Man of Steel – played with square-faced soullessness by David Corenswet – has an uninteresting crisis of confidence in Gunn’s cluttered, pointless franchise restarterPeter BradshawTue 8 Jul 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareHere is a film occupying the heartsinking Venn diagram overlap between franchise exhaustion and AI soullessness: a film fatally unconvinced of the reason for its own existence. We’d all hoped that writer-director James Gunn, who was in charge of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy movie series, might put some wind back beneath Superman’s wings – or in his cape, or under his boots, or at any rate somewhere near his costumed person. The Man of Steel needed a fresh start after his self-cancelling contest inBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justicein 2016, and getting muddled together with a lot of other utility superheroes inJustice Leaguea year later – though I will admit to enjoying the pure hubristic craziness of the lengthy Zack Snyder cut of that movie when it saw the light of day.But this? If it was to be a reboot then really we needed to get back to basics, and be reminded why we liked superheroes in the first place – and I do – and remember why they were exciting and escapist and fun. We needed the clarity and simplicity of something like the origin myth of the infant Superman arriving here from his doomed planet, like Moses, destined to put heart back into an America hit by the Great Depression, hokey though all that may be.Yet from the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times. Superman, played with square-faced vanilla dullness by David Corenswet, has recently taken it upon himself to intervene in a war between two fancifully named fictional nation states. Why this war in particular, and none of the many others happening all over the globe, you ask? Perhaps because these countries are so palpably made up and without inconvenient political associations and implications.The evil aggressor Boravia (conceivably like Putin’s Russia but not really) has invaded the nice people of Jarhanpur (possibly resembling Zelenskyy’s Ukraine but not so as you’d notice). Superman had flown in to help the Jarhanpurians out, stalling the Boravian advance, but at personal cost to himself. He had his superhero ass mortifyingly kicked by some sort of “metahuman” being, occasioning another of his very uninteresting crises of confidence. His opponent was ostensibly from Boravia but possibly under the control of the wicked Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), who insultingly affects not to know what planet Superman comes from, and has perhaps contrived the whole Boravia/Jarhanpur contest to undermine his arch-enemy.Meanwhile, in his civilian persona of Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent, Superman finds himself in serious relationship difficulties with fellow journalist Lois Lane, in which roleRachel Brosnahanchannels Courteney Cox’s Monica Geller from TV’s Friends with such eerie precision it’s difficult to believe it’s not deliberate. Skyler Gisondo tries his best with the role of junior reporter Jimmy Olsen; that formidable actor Wendell Pierce is underused, or in fact simply not used, as Planet editor Perry White, and as Green Lantern, head of the subordinate semi-comic “Justice Gang”, Nathan Fillion raises some smiles.View image in fullscreenHere comes the CGI destruction again.Photograph: Warner Bros. PicturesReboots and remakes: why is Hollywood stuck on repeat?Read moreYet whatever machinations Lex Luthor gets up to, the ironic truth is that what undermines Superman in the eyes of the whole world is not anything he plans but a belated revelation about what his parents Jor-El (Bradley Cooper) and Lara Lor-Van (Angela Sarafyan) really intended for Superman on Earth – which leads to his facing a terrible crisis, exploited by the loathsome Luthor.But what is the point of a film so stymied in its digitally encoded and generically prescribed world that it can’t even go through the motions, as that would imply some level of activity and signs of life? How many more superhero films in general, and Superman films in particular, do we need to see that all end with the same spectacular faux-apocalypse in the big city with CGI skyscrapers collapsing? They were fun at first … but the thrill is gone.Superman is released on 10 July in Australia and on 11 July in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuperhero moviesJames GunnRachel BrosnahanNicholas HoultAction and adventure filmsDC ComicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

When the queen, the pope, Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama were invited to address both houses of parliament, they were given Westminster Hall. On the first state visit of any European leader since Brexit,Emmanuel Macronhad to make do with the Royal Gallery. The UK has been on quite the journey since Liz Truss was unable to identify the French president as friend or foe.Still, the Royal Gallery is not a bad second-best. Indeed, if Donald Trump gets a similar invitation – in doubt, as everyone is trying to avoid that possibility by staging his visit in parliamentary recess – he might even prefer it. Enough gold paint and gilt to satisfy any simple narcissist.We Britons know the way to foreign leaders’ hearts. Just try to persuade Manu not to look too closely to the sides. On the left, an enormous painting of Nelson’s death at Trafalgar. To the right, an equally large daub of Wellington and Prussian field marshal Blücher meeting before the Battle of Waterloo. Awkward.More than an hour before the start of the event, the room was already half full. The organisers of similar events for other foreign leaders in the same venue have had to go scurrying around the parliamentary estate looking for extras to fill the rows of seats when peers and MPs decided they couldn’t be bothered to turn up. No such problem with Macron. Manu is box office.One of the first to arrive was Priti Patel. Awarded a front row seat. Though not looking as if the entente cordiale had reached her yet. She still dreams of slashing small boats with knives.Kemi Badenoch and Ed Davey found themselves seated next to each other and facing 45 minutes to fill with small talk. Both abandoned any pretence of civility early on and sat mostly in silence. Kemi soon turned round and started chatting to Helen Whately.Theresa May made her entrance in her usual way: alone. She seems to prefer things that way. She doesn’t do close friendships in parliament. Or perhaps anywhere. She prefers to sit alone and be left to her own thoughts. None of them probably good. A French accent is enough to cause a meltdown. She still has PTSD from the Brexit negotiations.There was no sign of Nigel Farage. The Reform UK leader had been outraged that Macron had declined to meet him. Odd, that. Nige spends a lifetime slagging off France, the French and the French president, and then is deeply shocked to discover that Macron has better things to do with his three days in England than be abused.Still, there was nothing stopping Nige from coming to hear the president. Except his pride, of course. Never forget that. Also missing was the newly independent James McMurdock. After meeting his lawyers, Young James has concluded that the best way to prove his innocence of wrongdoing over Covid loans is to say nothing further at all.Next the bad news. TheHouse of Lordsdoorkeeper grabbed the microphone to announce that Macron was running about 15 minutes late. Either he had had too good a lunch with the king or the traffic had been heavier than anticipated. An overheated packed room suddenly felt a whole lot more stifling. A few lords were already struggling to stay awake. And that was before Lindsay Hoyle had even started making the introductions. The speaker sure knows how to lose a crowd.When Macron eventually did turn up, Hoyle appeared to imagine that everyone had come to see him. So he started droning on about his favourite subjects: himself and rugby league, for the best part of a quarter of an hour. And when he did go off topic, his main theme was how often the English had bailed out the French in the 20th century. Macron tried to appear interested. His wife, Brigitte, remained inscrutable. She’s clearly perfected her face for sitting through events like this. Several more lords began to nod off.At last it was time for Macron. And he didn’t disappoint. Even if he did go on a bit long, as well. I guess opportunities like this come along once in a lifetime. So you might as well make the most of it.Speaking in an English that was infinitely better than most Britons’ French, he began in style, with references to Montesquieu, Rousseau and Locke. You can’t imagine too many British politicians trying something like that. Then the thanks, the honour bestowed and the obligatory shoutout to Winston Churchill. Still a crowd-pleaser, even though he’s been dead for 60 years.On to the substance. Ukraine, the Coalition of the Willing. France and the UK were leading the European drive for peace and security. Keir Starmer nodded along. Less so when Manu got to the Middle East and called for everyone to recognise the state of Palestine. That’s still a bridge too far for the British government.Having moved around the rest of the world in the search for peace, Macron turned his attention to climate change. We must see off the deniers, he said. He could have started in the Royal Gallery, as Toby Young was in attendance. Perhaps he, too, had nodded off by that point.After a brief drive-by on immigration – we must treat it with humanity, fairness and solidarity, he said – we got to Brexit. He regretted it. But the UK was entitled to make its own mistakes. He looked May in the eye and confessed that he had enjoyed the Brexit negotiations immensely. This tipped the Maybot over the edge. Her flashbacks uncontrollable.Finally we got the big reveal. The French were going to lend us the Bayeux tapestry. And we were going to lend them the Sutton Hoo longboat in return. Good luck with your small boat crossings in that. Still, it was about as close to a one in, one out deal Starmer was likely to get from this state visit.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronThe politics sketchForeign policyHouse of CommonsHouse of LordscommentShareReuse this content"

The suffocating power of that document haunted her for decades, casting a long shadow over her life and making her ill.“If I go back to that room, I did not ever imagine that it would be possible to reach any form of justice,” she says. Now, eight years since she first broke her NDA and inadvertently became the world’s leading campaigner against them, Perkins feels justice may finally be within her grasp. On Monday, in a move that surprised even the most committed campaigners, the UK governmentannounced sweeping measuresthat will prohibit bosses from using NDAs to silence abused employees.The following day, Perkins is still digesting the news, but her delight is palpable. “This is huge,” she says. “It’s the beginning of abusers having to change their behaviour – not because somebody’s wagging a finger at them, not because they are told to, but because they have to. There’s nowhere for them to hide any more, they just have to effing behave themselves.”The government’s stance has, she happily admits, gone beyond her expectations. If unchanged, the new measures will protect gig-economy workers as well as staff, requests for NDAs will be able to come only from complainants, not employers, and workers will be given access to legal advice. Crucially, “non-disparagement clauses” (widely used since non-disclosure became a “dirty word”, says Perkins) will be off the table in cases of abuse.“It’s really, really ambitious; if they actually do what they say they’re going to do, it is totally world-leading,” says Perkins, who set up the Can’t Buy My Silence campaign in the UK to lead the fight against abusive NDAs in 2021. The campaign argued that while NDAs may be necessary for intellectual property or commercially sensitive information, they have become a routinely used weapon to silence victims of bullying, sexual harassment or abuse, especially in lower-income sectors like retail and hospitality.“I’m super excited in a way I haven’t felt before, because I feel like I can almost smell freedom,” she says. “But the reality is this is the first step in quite a long parliamentary process. Tomorrow it is absolutely back to the grindstone, because this isn’t done yet.”View image in fullscreenZelda Perkins speaks to parliament’s women and equalities committee in 2018.Photograph: ReutersWith inclusion and diversity under attack by Donald Trump’s administration, the move is also globally significant, Perkins argues. Legislation has changed in more than 27 US states, a Canadian province and the Republic of Ireland – but companies are feeling nervous.Recently, two global corporations who signed up to Can’t Buy My Silence’s pledge not to use NDAs in cases of abuse, did not want to publicise the fact, for fear of it is being reversed. “With DEI being rolled back, Britain leading the way here is pretty bloody huge,” she says. “There’s part of me that is scared of highlighting that because I don’t want to scare the horses. But essentially, this is actually now much more important than it ever has been.”It is also a moment of huge personal significance. Perkins never wanted to be a campaigner – she just felt, finally, as if she had no other choice. “I’m the most accidental activist that ever walked the earth,” she says. “I’ve literally spent my whole time trying not to do it.“At 24 when I went to the lawyers, I thought: if I tell the grownups, then they’ll sort it out.”She felt the same when she spoke to the New York Times’ Jodi Kantor about Weinstein eight years ago, breaking her NDA and sparking a chain reaction that would eventually lead to his incarceration.“But what I didn’t realise in 2017, when I was 45, was that Iwasa grownup,” she says. “Because I’d been silent for 23 years, I thought nobody could hear me or see me, and I was stupid. I did not believe that I had any right or power to make any change.”When the change she wanted – even expected – to see didn’t happen, she kept going. She enlisted a “ferocious team of female allies” across the campaigning and political sphere – including, but not limited to, the former Conservative minister Maria Miller, Labour’s Jess Phillips and Louise Haigh, and the Liberal Democrats’ Layla Moran in the House of Commons, Helena Morrissey and Helena Kennedy in the Lords, the former TUC boss Frances O’Grady in the unions and Joeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, on the campaign front. She kept going.“It’s funny because everyone goes: ‘Oh you’re so brave for breaking your NDA’ – none of that was brave,” she says. “I tell you what’s brave: every single campaigner getting up every morning when you’re on your own and continuing to fight the system with no remuneration, no encouragement, and nobody really there to hold your hand. That’s brave.”But there is a reason she, and others, fight on. “Being able to make change is the biggest, most fulfilling thing any of us can do. We’re all looking to be part of a bigger thing,” she says. “I’m very lucky to have been able to turn something so negative into a positive, because 90% of women who’ve been in these situations don’t get to do that and that’s really why this win is much more for them than me.”Perkins with Harvey Weinstein at Cannes film festival, 1998.Photograph: Alan Davidson/REX/ShutterstockStill, the fight – and the exposure – took its toll. At the start of the year a series of false dawns had left her disheartened and demoralised. The support of Haigh and a group of high-profile baronesses in the Lords changed the dynamic, but when she got a call from government aides about the amendments on Friday, before a meeting with the business minister Justin Madders on Monday, she expected the worst. “I was like: ‘Oh God, here we go. They want to break it to me softly to make sure that I don’t cry in the meeting.’”The news, they assured her, was definitely positive. On Monday she travelled to Westminster and found herself back in a room of power, but this time she was part of it. “Without sounding woo woo, that has been the healing part,” she says. “As corny as it sounds, this has made me acknowledge the privilege of living in a democracy. It’s tough, and yes, the buttons are sticky and the levers are rusty, but they do actually work.”So what is next for the woman – part of a vanishingly rare breed – who took on power across multiple fronts and actually won? She will, she promises, continue to buzz around the government like a committed gnat, determined to see this through. Then, maybe, a rest. “Since the story broke in 2017 it’s been a maelstrom,” she says. “Like I was attached to a surfboard but sort of under the water most of the time. I’m now on the surfboard, but really knackered – and I’d just like to get off and go and lie on the beach.”Explore more on these topicsHarvey WeinsteinSexual harassmentEmployment lawinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s charming presenters or experts who entertain as they educate, we decided it was high time to salute the people who make our every day viewing a pleasure. Consider it a “soft power list” of TV’s most affable talents.The likes of Mel and Sue, Chris Packham, Clare Balding, Guy Martin, Kaleb Cooper, Roman Kemp, David Olusoga, Joe Lycett, AJ Odudu, Tom Allen and Stephen Mangan narrowly missed the cut. But they’re all just an adorable viral moment away from breaking into the agreeable elite.Here’s our selection of the people who cheer us up whenever they come on-screen. We’d love to hear yours, too.Claudia WinklemanView image in fullscreen‘Effortlessly witty’ … Claudia Winkleman.Photograph: Cody Burridge/PAThe fringe. The teak tan. The penchant for goth garb and daft gags. You know you’re in safe hands when La Winkle is fronting something. Engaging, welcoming and effortlessly witty, she is the perfect mix of slickness and spontaneity. Happily, Winkleman also has impeccable taste in projects. The Traitors, The Piano, and Strictly Come Dancing are all killer, no filler. Probably the best presenter on primetime TV.Bob MortimerMirth-maker … Bob MortimerThe Middlesbrough mirth-maker’s ascent to national treasure status has been joyous to behold. Emerging from the shadow of double act partner Vic Reeves, genial Mortimer’s mischievous energy and funny bones have made him a bona fide hero. His heart condition prompted riverbank larks withPaul Whitehouseon Gone Fishing. His turns on Would I Lie To You? leave viewers breathless. He recently romped to victory on Last One Laughing UK, where even the professionally deadpan Richard Ayoade was powerless to resist. Whatcha gonna do? And away …Stacey SolomonView image in fullscreenQueen of the Jungle … Stacey Solomon.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianWho’d have predicted that The X Factor finalist with Roland Rat’s voice would be an award-winning broadcaster 15 years later? She is routinely underestimated by snobs but our Stace is steely and smart. She charmed the nation on I’m A Celebrity and was crowned Queen of the Jungle. Like a relatable Marie Kondo, Solomon is full of can-do compassion on decluttering series Sort Your Life Out. Even professionally hapless husband Joe Swash is made bearable by her winning presence on the couple’s chaotic reality show.Monty Don‘The don of gardens’ … Monty DonThere’s nobody you’d rather tend your herbaceous borders. “Donty Mon”, as Alan Partridge drunkenly called him, is the undisputed, well, don of TV horticulturalists. All muddy fingernails and crinkly smile, he eloquently conveys his wholesome passion for all things earthy. Don’t even get me started on his loving relationships with dogs. I’ll start over-watering from my eyes.Dermot O’LearyView image in fullscreen‘Infectious enthusiasm’ … Dermot O’Leary.Photograph: ITV/REX/ShutterstockA firm favourite since he eased our hangovers on cult teen strand T4 and managed to make Big Brother’s Little Brother a must-see. O’Leary’s biggest primetime gig was hosting The X Factor in its imperial phase. He now helms weekly editions of This Morning alongside La Hammond, plus Reel Stories, Soccer Aid, andSilence is Golden. Nimble-witted with infectious enthusiasm, he always radiates good vibes. Deserves a bigger gig if you ask us.Rylan Clark‘I’m a celebrity’ … Rylan ClarkAnother X Factor alumnus with a surprise second chapter. After going viral for his tear-sodden meltdown when put through to the live shows (“I can’t breathe! Promise this ain’t a wind-up?”), the resilient Rylan bounced back by winning Celebrity Big Brother. He has since become an in-demand host on Eurovision and This Morning. Far cleverer than he is given credit for, he’s a Celebrity Gogglebox scene-stealer alongside Mummy Linda, while last year’s BBC travelogue with Rob “Judge” Rinder was an unexpected treat. As a superfan steeped in TV lore – see his unalloyed glee at his recent Doctor Who cameo – Rylan hits all the right beats with warmth and subversive wit.Alison HammondView image in fullscreen‘Fresh energy’ … Alison Hammond.Photograph: BBC StudiosProud owner of the most infectious laugh on TV, Hammond is always a sheer delight to watch, bab. She has brought a fresh energy to The Great British Bake Off, while her playful Friday stints co-hosting This Morning with Dermot O’Leary have become the flagging daytime fixture’s weekly highlight. Hammond is one of the few people who could have conceivably taken over For the Love of Dogs from the much-missed Paul O’Grady. Last month, she finally got her own interview series, Alison Hammond’s Big Weekend. Writer Jack Rooke even named the protagonist’s goldfish after her in Big Boys.Danny Dyer‘The land lord’ … Danny DyerCan you pinpoint the moment when Sir Danforth of Dyer went from laddish joke to national gem? Calling David Cameron a “twat” on live TV? Discovering his royal ancestry on Who Do You Think You Are? Providing the heart, soul and moustache of Jilly Cooper’s Rivals? Turning the airwaves blue during his grilling by a neurodivergent panel on The Assembly? Either way, from Queen Vic landlord to masculinity guru, Dyer is a total ledge.Martin LewisView image in fullscreen‘People’s champion’ … Martin Lewis.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/ShutterstockIt takes a lot for a financial journalist to win the public’s affections but the money-saving expert has managed it. After well-received slots on Good Morning Britain and This Morning, the tireless campaigner landed his own primetime series, TheMartin LewisMoney Show. The people’s champion when it comes to banking, energy bills and other everyday rip-offs, Lewis is precise, practical and increasingly influential over government economic policy. An all-round good egg.Davina McCallView image in fullscreen‘Canny big sister’ … Davina McCall.Photograph: ITV/Harry Page/ShutterstockAmong the most universally adored faces on our screens, Davina is like the viewing nation’s cool, canny big sister. She became synonymous with Big Brother during its Noughties pomp. McCall now plies her trade mainly on ITV as an empathetic presenter of Long Lost Family, a midlife matchmaker on My Dad, Your Mum and an excitable judge on The Masked Singer. Her menopause documentaries and heath battles have only made her more beloved.Ian Wright‘Passionate pundit’ … Ian WrightIan Wright-Wright-Wright was a Marmite figure on the pitch but since swapping playing for punditry, he’s become universally adored. This process accelerated when he was tearfully reunited on-screen with Mr Pigden, the teacher Wright called “the first positive male figure in my life”. Wrighty brings a fan’s passion and a frisson of spontaneity which livens up the dullest of matches. He gets the nod over fellow sporty types such as Micah Richards, Emma Hayes, Ally McCoist, Kelly Cates, Annabel Croft, Michael Johnson, Steve Cram, Freddie Flintoff and David “Bumble” Lloyd to make our list.Prof Hannah FryView image in fullscreenMaths isn’t boring … Prof Hannah Fry.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianNo TV academic wears their knowledge more lightly than the Cambridge mathematician. Determined to explode the stereotype that maths is boring, Fry frames it in populist ways that laypeople can understand – and she does so with an impish grin. Regular appearances on Radio 4, 6 Music and BBC Four led to her own BBC Two series, The Secret Genius of Modern Life. Fry made a moving, maths-heavy documentary about her recovery from cervical cancer and was resident number-cruncher on Channel 4’s election coverage. Carol Vorderman for millennials, anyone?Ant and Dec‘Masters at work’ … Ant and DecHaving won best presenters at the viewer-voted NationalTelevisionAwards for an astonishing 23 years running, it’s safe to say that Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly are the best at what they do. Standing in patented left-right formation, the cheeky geordie chipmunks steer many of our top-rated terrestrial entertainment franchises – I’m A Celebrity, Britain’s Got Talent, Saturday Night Takeaway – with a glint in their eyes. The duo’s chemistry and comic timing has been honed since their boyhood roles on Byker Grove. Watch the way they link the clips in the Aussie jungle this autumn and appreciate master craftsmen at work. Howay the lads.Keith Brymer JonesView image in fullscreen‘Hugely heartwarming’ … Keith Brymer Jones.Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Love ProductionsWhat’s not to love about a great big cuddly bear of a man being moved to happy tears over a nice piece of crockery? The undisputed star of The Great Pottery Throwdown is ceramicist and expert judge Brymer Jones. His punk past can be seen in his sharp dress sense and penchant for anti-establishment designs. Keith’s tendency to become emotional over clay is hugely heartwarming. It has become a badge of honour among the amateur potters to make him blub. Stop it, you’ll set me off too.Big Zuu‘Hype man’ … Big ZuuLast week’s Glastonbury coverage became even more exciting when viewers spotted Zuhair “Big Zuu” Hassan acting as hype man to his cousin, homegrown rapper AJ Tracey, on the Woodsies stage. The TV chef and grime MC from west London via Sierra Leone has won loyal fans for his rambunctious foodie travelogues. Big Zuu’s Big Eats won two Baftas, at which he was endearingly surprised. When he scored the winning goal for the World XI at Soccer Aid last month, his face was a picture.Richard OsmanView image in fullscreen‘Cult hero’ … Richard Osman.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianThe prolific TV producer didn’t step in front of the camera until 2009 but quickly became a cult hero. An owlishly wise, gently witty presence on quiz shows Pointless and House of Games, he is always excellent value on panel shows. Osman’s mega-selling Thursday Murder Club novels (the starry Netflix adaptation drops next month) and his pleasingly gossipy podcast with our ownMarina Hyde, The Rest Is Entertainment, have only made him more admired.Jane McDonald‘Your camp auntie’ … Jan McDonaldNobody can carry a Channel 5 cruising series or lux travelogue like the Wakefield Whitney. All glitter, gags and good time glamour, she’s like your camp auntie. The leather-lunged singer’s appearances on Celebrity Gogglebox, alongside her makeup artist and best pal Sue, have only boosted her appeal. The unpretentious duo guzzle goblets of rosé and cackle away like the ultimate huns.

In Around the World in 80 Days, Pole to Pole, and Full Circle, he journeyed at ground level, engaging with the culture and winning the hearts of locals, just as he did viewers. The unfailingly polite, eternally apologetic Palin is like the nation’s much-loved uncle.

Will its takings – and its Oscar hopes – now fall off a cliff?Andrew PulverThe film adaptation of Winn’s book, starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs, quickly became the third most successful UK movie of the year. What happens now?Tue 8 Jul 2025 12.20 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 12.30 EDTShareOn paper it has everything. A redemption-arc narrative about overcoming homelessness, adversity and illness. Two late-middle age lead characters that would appeal to the key silver-pound cinema-going demographic, as well as providing plum roles for top-notch British actors. A backdrop of glorious south coast scenery, as experienced through that most modish of contemporary activities: hiking.No wonderfilm-makerswere champing at the bit to make a movie out of The Salt Path, the memoir byRaynor Winn published in 2018– and so one duly emerged, starring Gillian Anderson as Winn and Jason Isaacs as her husband Moth, who was diagnosed with the incurable condition corticobasal degeneration (CBD). It was released in the UK in May, and was a verifiable hit,taking home £7.6mfrom the UK box office and becoming the third most successful British film of 2025 so far, behind Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy and We Live in Time.Walk on the wild side: Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs on their epic hiking movie The Salt PathRead moreBut all this looks imperilled bythe sensational report in the Observer on Sundaythat alleged that Winn took tens of thousands from a former employer, and lied about the circumstances under which the couple’s house was repossessed in the memoir. The report also alleged that Winn – whose real name is allegedly Sally Walker – and her husband had owned a house in France since 2007. A professor of clinical neuroscienc﻿es also questioned the validity of Moth Winn’s CBD diagnosis. Winn said the Observer’s report was “highly misleading” and that she was “taking legal advice and won’t be making any further comment at this time”.A spokesperson for the film’s producers, Shadowplay and Number 9, said: “The film is a faithful adaptation of the book that we optioned …There were no known claims against the book at the time of optioning it or producing and distributing the film and we undertook all necessary due diligence before acquiring the book.”It is not an unprecedented situation for film-makers to have doubt cast on the authenticity of books that they have adapted. The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things was released in 2001, and made into a film in 2004, before its author, the reclusive JT Leroy, was revealed to in fact be Laura Albert. A Mark Romanek-directed film version of James Frey’s A Million Little Pieceswas scrapped in 2006after Frey was revealed to haveincluded fictional elementsin his “memoir”; however,a film did emerge in 2019, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, that embraced the book’s questionable nature.Unhappily for The Salt Path movie, the controversy has arisen at a delicate, financially vulnerable point. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto film festival and has largely completed its theatrical run in the UK, as well as playing in cinemas in the Netherlands, Australia and South Africa. Unlike a studio film, independent productions have to sell themselves piece by piece across the world; crucially the film has not yet secured a North American cinema release. Less than a month ago,its sales agents appeared confidentof striking a deal on the back of its healthy British box office returns; now it could well be seen as damaged goods.View image in fullscreenGillian Anderson at a screening of the film in Germany, 1 July.Photograph: Gisela Schober/Getty ImagesNotwithstanding its successful theatrical run, the producers will have been hoping for a “long tail” of cinema screenings, which now looks questionable; a cinema manager I spoke to said while they’d honour previously made bookings in such a situation, the film is attracting considerable abuse on social media and may now be “tainted”. Even more concerning is the reality that a considerable proportion of a film’s revenue will come from home entertainment formats via streaming platforms, digital rental and download, DVD and TV and the like. The Salt Path has yet to be released on any of these formats and common sense dictates that the take-up will inevitably be diminished, meaning another significant financial hit. A projected awards campaign, for which Anderson and Isaacs would have been shoo-ins for Bafta nominations, if not Oscars, may well have gone up in smoke also.Depending on the details of the rights agreement, the producers may be able to make a compensation claim at some future point against Winn, depending on how the controversy is resolved.Perhaps more intangible is the reputational cost to the film-makers. Shadowplay Features is an outfit based around heavyweight producer Lloyd Levin, who in the past has produced United 93, Watchmen, Da 5 Bloods and The Mauritanian; Number 9 is the company of high profile British producers Stephen Woolley and Elizabeth Karlsen, whose previous credits include Carol, Living, Colette and On Chesil Beach. Embarrassing as this furore may be, both sets of producers have built up illustrious reputations in the industry and once the dust has settled it is hard to see either sustaining any significant damage.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm adaptationsanalysisShareReuse this content"

From weddings to funerals, job interviews to formal events – like it or not, sometimes it’s the only appropriate thing to wear.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s one snag, though: a suit is a big-ticket item. It’s not uncommon to spend a few hundred pounds on your chosen two-piece, and if you’re after Savile Row-standard tailoring, that number can tip into thousands. But if you know where to look, a good-quality suit doesn’t need to cost a fortune. Choose something timeless and you’ll have it for years.I still wear a few suits I’ve held on to for almost a decade. The ones that ended up at the charity shop, meanwhile, typically strayed from the timeless rule, with a skinny leg, bold colours or an ill-fitting silhouette.Suits never really go out of style, but they’re having a moment in fashion right now. Tailoring was prominent at the spring/summer 2025 menswear shows – look at Fendi, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Dior for reference. And suits are enjoying a resurgence outside fashion week, too. Menswear influencers (namely@chico_lachowski,@reubenlarkinand@josefmiichael) are sporting suits beyond formal events, and their accounts provide some good styling inspiration – even if you choose to wear the trousers and blazers separately.Read on for my pick of the best suits around at the moment, and scroll below for a guide to how to pick the right suit for you.The best men’s suits under £400Best double-breasted navy suitView image in fullscreenHawes & Curtis navydouble-breastedsuit£349 at Hawes & CurtisThe heritage British suit maker, founded in 1913, has four royal warrants under its belt. Today, it’s still an expert in tailoring, from a wide range of shirts to silk accessories, as well as a good selection of suits themselves. This double-breasted navy design is an example of what the brand does best: a classic yet strong silhouette made with premium textiles for a suit that looks and feels expensive.Best black tie tuxedoView image in fullscreenMossblack double-breasted tuxedo£279 at MossThe British high-street store Moss Bros rebranded as Moss a couple of years ago – ever since, its menswear collections have gone from strength to strength. The suits now feel modern yet wearable, and more luxurious than most other budget-friendly options. My favourite is this tuxedo (which has some key differences from a plain black suit, namely the contrast satin lapels, satin-covered buttons and satin taping on the trouser seams). It’s made using a wool-polyester blend that’s crease- and stain-resistant and water-repellent. An added touch of elastane gives it a comfy stretch finish.Best cream linen suitView image in fullscreenMangoAmalfilinensuitBlazer£149.99 at MangoTrousers£79.99 at MangoAt smart summer events, it’s always the guys wearing cream linen who stand out – think Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. Aesthetics aside, pure linen is great for a few reasons. It’s naturally breathable and antibacterial, so it’ll keep you cool even when it’s hot. It’s also not a problem if it’s a little creased. This Amalfi suit from Mango is a great option.Best dark brown suitView image in fullscreenH&Mbrown suitBlazer£64.99 at H&MTrousers£37.99 at H&MNo one can argue with the fact that dark brown looks luxurious. If you don’t believe me,the Row’s autumn/winter 2025 collectionshould be enough to convince you. While a suit by the Olsen twins’ hyped-up brand would cost upwards of £3,000, you can get a similar colour for much less if you shop around. Case in point: this suit by H&M. For just over £100, this looks stylish, fits nicely, and gives people the impression you justgetmenswear.Best classic black suitView image in fullscreenKin blacklinen-blend suitBlazer£91 at John LewisTrousers£48 at John LewisKin is John Lewis’s in-house label, and its menswear collections feel more fashiony than the department store’s main line, thanks to its modern silhouettes and fashion-forward fabrics. Although it’s described as a slim fit, this suit is a little looser than a classic slim cut, making it feel more appropriate for 2025. The linen-viscose blend gives a louche, flowy finish that can be dressed up or down.Best relaxed suitView image in fullscreenSelectedwooldouble-breastedsuitBlazer£69 at John Lewis£161 at SelectedTrousers£94.50 at SelectedSelected is a strong choice for affordable menswear. The online-only brand’s collections feel both fashion-forward and premium, especially considering the price bracket. If you’re into a roomy fit, this is just the suit for you. It has strong peak lapels, a slouchy shoulder and a double-breasted fit, and is constructed using a timeless neutral wool.Best casual suitView image in fullscreenPercival tailored seersuckersuitBlazer£143.40 at PercivalTrousers£83.40 at PercivalPercival is known for menswear classics with a twist. This suit, for example, has patch pockets instead of flaps. It’s cut to a cool, laid-back fit. And rather than using a common woven twill or linen, it’s made from an interesting seersucker that adds another layer of texture.Best neutral suitView image in fullscreenAsos stonemarlslimsuit£120 at AsosYou can always find a good suit by Asos Design. You may have to scroll past a few stretch-skinny or brightly coloured options, but you can always find something that feels far more expensive than its RRP. This season, this stone double-breasted suit tops the list thanks to its modern fit, tonal tortoiseshell buttons and subtly textured marl fabric.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s best to avoid anything too light and lean towards darker shades, such as charcoal and slate. It’s a colour that can easily look corporate, so avoid that by looking for more relaxed details such as a loose fit or patch pockets. This wool design by Scandi high-street hero Arket nails the brief.Best lightweight black suitView image in fullscreenJaeger tailored linen-wool blend suit£370 at M&SYou can count on Marks & Spencer for a classic suit at a great price. This time, it’s a black double-breasted number by the retailer’s high-end line, Jaeger. A black suit may not scream summer, but monochrome fans will be pleased to hear this one’s made from a lightweight linen-wool-silk blend to give you a good chance of staying cool in the heat, even in the worst colour for it.Best pinstripe suitView image in fullscreenAsos Designoversizedsuit£100 at AsosPinstripes are best when they’re subtle – you want them to be your outfit’s supporting character rather than the lead. The barely there stripes on this Asos suit are exactly what you’re looking for. This suit will help you lean into the “corpcore” aesthetic without looking like you’re cosplaying an advertising director in the 60s. Double down by wearing it with a striped shirt beneath.Best holiday suitView image in fullscreenWax London rust linen suitBlazer£210 at Wax LondonTrousers£130 at Wax LondonWhether you’ve got a destination wedding (sincerest apologies to your bank account) or want a nice dinner ’fit for a holiday, Wax London’s rust suit could be the answer. It’s made from linen, the best fabric for the heat, and is designed with a roomy fit to give a laid-back look without feeling too casual. You could dress it down with a vest or up with a linen shirt – and if this orange shade isn’t for you, there are five others to choose from.Best single-breasted navy suitView image in fullscreenCharles Tyrwhitt navy twill suit£329 at Charles TyrwhittA single-breasted navy suit is the classic white T-shirt of the tailoring world. Wear it to any formal engagement, regardless of the time of year or tone of the event, and it will always look good. That’s why it’s good to invest in quality.Charles Tyrwhitt suits focus on luxe fabrics and good craftsmanship. This is a classic tailored fit made with a natural stretch twill. If youreallywant to treat yourself, check out thebrand’s collab with premium Italian fabrics company Reda, which takes things up another notch.Best hounds tooth suitView image in fullscreenZara hounds tooth linen-blend suitBlazer£49.99 at ZaraTrousers£19.99 at ZaraA hounds tooth has a lot to offer. The micropattern adds depth to give a finish more interesting than a plain weave. This suit comes in a versatile shade of green that sits somewhere between moss and sage.How to pick the right suit for youView image in fullscreenThere are two key words to keep in mind when you’re on the hunt for a suit: fit and fabric. You’ll want the suit to be cut and constructed well, with an appropriate textile – linen for summer, wool for winter, or cotton or polyester if you’re after an all-rounder.At the moment, double-breasted silhouettes a la Remington Steele(a young Pierce Brosnan smarming his way through a comedy-detective show in top-notch tailoring) are top on the fashion agenda, although a single-breasted style is more understated. The cuffs should always show a touch of your shirt and, as a general rule, the jacket’s length should stop around the middle of your palm when your arms are hanging by your sides (an easy test is to see if you can grab the jacket hem with your hand).Trousers should generally have a straight leg with a slight break on the shoe – by which I mean the hem should sit lightly on the shoe, rather than hang above it.For longevity, it’s best to stick to a classic colour. Every man should have a black suit to hand: it works for most formal events and it’s essential for most funerals. After that, you’ve got some options. There’s my personal favourite, navy, as well as dark brown, cream and the occasional breakout colour. You don’t need the entire selection, but it’s good to have a choice of a couple of shades so you can choose the best for the engagement at hand – something brighter for summer weddings and something navy for dressing up in the city, for instance.Checks, pinstripes and hounds tooth patterns are all a nice addition, but only as a supporting detail to add depth. That means you should avoid XL checks, bold stripes and loud colour combinations, and instead go for a subtle and understated finish such as a mini hounds tooth or tonal pinstripe.What are the best brands for men’s suits?When you’re buying off the rack, there are a few names to know. M&S, Zara and Mango are your best bet for affordable options, usually coming below £150. Reiss, Moss and Hawes & Curtis are all tailoring specialists and come with the price to match – costing upwards of £350 – while Percival and Arket are usually top of the list for more casual designs.It’s hard to find any you’d considercheap, but we’ve made sure every option in this list comes in at less than £400, so you don’t need to remortgage your house to look sharp at your next formal function.What should I wear with my suit?Though the two-piece is obviously important, it’s the accessories that make or break the outfit. A subpar tie or pair of shoes can make an acceptable suit look far less sophisticated.Some tried and tested advice on ties: in my experience, secondhand silk ones have always garnered the most compliments – and they’re often much cheaper than brand new. Try a charity shop or thrift store and more often than not you’ll find one that works. Or take a look atRokit, which usually has a good selection.If you’re wearing a pocket square too, it’s best for it to complement your tie without being too matchy-matchy. And as for shoes, it depends on the occasion. If it’s more casual, a pair of loafers or derbies will do, or potentially even smart trainers. A formal dress code usually calls for oxfords.Peter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist covering menswear, womenswear and beautyExplore more on these topicsMen's suitsThe FilterMen's trousersMen's coats and jacketsMenMen's fashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Would I like to? No … But I would ask that the report be judged not on what I am undoing, but on what I am trying to protect.”He said in the report that there was “a real risk of total system collapse in the near future”, with victims and witnesses disengaging because they were waiting years for their case to be heard or forgetting details by the time a case came around.“Little or no consequences for lawlessness could lead to a breakdown in law and order and society taking things into their own hands,” he wrote.Leveson said the many financial hits suffered by the Ministry of Justice as an unprotected government department had “come home to roost”.Responding to the report, lawyers said restricting jury trials was not the solution to the crown court backlog, which stands at 77,000 cases.Barbara Mills KC, chair of the Bar Council, said:“Changing the fundamental structure of delivering criminal justice is not a principled response to a crisis which was not caused by that structure in the first place. As Sir Brian recognises, it is the failure to invest properly in the justice system over decades that has led to the crisis we see in the criminal courts today.“Juries represent society and are a fundamental part of our system. And on a practical level, it remains unclear how the current resources in the system – magistrates, judges, court staff and courtroom capacity – will be able to meet the demands of the proposed new crown court bench division.”Richard Atkinson, the president of the Law Society, said: “The proposed new division of the crown court on its own will not solve the crown court backlog. The government would have undermined our historic jury system for no effect.“Only investment in the whole system has any chance of success – from when a criminal prosecution starts in the police station, and at all stages before a crown court case.”However, the Magistrates’ Association welcomed the idea of a new crown court division, while stressing that the number of magistrates would need to rise by about a third.Asked about fears that reducing rights to jury trialswould disadvantage people of colour and other minorities, Leveson denied that it would lead to more miscarriages of justice.He said that he was seeking to tackle the risk of disproportionate outcomes by including two magistrates sitting alongside a judge in the crown court bench division and calling for an increase in magistrates from under-represented communities. He also said that – while he was aware ofalleged racial bias among judges– he had not witnessed it during his 35-year career on the bench.Other recommendations in the report included increased use of out-of-court resolutions, greater use of rehabilitation programmes and health intervention programmes and increasing the maximum reduction for entering a guilty plea at the first opportunity from 33% to 40%.Cutting the courts backlog is seen as vital to delivering the government’stackling violence against women and girls and safer streets strategies.The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said she would consider the recommendations and respond before legislating in the autumn.“Swifter justice requires bold reform, and that is what I asked Sir Brian Leveson to propose,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCrimeUK criminal justiceBrian LevesonPrisons and probationnewsShareReuse this content"

A further 19 people began abusing alcohol, with some saying they could not sleep at night without drinking first.Of the 59 who had thoughts about killing themselves, 10 went on to attempt suicide, some on more than one occasion. Contemplating suicide “was a common experience across both those who were and were not prosecuted”, the report said.View image in fullscreenSir Wyn Williams said the picture of the scandal that had emerged was ‘profoundly disturbing’.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesOne post office operator said: “The impact on me of the treatment the Post Office subjected me to has been immeasurable.

I attempted suicide on several occasions and was admitted to a mental health institution twice.”About 1,000 post office operators were prosecuted and convicted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015, the report said, because of faulty Horizon accounting software that suggested they had committed fraud. A further 50 to 60 people, possibly more, were prosecuted but not convicted. The total wrongly held responsible for losses was in the thousands, with many making up the shortfall out of their pocket without ever being charged.Government did not want to ‘harass’ Post Office victims by chasing up claimsRead morePost Office bosses either knew, or should have known, that the IT system was faulty, the report said, but they “maintained the fiction that its data was always accurate” when prosecuting branch owner-operators.Williams said he had received more than 200 witness statements from victims and almost all “had suffered very significantly and many had endured a degree of hardship which was very severe by any standards”.Some became seriously ill, struggled with mental health problems, suffered financial hardship, lost their homes or went bankrupt.Even those who were acquitted often found themselves “ostracised” in their communities, and many died before receiving compensation – reports have put the figure at about 350. Some family members also suffered psychiatric and other illnesses and “very significant financial losses”.The report revealed about 10,000 people were claiming compensation through four schemes, two of which were merged in early June, and that number was likely to rise “at least by hundreds, if not more” over the coming months. There were more than 3,000 claims still to resolve, half of which were in the initial stages, Williams said.View image in fullscreenThe Post Office Horizon IT inquiry chair said there were more than 3,000 claims still to resolve.Photograph: Guardian VideoIn the report, he said: “On too many occasions, the Post Office and its advisers have adopted an unnecessarily adversarial attitude towards making initial offers, which have had the effect of depressing the level at which settlements have been achieved.”Williams called for urgent action to deliver “full and fair” compensation, asking the government and the Post Office to agree on a definition of the term to follow when deciding how much to offer.Williams said victims should receive free legal advice, funded by the government, to help them decide whether they should opt for the fixed-sum offer or assessment of their claims, and close family members of affected post office operators should also be compensated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also called for the creation of a standing public body that could administer and deliver “financial redress to persons who have been wronged by public bodies”.In response to the findings, the chair of the Post Office, Nigel Railton, madea “clear and unequivocal apology to every single person affected by this scandal” on behalf of the company and admitted “as an organisation we let them down”. He vowed to do “everything in my power” to make sure that affected branch operators received the redress they were entitled to, as soon as possible.The report, which follows 225 days of inquiry hearings with 298 witnesses, did not detail the total compensation paid out so far. According to the government,more than £1bn had been paid outto more than 7,300 post office operators by 9 June.No date has yet been set for the publication of volume two of Williams’s findings, which will cover the technical issues with the Horizon IT system, the Post Office’s handling of the reported discrepancies, legal proceedings against post office operators, institutional culture and government oversight. It could come as late as next year.Williams’s report contained 17 case illustrations, including that of Millie Castleton, who was eight when the Post Office alleged that her father, Lee Castleton, was liable for shortfalls at his branch and his contract was terminated. He was later ordered to pay the Post Office £25,858.95 plus interest and their legal costs, a total sum of £309,807.94.Millie recounted that she became the target of bullying at school, where she was asked: “Didn’t your dad steal loads of money or something?” At 17, she was suffering from depression and was diagnosed with anorexia, and was forced by illness to “take a year out” at university. At one point she was admitted to hospital with heart-related problems.“That nagging voice in my head … still tells me that my past and my family’s struggle will define me,” Millie said. “I’m 26 and … I’m still fighting, as are many hundreds involved in the Post Office trial.”The scandal was exposed after years of campaigning and media investigations but was brought to the attention of many people by the ITV dramatisationMr Bates vs the Post Office.Days after the series aired in January last year, the government announced plans to legislateto exonerate those who had been wrongly prosecuted, and the bill was passed in June.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said in her debut budget last October that the government had set aside£1.8bn to cover all compensation claims. The government is the sole shareholder of the Post Office and is therefore responsible for paying out. Compensation payments have so far ranged from £10,000 to more than £1m.The postal minister, Gareth Thomas, said: “Sir Wyn’s … recommendations are immensely helpful as a guide for what is needed to finish the job, and we will respond in full to parliament after carefully considering them.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

They include allegations, denied by Wallace, of groping one co-worker and having pulled his trousers down in front of a second.The new allegations come just days before the publication of a report on separate claims made last year. It led toMasterChefproduction company Banijay commissioning a report on Wallace, overseen by the law firm Lewis Silkin.The new claims were made as Wallace admitted using inappropriate language but claimed to have been cleared of “the most serious and sensational accusations made against me”.In a statement on social media, the former BBC presenter said he had now been diagnosed with autism. He said while his neurodiversity was discussed across “countless seasons of MasterChef”, he was given no protection.Wallace repeatedly attacked the BBC in a furious Instagram post.“I will not go quietly,” Wallace wrote. “I will not be cancelled for convenience. I was tried by media and hung out to dry well before the facts were established. The full story of this incredible injustice must be told and it is very much a matter of public interest.”BBC News previously said it had heard allegations of inappropriate sexual comments and inappropriate behaviour by 13 people who had worked with Wallace across a 17-year period.The presenter first stepped away from his role on MasterChef nine months ago, after the BBC received complaints about his conduct. Among his accusers is the presenter Kirsty Wark, who was a Celebrity MasterChef contestant in 2011. She has alleged Wallace told “sexualised” jokes during filming.In his new five-page statement, Wallace said he had opted to speak out before the Silkin report – a “decision I do not take lightly”.“But after 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others,” he said. “The Silkin report exonerates me of all the serious allegations which made headlines last year and finds me primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018.“I recognise that some of my humour and language, at times, was inappropriate. For that, I apologise without reservation. But I was never the caricature now being sold for clicks.”He claimed he had been driven to “go public” because BBC News was “intending to platform legally unsafe accusations”. He accused the broadcaster of “no longer providing balanced and impartial public service journalism”.Wallace accused MasterChef’s makers of turning on him, despite his personality once being regarded as a crucial part of the show. He said they had also failed to protect him, despite his likely neurodiversity.“I was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all,” he said. “For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.“My neurodiversity, now formally diagnosed as autism, was suspected and discussed by colleagues across countless seasons of MasterChef.“Yet nothing was done to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over 20 years. That failure is now being quietly buried.”The BBC reported that the majority of new allegations were about claimed inappropriate comments. However, it said 11 women accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour such as groping and touching. Wallace has denied the allegations.Among the new allegations were claims that Wallace took his trousers down in front of a woman in a dressing room, which she described as “disgusting and predatory”. She worked on MasterChef between 2011 and 2013. At the time, it was produced by Shine, a company now owned by Banijay.She claimed to have reported what had happened, but said she was told by staff who were more senior: “You’re over 16. You’re not being ‘Jimmy Saviled’.”A participant on Saturday Kitchen claimed that during a 2002 dinner before filming, Wallace put his hand on her groin, saying: “Do you like that?” The BBC also reported that a 19-year-old MasterChef worker had tried to complain in 2022 about Wallace’s comments about her body.A BBC spokesperson said: “Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.”Banijay is not commenting on the report until it is officially published.The BBC has already accepted a series of recommendations from an independent culture review, designed to tackle unacceptable behaviour by powerful figures.Explore more on these topicsGregg WallaceBBCMasterChefnewsShareReuse this content"

So far, 400 people had been evacuated, around a dozen houses destroyed and 63 others damaged, he said. He added about 100 people had also suffered light injuries, including from emergency services.“At the moment that I speak to you there are no deaths, which is remarkable given the extent of the fires,” he said on Tuesday evening as he visited firefighters in the region. “But there are all the reasons to think we are headed towards a summer of high risk.”Local media reported that the cause appeared to have been a vehicle that caught fire on the A552 motorway. The climate crisis is creating conditions that allow such fires to burn faster, more intensely and over larger areas.The fire has brought many of the city’s services to a halt. Marseille airport cancelled all flights, train services to and from the north and north-west of the city were suspended, two motorways, main roads and several road tunnels in the city were closed, and many bus services cancelled, authorities said.Departures to Brussels, Munich and Naples were cancelled, with incoming flights diverted to nearby airports, including Nice and Nimes. Marseille is France’s second largest regional airport, handling nearly 11 million passengers last year.Earlier, the regional prefect, Georges-François Leclerc told reporters that the blaze was not yet contained but the situation appeared to be “under control”.“The instructions are simple: have confidence in firefighters, let emergency services do their job, and stay indoors,” he said. “Firefighters are defending the city.”Fanned by winds reaching 100km/h, the fire filled downtown Marseille with acrid smoke and flying cinders. Videos from the central Old Port area showed large plumes of smoke billowing over the city. About 450 people were evacuated, Marseille city hall said.It urged residents closest to the blaze, especially in the northern 15th and 16th arrondissements, to “stay inside so as to avoid any exposure to smoke” from the fire. Four sports halls in the city were opened to accommodate any more evacuees.“You can feel it, you can see it and you can smell it,” Vanessa, a 16th arrondissement resident, told BFMTV. “It’s horrific. We’re all frightened. It’s a catastrophe, you can’t even put your nose outside the front door – in Marseille!”City hall said 720 firefighters, including dozens from neighbouring departments, were battling the blaze with 220 emergency vehicles, helped by helicopters and water-bombing planes. About 350 hectares of land had been consumed by late afternoon.Local authorities said 20 houses had been destroyed, including several within the city limits. Nine firefighters were being treated for smoke inhalation and four residents had been hospitalised in “relatively urgent” circumstances.map of the Marseille areaThe mayor of Marseille, Benoît Payan, congratulated the city’s firefighters “who have so far saved several hundred houses”. A major hospital to the north of the city had switched to emergency generators “as a precaution” but was safe, he added.“As we speak, it’s a battle,” Payan said, likening tackling the wildfire to “guerrilla warfare”.He added: “We’re waiting to see what happens overnight, because that’s critical too. Everything is strategic: wind speed, humidity, nightfall … It’s extremely complex.”The prefecture of the Provence-Alpes-Côtes d’Azur regionissued multiple mobile phone alertsurging inhabitants to also close their doors and shutters, hang wet laundry around openings, and keep all roads clear for emergency services.View image in fullscreenPolice try to extinguish a blazing car in the L’Estaque district of Marseille on Tuesday.Photograph: Clement Mahoudeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThree southern French departments, Bouches-du-Rhône, Var and Vaucluse, are on red fire alert.

And he called again for a youth mobility scheme, to widespread applause in the hall, including from Labour ministers.“We will have to de-risk our two countries from the excessive dependencies on both the US and China,” he said. “If we still depend on both China and the US, I think we have a clear view of our future and the future of our children.“On one side [China], other capacities and other subsidies are clear threats [to] fair trade, and they are destabilising a lot of value chain and creating new dependencies. On the other side [the US], the trade war is clearly an explicit decision not to be compliant any more with WTO and this commerce we loved until now.“If we want to build a sustainable future for all children [we have] to de-risk our economies and our societies from these dual dependencies.”Macron’s speech formed one of the centrepieces of his three-day visit to the UK – the first for a French president since Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008. The day was filled with pomp and ceremony, including a welcome by King Charles at Windsor Castle and a trip in a horse-drawn coach to inspect a military guard of honour.The president then travelled to parliament to speak to MPs, peers and other invitees in the Royal Gallery – a venue previously graced by the former US president Bill Clinton, the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the former German chancellor Angela Merkel.Macron spoke from a platform between two huge paintings, one depicting the Battle of Waterloo and the other the Battle of Trafalgar. The French president mentioned neither conflict but drew heavily on the Entente Cordiale – signed between the two countries in 1904 – in an attempt to show the political battles of the Brexit era were now over.“Since [1904], our states have had a broad, deep partnership, working together on European and global security,” he said.In a sign of that renewed cooperation, he announced theBayeux tapestry would return to the UKfor the first time in more than 900 years.The British government has been hoping to use the trip to show that its “EU reset” had borne fruit, including on the traditionally difficult subject of migration.British officials have been hoping to sign a new deal that would involve Britain accepting asylum seekers who have a genuine family connection with the UK in return for being able to send others back to France. However, they had warned in recent days that it might not be ready in time for this trip.The French president did not say anything specific about the deal, but spoke in glowing terms about a youth mobility scheme, which is being worked on by UK and EU officials after therecent European summit in London.“There is a risk that our societies are growing apart, that our young people do not know each other as well, and may end up strangers at a time when international current events remind us on a daily basis of our common future,” Macron said.“Let’s fix it. Let’s work together in order to facilitate the exchange of students, researchers, intellectuals, artists … let’s allow our children to have the same opportunities as the ones we had,” he added, to widespread and sustained applause.Macron spent much of his time focusing on the twin threats from the US and China, adding that the level of risk from each was not the same.“I do not put a sign equal between China and the US,” he said. “We have a strong ally on one side, and a challenger – sometimes a partner, when I speak about climate change – with China.”He said the risks to European countries came from trade, global supply chains, and particularly technology, and compared manipulative algorithms used by US technology firms to the kind of political misinformation deliberately sown by Russia, in comments that underscored the differing approaches to technology being taken by Britain and France.“What is at stake today in Europe is the defence of democratic models amid foreign interference, information manipulation, domination of minds by negative emotions and addictions to social media,” he said.But while France and the EU have pushed ahead with social media regulation, the UK has shied away from doing so, and has even offered toreduce the amount of tax paid by the biggest US technology companiesin return for tariff relief.At a state banquet held at a Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening – attended by the queen, the Prince and the Princess of Wales, the prime minister and senior members of the cabinet – King Charles spoke of the deepening cooperation between the UK and France which he said would protect against “profound challenges” such as terrorism, organised crime and “irregular migration” across the Channel.Addressing Macron, he said: “Monsieur le President, the summit that you and the prime minister will hold in London this week will deepen our alliance and broaden our partnership still further.“Our armed forces will cooperate even more closely across the world, including to support Ukraine, as we join together in leading a coalition of the willing in defence of liberty and freedom from oppression – in other words, in defence of our shared values.”There were lighter moments, with the king describing what he called the “perfect combinations” of French and British: Monet’s paintings of London fog and the French striker Thierry Henry scoring for Arsenal at Highbury.The French president even winked at the king when Charles mentioned the cultural ties between the UK and France and how a Frenchman, William the Conqueror, began building Windsor Castle more than 900 years ago.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

The Foreign Office were informed they were due to be taken to Tehran on around 8 June, raising fears they may have been caught in the Tehran attack, but on Tuesday they were informed they were still held in Kervan.Joe Bennett, 31, said: “Every day not knowing brought a deeper kind of dread. Every night, the same questions with no answers. You go to sleep, afraid. You wake up still afraid. And the silence – the not knowing – is just unbearable. So many of our fears remain. How are they doing? Are they being looked after? How are they coping psychologically?“Our belief is that Lindsay and Craig will be much safer when people know they’re there. Every piece of information we’ve received points to visibility as their greatest protection, when there are eyes on them, that’s when they’re safest. It took a lot of soul searching, but this isn’t about recklessness; it’s about responsibility. We’ve had to weigh risk and reward carefully, but we’re convinced that the best way to safeguard them is to ensure the British public cares and is paying attention. Silence puts them at greater risk. Awareness saves lives.”He added: “Our biggest message is that we want to work with the UK government on their release, but because there is no noise around my mum and Craig, when Keir Starmer is around the table with the Iranians they are not going to be mentioned. We cannot operate in darkness, and we have to bring their names into the sunlight.”So far British officials have visited the couple in detention three times, but UK diplomats are only now returning to Iran after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. Bennett said he understood his mother and Craig were both suffering from the food and sleeping conditions.He said “On the first visit Craig had lost a lot of weight and she was in OK spirits. The second visit was very chaotic and short. It lasted only nine minutes and it ended very abruptly. My mum was struggling with sleeping on a wafer-thin mattress. Craig was still thin, but he was mainly concerned about my mum.“The third visit was more positive; they had been allowed to be together and had access to the prison shop. They were in a room the equivalent of three by three. For any exercise they just did a figure of eight so they could run 5km like that. They get access to a yard for 15 minutes.“They had a metal bed with a mattress. The feeling last month was that this was moving towards sentencing or trial in that they had been appointed a lawyer, but he did not speak English so it was very very hard to communicate with him.“We have sent some personal messages to my mum via the Foreign Office. I relayed a message to her that I am looking at the moon at night and that if she looks at the moon as well, we will be sharing that experience and have a connection. It gives me hope and maybe it gives her some hope.”Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who spent six years in an Iranian jail and has advised the family, recalled: “The cell had tall walls and cold floor. There was no bed but only a thin blanket. I didn’t shower for days as I wasn’t allowed to leave the cell. The walls were towering and the constant light in the cell was blinding. I was terrified, lost and emotionally traumatised.”Bennett said of Lindsay and Craig: “They are not tied to any political party, or a government, they are not criminals and they are certainly not spies. They are just two human beings, normal, normal people. It is a mum and a dad, a son and a sister. They love travelling, they love people, they love connection.”Asked if they should have followed UK Foreign Office advice not to travel to Iran, he said: “They were two people in the wrong place at the wrong time, pawns in something geopolitical. History shows that theirs is not the first case and the only crime is that they are UK nationals.“It’s quite obvious it is hostage-taking for leverage on the UK government, and they do it to other countries, like France. We don’t know what the Iranians want. At the end of all of this, there is a deal to be done and it will be the Foreign Office that are the ones that make it. We are just here to make it happen as efficiently as possible.“It’s been tough; whatever you do in life cannot prepare you for this, there is such a sense of powerlessness, and elderly relatives to look after.“They are pretty strong-headed people. My mum is very much into positive psychology and Craig is very practical. They are together and they have that solace, but we don’t know. There may be panic and fear, and that is why it is so important we get their names out there so they know they have not been forgotten.”A spokesperson for the Iranian judiciary, Asghar Jahangir, said at the time of the arrest that the couple, married nine years and living recently in Spain, had “entered Iran under the guise of tourists” and “gathered information in multiple provinces of the country”.Explore more on these topicsIranForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However, aGuardian investigationpreviously found some online pharmacies either breaking these rules outright, or exploiting grey areas to peddle the medications to the public.Now theAdvertising Standards Authority(ASA) has released nine new rulings that, it says, will set clear precedents for advertisers.TheASA said the new rulings meant that while pharmacies could continue to mention weight loss injections on their websites, provided they were not shown on homepages or landing pages from other links, adverts were banned from using the phrases “weight loss injections” and “weight loss pen”, and the treatments must instead be marketed as part of a wider service, including a consultation and prescription.In addition, the ASA said that in the context of ads for weight loss treatments, ads could not feature images of medical injection pens, whether or not unbranded, images of a vial of liquid on the front, or contain links to landing pages where named POMs were promoted, or were the only available option.Experts say the ban on the advertising of POMs protects the public by preventing people from being exposed to undue commercial pressure, ensuring safe prescribing, and avoiding over-medicalisation of everyday concerns.“Part of our overall strategy is protecting vulnerable people from harm, and nothing’s so harmful as powerful prescription-only medicines,” saidNicky Morgan, chair of the ASA.The ASA had been investigating 13 advertisements relating to prescription-only weight loss medications, with the results from nine of these released today.They largely relate to ads flagged in a monitoring sweep during August and September 2024 by the ASA’s active ad monitoring system, an AI-based approach that proactively searches for online ads that may break the rules.The ASA said its AI monitoring resulted in it processing 28m ads across all sectors in 2024, with 94% of those that were amended or withdrawn coming from the AI system.The regulator said its AI system would continue to search for problem ads, helping the body identify repeat offenders. It has already identified more than 20,000 ads from 35 high priority pharmacies between February and June this year, 10,000 of which were for weight loss treatments.While 80 of these ads were found to directly use or mention a weight loss drug name, most used imagery of weight loss pens, or strongly implied the use of weight loss POMs without naming the drug.The ASA said while there were many more potentially problematic ads for weight loss treatments in the public domain, those chosen for the recent investigations were representative of the issues at play in advertising.Among the adverts to fall foul of the ASA in the latest rulings were those promoting “weight loss treatments” that directly linked to webpages where the only treatment options were POMs.“Previously, you know, it was a bit of a grey area, they could essentially get away with putting a lot of things on a landing page, which just wouldn’t be acceptable on a homepage. So I think that these rulings have plugged quite a significant gap there,” said Jess Tye, lead of the weight loss POM project at the ASA.The rulings also close the loophole by which pharmacies advertise a weight loss consultation – a permitted promotion – but link to landing pages for such services that only feature weight loss injections as possible treatments.“It has to be that there is a genuine option, or options, which a professional would be working through with their patient, as opposed to some sort of token consultation, where both sides know what they’re actually doing is ending up with a jab that is going to be mailed to them so that they can use,” Morgan said.Influencers have also been caught up in the new rulings: one upheld complaint was against an Instagram post by the TV personality Gemma Collins, who promoted the weight loss service Yazen.The ad was found to have promoted POMs because Collins referred to using a weight loss medication that is prescribed on the NHS, and because Yazen’s website also featured links to three newspaper articles, with thumbnails that described how Collins had lost weight using Yazen’s “GLP-1 weight loss injections”.Morgan said the new rulings would set precedents and offer guidance to pharmacies, with further rulings expected to clarify the landscape further.The boom in weight loss jabs, and their promise not only to help people shed pounds butalso to tackle a myriad other health conditions, has resulted in an explosion in online selling. The credibility of the drugs has been further enhanced by political approval.This week the health secretary, Wes Streeting, told LBC radio: “Weight loss jabs are the talk of the House of Commons; half my colleagues are on them and are judging the rest of us, saying: ‘You lot should be on them.’”But while Streeting plans to widen public access to the jabs, making them more broadly available on the NHS, many buy the medications through private prescriptions with online pharmacies, making their promotion a lucrative business.A key question remains whether the new rulings will correct much of the illegal selling, or whether advertisers will continue to break the rules – as some pharmacies have been doing.The ASA said pharmacies found to have breached advertising rules would be contacted and instructed to remove or edit their ad. Should a company fail to engage, the watchdog could take further action, such as working with platforms to have problem paid-ads taken down.The breaches can also be flagged to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), which have the power to apply sanctions such as fines and court proceedings, in the case of the MHRA, or take action against the pharmacy, the pharmacy owner, the superintendent pharmacist, or all three in the case of the GPhC.However, while Morgan said compliance had been good, the rulings show that some of the online pharmacies did not respond to the ASA when their adverts were challenged.Dr Piotr Ozieranski, from the University of Bath, welcomed the new rulings, but said regulators must adopt a more adversarial attitude towards advertisers found breaking the rules, including graduated financial penalties that could be linked to company turnover or the scale or severity of patient risk.“This would bring regulation more in line with the seriousness of the harms at stake – not just misleading advertising as such, but its possible consequences for patient safety, overmedicalisation, and mental health,” he said.Oksana Pyzik, an associate professor of pharmacy practice and policy at UCL School of Pharmacy, also called for stronger action.“These rulings represent the bare minimum in addressing how weight loss POMs are being promoted in ways that blur the line between advertising health care services versus POMs,” she said, noting that companies continued to break the rules, with some even glamorising weight loss jabs through celebrity endorsements on social media.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryAdvertisingAdvertising Standards AuthorityDiets and dietingObesityDiabetesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

But although the dolls have been around since 1959, it was only in 2019 that the manufacturer, Mattel, started selling Barbies with physical disabilities.Mattel has now launched its firstBarbiedoll with type 1 diabetes, the latest addition to a range it says has been designed “to enable more children to see themselves reflected and encourage doll play that extends beyond a child’s lived experience”.View image in fullscreenThe doll wears a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) on her arm to help manage her condition.Photograph: Mattel/PAType 1 diabetesis an autoimmune condition where the body attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. It is often diagnosed in childhood, and patients have to monitor their glucose levels and take insulin every day.The new Barbie has been designed in partnership with the global type 1 diabetes not-for-profitBreakthrough T1D. The doll wears a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) on her arm to help manage her condition, and to keep it in place she uses (Barbie pink) heart-shaped medical tape. Barbie also carries a mobile phone with a CGM app to help track her blood sugar levels throughout the day.The doll wears an insulin pump, providing Barbie with automated insulin dosing as needed, and holds a bag big enough for any essentials such as snacks that she might need while out and about.Announcing the new doll, Krista Berger, senior vice-president of Barbie and global head of dolls, said it marked “an important step in our commitment to inclusivity and representation”.“Barbie helps shape children’s early perceptions of the world, and by reflecting medical conditions like T1D, we ensure more kids can see themselves in the stories they imagine and the dolls they love.”Karen Addington, CEO of Breakthrough T1D UK, said: “I’m absolutely thrilled that Barbie now includes a doll with type 1 diabetes. For children with T1D who don’t often see themselves represented, this doll will be a powerful role model, celebrating their strength and bringing recognition, inclusion, and joy to their play.”The first black Barbie dolls were introduced in the 60s and hispanic dolls in the 80s, while many dolls in careers under-represented by women were added in the 90s and 00s. Until six years ago, there were no Barbies with disabilities.‘A positive step forward’: Mattel launches first blind BarbieRead moreToday there are more than 175 different Barbie looks in the fashionistas range, with various skin tones, eye colours, hair colours and textures, body types and disabilities. They include a blind Barbie, a black Barbie with Down’s syndrome, dolls with hearing aids, prosthetic limbs and wheelchairs, and a Barbie with vitiligo.Barbie is not the only brand to focus on diversity.Lottiehas dolls withDown’s syndromeandautism, while Lego sells a variety ofminifigures with physical and non-visible disabilities.Responding to the announcement, Arjun Panesar, founding chief executive of diabetes.co.uk, said: “Representation matters – especially in childhood. Seeing a Barbie doll with type 1 diabetes helps normalise the condition, reduce stigma and show children that they are not alone.“It’s a positive step forward in building confidence, inclusion and understanding around living with diabetes.”Explore more on these topicsBarbieDiabetesDisabilityToysnewsShareReuse this content"

Walking along the beachfront past people soaking up the sunshine on benches and kids playing in the sand overlooked by Blackpool Tower, he throws out his arms with a huge grin.“For me, it has been an amazing place to grow up. I don’t understand why anyone would talk down their home town. If you feel shit about your town, you’re going to feel shit about yourself, right?”Michael’s life may be going places – he’s studying fashion at college, is making music and has a part-time job entertaining visitors at the Sea Life aquarium – but he knows his positivity about Blackpool isn’t shared by his peers in the town.Life for many young people here is tough, he says, for a myriad of complex and overlapping reasons; bad housing, poor educational and employment opportunities, crumbling and inadequate infrastructure and transport.View image in fullscreenMichael in the Sea Life aquarium, where he works part-timeDespiteBlackpool becoming one of the UK’s “trailblazer” neighbourhoodsnamed in the government’s spending review and promised up to £20m regeneration investment over the next decade, proposed cuts to welfare amid the cost of living crisis are likely to hit young people in the town hard.Considering all this, the recent finding from the University of Essex thatyoung people in coastal towns are three times more likelyto have an undiagnosed mental health condition than elsewhere in England doesn’t surprise him.“There’s a lot of people my age here that just get stuck in this cycle of feeling like they’re going nowhere, that there’s nothing here for them,” he says. “And whenever the media come here they just want to write about the bad things that then makes this whole cycle get worse.”Blackpool started rising through many deprivation indicesin England and Wales a decade ago – with all overall measures at the local authority level showing Blackpool has become relatively more deprived since 2007 – and became what one University of Cambridge paper described as a “recurring mediabenchmark for coastal deprivation”.Q&AWhat is the Against the tide series?ShowOver the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped back public services and transport systems that limit their life choices.For the next 12 months, accompanied by documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Over the past few years, local and national media has focused almost exclusively on Blackpool through the lens of its poverty and deprivation statistics. Newspaper headlines such as one from the Express last year which compared Blackpool to Beirut where“kids walk streets ‘barefoot’ beside junkies”have become what some groups working with young people consider “poverty porn”.Others see this characterisation of their town as a relentless drip of stigma and shame for young people already struggling to feel good about their prospects.“If you just hear that your home town is scum all the time that sinks in,” says Michael.1:33Young people speak about their lives in Blackpool – video“And what makes me angry is that it’s just not true that everything is bad here for people. So many good things are happening here but nobody is telling those stories. Everyone gets really pissed off when the media talks about how bad it is in Blackpool but it feels like there aren’t many people helping us be proud of where we’re from.”Michael says his pride and belief in himself are partly thanks to his mother who raised him on her own and saw that nurturing his creativity was key to building his confidence.He also says he wouldn’t have become the person he is now if he hadn’t found his community at House of Wingz, an “arts house” founded by couple Sam and Aish Bell Docherty.Launched as a dance company in 2006, House of Wingz has evolved into a hub for youth and street culture. Tucked down a back street not far from the seafront, it has become a second home to Michael and hundreds of others from the town.As well as the large dance studio, there is a music studio and skate ramp. Someone has set up a painting corner with an easel and oil paintings stacked against the wall. The place is buzzing with a hip-hop dance class in motion and teenagers clattering up and down the skate ramps.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: Michael goes through some dance moves in House of Wingz; Orson, who has been taking dance classes since he was eight; Joe, who likes to surround himself with ‘positive people’ and make music; Julia, who learned to dance at House of Wingz and now takes workshops of her own“Basically, anything creative that we want to do, Sam and Aish will make it happen,” says Michael. His mum first took him there as an eight-year-old for street dance lessons. “They’re always like, ‘just find your passion and go for it’. You don’t need to be the best dancer or the best at anything, it’s fine to just be here and have a good, normal life doing interesting things.”Orson, 22, is in the kitchen, cooling down after a dance lesson. Growing up in a single-parent household in Blackpool with three siblings, he saw his mum struggle to pay the bills.Dancing makes me feel alive, like, really good about myself … You walk out of here and you believe in yourselfOrson, dancer“I know what it’s like to live in bad housing, and it’s shit,” he says. “Housing is a really big problem for young people here. You can’t help but feel bad about your life if you’re living like that. I hated school, I had a really hard time there but then I found dance and I found this place and it changed my life.”Orson has been taking dance classes at House of Wingz since he was eight and is now a talented dancer. “I’ve probably spent thousands of hours here,” he says.He is now teaching and about to go on tour with his own dance company. He has no problem talking about how dancing makes him feel. “It makes me feel alive, like, really good about myself,” he says.“It’s like [I have] this confidence when I’m in a room and there’s music on, I just have this vision of what I can do with my body, how I can make something look cool, or weird or whatever I want. You walk out of here and you believe in yourself.”View image in fullscreenJoe says that where he grew up hasn’t stopped him trying to follow his dreamsMany here speak of how finding House of Wingz helped them pivot out of periods of depression or taught them skills that opened up new pathways.For 23-year-old Julia, who moved to Blackpool from Poland and initially struggled with feeling isolated, “it just brought all these cool people into my life. I learned to be a dancer from nothing and now I’m teaching dance and going out into schools and running workshops.“A lot of people say, ‘there’s nothing going on in Blackpool, it’s dead’, and I’m like, are you kidding? It’s frustrating that more people don’t know it’s here,” she says.Joe says he has been given confidence to believe in himself and his music. “Finding this community has meant so much, just surrounding yourself with positive people and making music and doing productive things with your time.“My life hasn’t been easy, I grew up in the wrong area but that hasn’t stopped me from trying my hardest to chase my dreams.”Sitting outside in the afternoon sunshine, Sam and Aish Bell Docherty say they know that what they are providing isn’t going to fix the big, systemic problems in young people’s lives.View image in fullscreenSam and Aish Bell Docherty, who run House of Wingz, are working hard to get young people involved in the conversation about Blackpool’s future“Life is so hard for a lot of kids here, many of them don’t have anything at all and they can face multiple disadvantages, but they also carry this negative view of what they can do with their lives,” says Aish. “It’s so difficult to shift that perspective or mindset because it’s generational.”According to the Office for National Statistics,28% of Blackpool’s population were classed as “economically inactive”last year – neither working nor looking for work. “Many young people in Blackpool, the adults in their life aren’t doing anything and they internalise and project all of this back on to their own lives and feel hopeless,” says Aish.You need to show young people that there are people in town doing creative, inspiring things. That’s how aspiration growsAish Bell Docherty, House of WingzAish and Sam want to get House of Wingz members such as Michael, Orson, Joe and Julia to be a part of the conversation about what young people need in Blackpool in order to be able to feel good about the town and their future in it.They run a youth leadership programme at House of Wingz that gets older members of their community to teach dance to hundreds of younger children, which, says Aish, “helps kids in our town feel accepted and that they belong and that it’s good to be ambitious about their futures too”. Michael, Orson, Joe and Julia are on a steering committee with local policymakers to develop a new arts and culture strategy for Blackpool.“The problem is, all the optics are wrong. You need to show young people that there are people in town doing creative, inspiring things. That’s how aspiration grows,” says Aish. “Often it’s not that young people need to get out of Blackpool, it’s just they need to find the right opportunities or pathways here but their voices aren’t being listened to enough – and they are the future of this town.”View image in fullscreenJoe and Julia on the beach at sunset with Blackpool’s South Pier in the distanceView image in fullscreenOrson on Blackpool beach.

Is time speeding up? Australia’s experts give us their second opinionA standard Earth day is 86,400 seconds, but over three days in July and August, scientists expect the planet’s rotation to quicken relative to the sunSupported byAbout this contentPetra StockTue 8 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.41 EDTShareTime flies, and three days in July and August could flit by faster than usual this year – but only if your clocks are set to astronomical time.A standard Earth day is 86,400 seconds. But on 9 July, 22 July and 5 August, scientists expect theplanet’s rotation to quickenrelative tothe sun, truncating the days by a millisecond or more.In this period of great acceleration, is time itself now speeding up? And will global timekeepers have to skip a second to keep things tidy?Who keeps time, and how?Before the 1950s, the length of a day was defined by the Earth’s rotation and the apparent position of the sun.“The Earth rotates once per day, you divide that by 86,400, that’s one second,” says Dr Michael Wouters, time and frequency lead at the National Measurement Institute – Australia’s legal time keeper and the ultimate referee for what constitutes a second.“We’ve always needed to do certain things at certain times, with varying levels of accuracy, like knowing when to plant your crops,” he says. “As society got more and more complicated, it became necessary to know time more accurately.”These days, the institute keeps track of time using atomic clocks, capable of measuring in nanoseconds (a billionth of a second), which are synchronised globally to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).“We have atomic clocks here at our Lindfield lab. One of those is the source of time, and then we have others that we just use for checking that one’s working correctly,” Wouters says.These precise measurements matter when it comes to technology, according to Dr David Gozzard, an experimental physicist who specialises in technologies for precisely keeping and synchronising time at the University of Western Australia.Computers, servers, GPS systems, banking and electricity networks, as well as large telescopes, all rely on incredibly accurate synchronisation, sometimes within a fraction of a billionth of a second, he says. “We’re transmitting data so quickly, and it all needs to be time tagged, so computers know what data goes where.”Does the length of each day vary?Unlike an atomic clock, the rotation of the Earth can be irregular. One day can be a millisecond, or a fraction of a millisecond, shorter or longer than average.Gozzard says one of the contributing factors is the “gravitational dance” between the Earth and moon. Sometimes the moon acts like a handbrake, creating ocean tides, which bulge towards it and slightly slow the spin of the Earth. When the moon is furthest from the equator, the effect is weakened.Oleg Titov, a Geoscience Australia scientist, says acceleration and deceleration follow seasonal trends. The shortest day every year is around July and August, which is followed by deceleration over November to March.Scientists have noticed a slight quickening in the Earth’s spin since 2020. The fastest day recorded so far, on 5 July 2024, was 1.66 milliseconds shorter than average.“There is a general consensus the Earth will slow down again (deceleration will win), but there is a risk that acceleration may be effective for a few decades,” Titov says.Do we need to add or subtract ‘leap seconds’?As the milliseconds accumulate, the system of time based on the Earth’s rotation (known as Universal Time 1) drifts further away from the official system of coordinated universal time (UTC), measured by highly precise atomic clocks.To minimise the gap, global timekeepers began inserting something called “leap seconds”, adding an extra second here and there when needed. The first was added in 1972, themost recent in 2016.“Atomic clocks and our computer networks are the new, far superior form of time measurement, but we’re forcing them to keep in sync with this older form of measurement,” Gozzard says. He is pleased the international community has agreed to stop adding leap seconds from 2035.View image in fullscreenLondon celebrates the New Year.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesBut if the speed-up continues, the situation might require a different and unprecedented kind of adjustment. Instead of adding a leap second, timekeepers might have tosubtract one.Deleting a leap second could cause problems, Wouters says, as skipping a second has never been tested in practice.A few milliseconds here or there won’t make much of a difference to most people, Gozzard says. Especially given that we add or subtract an hour “arbitrarily” with daylight savings and apply the same time zones across hundreds of kilometres.Wouters says a millisecond’s difference would be imperceptible to the human eye and brain. Even if several seconds in difference accumulated over a century, “nobody’s really going to notice”.Explore more on these topicsScienceAustralian climate and environment in focusexplainersShareReuse this content"

But navigating spring and summer with one can be particularly difficult, with warmer weather calling for open-toe shoes and more exposure to the elements. Contact with dirt or the ocean can allow bacteria to enter the skin near an ingrown toenail, leading to infection, according to theCleveland Clinic.I should know: over the years, I’ve managed recurrent ingrown toenails, which occur when the edge of a nail grows into nearby skin, causing inflammation and pain. Twenty per cent of people who see a doctor for foot problems have the condition, according to theNational Institute of Health.Even though ingrown toenails are common, they can feel embarrassing. The usual response when I tell someone I have one is a wrinkled nose and the assumption that my feet look gnarly. This is not the case – typically, they just look a little red and inflamed (although if they get infected, like mine did once when I delayed seeing a doctor for over a week, that can be gross).There are effective ways to manage the condition. Here’s what experts say.What causes ingrown toenailsTrimming toenails incorrectly is one of the most common causes. A lot of people follow the curved line of the whites of their nails, but cutting straight across is better, says Dr Shital Sharma, DPM, a podiatrist and foot and ankle surgeon at New York Sports and Joints. The more the corners of a nail are cut, the more the nail will curl into the surrounding skin instead of lying flat, potentially causing an ingrown nail.Cutting the nail too short or too rounded can create a jagged shard of nail. This shard can dig into skin as the nail grows. “When you’re bending over to trim your nails instead of someone trimming for you, sometimes you don’t notice you’re missing a shard of nail on the corner,” says Dr Joshua Hollinger, DPM, a podiatrist at Rothman Orthopaedics.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Tight shoes are another common cause. Narrow toe boxes apply constant pressure to the inner and outer corners of toenails, which can cause the nail to poke into skin, says Sharma.In other cases, heredity is to blame. “I’ve seen whole families with ingrown toenails,” Hollinger says. In addition, individuals with bunions frequently have ingrown toenails, because as the big toe angles toward the second toe, it applies more pressure to the inside border of the nail. People with flat feet, fungal nails and dystrophic – or thickened – nails are also predisposed.How to prevent ingrown toenailsAn easy way to protect your toes is to let the nail grow slightly past the tip of your toe, then trim straight across without rounding the edges, says Dr Don Pelto, DPM, a podiatrist at Central Massachusetts Podiatry and author of The Healthy Living Guide to Ingrown Toenails. Trimming every three to four weeks is a good general practice, but this will vary for each individual.Sharma recommends wearing wider footwear that gives your toes room, and avoiding pedicures, which can involve aggressively cutting the sides of your nails. If you do get a pedicure, ask for your nails to be trimmed straight across to avoid problems.For athletes who wear cleats, note that they have a break-in period. “That’s when I see lots of ingrown toenails,” she adds. “So don’t throw away your old cleats – go back and forth between them [and] new cleats.”If heredity is causing your issues, that’s trickier. Some people opt for a partial matrixectomy, where a doctor removes a small side portion of the nail and applies a chemical to the nail root to prevent it from growing back. This typically takes two to three weeks to heal, Hollinger says.This procedure can be especially useful for people with recurrent ingrown toenails, like me. Last spring, after weeks of pain and an infection my podiatrist said was too deep in the nail root for antibiotics to treat, she performed a partial matrixectomy. I haven’t had issues since. Consult your podiatrist to discuss whether this is an appropriate measure for you.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sharma suggests soaking your foot for 15 minutes nightly in warm water with Epsom salts or table salt. “Soaking helps reduce inflammation and softens the nail so that it’s easier to trim,” Sharma says. Although it’s not a cure, you can also use a moisturizing, protective ointment such as Aquaphor to soften tough skin and nails and reduce some discomfort, she adds.I never travel without some, in case I have a flareup. And if my toes feel sore after wearing tight shoes, such as high heels, I immediately start soaking my feet and applying Aquaphor.Monitor your toenails as soon as you start experiencing discomfort, Sharma says. Taking pictures can be useful as the condition progresses, to construct a timeline for your healthcare provider that can help you figure out what might have triggered the problem and how quickly it’s worsening.I hate the way sneakers look on me – is there another comfortable shoe I can wear?Read moreTake caution if you’re going swimming. “Chlorinated pools have chemicals that fight bacteria in the water, so I’m less concerned about people swimming in a pool with an ingrown toenail,” says Hollinger. “But I’ve seen nasty infections from the ocean if people swim when their skin is broken.” If you’re experiencing redness, drainage or swelling, he doesn’t recommend swimming in the ocean or a lake.Redness and drainage are signs of possible infection, and it’s best to see a podiatrist. However, don’t wait for these symptoms to visit a doctor. “Go as soon as you notice pain and persistent discomfort when you’re walking or doing your daily routine,” Hollinger says. Sometimes a podiatrist can simply trim the offending nail to relieve the issue. But “if you wait for it to worsen, we might be limited to doing a partial matrixectomy.”Another possible treatment is partial toenail avulsion, which removes the ingrown portion without dissolving the nail root. The nail should regrow in eight to 12 months, Hollinger says. Full toenail avulsion is rare and usually only used when both edges of the nail are ingrown, Pelto says.Follow your podiatrist’s instruction for aftercare if they perform partial toenail avulsion or a matrixectomy. Pelto recommends daily foot soaking with Epsom salts or iodine if sterilization is required. Afterward, apply Neosporin, wear flip-flops or wide sneakers, and keep the toe wrapped in gauze or a bandage for several days, he says.Ingrown toenails might not be the most glamorous condition, but it’s certainly a manageable one.Jacqueline LeKachman is a New York based-writer who covers family, sex and all the other things that keep us up at night for the Washington Post, Women’s Health, HuffPost, and moreExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 1990s threw up some random highlights – Jeeves and Wooster, the ubiquitous Mr Bean – but the next decade was something of a sitcom wasteland until Derren Litten’s outrageously funny Benidorm pitched up. That was followed a mere six years later by Plebs (essentially: if The Inbetweeners were Romans) and job centre-based comedy The Job Lot, whose title’s feel of this-pun-dictated-the-entire-premise still causes me to break out in a cold sweat. Yet despite these shows being the broadcaster’s only notable contributions to the form this century, ITV comedy still feels like a distinctive subgenre, one defined by old-school story beats and all the edge of a bouncy ball.Into this decidedly unradical template struts Jordan Gray, the singer turned standup who in 2022 became the first transgender person to headline the London Palladium with her Edinburgh-award nominated hit showIs It A Bird?With her new sitcom, the 36-year-old provides the mainstream comedy mould with fresh fodder. We first encounter our hero, Liv, via a parody of one of those cheesy 00s razor adverts: a silky dressing gown is dropped; blades glide along already spotless shins and armpits – but then this classy babe begins shaving her face and urinating in the sink. The punchline? Her longsuffering housemate Tom (Thomas Gray) has been sitting on the toilet the whole time.From that point on, you suspect Transaction is honouring a sitcom style powered by an endless stream of silly, semi-predictable jokes and ludicrously contrived storylines in exchange for the chance to present a nuanced portrait of a transgender woman at a time when dehumanisation remains rife. Liv is charismatic and clever, but she is also lazy, workshy, irritating, jealous and selfish. These are all positives, by the way – anyone who thinks progressive representation in comedy involves nice characters being nice to each other all day long is sorely mistaken.Transaction’s major arc involves Tom’s employer, a supermarket called Pellocks, which has caused controversy by inadvertently plastering “lady boys get out” on a billboard. Obviously this isn’t remotely plausible, but such creaky plotting does give stressed-out, well-meaning boss Simon (Nick Frost) a reason to hire Liv – who he somehow knows is Tom’s flatmate – in an effort to quell the protest outside. Once she realises she can’t be fired (the optics would be terrible), Liv decides to be an awful employee. But she does disarm the indignant crowds with an irreverent speech. “When I told my dad I was becoming a woman,” she announces solemnly, “he said I could never pull it off. I said I’d probably get a doctor to do that bit, Father.”You could envisage a variation on this joke being told, wince-inducingly, by a blokey comic decades ago. Coming from Gray, it feels like snort-inducingly harmless fun. That said, walking the line between enlightened and unreconstructed humour is not always so straightforward. Liv’s other colleagues are conscientious Millie (the charming Francesca Mills), who has dwarfism, and “beefy Linda” (an impeccably deadpan Kayla Meikle), who is Black. When Liv declares that the trio resemble “the setup to a joke that would get you uninvited to Christmas dinner,” moments after delivering a duff quip about Millie’s height, it all starts to feel less bracingly modern.Yet there is something impressively sophisticated going on here, too. Liv refuses to pay Tom rent, claiming she’s saving up for “gender realignment” surgery. Tom is sceptical: “I thought you didn’t want a vagina? You said you were scared of a bee flying up in it.” Indeed, Liv is later horrified to discover Simon has started a fundraiser for said surgery. Transaction’s brashness doesn’t stop it discussing what has traditionally been one of the more delicate – and taboo – elements of the trans experience. Then again, Gray has long had something to say on this topic: her 2022 appearance on Channel 4’s Friday Night Live saw her play the piano with her penis, resulting in 1,500 Ofcom complaints.It’s part of a refreshing rebellion against the status quo offered by this show, but Transaction remains markedly retro overall: at its core, this is a broad comic caper about some unrealistically stupid people messing about in a supermarket. In later episodes, the narrative sprawls into generic workplace plotlines: crushes, rivalries, minor slapstick disasters. It’s a bit dull – not something you could ever say about Liv herself, whose humour is puerile but punchy and unexpected. Instead, I am left wondering what Gray might have made outside the confines of an old-fashioned sitcom on a channel that tries to crowd-please, but rarely manages to make history.Transaction is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyComedyTelevisionTransgenderreviewsShareReuse this content"

Emerging from a profound sense of place, they leave the viewer teetering with wonderAdrian SearleTue 8 Jul 2025 13.04 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTSharePainting quickly and directly, with few revisions and no changes of heart, Emily Kam Kngwarray’s art is filled with exhilarations and with difficulties. Part of the pleasure of her art is that it is so immediate, so visually accessible, with its teeming fields and clusters of finger-painted dots, its sinuous and looping paths, its intersections and branchings, its staves and repetitive rhythms. You can get lost in there, and sometimes overwhelmed. You can feel the connection between her hand and eye, and the bodily gestures she makes as she paints.Kngwarray’s paintings might well remind you of a kind of gestural abstraction they have nothing to do with, and which the artist would never in any case have seen. The things we look at in Kngwarray’s art are about an entirely different order of experience to the similar kinds of brushstrokes driven this way and that around other, more familiar canvases we might also find in Tate Modern, where her retrospective has arrived from theNational Gallery of Australia. But this similarity is also one of the reasons Kngwarray became famous in the first place.View image in fullscreenEmily Kam Kngwarray in 1980.Photograph: Toly SawenkoKngwarray only painted for the last six or seven years of her life, leading up to her death in 1996. She made upwards of 3,000 paintings. Before that she spent a little over a decade making batik prints, which were no less inventive than her paintings; foliage and flowers cover the cotton and later silk, lizards and emus erupt from the fabrics which swarm with life and her own lively and confident graphic touch. Her art always had a spirit of improvisation and immersion in the process, first in the complexities of printmaking and then in painting with thin, quick-drying acrylics.Born around 1914 in Australia’s Northern Territory, Kngwarray spent her entire life around her ancestral Alhalker Country homeland. Colonisers had first appeared there in the 1870s, and confrontations had led to many Aboriginal deaths. As a child, Kngwarray learned to run away from the whitefellers. First came the surveyors, then the telegraph, and then police, trackers and settlers, digging boreholes for water for their sheep, goats, horses and cattle, and appropriating sacred ancestral lands. Missionaries came with camels, magic lantern shows and a gramophone. In the early 1930s, 100 or more Aboriginal people in the area were shot or poisoned by police and a colonist leaseholder (who had been involved in previous atrocities), in retribution for spearing cattle.View image in fullscreen‘The boss of batik’ Untitled 1977 by Emily Kam Kngwarray.Photograph: Emily Kam Kngwarray/Copyright Agency. Licensed by DACS 2025Kngwarray spent much of her adult life on stations, watching cattle and sheep, working in kitchens and minding children. She spoke little English, and like other Aboriginal people, generally worked for rations rather than payment. The sheep and cattle stations couldn’t function without their labour. She was an accomplished hunter-gatherer. Photographs in the fascinating catalogue show Kngwarray skinning echidnas and bearing a lizard by the tail.By the 1970s, land began to be returned to its traditional owners, and adult literacy and numeracy courses were set up, leading, circuitously, to a batik printing course at the former Utopia station homestead, as a possible avenue to self-employment for women in the area. Then in her mid-60s, Kngwarray became, as she said later, “the boss of batik”. By the early 1980s, batiks by the Utopia artists began to be recognised and exhibited, firstly in Australia then further afield. By the end of the 1980s, an Aboriginal controlled organisation took over the Women’s Batik Group, and began distributing paints and canvas as an alternative to the highly labour-intensive batik.The imagery, motifs, iconography, and even spatial sense of Kngwarray’s work comes directly from her Indigenous Anmatyerr culture; women’s songs and ceremonies involving communal body painting – using natural pigments mixed with fat to stripe breasts, torsos and arms, ceremonies involving scarification, and telling stories with the sand at one’s feet, using leaves and twigs and other ephemera to represent characters, situations, weather. All this storytelling and bodypainting takes place while sitting on the ground, which is also where Kngwarray put herself to paint. For larger works she would sit on the unstretched canvas and work from within it.Painting for her was a continuation of her cultural practice – although it appears she was hesitant about revealing the stories her paintings told. This isn’t unusual for any artist. Its good to have secrets and mysteries and things unexplained. Where her paintings are titled, they might be called ‘Everything, or My Country, or be named after a specific place or a type of yam, an old man emu with babies, or appear to describe a journey through the bush.View image in fullscreen‘I paint my plant, the one I am named after’ … Yam awely 1995, by Emily Kam Kngwarray.Photograph: Emily Kam Kngwarray/Copyright Agency. Licensed by DACS 2025Arrow shapes turn out to be the footprints of emus in the sand as they make their way from here to there, pausing to eat fruits or grain or insects in their path. Tangles of line depict the vine of the pencil yam, whose presence betrays the tubers underground and the seed-pods from which the artist got her name Kam. “I am Kam! I paint my plant, the one I am named after,” she once explained. “They are found growing up along the creek banks. That’s what I painted. I keep on painting the place that belongs to me – I never change from painting that place.”Sometimes the paintings are meticulous in their ordering, and at other times a line will scrabble all over the place, rolling and slewing around the large canvas. There are blizzards of dots, translucent white lines crossing and recrossing the territory of the canvas, and emphatic black lines crazing a white surface with marks that nearly cohere – but into what? Often, I’m left teetering. One long suite of 22 identically sized canvases, all dotted and clotted and clogged with colour, seems to evoke a consistent though shifting optical terrain, while banks of horizontal and vertical lines evoke the body markings of a traditional ceremony, and the sense of bodies in motion. The closer I get to Kngwarray’s art, the more it recedes. On a physical and optical level, it feels accessible, in ways that are a bit overfamiliar. But that wasn’t what the artist was doing. Her art was about life and connectedness to something more than just the art world and its manners.Emily Kam Kngarraway is at Tate Modern until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingIndigenous AustraliansTate ModernIndigenous artreviewsShareReuse this content"

Will her epic ‘explosion of energy’ Prom blow the Albert Hall roof off?John LewisTue 8 Jul 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareAt midnight, at least one night a week, Anna Lapwood ascends the stairs to the Royal Albert Hall’s organ loft and climbs on to its bench. Safe in the knowledge that the audience for that evening’s show have all dispersed, she starts playing the venue’s enormous Henry Willis organ, all 10,000 pipes of it. Often, she’s still going at five or six in the morning. “It’s the only downtime you get to practise,” she says.Occasionally, some celebrity from an aftershow party will be lured by her playing. “It’s how I met Benedict Cumberbatch,” she says with a laugh. “And there was the time I gave Tom Cruise an impromptu organ lesson, after that live orchestral screening of Top Gun: Maverick. AndLudovico Einaudi, who came up and improvised something with me. And the bandWet Leg, who had a go on the organ. Sometimes it’s curious cleaners or security staff who’ll come up and chat and want to have a play. It’s a lovely vibe.”Schoolfriends found it hilarious that I couldn’t tell the difference between Justin Bieber and BeyoncéLapwood’s followers on social media – including more than 1 million on Instagram and 1.2 million on TikTok – have long wanted to witness her in this late-night environment. Now, finally, she has found a way to make it happen. Next month, Lapwood will curate the first all-night Prom in over 40 years. “It will be an explosion of energy. I’ll be conducting a choir and playing the organ, but there will also be a whole load of other artists, like the pianist Hayato Sumino, or the fantastic Norwegian ensembleBarokksolistene– people in the Arctic know about performing during the night!”It’s tempting to picture this Prom, which will run from 11pm until 7am, as a giant chill-out room. Not at all, says Lapwood. “I hope that no one will be asleep!” she exclaims. “And I hope people won’t be dipping in and out. There will be two breaks. We’re trying to make sure that there are rest areas – not sleeping areas! – and lots of coffee and snacks. The idea is that people will settle in, stay awake and enjoy all of it.”View image in fullscreenArctic cool… Barokksolistene are part of Lapwood’s Prom.Photograph: Matthew LongThe event kicks off the next stage in Lapwood’s sensational career. Still only 29, she has become the hottest property in classical music: a media-friendly, globally popular ambassador for her instrument and the genre. We meet in the 350-year-old chapel at Pembroke College, Cambridge, designed by Christopher Wren, which has been Lapwood’s workplace since 2016 when, aged 21, she became the youngest ever director of music at an Oxbridge college. It’s where she taught, rehearsed with choirs, led evensong and supervised two organ scholars. But the role became increasingly difficult to maintain in the light of her other commitments, which is why she made the “gut-wrenching” decision to leave this summer.“I’ve been doing admin on planes, marking homework while travelling to gigs, racing back from recording sessions to conduct choirs. And it’s difficult for me to tell my students that they need to have a healthy work/life balance when they see me operating like this.”It leaves Lapwood free to pursue other ambitions. As well as her contract with Sony Records and her new role as associate director at the Albert Hall, she has a packed concert schedule over the next two years, including another recital at LA’s Walt Disney Concert Hall (her first was a sell-out), a collaboration with Jonny Greenwood in Manchester (another all-nighter next February) and concerts everywhere from Bristol to Budapest, Nuremberg to New York. “Venues used to want a confirmed setlist years in advance. I’ve tried to encourage more flexibility. I now just say ‘programme includes’ and list a couple of works – it’s important that I’m able to play the music that I’m currently excited about, and get a bit spontaneous.”One noticeable feature of Lapwood’s concerts is that, unlike most conductors or soloists, she talks to her audiences. Why does she do this? “Partly because I’m stuck up in the organ loft, and I need to connect with people. Mainly, I want to break people into classical music, and it’s essential to provide some sort of context and convey my enthusiasm. But every performer does things differently. Some conductors feel it’s a distraction. It’s a personal choice.”Last year Lapwood was at the centre of a mini furore for saying she welcomed people filming her concerts and uploading footage to social media. “Again, It has to be the choice of the performer,” she says. “Going on to the stage requires a lot of bravery, and you need to feel comfortable. Some people hate being filmed. I like it.”That hasn’t always been the case. “There was a time when I felt that I was always having to prove myself, a constant fear I’d mess up,” she admits. “The main problem was that I was playing an entirely classical programme, the likes of Bach and Widor and Messiaen. Much as I love all those composers, I didn’t want to playjustthem. It’s only since I’ve started incorporating my own transcriptions of film scores into my sets that I have started to genuinely enjoy playing live.”Soundtracks have become a crucial part of Lapwood’s repertoire. “I was always acutely aware of how soundtracks could affect your emotional state. I found myself rewinding DVDs and transcribing scores, note for note, working out why they moved me. Now I’ve started turning those transcriptions into organ arrangements. You have to follow what makes your heart sing.”View image in fullscreenSmall hours highlight … Japanese pianist and composer Hayato Sumino.Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty ImagesShe has recorded and performed film themes by John Powell, Rachel Portman and, in particular, Hans Zimmer, and wants to do more by the likes of James Newton Howard, Harry Gregson-Williams and Nainita Desai. “It was always my ambition to write music for film. I’d love to write a soundtrack for the organ, because it’s never been done, and it’s such a versatile instrument.”Lapwood’s most recent album, Firedove, mixes many of her enthusiasms. It opens with her arrangement of Alan Menken’s theme from Disney’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame and ends with two pieces by real-life organists at Notre Dame de Paris: a fiendish scherzo by Louis Vierne and preludes and fugues by Maurice Duruflé. There are modern minimalist pieces she has commissioned by Poppy Ackroyd, Hania Rani and Ola Gjeilo; a touch of Zimmer, a hymnal choral arrangement of a Bob Dylan song and a bombastic mashup of Robbie Williams’s Angels and Widor’s Toccata. “It sounds like I’ve arranged it thematically, but it’s literally just a load of music that I’m excited by, held together by the thread of the organ sound.”Lapwood has no composing credits on any of her eight albums to date, something she wants to rectify. “My composing brain is slowly waking up,” she says. “I’m just getting comfortable enough to start writing for the organ. I loved composing when I was little, but then I got a low grade in a harmony and counterpoint exam and was told I couldn’t continue composition. Which is nonsense!”I never sneer at anyone’s musical tastes. All musicians have blindspotsInstead the young Lapwood put all her efforts into learning as many instruments as she could get her hands on. By the age of 18 she had reached grade-eight standard on the piano, violin, viola, harp and organ, and taught herself a dozen other instruments. “I’d hear my older brother playing the flute and I’d nick his instrument and his tuition book. I’d buy cheap instruments from junk shops – guitars, cornets, drum kits – and learn from beginners books. It’s like languages. The more you learn, the easier each one gets.”So immersed was she in mastering instruments that she didn’t have much time to listen to music – something surprisingly common among musical prodigies. “Schoolfriends found it hilarious that I couldn’t tell the difference between Justin Bieber and Beyoncé,” she laughs. “It was like I lived under a rock.” She remembers sharing the musical tastes of her father, a vicar turned teacher who would listen to evangelical hymns and “quite bland popular classics” by the likes of Aled Jones and violinist Vanessa-Mae.“It’s why I never sneer at anyone’s musical tastes,” she says. “When I started working with choirs, people were like, ‘How could you not know these big hits of the choral world?’ But every area of music has its own smash hits, and all musicians have their blindspots.”Watch the viral clip of Lapwood playing with Bonobo at the Royal Albert HallLapwood’s blindspots have become a running joke on the Radio 4 cross-genre music show Add to Playlist, on which she is a frequent guest. She often admits to never having heard anything by the likes of, say, Adele, Justin Timberlake, the Rolling Stones or Keith Jarrett. She confesses that, in the past, she has been guilty of being musically incurious. She even admits she has not heard any of Dudley Moore’s jazz recordings, despite being one of his successors as an organ scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford, and having her name listed beneath his on a plaque in the chapel’s organ loft.“Sometimes, the amount of music I need to deal with just for work is exhausting,” she says. “You can’t listen to everything.” She relaxes, she says, by putting on the same Melody Gardot playlist she has listened to for years, and by watching trash TV like Australian Masterchef, or by cooking the same dishes day after day (“I’m currently in a shakshuka phase”).“It is easy to get stuck in a rut, which is why I love being forced into learning about new areas of music.” Often this happens in public, such as when she guested on the organ with the electronica outfit Bonobo, or performed in a Ministry of Sound concert – both went viral.“You suddenly learn about a new sound world, and appreciate different technical skills. All these musical barriers – barriers that I had enforced on myself – disappear. It’s like, for some reason, my parents never cooked bacon. I went through my childhood thinking I’d hate bacon. Then, at university, I had a bacon sandwich, which was a eureka moment! It’s why I’m increasingly open to all types of music.”Firedove by Anna Lapwood is out now on Sony Classical. Her new single, An Irish Blessing, with the Pembroke College Chapel Choir, will be released on 1 August.

So I travelled to Italy to find out whether it was too good to be trueByLauren MarkhamTue 8 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 11.44 EDTShareIf you could move anywhere, where would it be? This used to be a question I’d ask myself or others at dinner parties, but two years ago, as new parents facing the unsustainable costs of Bay Area life and the looming threat of middle-age atrophy, my husband, Ben, and I took to the internet in earnest with the notion of reinventing our lives somewhere new.We were, of course, part of a widespread trend: seeking adventure and greener pastures elsewhere in the era of globalisation. Even so, the notion felt thrilling. Where would we go? Our search had some parameters: affordability, a natural landscape (I dreamed of cicadas, cypress trees), a place with a language we either already spoke or could learn easily enough so that we could contribute to the community. We’d spent our careers working in schools and nonprofits with young immigrants, and, however different it might look in a new country, we had no intention of leaving a life of service behind. Above all, though, what we wanted was an environment in which we could spend a lot of time writing and afford to do it. But Ben had another non-negotiable of his own: proximity to surfing. This annoyed me, as it significantly limited our search, but I supposed it was reasonable enough to design a dream life according to one’s actual dreams.“There’s surfing in Sardinia,” he said.We’d heard about the “€1 house” programme in which poor, depopulating towns put their abandoned or unused buildings up for sale. The programme, I soon learned, was actually a loose collection of schemes that economically struggling towns used to lure outside investment and new residents. The campaigns seemed to me to have been largely successful – some towns had sold all their listed properties. I pored over dozens of news articles that had served as €1 house promotion over the years. By attracting international buyers to a house that “costs less than a cup of coffee”, as one piece put it, some of Italy’s most remote towns now had new life circulating through them. Many local officials had come to see €1 house experiments as their potential salvation.What was the catch? It seemed most municipalities required you to renovate the house within a couple of years of its purchase, and due to high levels of interest, the houses often went to auction, ultimately selling for much more than a single euro. But what we wondered about were the ethical considerations – the classic tensions of gentrification. What would it mean just to buy our way into a foreign place where we had no connections and try to set up a home there?Still, we kept looking. There is a town in northern Sardinia called Sedini that was, according to Liliana Forina, a woman I got in touch with online, about to launch a €1 house initiative of its own. A stylish woman in her 60s from Milan, she had recently moved to Sedini from the mainland. The town wasn’t far from the beach and, judging by the pictures and Forina’s descriptions, seemed beautiful.I arranged a meeting with her over Zoom. She appeared on-screen from her office, a Sardinian valley stretching behind her. A few years ago, she explained, she and her new husband began scouring Italy for the perfect place to live. Each weekend, they would visit a new region, feeling out the vibe in remote villages and golden-lit coastal towns speckled with beaches, in each place trying to imagine a life. It was relatively easy to cross options off their list: this town was too expensive; this one too was full of tourists; this one lacked trees. They wanted easy access to basic services such as a hospital, a pharmacy, a police station. They also wanted a view. But above all, they were looking for what Forina called theirdolce vita, their sweet life. Eventually, they found it in Sedini, this breezy, hilltop town in northern Sardinia where the bells of several churches rang at noon, and, from a distance, the white-stone houses appeared stacked like antique toys on a rickety shelf. A local estate agent had found them a three-storey house right in the historic town centre with a view of the great green valley below. The house was livable but rather run-down and not to Forina’s taste, so the couple got to work renovating it, adding an upstairs terrace, exposing old beams, bringing antique tiles to a new gleam and knocking down walls to allow in more light.Their dream life was indeed becoming a reality. Mostly. As beautiful as their home was, Forina noted early on that many of the other houses in Sedini were in a state of complete dilapidation. This left the otherwise picturesque old-world town with a ghostly quality. The town was stunning, but it needed more people – ideally people from outside Sardinia. She dreamed of more cosmopolitan neighbours, people more like her. Might I be one of them?Depopulation is a primary struggle for many places throughout Italy’s interior. Young people, especially, are leaving towns such as Sedini, moving elsewhere for educational opportunities or for work. These historic settlements are littered with buildings that now sit empty.Forina began researching the €1 house scheme and brought the idea to Sedini’s town government. The mayor and his staff – all longtime residents whose families had lived there for generations – were easily convinced. That summer, they were going to introduce the idea to the rest of the locals.“Come visit us in Sedini!” she told me on our call. “Stay in my home. You will love it here.”If you could move anywhere, where would it be?It’s a question that gestures toward a life in some stage of calcification – thecouldimplying constraint, limitations, the presumption that one simply cannot, in fact, up and move. The €1 house programme serves as the doorway for just this sort of yearning for something new. Hate your job? Want to move but can’t afford a house? Worried about where you’ll retire, or how you’ll even manage to retire at all? If you have the right passport and enough money, you can find somewhere else to live. Why not make that place Italy?Last summer, I decided to take Forina up on her offer to visit Sedini and, while I was at it, a host of other depopulating towns throughout Italy, too. My husband and I stuffed an inordinate amount of belongings into a preposterous number of bags and flew with our 11-month-old to Italy for an adventure in pursuit of the possibility of a brand-new life.‘Everyone wants a piece of history,” Giacomo Verrua, an Italian property developer, told me. “And in Italy, history is everywhere.” Within this cliche, a person can achieve a life’s purpose and a sense of belonging through possession. But Italy’s cheap real estate is only available to foreigners because, contrary to popular mythology, Italian life isn’t pure romance and ease.The country is home to roughly 60 million people, but that figure is predicted to decline by 2 million by 2040 and by at least 4 million by 2050 – one of the steepest depopulation rates in all of Europe. This is due to an ageing population, but it is also a result of lack of opportunity that sees poor and wealthy Italians alike moving in search of better opportunities.In 2023, 9.8%of Italians lived below the poverty line, up from 6.9% in 2014. In Sardinia,roughly 20%of people live in poverty. Thecountry’s birthratehas hit all-time lows, andnearly 30%of its homes are unoccupied. Small Italian towns are experimenting with all sorts of financial incentives – tax breaks, even cash handouts – to bring Italians back to the countryside. In 2022, Sardinia offered a €15,000 bonus, with some strings attached, for moving to the island.Other places are experimenting with similar incentives. Tulsa, Oklahoma, offers a $10,000 relocation grant to remote workers as well a membership at a downtown coworking space. Across Japan, abandoned homes sell for zero dollars. There are special visas for UK and other non-EU citizens seeking to relocate to Spain; all they need to show is a certain amount of money in their bank account to qualify. Greece offers a “golden visa” to anyone who can invest at least €250,000 in a Greek property.View image in fullscreenSambuca di Sicilia at sunrise.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The ObserverBut no such initiative has quite captured the public imagination as the €1 house scheme. “It’s a PR campaign,” said Maurizio Berti, who runs 1eurohouses.com, a website dedicated to tracking and promoting various €1 house towns. And it’s a wildly successful one at that.The €1 house project seems to have been the brainchild of Vittorio Sgarbi, the Italian art critic and TV personality turned mayor of the small, rapidly depopulating town of Salemi, Sicily. On being elected in 2008, he began wondering whether he could draw investment into Salemi by offering up its empty, falling-toward-ruin buildings to foreigners for a token fee. Outsiders scrambled to snatch up the dirt-cheap properties, demand for local construction boomed and Salemi’s emptied houses were once again filled.Seeing this success, other Italian municipalities began devising their own €1 house plans. According to 1eurohouses.com, there are now 73 towns that have launched or are in the process of adopting a version of the model. Each town organises the operation slightly differently: some oversee the property sales directly, while others merely connect interested buyers to sellers and hype the event to the press. But the key is that the town can place conditions on the sales. Generally, buyers are required to fix the houses up within a certain amount of time (and will often have to rely on local architects and artisans). Some towns also require buyers to maintain full-time residence, or to open a business.Advocates of the scheme insist that everyone stands to win: the town benefits economically with an increased tax base, more people to patronise local businesses and a local building boom, while buyers gain the home – and the life – of their dreams. But its detractors worry that these flash sales risk turning these endangered Italian towns into mere curiosities, packing them with foreigners so that the culture all but disappears.The philosophical conundrum of these ageing, depopulating towns is this: open a place up to newcomers and risk eroding its essential nature, or allow it to wither away and die?Seen one way, the story of every place on Earth is that of migration and change. Between 1880 and 1924, somemore than 4 million Italians migrated to the United States. Meanwhile, in the past decade, about 900,000 refugees have found their way to Italy – from Syria, Afghanistan, Mali, Eritrea, Guinea, Pakistan and dozens of other countries. The Italian government is working hard to seal up its borders to keep these migrants out, while municipalities invite the €1 house gawkers. The €1 house scheme represents a new era of migration. A product of late capitalism, it seeks to fill the gaps left in one place with willing, resourced travellers from another – those with some money in the bank, stable passports and thus with other options. People, in other words, like me.On the first leg of our trip, we’d arranged to join Ben’s dad, stepmother and numerous members of his extended Italian American family in Tuscany. They’d rented a magnificent 13th century, two-storey stone villa that overlooked fields of sorghum and sunflowers. This place was, it occurred to me, tailor-made for the wistful outsider, possessing enough of the quintessential Italian iconography (draping vines, sweeping views from shuttered windows, stone floors) and the new: an open floor plan, air conditioning and palatial private bathrooms off most bedrooms.The villa was managed by Yulia, a Ukrainian émigré in her 30s. One afternoon, she came over to help us with the air conditioning and brought her one-year-old, who joined my baby in crawling around the living-room floor.“How much does childcare cost in California?” she asked. “$2,300 dollars a month,” I told her, shocking myself as I said the words. Yulia gasped. She had a daughter a few months older than ours and had been lamenting the Italian price tag of around €300 a month. Considering that our childcare cost more than we spent on housing, it was all too obvious to wonder yet again – what the fuck were we doing with our lives? House prices have soared in recent decades and rents continue to rise, and all the while more and more people have jobs that allow them to work from anywhere with an internet connection.“If you find the right place, we’d go in on it with you,” Ben’s uncle Aldo said. Our rental villa was just an hour and a half from the Tuscan town of Montieri, a hilltop settlement dating back to pre-Roman times that had been one of the first to adopt a €1 house model back in 2016. I left the family one day to visit the town, winding through fields of sunflowers and climbing a few thousand feet in elevation through cooling stands of forest. Montieri’s young mayor, Nicola Verruzzi, took me on a walking tour of the town, with its streets and narrow stone passages, which were almost entirely empty of people. “The heat,” he said with a shrug.Montieri had been a mining town since its founding around the year 1000 – silver and copper, then pyrite and lead. But when the last mine closed in the 1990s, the town was flung into a cycle of depopulation and abandonment. In the 1960s, Verruzzi said, roughly 4,000 people lived here. In the two decades after the mines closed, Montieri lost 3,000. Houses in the main squares were empty and falling to ruin, and businesses were on the brink of closure.In 2014, Verruzzi announced his plan to sell its abandoned houses for €1. It was just a whim, he told me. Unlike Sardinia and many of Italy’s poorer regions, Tuscany already loomed large in the foreign imagination. The municipality’s inboxes were quickly crammed with interested buyers from all around the world.In some ways, Montieri was the ideal candidate for the €1 house experiment. The town had already been hard at work updating its energy and heating infrastructure and laying fibre internet cable. And Tuscany is already a tourist destination, particularly for cyclists, mountain bikers and hikers.View image in fullscreenForeign visitors inspect the buildings in Sambuca di Sicilia with a view to buying one for €1.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianStill, the success of its €1 house scheme was remarkable. Verruzzi estimates that 30 new businesses have opened in this small town as a result of the initiative. On our tour, I was fascinated to see just how many buildings in the dead-centre of town had been renovated by foreigners in the past few years. “This house was an old prison,” he told me, pointing to a narrow two-storey that had sold for €80,000, its original stone covered in places by new stucco punctured by large, modern windows.Since the launch, some 70 houses have sold. Many of them are used as vacation homes, but they were no longer empty and falling into ruin. New electrician businesses have opened to service the renovators, there are new restaurants and bars, and tourism revenue is up.Admittedly, much of the evidence for the success of the €1 house programme more broadly remains anecdotal, and most of it comes from town leaders themselves. But what little data does exist suggests the initiatives’ remarkable economic promise. Since announcing a €1 house campaign in 2017, the 10,000-strong town of Mussomeli, Sicily, for instance, has seen more than 125 houses sold. The mayor’s office calculated that this brought €7m to the local economy, including builders, tradespeople, restaurants and hotels. The economic boom wasn’t just a result of the house sales: it estimated that roughly 6,000 people visited Mussomeli just to look at houses in 2018 and 2019, bringing income to local restaurants and hotels.In Montieri, Verruzzi put me in touch with Paolo, a Tuscan architect who married a Canadian woman; the two of them now comprise the in-demand design team of Montieri’s new, foreign class.Though enchanted by the notional history of the place they are buying, many buyers have a poor historical sense of just what it is they’ve bought, Paolo said. He and his wife told me, with a smile and a slight eye-roll, that American visitors “are always looking for frescoes”.The trickiest part about the €1 house scheme for buyers, Paolo explained, is that it is a gamble: inspections on old homes such as this can only glean so much information, making it hard to know what, in truth, you’re buying and how much work it will need. That’s also part of the fun. He recalled that one house in Montieri took years to sell because a menacing crack ran down a central wall. Perhaps the whole building would need retrofitting – or to be built anew. When it finally sold, the buyers hired Paolo, whose team carefully removed the plaster on the damaged wall only to find a beautiful stone chimney behind it. This was what had caused the plaster to buckle. What had seemed like a liability was in fact a stunning relic of the old house.We spent the week sprawled like lizards in Tuscany, enjoying the quiet and the natural light and availing ourselves of the free local childcare (the grandparents). Then early one morning, Ben, the baby and I got in the car and drove to the ferry, which delivered us to the eastern side of Sardinia, where we went looking for a beach with surfable waves. We headed westward, crossing through the mountains and the town of Montresta, which has also jumped on the €1 house bandwagon. It was settled in the 18th century by Greeks fleeing the Ottoman empire. Now, the place and its people were weighing whether to usher in the next wave of people from far away.It was hot and empty, like Montieri had been, and all its businesses were closed. We didn’t see a soul. It was hard to picture living there for practical reasons. We’d spent over a week straight enjoying the help of grandparents in looking after our baby. If we moved here – even if surrounded by people – we’d be, at first anyway, all on our own. Was that the life we wanted? A person can buy a house, in other words, but home is something that seems to require more than money: the currency of relationships and time.The next day, I was due in Sedini, where I’d meet Forina and attend the launch event for the town’s €1 house initiative. I arrived just as the evening’s setup was beginning.“We’re a town of old people,” Sebastiano Finá, one of Sedini’s town councillors, told me with a shrug as he dragged chairs into a large meeting room in the centre of town. A lean, handsome man in his 60s, Finá was sporting shorts and a tan and had just stubbed out a cigarette in the entryway. In just a few short hours, the hall would be full of townspeople for the formal announcement of the new housing plan that Forina had helped to draft, hoping to convince the owners of Sedini’s old, abandoned houses. Some had moved away. Others lived nearby and simply couldn’t afford – or didn’t want to bother with – the upkeep. And some of the homes were shared by so many descendants of the original owners that they hadn’t figured how to split the costs of the renovations or make a cogent decision about the building’s future. Under the new proposal, the town authorities would create the necessary tax structures and offer tax incentives to both buyers and sellers, in addition to channelling interested parties directly to the Sedini residents selling their old tumbledowns. This was part of a larger initiative called “Sedini per la rinascita” (Sedini for Rebirth).While Finá finished unstacking chairs, Forina stood at the front of the room, clad in a chic purple pantsuit and fiddling with a projector. “How do I make this connect?” she groaned with frustration. “A town of old people!” Finá repeated, pointing to Forina with a laugh. “This is why we need this programme!”We still had some time before the event began, so Forina offered to show me around town. SouthernEuropewas in the midst of a heatwave. It was about 38C (100F) in Sedini, the air so thick that it was unpleasant to breathe. The asphalt and centuries-old stone emitted a heat haze that made everything appear warped, as if viewed through smudged glass.It wasn’t precisely the paradise I had pictured for myself, because, I realised once I’d arrived in Sedini, I wasn’t actually all that interested in living in the centre of a town but more in the remote ramble of the countryside – which wasn’t what the €1 house programme was generally selling. But, susceptible to the call of cheap real estate and the yearning for a full reinvention of self and life, I had at that very moment been wondering what exactly it was selling.By six, we were back at the meeting hall where people were taking their seats. Some 40-odd people had turned out – not a bad showing given the heat. Much to my discomfort, I was seated at the front facing the crowd, along with Forina; Salvatore Carta, the gravel-voiced mayor; and Angela Fresi, the town’s buoyant deputy mayor, dressed in a fitted pantsuit of bright green.“Welcome,” Carta bid the crowd in Italian. Not to worry, he assured the audience: the “€1 euro” price was just a starting point. Sellers could list for much as they wanted. “The municipality is only the facilitator of the sale,” he said. It would be the job of the mayor’s office to attract buyers.When it was Forina’s turn to speak, she implored the crowd and the owners of an abandoned or uninhabited house to “understand the importance of handing it over to those who can and want to renovate and live in it. Otherwise, there will be double damage: the owner will end up with a pile of broken bricks of no value and the degradation of the village will be progressive and irreversible.”A Dutch couple who were renovating their recently bought Sedini home took the stage. The husband, a white-haired gentleman with a slight swagger, spoke at length in decent Italian about his fondness for the town. His wife, a trim woman with short auburn hair, apologised for her lack of Italian.“Thank you for the warm welcome to your country and to your town,” she said. “I find this place very authentic. I feel the future here.” After a pause, she added, “And I see the future here for us.”‘Acountry,” writes Paolo Pileri, an Italian professor of urban design and an outspoken critic of the €1 house model, “is a complex artefact of architecture, streets, alleys and houses, combined with a web of relationships, experiences and interrelated social practices, and it therefore cannot be reduced to a mere confused sum of houses.”And yet houses are what are for sale. The worry is that, as with all forms of gentrification, a sudden influx of moneyed outsiders will change the culture of a place – erode its customs, turn its values on their head, change its fundamental essence.Fresi, Sedini’s deputy mayor, had spoken to me at length about the food festival the town held each autumn, in which families opened up their wine cellars, and farmers their barns and living rooms, so that people could share their harvests with one another. This was a point of pride for the locals and a matter of community connection. It also was a lure for buyers. Such events wouldn’t vanish with the mere presence of outsiders, but the detractors of the €1 house scheme seemed to fear that such events would become less of a genuine cultural tradition and more of a show – these towns becoming Disneyfied villages to be fetishised, even by their inhabitants.Marco Pizzi, a sociologist who has conducted extensive research into the impacts of the €1 house campaigns in Umbria, told me that though he was sceptical when he began his research, he’s come to see the programme as an innovative local approach to economic redevelopment. The foreign investment may, in fact, be what allows some of these towns to survive – and the very fact of their survival would allow their traditions to continue. Almost everyone I spoke with in Italy with first-hand experience of €1 house initiatives agreed: these schemes were a form of revival and had drawn people from abroad who were curious to learn about and participate in local ways of life.View image in fullscreenMen outside the church in the centre of Gangi, a depopulated town about 75 miles from Palermo with a €1 house programme.Photograph: Tiziana Fabi/AFP/Getty ImagesI spoke to Jennifer Fortune, a veterinarian from the Florida panhandle who started researching Italian real estate during a 2022 family vacation. She’d heard of the €1 house scheme, but soon figured out that there were lots of cheap houses for sale all over Italy that lacked some of the €1 house competition and red tape. On the real-estate site idealista.it, she found a handsome three-storey house not far from where she was staying in northern Italy. After failing to reach the real-estate agent, she snuck inside to take a look. The place was even more enchanting than she’d imagined. A stone house with brick ceilings and tiled floors, overlooking the Alps and a hazelnut grove, it was, she said, the stuff of dreams.The property was in rough shape and would need a lot of work, but she was undeterred. In fact, the work seemed like fun. She hired Italian property lawyers to help sort out the purchase. But even with their help, the process involved seemingly endless paperwork. And then came the renovations. It could feel like a full-time job, she told me – not just because of all the choices one has to make for such a big project, but due to the bureaucratic logjams.It didn’t help that she doesn’t speak Italian. “But I am really friendly,” she told me, “and I laugh a lot. And I have a credit card – that helps, too.”Purchasing a property in Italy, in other words, is not for the faint of heart. This seems to be baked into the €1 house model: the barriers to a foreigner buying property in Italy ensure that only the most committed buyers make it to the finish line – those who really want to make a life in the town and have the funds to do it.Some €1 house municipalities are now so crammed with foreigners that one wonders what – beyond historical curiosity – the original town still has, or will soon become. The Sicilian town of Sambuca di Sicilia,as CNN reports, has been so successful in luring €1 housers that it’s now considered the Sicilian “Little America”. It’s not clear whether Italian residents of the region mind.Pileri’s argument against the €1 house model makes perfect sense to me when levelled against moneyed outsiders, but it also verges on the kind of nativism that seeks to keep refugees and poor immigrants out of Italy. What is an “original” place, anyway, when every place is the product of migration upon migration, change after change? And is a town really better off if half emptied?What of Sedini’s dreams of rebirth? Now, nearly two years later, Forina says only a handful of Sedini residents have committed to selling their homes in the historic centre of town – some for the token €1 price, and others for a starting price of closer to €5,000. She remains somewhat at the helm. She has teamed up with Maurizio Berti and a tourist outfit to offer a “grand tour” of the area this coming summer in hopes of attracting international buyers and, for the tour operator and Berti, of perhaps making some money along the way.I asked Fresi, the mayor, why she thought so few had yet signed over their houses to sell. She wasn’t sure. She admitted there was already a “lack of trust” between the town’s longtime residents and the few newcomers who had recently moved into town. All this effort to sell their town to outsiders, and so quickly, felt suspicious to some. Yes, they wanted the town to survive. But many liked things how they were.One of the fundamental purposes of the €1 house programme, according to Sedini’s official guidelines, “is the revitalisation of the historic part of the town, restoring it to its historic function of the driving force of life, culture and activity”. A town needs people, Fresi and the rest of the town leaders knew. It needs patrons of its restaurants and bars and grocers; it needs people to tend its streets and take away its garbage; it needs people to help make its decisions, build its houses, teach its children, care for its elders and dress its people’s wounds. It needs people to have its children and bury its dead. The question, really, is who these people will be.By the time we got back home to California from our own grand tour, we weren’t so sure any longer about the Sardinia plan. It was far; it was hot; living all by ourselves in the countryside with a small baby might be a really excellent way to lose our minds.The great abandonment: what happens to the natural world when people disappear?Read moreBut while en route home, I’d received an email from a couple who were trying to attract buyers to a small hamlet called Bozzolo in the northern region of Liguria. The email was over the top in its evocation of paradise, but it had an effect. Had we given up too quickly? Maybe there was a dream place for us in Italy and we just hadn’t found it yet. Or maybe what we needed to be happy was not to defect from our lives, but hold the possibility of defection forever in our back pocket, taking it out and turning it over in our hands from time to time, because doing so revealed that the life we already had was actually, blessedly, pretty damn good.I often recall a bike trip we took one afternoon from our Tuscan villa, arriving, sweating and panting, at the top of a hill where a house, boarded up and overgrown with scrub brush, sat quietly in the sweltering heat. One window remained open, and an old curtain, just a scrap of cloth, now, billowed with breeze – a suggestion of life. Every now and then, convincing myself it’s just for research, I’ll poke around on the internet to see if it’s for sale.This is an edited version of a story that first appeared inVQRListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readHousingMoving overseasItalyEuropeCommunitiesAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Immediately, her family were branded thieves and liars. She moved school, where she became the target of bullying for her father’s “theft”. The verbal abuse was followed by physical. Racked by stress, meanwhile, Millie’s mother developed epilepsy, and Millie began sleeping with her to be on hand when she suffered seizures. The child became depressed and self-loathing, feeling like “a burden” to her family. She won a place at university but developed anorexia and could not continue.In her absolute gut-punch of a statement to Sir Wyn Williams’ Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, whosefirst report volume dropped on Tuesday morning, Millie wrote: “I fought. I tried. I am better for it … That nagging voice in my head still says ugly things sometimes. It still tells me that my past and my family’s struggle will define me, that it will be a branding on my skin forever … I’m 26 and am very conscious that I may never be able to fully commit to natural trust. But my family is still fighting. I’m still fighting, as are many hundreds still involved in the Post Office trial.”How does every one of these stories feel like the saddest thing you’ve ever heard? How did Millie’s father, an entirely innocent man, end up hounded into homelessness and a £310,000 “debt” to thePost Office? How in the ever-living Fujitsu does Lee Castleton still not have justice nearly two decades on?That story is just one case highlighted in the first volume of the report, with Williams calling the human impact of the Post Office scandal “profoundly disturbing”. Other takeouts? The most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history just got wider. We used to think that 900 innocent subpostmasters were convicted after the Post Office pursued them for branch shortfalls – shortfalls that were not in fact down to theft, but to a computer system the Post Office and its developer, Fujitsu,knew was faulty. Today we learned there were in fact approximately1,000 convictions. At least 10,000 victims were eligible for compensation, and that number is rising.At least 10,000 people affected by Post Office IT scandal as bosses ‘maintained fiction’ Horizon data was accurate, report says – liveRead moreAnd there have been even more tragic numerical upticks. It was previously thought that six victims of the Horizon scandal had taken their own lives; today we learned it was at least 13. A further 59 victims contemplated suicide at various points in their ordeal, and 10 of those actively attempted to take their own lives. At least one was admitted to a mental health facility on more than one occasion. Many self-harmed. Many say they began to abuse alcohol.Some numbers haven’t changed, though – the tally of people charged for ruining this many thousands of lives still stands at precisely zero.That blame side of matters will be addressed in the next phase of Williams’ report, and a significant police investigation is already under way. But the inquiry chair wanted to use this first volume to urgently catalyse the “full, fair and prompt” redress the government keeps saying is due to victims. In fact, he’s very keen the government should spell out what full and fair redress means. Ideally by, like, yesterday – but in the absence of that, ASAFP. That’s not Sir Wyn’s abbreviation, I should stress. But it’s very much the vibe of this compelling report, given the number of victims still to be compensated by any one of the four redress schemes. Of these, three are run by the government, and one by the Post Office. The Post Office! That feels totally normal – like appointing the wolf as loss adjuster for the three little pigs’ house insurance claims.Yet even at this first stage, Williams was clear that these thousands of individual horror stories were not the result of some kind of antagonist-free natural disaster. They happened becausethere were perpetrators. Someone blew thousands of houses down. His report states that all of these people and their wider families are to be regarded as victims of “wholly unacceptable behaviour perpetrated by a number of individuals employed by and/or associated with the Post Office and Fujitsu”.Indeed, a notable feature of today’s report is how many of the victims had begged for help when their Horizon terminals started showing weird shortfalls. One postmistress had made 256 calls to the helpdesk about Horizon problems. She would later be incarcerated and denied contact with her daughter on the latter’s 18th birthday. Her daughter died the following year. I have to say that even selecting which glimpses of suffering to include in this column feels disrespectful to all the others – the fact is that every single one is a tragedy whose ripples can only be guessed at. Small wonder Williams recommended that close family members affected by this are also compensated.And so to another of those families. The facts of Harjinder Butoy’s story are modern, but its emotional dynamics feel like something straight out of a Thomas Hardy novel. Here was a man in the prime of his life, with a thriving small business established with a loan from his brother. Then, a twist of fate … and the descent is dizzyingly rapid. The total loss of reputation, a court case, imprisonment. His shame – the shame of an innocent man – reported in newspapers from the Daily Telegraph to the Punjab Times. Harjinder’s whole family were sucked into the vortex of his misfortune – his wife was left homeless and penniless with their three young children; his brother’s loan could never be repaid; his parents gave everything to try to ameliorate his situation, though everything wasn’t enough. Mr Butoy spent longer in prison than any other victim of the Post Office scandal, and 14 years passed between his suspension and his conviction being quashed. His bankruptcy dogged him for a decade or more, his mental health has been destroyed, and he has never been able to find work.It feels impossible not to think of Harjinder’s fall in counterpoint to the seemingly unstoppable rise of senior executives at Fujitsu, and most particularly at the Post Office, where the boss class securedbonuses,directorships, and – who knows? – maybe even a few places in hell.Harjinderbroke a long silenceon the eve of this report’s publication. “I just want everyone to know the impact, what’s happened to us all,” he said. “But I also need someone to be punished and let them go to prison and feel like what we’ve been through.” Quite so. But do “someones” like that go to prison – or is it only people like Harjinder Butoy who do? That is the key question which remains, and no country where the little people pay for the sins of the bigwigs should ever consider itself properly civilised. Compensation should be full and fair – but so should justice.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPost Office Horizon scandalOpinionPost OfficecommentShareReuse this content"

A middle-aged couple, brutally down on their luck after bankruptcy and a terminal diagnosis, escape their troubles on an epic walk round the South West Coast Path, finding comfort along the way in the kindness of strangers. Billed as an “honest and life-affirming” story of prevailing against the odds, The Salt Path became first a bestseller and then a blockbuster film, starring a windswept Gillian Anderson. Though it was never really my thing, I knew plenty of people for whom The Salt Path genuinely resonated, with its romantic central theme of being (as the film’s director, Marianne Elliott, put it) “reformed by the elements” of a blustery English seascape.If it seemed a bit unlikely that a dying man could be rejuvenated by a strenuous trek involving wild camping in all weathers – well, getting readers to suspend their disbelief is what good storytellers do, and The Salt Path’sRaynor Winnwas definitely good. Arguably, as I said, too good.For according toa jaw-dropping accountin the Observer, she and her husband Moth are also known as Sally and Tim Walker, a couple who lost their family home in allegedly verydifferent circumstances. In the book, they’re left homeless when a good-faith investment in a friend’s business goes bad. In the version pieced together by the newspaper, she was accused of embezzling money from the small business for which she worked as a bookkeeper: to make good the missing cash, the couple allegedly took a loan from a relative secured against their house, only to lose the property when the loan was called in. (Though even then, according to the Observer, they still owned a tumbledown wreck in France.)Medical experts interviewed by the paper further cast doubt on the idea of Moth/Tim reportedly living for 12 years with corticobasal syndrome, a rare and disabling brain condition normally fatal within six to eight years. Of all the allegations against the couple, perhaps the most serious is that of potentially giving false hope to other sufferers that they too could be miraculously revived by lacing up their walking boots. But since memoir depends above all on authenticity, on the promise of something raw and real, even the smallest suspicion that events may have been rather more artfully curated feels like betrayal.In a statement, Raynor Winn called the Observer article “highly misleading”, adding: “We are taking legal advice and won’t be making any further comment at this time. The Salt Path lays bare the physical and spiritual journey Moth and I shared, an experience that transformed us completely and altered the course of our lives. This is the true story of our journey.”Whatever the facts here, hers isn’t the first memoir to be accused of embellishment and is unlikely to be the last, given boundless public appetite for genuinely extraordinary “emotional journeys” – the true stock of which is by definition limited. While the publishing industry evidently has questions to answer about due diligence, the more intriguing puzzle is why readers are still so keen to believe in them.Author of bestselling memoir The Salt Path accused of lyingRead moreThe idea of physically travelling, only to find yourself at the end of the path, is as old as human storytelling. But the 21st-century twist on it is that unlike the Odysseys and Iliads of the past, the narrators of these epic wanderings are now usually female, setting out less to slay Minotaurs than to wrestle with emotional traumas. If the Observer is right, perhaps this one should have been read all along as a modern myth: one where everyone accepts that the Minotaurs aren’t strictly real, but some readers nonetheless desperately need to see them comfortingly slain.The Salt Path’s reassuring hook wasn’t just the idea of overcoming seemingly impossible adversity, but ofhowthe Winns/Walkers did it – thanks supposedly to the healing powers of nature, the kindness of people who took pity on them and ultimately a book-buying community who helped them spin disaster into box-office gold.Perhaps it rang particularly true in the aftermath of a pandemic, when many people found solace in both long lonely walks and in the idea that even when terribly isolated they could still be part of something bigger. But for whatever reason, the story met an all-consuming need for hope. Don’t be surprised if the market for journeys of self-discovery endures, no matter what is found at the end of this one.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So why is she the only one in prison?Arwa MahdawiThis weekend, the Trump administration officially closed the file on the notorious billionaire Epstein. Maga aren’t the only ones who should be outragedTue 8 Jul 2025 12.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareGreat news, everyone! We can all stop thinking about Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged with the sex trafficking of minors in 2019 andfound dead in his Manhattan jail cellshortly after, apparently of suicide. Great minds have looked into the case and discovered there is nothing more to uncover. So don’t waste your time wondering which powerful people might have been part of Epstein’s alleged trafficking operation. There’s nothing to see here – nothing at all. Case officially closed.That, in essence, was the message from the Trump administration over the weekend. On Sunday,Axios reportedon a memo from Trump’s justice department and the FBI that concluded there is no evidence that Epstein was involved in blackmailing people, kept a “client list” or was murdered. Most importantly, the memo said there is no “evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties”.This is a big deal because Trump and his lackeys have spent a lot of time and energy dangling Epstein-related conspiracy bait in front of their base, constantly insinuating that they’re on the verge of revealing the shocking truth about Epstein’s network of elite predators. When asked about an Epstein client list (the one that the new memo says is nonexistent) during a February appearance on Fox News, the US attorney general Pam Bondi said: “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.” Shortly after that interview therewas a big to-dowhere Epstein-obsessed Maga influencers were invited to the White House and given binders titled the Epstein Files, full of information that Bondi promised “will make you sick”. Shock horror, there was nothing new or notable in those binders and Maga had a meltdown.Now, a second Epstein-induced meltdown is in full swing. Elon Musk, who is back to publicly fighting with Trump, and has threatened tostart a new political party, has beenfiring off jabsabout the justice department’s Epstein U-turn. On Monday, Musk, who previously accused Trump of being in the Epstein Files,retweeted a postby a woman called Sarah Fields that said: “If the entire government is protecting paedophiles, it has officially become the government against the people.” Bit late figuring out the Trump administration doesn’t work for “the people” – but hey, welcome to the resistance, Elon!The conservative activist Robby Starbuck is also fuming. “Pam Bondi said the Epstein client list was on her desk to review for release to the public just a few months ago,” Starbuck tweeted. “Now the DOJ she leads claims that there’s no Epstein client list. Sorry but this is unacceptable …We deserve answers.”It’s always fun when theMaga crowdrealise what the people they propelled into power are really like. But why are rightwing voices the loudest on this topic? Starbuck is right that the current situation is unacceptable:everyoneshould be demanding more answers about Epstein. Everyone should be outraged that there is only one person, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has actually faced justice in what was, by all accounts, a vast trafficking operation. Some people have paid in other ways – in 2023 Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75m (£60m) to settle a lawsuitbrought by a group of womenwho accused it of helping facilitate Epstein’s operations – but Maxwell is the only person to have got prison time.There are, it should be said, a lot of ridiculous Epstein-related conspiracy theories circulating. Those obviously should not be indulged. But I’ll tell you what is not a conspiracy: the fact that there are a lot of high-status people who are very interested in covering up their association with the disgraced financier. It is not a conspiracy to say the US has a two-tier justice system where rich and powerful people can do terrible things and face no consequences.Earlier this year, Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent Epstein victims,died of suicide. She was thethird Epstein accuserwho is reported to have died of suicide or a drug overdose. Epstein destroyed countless lives. And he didn’t do it alone: he was enabled by “respectable” people who actively facilitated his crimes. And, more broadly, he was enabled by people who looked the other way, who helped whitewash his reputation, who hobnobbed with him in high society. Those people are still out there, living their best lives. And it is looking increasingly likely they will never be held accountable.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We could do with more like that nowTue 8 Jul 2025 11.13 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 11.20 EDTShareThe word “icon” is perhaps thrown around rather liberally in the lexicon of memorial. But in the realm of Tory politics, Norman Tebbit,whose death was announced today, was an icon – the politician who perhaps came closest, save of course for the Iron Lady herself, to embodying the phenomenon of Thatcherism.Why? He was not cast in the grouse-moor mould of the Harold Macmillan era, to be sure; but nor was Edward Heath, and little affection won he by that. (Nor, indeed, wasMargaret Thatcher.)There was, perhaps, a degree of exoticism about his working-class background in the front rank of Tory politics in what was a much more class-conscious era.But Tebbit was no exotic pet, and nor would he have made such an impression on the public consciousness had he been so. Rather, he managed to personally embody a deeper, seismic shift in British politics: the Conservative party’s decisive, and enormously successful, play for a large slice of the working-class vote.It is the nature of revolutionary myth-making to sometimes overstate a transformation. Working-class Toryism long predates Thatcherism, be that its Protestant and Unionist manifestations in Ulster, Scotland, and Liverpool or the more widespread tendency, noted by George Dangerfield in his 1935 classic The Strange Death of Liberal England, for working men to support the party that had no time for teetotalism.But while the nation’s pubs might once have been a “chain of political fortresses” for the party of Lord Salisbury, one can only imagine what he would have made of a working-class man serving as chairman of the Conservative and Unionist party. But then, ironically, a facility for evolution has always (until recently) been the party’s strongest suit.Yet personally embodying a change is not enough to make an icon. Alone it produces at best a totem, or perhaps that should be a token; a passive object to be hoisted aloft to signal the party’s adaptation to changing times.No, what made Tebbit an icon was that he believed in that change and he fought for it. He was a fighter, at a point when the party needed fighters, a true believer in what was in its early years a deeply uncertain revolution, and a bulwark for his leader against the forces of genteel reaction that would certainly, had the opportunity presented itself, have ditched her and her experiment alike.It would be an ugly politics that comprised solely each side’s furious partisans. But it would be a very hollow politics that made space only for conciliators. There is an easy route to a faction’s heart for a politician willing and able to be their tribune of the plebs, but that doesn’t mean the job can’t be well and honourably done, and Tebbit did it honourably and well.The latter is best illustrated by his star turns on the conference platform. Obviously, there was his (in)famous comment aboutgetting on one’s bike and looking for work. But more significant, in light of subsequent events, must be his call-and-response routine at the 1992 conference.“Do you want to be part of a European union?”, he asked the hall; the “NO!” all but took the roof off. All this infuriated John Major, of course; one wonders if either seriously thought they would both live to see Britain leave it.Tebbit paid a heavier price than most for his frontline political career; theBrighton bombingsaw him trapped under the rubble for an hour and, much more seriously, paralysed his wife, Margaret, for whom he subsequently cared. But like the true believer he was, he remained involved in the party and what became the Eurosceptic cause. He also managed a decade in the spotlight without acquiring airs and graces, and in the digital age proved more than willing to wade into the comments beneath his Telegraph blog and have it out with all and sundry.Courage, energy, authenticity – these Tebbit had in spades, and they are the things of which political icons are made.One might quibble that my definition makes little reference to the actual content of Tebbit’s beliefs. But that is deliberate. He certainly held many views with which readers of this newspaper would profoundly disagree, then and now, and his views on social issues were wildly out of step with modern society.But an icon is not a hero, except perhaps in the Greek sense; recognising one does not require agreeing with all or even any of what they stand for. Every movement will have its own icons, and one of democracy’s great strengths – or indeed, basic requirements – is recognising that there is space in public life for more than one.In fact, as a Conservative, it does with hindsight seem to have been a stronger, more vital Conservative party whose chairman was a substantial figure who could, occasionally, embarrass the leader.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old Black nurse and mother, was declared brain dead in February after blood clots formed in her brain.Legally, and by all meaningful measures, she was dead then: the woman who loved her family, laughed with her friends, comforted her son, helped her colleagues and cared for her patients was gone then, and was never coming back. But the state of Georgia, and the administrators of the hospital where she was declared dead, kept her corpse in a state of artificial animation for months. That’s because when Smith went to the hospital in February complaining of a headache, and later became unresponsive, she was about eight weeks pregnant. According to her family, doctors at Emory hospital, in Georgia, told the family that the state’s abortion ban required them to maintain the regimen that falsely animated their daughter’s corpse so that the fetus inside her could continue to grow.TheGeorgiastate attorney general denies that the state’s abortion ban required this abuse of Smiths’s body. But other supporters of the law disagree. The result, either way, was the same: in deference to a law that created genuine ambiguity about what freedoms Smith’s doctors and family had in the wake of her death, a woman who did nothing other than be pregnant was denied the right to rest in peace.Women of West Virginia: inform on yourself to the miscarriage police! | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBrain death is distinct from a vegetative state or a coma; it is the complete and permanent loss of the function of the entire brain, including the loss of the function of the brain stem, which is needed for basic organ functions like the reflexive intake of breath and the beating of the heart. There is no chance of recovery; usually, the invasive life support required to sustain the body of a brain dead patient is administered only long enough for the patient’s family to say goodbye. That’s because what life support does to a patient’s body, in addition to being medically futile, is also extreme and invasive. The artificial ventilator that acts as a bellows, pushing air in and out of the dead lungs, involves tubes inserted through the nose and throat, extending into the stomach and windpipe.These tubes, in Smith’s case, were tools of the state, extending the force of the law into the inside of her corpse. It was the state, via these machines, that pumped her heart, contracted her lungs, and pushed blood into the dead tissues of her body, so that cells could continue dividing inside her uterus. It was the state that used these machines to desecrate Smith’s corpse – to turn it from the vessel for a beautiful person, the nurse and mother, into an object that symbolized women’s degradation and Smith’s disposability. What should have been a respected artifact of a loved person became a macabre marionette, pushed and pulled by a state apparatus that sees all women’s bodies as mere means to its own ends.Last month, the fetus was cut out of her corpse prematurely; presumably, doctors did not think that the dead body could sustain a pregnancy any longer. Physicians working on Smith’s case told her family that as a result of gestating inside a dead uterus, the resulting child could experience health complications ranging from blindness to the inability to walk. The infant that was extracted from the dead woman, a baby boy, weighs less than 2lbs, and is currently in neonatal intensive care. The family has named him Chance.The desecration of Smith’s corpse by Emory University hospital and the state of Georgia is a grim reminder of how little women’s personhood is esteemed in post-Dobbs America. But Adriana is not the first woman to have her dead body abused this way. In 2013, a 33-year-old Texas woman, Marlise Muñoz, was declared brain dead after suffering a pulmonary embolism. Because she was 14 weeks pregnant,the hospital arguedthat the state of Texas required her to be kept on life support, solely so that her corpse could be used to continue the cultivation of the fetus. Her husband, Erick,sued to have her removedfrom life support so that he could bury his wife and grieve in peace; still, the hospital artificially animated her corpse until a judge ordered them to stop. Marlise’s family would tell reporters that as they visited her body in the hospital, theycould smellher flesh decaying.There is something particularly unsettling about seeing a corpse: the absence of the person who was once there is so conspicuous that it makes the body uncanny. That the body is not the person becomes clear the moment you see a body without a human person in it. And yet the body is the instrument and vessel of the person who animates it, and as such it commands to be treated with dignity, with a kind of reverence, with the respect you would give to a human being.Abortionbans disregard this: they appropriate the body for the ends of the state, indifferent to the will or the dignity of the person who lives in it. Rape functions this way, too – using a body for an end, without deferring to the person who inhabits it. In both cases – rape and abortion bans – the body of a living person is reduced to an instrument for someone else’s use. That contrast – between the dignity that a human being’s body demands and the instrumentalization with which it is treated – is what supplies abortion bans and sexual violence with their moral horror. They treat living people as mere objects. In that sense, a corpse might be the perfect vehicle for the anti-abortion movement’s agenda: it is a female instrument without the annoying encumbrance of a female person.But Adriana Smith was a person; so was Marlise Muñoz. They were not objects, or instruments; they were people endowed with dignity and rights. In life and in death, they deserved better.

Whichever way ministers jump, it would be a good moment to update consumers on the outlook for their bills in the “sprint” to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2030. Does the government still think cleaner energy means cheaper energy? If so, when and how?It deserves an answer for two reasons. First, because the costs of turning down gas-fired generation in favour of renewables are clearer than a year ago – and current trends, sadly, are not encouraging. Second, because promising consumers “up to £300” off their bills by 2030 via clean energy, as Keir Starmer and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband,have done, risks handing a political gift to anti-net zero opponents if the savings do not materialise.That is not to dispute the need to decarbonise the grid. More wind, solar, batteries and interconnectors are the only way to reduce emissions across the whole economy. For the government, there is an extra incentive to protect itself against the risk of a 2022-style rise in the price of gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Treasury could ill afford to subsidise household bills again, given the fragile public finances.‘The bubble had to burst’: the inside story of the Lindsey oil refinery collapseRead moreBut the government’s claims about clean energy tend to go further. The promise, as conveyed by the £300 pledge, is that we can also save money on the way to 2030. Really? The gas price is back at its 10-year average in real terms, while renewables have lost the financing whoosh they enjoyed from ultra-low interest rates. It becomes harder to see how a £200bn five-year transition from dirty but reliable fossil fuels to a cleaner but more complex intermittent system can be costless for consumers.“I fully support the move to a cleaner energy system,” wrote Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas-owning Centrica,on LinkedIn a few weeks ago, before tackling the “confusion” over whether renewables will bring down energy prices from where they are now: “The build out of renewables will not materially reduce UK electricity prices from current levels. They may give price stability, and avoid future price spikes based on the international gas market, but they will definitely not reduce the price.”His point is that there is now little difference between the average wholesale price of electricity, which is usually set by gas-fired plants, and the prices to be paid to offshore wind developers whose projects won contracts-for-difference (CfDs) in last year’s auction.CfDs are the price-guarantee mechanism, funded by bill payers, that encourages developers to build. Projects get the “strike” price for their electricity regardless of the wholesale price. Last year’s CfDs for fixed offshore wind, viewed as “the bedrock” of a cleaned-up system, were priced at £76-£82 in 2024 money, which at the top end is the same as the average wholesale price of electricity over the past year.O’Shea could have added the qualification that CfDs only last for 15 years, so there could be gains when the subsidies eventually fall away. In terms of 2030, however, that moment is over the horizon. Today’s outlook is not the happy world of 2022 when CfDs for offshore wind arrived at £53.50 (in today’s money) and the turbines could legitimately be said to be outcompeting gas.Thus the outcome of the next auctions for renewables projects is critical. Vallorii, an Oxford-based financial risk-modelling company, estimates that CfDs for offshore wind will be up again to £90-£111 a megawatt hour (in today’s money) in this year’s auction – well above current wholesale prices. That is even if the government doesn’t adopt zonal pricing – the proposal that Great Britain’s electricity market should be split into regions with prices set by local supply and demand – which could inflate numbers further.We’ll see what the auction produces, but Vallorii’s projection is credible for the reasons it gives. There are bottlenecks in supply chains, as evidenced by the Danish company Ørstedstopping work on its giant Hornsea 4 windfarmbecause it couldn’t make the numbers add up even with a 2024-vintage CfD.Windfarms are also capital-intensive schemes where borrowing costs make a huge difference: we are not in the 2022 era of ultra-cheap money. That may be why the energy department is flirting with the idea of extending this year’s CfD contracts to 20 years in the hope of reducing the headline rate, albeit at the cost of locking it up for longer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ofgem last weekbacked £24bn of spending on gas and electricity networksas the first part of a package that, for electricity alone, will reach £80bn over five years. That will add £104 to annual network charges on bills, the regulator said, although it also offered a net figure of £24 that includes the savings from keeping a lid on “balancing costs”, meaning costs associated with paying windfarms (usually in Scotland) not to generate when the system is overloaded.Even with the investment in new transmission capacity, however, such balancing costs are still projected to increase from£2.7bn last yearto £4bn in 2030 – and that assumes the new high-voltage infrastructure arrives on time.Such a system-wide perspective – counting all the costs and levies, rather than focusing narrowly on renewables’ undoubted ability to reduce wholesale prices – is how energy analysts tend to look at transformation.Three conclusions from AuroraEnergyResearch’s modelling earlier this year stand out. First, CfD clearing prices are key. Second, the high upfront cost of renewables means building a clean power system is always sensitive to changes in the cost of capital. Third – and critically – “due to the long lead times on energy infrastructure, a clean power system would only start saving bill payers from 2044”.That assessment sounds uncomfortably like the reality. Overhauling a system that was largely built and designed in the 1950s and 1960s is a huge undertaking. It should not be surprising if the benefits in bills take ages to emerge. To repeat, that is not an argument against rolling out renewables. But it is a reason to be honest about costs, uncertainties, the effect of interest rates and bond yields andthe inevitable trade-offs that come with tight deadlines. Clean power is not a free lunch.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryNils Pratley on financeEnergyWind powerRenewable energycommentShareReuse this content"

It will change Britain’s futurePolly ToynbeeSure Start was New Labour’s finest achievement, and the Tories destroyed it. Now it’s back with a mission to put children at the heart of everythingTue 8 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 09.15 EDTShareThey hunt high and low for Labour’s missing message, vision, purpose or identity. Well, here it is, where it always was, in the future of children. It’s what Labour does best, what it is for: building a society where children come first and everything else falls into place. The foundations have now been laid by Bridget Phillipson by finallybringing back Sure Startto England – the most successful achievement of the last Labour government – now rebranded as Best Start family hubs.It’s a pity about the new name, but young parents recognise “hubs”, whereas Sure Start is largely gone and forgotten. Its uprooting began the day Michael Gove arrived as education secretary in 2010. He entered the “Department for Children, Schools and Families” – a name chosen to reflect the awareness that children don’t learn without wraparound care for their whole lives – and replaced it with the Gradgrind “Department for Education”. Family stuff was flimflam, distracting from rote learning, and arts, music, drama and sports were expunged from hisEbacc’s core subjects.Labour’s identity and purpose is captured in Best Start’s view of what makes children thrive. In a short time Phillipson will be rolling out across England free universal breakfast clubs,300 nurseriesin primary schools, nurseries for babies from nine months old, and 30 hours a week free childcare for preschool children in September. That’s a blessing for working parents, but its prime purpose is infant education, where most good is done for life chances. A new database will nowlink all hub servicesto Wes Streeting’s new neighbourhood health centres, helping to identify vulnerable children.Labour vows to protect Sure Start-type system from any future Reform assaultRead moreLabour pledges £1.5bn over three years tofund 1,000 family hubs– at least one in every council in England. Councils, even those run by Reform UK, will be forced to use this money on Best Starts. More hubs will follow in the next spending round: it took 10 years to establish Sure Start, and even then many of the 3,600 centres were still in their early phases, not yet offering all the health visitors, midwives, speech and language therapy, children’s mental health services, parental support, employment, debt and addiction support and many other services. Sadly, some beautiful, purpose-built centres were sold off in post-2010 vandalism. When fully functioning, they were life-changing:Angela Rayner speaks for manywhen she talks emotionally about how a Sure Start course taught her as a teenage mother to hug and read to her son, breaking a generational cycle. This time, Labour says it is determined to cement Best Start into the national psyche, making it as untouchable as the NHS, so it is unthinkable for future governments to wreck it again.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), monitoringSure Start’s lasting effects, finds that those living near a Sure Start centre in their early years “performed significantly better in assessments at ages 7, 11 and 16”, and achieved better GCSE results. At 15 they had 15% fewer absences from school. Sure Start children had many fewer hospitalisations, with fewer injuries and poisonings, “likelyreflecting improved safetyin the home environment”, and “an improvement in family functioning”. Teenagers suffered fewer depressive and anxiety disorders, while 12- to 14-year-olds had 50% fewer mental health hospitalisations.Because they caught problems early, fewer Sure Start children needed Send plans in school. This research raises hopes that Best Start will lead to fewer children needing education, health and care plans (EHCPs). But, unlike with the disastrous plans to cut disability benefits, Labour should wait for the plan to succeed and for the need to drop naturally, and not cut support first.Here’s why this is being positioned as the emblem of Labour’s prime purpose: Sure Start reduced inequalities, and was the best way to improve outcomes for the most disadvantaged. These children would, the IFS calculates, earn £11 more for every £1 of Sure Start investment, while the state would gain £5.5.bn for the £2.5bn cost. Here’s the IFS’s conclusion. “The impacts of Sure Start wereremarkably long lasting.” And those effects may be even stronger than can be proved, since inadequate data means all children living near a Sure Start centre were counted as benefiting, including those with no contact, diluting the results.For those who seek a definingLabourproject, this is it. Best Start hubs must be the flagship for future spending – the roots of a better society. Imagine if Sure Start had flourished and grown over the past 14 years, and if each cohort of children year after year had emerged better, instead of falling back.Phillipson revealed the cost of backsliding ina speech in Sunderlandlast week. The social gap between children arriving at primary school widened in the Tory years: a quarter are not fully toilet trained, a third can’t follow instructions, half can’t sit still, and reception teachers lose two and half hours a day catching these children up, to the detriment of the rest. That disadvantage gap at five years old is still there at 16. As Best Start begins the repairs, it should start by including left-out two-year-olds with unemployed parents – the most deprived, who for bizarre reasons arecurrently deniedfull-time nursery.After disability benefits, is Labour really about to target the educational rights of special needs children? | John HarrisRead moreBest Start alone is not enough. The cardinal pledge is that child poverty will fall steeply by the next election, as it has under every Labour government: Rachel Reeves and other ministers confirm this whenever they are asked. I am convinced that the child poverty taskforce led by Phillipson and Liz Kendall, reporting in the autumn, will remove the two-child benefit cap. Ignore the revengeful, anonymous No 10 briefer who taunted benefit rebels by saying that plans to remove the cap were “dead in the water”. Phillipsonadmitsthe expensive welfare U-turn makes it harder, but I can’t see the cap surviving. Counter-briefings I have heard say it is unthinkable that the taskforce will leave it in place. Listen when she says her “driving mission” is to “break the link between [a child’s] background and what they go on to achieve”. How else would that be achieved?The way forward is clear: Starmer and Reeves must make Best Start core to every speech they give. Children come first, in everything. Triple-locked pensions, social care and even the NHS must give way to children. The children’s commissioner for England today reports that “children are living in ‘Dickensian levels’ of poverty”. Neil Kinnock hasa suggestion: raise the money from the very richest. A 2% wealth tax on those who have £10m or more would yield £24bn – a plan that getsstrong supportfrom three-quarters of voters.Pain and political trouble beckon at the next budget. It’s time for this government to do something popular: pay for children’s future with the proceeds of past inequality.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionWelfareLabourBridget PhillipsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Words matterTue 8 Jul 2025 14.13 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareVisiting Washington, Benjamin Netanyahu delighted in telling Donald Trump that he hadnominated himfor the Nobel peace prize. The Israeli prime minister cited Mr Trump’s efforts to end conflicts in the Middle East. But in truth he is grateful to the US president for joining his war against Iran last month and for allowing carnage in Gaza to continue after a brief pause. He is also eager that the US president does not strong‑arm him into another ceasefire. Perhaps the indirect talksbetween Hamas and Israelin Qatar will reach a temporary deal again, with hostages released and possibly more aid allowed in. Even so, few expect that a lasting peace would result.Words matter. They have become so detached from reality when it comes to Israel’s war in Gaza that it is not merely absurd, or despicable, but obscene. The defence minister, Israel Katz, has laid out plans for a “humanitarian city”: this meansforcing all Palestinians in Gaza into a campthat the military would bar them from leaving. Prof Amos Goldberg, a historian of the Holocaust, used the accurate words: it would be “a concentration camp or a transit camp for Palestinians before they expel them”. The “emigration plan” which Mr Katz says “will happen”,according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, is in fact an ethnic cleansing plan. No departure can be considered voluntary when the alternative is starvation or indefinite imprisonment in inhuman conditions.Some think the proposal is a political gambit. Perhaps. Israel has yet to find countries prepared to take Palestinians. Yet it is laid out not even by extremist coalition partners whom Mr Netanyahu wants to keep on board, but by a man whose position gives him the authority to carry it out – even if the military has qualms.Ideas previously seen as unfeasible and unconscionable have already become reality. The “humanitarian distribution” system run by the privateGaza Humanitarian Foundationsummons starving Palestinians into a death trap; hundreds have been killed. Soldiers near the hubs have told journalists thatthey were ordered to shootat unarmed Palestinians who pose no threat – a war crime. (The Israeli government called the allegations “blood libels”.) The IDF says it attempts to minimise civilian casualties. But most of the tens of thousands who have died are women and children. Israel has killed hundreds of medical workers: another war crime.Words matter. When South Africa took its genocide case to the international criminal court, many resisted that description. Far fewer do so now. The legal bar is extraordinarily high. But signatories to thegenocideconvention are required to prevent it, and the US has declared genocides four times in the last decade. Destroying Palestinians’ means of survival, planning the removal of Gaza’s population and envisioning its outright destruction are surely not merely brutal acts but ones committed with “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” – the definition of genocide in the UN convention.Israel’s rhetoric aims to obscure the horror, and allowthose who are complicit, including the UK, to distance themselves. Leaders must face the facts. EU ministers will next week consider the internal review of the bloc’s trade agreement with Israel. They shouldfollow throughwith action. If he wants a Nobel, Mr Trump should insist on a peace that truly means peace, instead of being dazzled by the mirage of a riviera built in Gaza’s ruins.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Over two decades, Britain’s Post Office prosecuted its own subpostmasters for crimes they hadnot committed, based on the say-so of a computer system called Horizon. The software, developed by Fujitsu, and rolled out from the late 1990s onwards, was riddled with faults. But these were not treated as glitches. They were treated as evidence of dishonesty.Thepublic inquiryinto the Post Office IT Horizon scandal, seen as one of the worst miscarriages of justice, began in2021. In a searing 162-page first volume its chair – the retired judge Sir Wyn Williams – laid bare the human toll, and the often sluggish, inadequate attempts to put things right. Between 1999 and 2015, nearly 1,000 people were prosecuted – and convicted – using data from the flawed Horizon system. Some were jailed. At least 13 may have killed themselves. Many more were ruined – wrongly imprisoned and bankrupted with their health and reputation shredded. The report makes clear: this was not a technical slip. It was a systemic failure that destroyed lives – and one that the Post Office let happen.Sir Wyn can’tassignlegal guilt, but he leaves no doubt about blame. Victims, he writes, suffered “wholly unacceptable behaviour” at the hands of “the Post Office and Fujitsu”. Post Office executives and Fujitsu staff knew early on that Horizon was faulty. Still, prosecutions went ahead. Unreliable data was used to discipline, sack and jail subpostmasters. Complaints were brushed aside. Shortfalls were assumed to be theft. Victims were isolated and disbelieved.Compensationschemes have followed, but these too have been marked by delay, confusion and red tape. Sir Wyn criticises all three of the major schemes as failing to deliver “full and fair” redress – and retraumatising many victims. He calls for clearer definitions, swifter payments and a permanent public body to handle compensation for people harmed by state wrongdoing. The judge says there are about 10,000 eligible claimants for financial redress.It seems astonishing that it took atelevision dramaabout the scandal to move the government to act. The judge concurs with a barrister acting for the victims who noted that “until a change in political momentum in January 2024, behind the scenes an overly legalistic, slow and potentially obstructive attitude operated to constrain the amounts of compensation paid”.Sir Wyn also proposesrestorative justice: not only money, but acknowledgment. How this is framed has yet to be determined. But there seems much to be gained from public apologies and human understanding. There must be a moral reckoning with the damage caused.This isn’t the end – more volumes will follow – but even this first report reveals something badly broken in British public life. The real failure wasn’t tech, but people and institutions. The government-owned Post Office, once a trusted part of society, emerges as secretive, punitive and unwilling to admit fault. It failed its reputation for being a pillar of civic life. It was, instead, the state that Nietzsche warned of – the “coldest of all cold monsters” – wearing the people’s face, but turning on them with indifference. The question now is not whether this happened, but what a country should do when it learns what it allowed to happen.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He only flew in from a Brazilian beach last week, does not look any the worse for it and has already paid back a significant chunk of his £60m transfer fee after blasting Chelsea into the final of theClub World Cupwith two brutal finishes against his boyhood club.This was a scintillating way for one of the newest faces in Enzo Maresca’s attack to mark his full debut.Fluminensemade João Pedro but the Brazilians were broken by one of their own in the heat of New Jersey and could have no complaints about going out. Chelsea were much the better team during a one-sided semi-final, even if they were complaints about the reversal of a first-half penalty awarded after an inadvertent handball by Trevoh Chalobah, and will probably not be worrying about fatigue affecting their Premier League campaign given that the financial rewards of their time in the US have been accompanied by sporting benefits.‘Something to be proud of’: Maresca delighted as Chelsea reach Club World Cup finalRead moreA kind draw has not come without complications, allowing this young side to build on the momentum generated by qualifying for the Champions League andwinning the Conference Leaguelast season. Chelsea feel they are growing. They will also be encouraged by João Pedro’s willingness to put his foot through the ball demonstrating that he will add more than guile and craft against deep defences after joining from Brighton.Worrying times for Nicolas Jackson, then? He has barely featured since his red card against Flamengo last month and was overlooked again with Liam Delap serving a one-game ban. There was a late runout for Jackson here but his rawness was evident when he slashed wide when through on goal. He has to respond to the challenge posed by Delap and João Pedro. OtherwiseChelseawill not be afraid to move on.For now, of course, thoughts turn to their return to the MetLife Stadium to face Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday’s final. This is a quirky event, to put it kindly, and there is something faintly amusing about the fourth-best team in England being one win away from being crowned world champions. Chelsea keep on going, though. The transformative effect on their finances cannot be stressed enough. They have already made over £80m from making it this far – almost three Delaps – and will be approaching £100m if they lift the trophy.A concern for Maresca will be whether Moisés Caicedo will be fit for the final after the influential midfielder twisted an ankle during the closing stages. Caicedo tried to play on but the pain was too much. Losing him would be a big blow, particularly with Roméo Lavia and Dário Essugo both missing here.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro (top right) watches as his curling shot finds the top corner to open the scoring.Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty ImagesBut an all-European final beckons. Chelsea, who were also without Levi Colwill in defence, dealt with temperatures hitting 35C at kick-off and pushed Fluminense back from the start. The Brazilians are the oldest team in the tournament and had more problems with the heat.The composition of Chelsea’s attack was intriguing. There was no place for Noni Madueke, who continues to be linked with Arsenal. Pedro Neto switched to the left and Christopher Nkunku, who is playing with renewed purpose, caused problems by drifting in from the right.It was not a surprise when Chelsea went ahead thanks to an error from Thiago Silva in the 18th minute. The former Chelsea centre-back was too casual when he cleared a cross from Neto. The ball fell to João Pedro, who did not hesitate to punish his former club. There was no celebration from the 23-year-old but nor was there any mercy. Having showcased his link-up play during his cameo against Palmeiras, this time he set himself and ripped a dipping, swerving shot past Fábio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their intensity dipped before half-time and Fluminense stirred. Marc Cucurella cleared off the line from Hércules. Chalobah had a let-off after handling a cross. The French referee, François Letexier, overturned his decision to award a penalty after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor.Fluminense refused to give in. They made attacking changes at the start of the second half and almost equalised when Everaldo shot straight at Robert Sánchez moments after coming on. But there was more space for Chelsea on the break. They countered through Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernández, who released João Pedro with a superb pass.The Brazilian still had a lot to do. He made it look easy. This time João Pedro cut inside, opened up his body and used his right foot to send a rising drive in off the underside of the bar.Chelsea continued to dominate, Nkunku twice going close.

The applause was polite, acknowledging a sporting contest had taken place, even if it had not been competitive. The whoops were a little performative. Britain’s last remaining singles hope at these Championships, Cameron Norrie, had been outclassed by a purring Carlos Alcaraz6-2, 6-3, 6-3.Alcaraz, the reigning men’s champion, had whipped through the match, whipped forehand winner after forehand winner, and whipped his opponent into meek submission. It had been so tough for Norrie that he had felt the need to fist-pump simply for holding points on his serve. This is where the whoops came in; the crowd’s own attempt to find encouragement where it could.Carlos Alcaraz swats aside Cameron Norrie to storm into Wimbledon semi-finalsRead moreQuarter-finals with a British interest are far from a given atWimbledon. The decade between 2008 and 2017, when Andy Murray never went home before the final eight, is a glaring anomaly in the men’s game. Equally exceptional were the successes of Virginia Wade in the 1970s. This was only the fifth quarter-final to feature a home competitor in the past decade and the unspectacular Norrie, born in South Africa and raised in New Zealand, is not someone who can easily be described as a fan favourite.So it was a big match, but not as big as it could have been and this perhaps was reflected around the showpiece court. Half empty as the match got under way, albeit with British theatrical titans Sir Ian McKellen, Mark Rylance and Richard E Grant in their seats throughout, the ground filled up but the atmosphere never took off. Were the crowd cheering for an underdog victory, or applauding the effort of an emerging titan of the modern game? In the end it was a bit of both and neither.A raucous home crowd would probably have had no effect on the outcome of the match, unless it was to inspire Alcaraz to higher levels than those he deemed necessary to win. Even in the first game of the match, in which Norrie valiantly held serve, the No 2 seed pummelled the Briton with power and placement. One of Norrie’s key strengths are on the defensive, with a tigerish ability to chase down angles and take the speed out of dangerous play. But it was clear from the off that these tools, effective in the tournament to this point and in his run to the semi-finals in 2022, were not going to work here.Alcaraz was typically considerate in his post-match remarks on court, declaring Norrie a “really difficult” opponent. “I am really happy,” the 22-year-old said. “To be able to play another semi-final here at Wimbledon is really special. I want to go as far as I can and I am really happy with the level I played today against a really difficult player like Cam. He is an amazing guy. No one works harder than him and it is nice to see him fighting for great things.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz dominated the play against Britain’s Cameron Norrie.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAlcaraz was right, there was no doubting Norrie’s work ethic, at least in the first two sets when the writing was only being daubed on the wall. But the limits of his ability against the top players was clear. This was more like a British Wimbledon encounter in the years pre-Murray, such was the imbalance on court, but this is 2025 and expectations have long been revised upwards. Jack Draper, the British No 1 and another player to have exited meekly from the tournament this year, wondered out loud “How did Andy Murray do it?” after his second-round defeat. This question will surely come into sharper focus by the time the Championship comes around next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Spaniard does not yet have his supporter army, like the omnipresent and slightly unsettling Nole-fam that stand foursquare behind the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic. But the 22-year-old does have the game to win the hearts of neutrals. Yes he has the 135mph aces, and the bludgeoning strokes from the back of the court that are the prerequisites for success in the hard-court age. But his love of the drop shot is something that is shared by Wimbledon aficionados too, and he also found time for some exquisite lobs in the few moments Norrie could be tempted to the net. His roar of celebration upon victory seemed pretty genuine too, and this crowd loves a fighter.Norrie will now try to take the momentum he has generated and turn it into a run at the US Open later this summer. For Alcaraz, it’s the AmericanTaylor Fritz in the semi-finalsand the ongoing shot at a threepeat. That match is scheduled for Friday, and in between Alcaraz plans to take in some sights. “I will make the most of the time with my team and family in London,” he said, further endearing himself to the crowd. “I might try to go to the city centre if I have time. What I have been doing so far has worked so we will try to switch off together.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Carlos AlcarazWimbledonTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I will do everything I can to win tomorrow. If I have to do something that is not good for Beth, then I will do it.England wildcard Michelle Agyemang in a hurry to make Euro 2025 impactRead more“I don’t think she’ll speak to me for a bit [if we win] but it’s tough. I also have some of my best friends on that [England] team. It’s part of football. It’s part of the game. I’ve probably been on the other end of it [more, losing]. I’ll be happy for us if we get through tomorrow.“We both know what we’re going through. It’s a very important tournament. Our golden rule is we do not discuss anything [pre-match]. I don’t know whether she’ll be starting tomorrow or whether she’ll be on the bench. As a Dutch player I will do everything possible to win the game.”Miedema, who scored her 100th senior international goal ina 3-0 win against Waleson Saturday, urged her Netherlands teammates to be wary of England’s threats, despite theiropening 2-1 defeat against France: “They can turn up tomorrow and be absolutely unreal so we need to be ready.”That was a sentiment echoed by the Netherlands head coach,Andries Jonker, who played down the significance of England having been beaten by France, saying: “In the first 20 minutes, England played very well. I’m a trainer, I look at the facts. Their second half was an even battle. The media [reaction] it’s quite dramatic. That’s not my cup of tea. But in the first 20 minutes, I saw a really good England team.”Quick GuideWiegman's England v Netherlands: previous meetingsShowThe England head coach has faced her country of birth three times since taking over the Lionesses four years ago:England 5-1 Netherlands, 24 June 2022, LeedsEngland were utterly dominant in the 5-1 win, a result that will have given them a huge confidence boost before the Euros on home soil the following month. The Dutch took an early lead at Elland Road through Lieke Martens but Lucy Bronze, Beth Mead, Lauren Hemp (2) and Ella Toone scored for England to secure a very comfortable victory. “It was a very difficult evening,” said the Netherlands coach, Mark Parsons.Netherlands 2-1 England, 26 September 2023, UtrechtWiegman was given an ovation in Utecht before the game, having been in charge of the Dutch team when they won the Euros in 2017. England were second best for most of the evening although they could count themselves unlucky as Daniëlle van de Donk was clearly offside in the buildup to the Netherlands’ first goal. Alessia Russo equalised in the second half before Renate Jansen settled the contest with a 90th-minute screamer into the top corner.England 3-2 Netherlands, 1 December 2023, London“I feel a bit strange,” Wiegman said after England had come from behind to win 3-2 after a late Toone goal. For 45 minutes at Wembley, England had looked destined to throw away their Nations League and Olympic qualifying hopes  as the visitors dominated and Lineth Beerensteyn scored twice before half-time. Georgia Stanway and  Hemp scored within a minute of each other around the hour-mark before Toone’s late intervention. The following month England beat Scotland 6-0 but lost out on a place at the 2024 Olympics for Team GB on goal difference.Nasra Abdi and Ervin AngWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England ideally need a victory to revive the defence of their European title, and the Lionesses know that – if they lose – they would be eliminated later on Wednesday night unless Wales defeat France. But their head coach, Sarina Wiegman, appeared to be embracing the pressure, saying: “Playing at this level makes it special. Playing matches like these makes it special. This is why we are doing it. These are the best matches you can possibly dream of.“We knew before the tournament it would be a tough group. You want to win but we didn’t [against France]. Now we have another game and the approach is the same. We want to win the game.”The Lionesses have not been eliminated in the group stages of any tournament since 2013 and Wiegman has reached four consecutive major tournament finals as a head coach, the first two of those coming with the Netherlands. Wiegman was also asked about the media reaction to her team’s opening defeat but said: “I don’t read the tabloids or the media. My only focus is on the team and what I have to do. Tomorrow we will start the game with the best possible gameplan and this is my only focus.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Everything also points to a possible high excess of speed over the permitted speed of the road. All the tests carried out for the moment point to the fact that the driver of the vehicle wasDiogo Jota.”The report will be handed to the court in Puebla de Sanabria, Zamora, when the investigation is completed.Jota and Silva died when the car left the A52 in north-west Spain and burst into flames. They are believed to have been heading to the northern Spanish port of Santander to take a ferry to England before Jota’s return to Liverpool for pre-season training, having been advised not to fly after Jota had a recent lung procedure. The brothers were buried in their home city of Gondomar near Porto on Saturday.Jota’s Liverpool teammates, most of whom attended the funeral, began reporting back for pre-season training on Tuesday. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson, who posted emotional tributes to their friend, were among the contingent who arrived at the Axa Training Centre for pre-season tests along with the new signing Jeremie Frimpong. Tributes to Jota were left near the players’ entrance to the training ground.Liverpool delayed the start of pre-season after Jota’s death and the full squad is not expected back until Thursday.

Not just piling on the runs, but forcing his opponents to toil in the field until they felt exhausted and out of options.That fatigue affects batters’ mental clarity and their decision-making – what to play, when to leave – as well as their movement and their footwork. Reducing England to 25 for threeat the end of the second daywent a long way to deciding the match. As well as India bowled with the new ball, it was Gill’s remorselessness that created the conditions for it to happen.Jofra Archer’s return is a risk England must take with India on the march | Ali MartinRead moreWe have to pay testament to his stamina, his skill and his hunger – not just for runs, but to set an example as the new captain of a young team. Captaincy can affect a player’s form detrimentally, but it seems to have focused him and his three highest Test scores have been made in the past three weeks.We are coming to the end of a period that has been dominated by the so-called Fab Four – Virat Kohli, Joe Root, Steve Smith and Kane Williamson – and the search has been on for players who can take over. Gill has shown he can fill those boots and in a wonderfully orthodox style: he plays all formats and is brilliantly adaptable, but with a foundation of classic technique.He has not just been making his own reputation, he is making history. No touring player has scored as many runs in a Test as the 430 at Edgbaston – only Graham Gooch against India at Lord’s, in 1990, has bettered it – and his 585 puts him 23rd on the list of highest individual tallies in Test series in England, two games in. Even Don Bradman’s world record of 974 in the 1930 Ashes looks under threat.He was given the opportunity to dictate the game because England chose to bowl first. The opportunity to stretch and tire opponents and then benefit from scoreboard pressure and fatigue, as well as the opportunity to bowl on a possibly deteriorating pitch towards the end of the game, is why people win the toss and bat. England will be reflecting on that decision as they consider ways of reducing Gill’s impact on the remainder of the series.View image in fullscreenShubman Gill made history at Edgbaston.Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty ImagesI remember Smith’s performances on the Ashes tour I went on as batting coach in 2017-18, when he scored two unbeaten centuries and a double century, ending the series with an average of 137.40. At times it felt like we just could not get him out, it was soul-destroying. He always seemed to have an answer. After a while it really does get to you and we had two very experienced frontline bowlers in Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.Gill is used to the cast of bowlers England used in the first two matches, he knows their plans, their trajectories, their variations, their pace. If fatigue was not already going to force Ben Stokes to change his bowling group, the need to find fresh ways to challenge the India captain would have done it anyway.If Chris Woakes can put himself through a third match in a row I would keep him in, because his batting could play a part.He bowled a good new-ball spellon the first day at Edgbaston when he was a bit unlucky and Lord’s is a happy hunting ground for him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBrydon Carse and Josh Tongue have been selected because they bowl with good pace, height and bounce and can present problems even on flat surfaces. They have done OK, but they have come up against top-class batting that has been ruthless – Stokes doesn’t like that word but India probably do. Now England need a point of difference: it’s going to be 30C in London, probably not great conditions for swing, and Jofra Archer has to be the man.But picking Archer, after one first-class game in four years, is a risk and with Stokes also needing to bowl in short bursts England then need a couple of people who can really put in a shift. What surprises me about their squad, aside from the three seamers who played the first two games, is the extraordinary lack of first-class overs in it: Gus Atkinson has come back in for the third Test having not played since the game against Zimbabwe in May and joins Jamie Overton, who would add extra depth to England’s batting but has played one T20 game since May and one first-class match this season.To pick either of them alongside Archer feels like a risk, particularly when it is going to be hot and dry and England have to be braced for long periods in the field.For that reason Sam Cook has to come in, though he is someone who offers control, plenty of stamina and lots of overs, but not always a cutting edge. Cook may struggle at Old Trafford and the Oval given the nature of the pitches and this could be the one where he uses the slope cleverly and bowls lots of overs. Woakes and Cook can then provide control with Archer the ace up England’s sleeve, someone fresh and fast, and something new for Gill to try to deal with.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

A squad rich in depth and top-level experience are gathering steam and look a nightmarish proposition for whoever is sent their way in the quarter-finals. They will top Group C by avoiding defeat against Germany on Saturday and, withthe obvious exception of Spain, have looked at least as convincing as anyone on show so far this summer.Make no mistake, they will have to pass far tougher tests than the obstacle posed by a limited Poland. The tournament debutants will play for pride in their meeting with Denmark and almost grasped a huge chunk of it here when Milena Kokosz cracked a stupendous strike against the post in added time. In truth, though, Sweden could have doubled their tally at a minimum. They were relentless, thrillingly so at times, and the only concern for Peter Gerhardsson may be that his players were not more clinical.Poland v Sweden: Euro 2025 – liveRead moreNot that he was too willing to voice it. “A great performance,” he said. “We scored some great goals and we created a lot of chances, and our defence was really good.” Their opponents were certainly unable to muster much of the counterattacking threat thathad occasionally flustered Germany.Poland had held the Germans at bay for more than half of their opener but that never looked remotely likely here. They could not handle Sweden’s movement and, in particular, the speed and balance of the Chelsea winger Johanna Rytting Kaneryd. Her performance on the right was a firm contender for the best individual display of the past week, an early run and cross that Kosovare Asllani headed against the crossbar setting the tone. Within 13 minutes Madelen Janogy’s effort met a similar fate and, as more opportunities came and went, it resembled a minor miracle that Poland remained unbreached towards the half-hour mark.View image in fullscreenStina Blackstenius heads home Sweden’s opening goal of the night.Photograph: Matthew Childs/ReutersThat had partly owed to a miss from Stina Blackstenius, who flashed off target at the near post after a dart from midfield by Filippa Angeldahl. She was more on point when Angeldahl, who was behind much of ­Sweden’s best work, located an intelligent run from Asllani. The captain’s chipped cross was thundered in on the run by Blackstenius and the torment rarely let up from there.Blackstenius could have scored two more before the interval but the contest remained faintly alive. It was put to bed in response to the briefest of Poland flurries, the combination of Rytting Kaneryd and Asllani this time yielding a decisive finish past the busy Kinga Szemik. “It doesn’t happen that often,” Asllani said of her header, but telling interventions from a player who turns 36 later this month invariably do.Stina BlacksteniusThe mini rout was completed by Lina Hurtig, who rose to nod in a corner from her fellow substitute Jonna Andersson. Just before that, Gerhardsson had given Frida Rolfö her first action of Euro 2025. Magda Eriksson is also yet to be involved and it speaks volumes for the tools at his disposal. There is plenty still in reserve, not that Sweden’s showing needed much of a pick-me-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They far outnumbered their Polish counterparts although a word should be reserved for the respectable red and white-clad contingent who were vocal throughout. This sport runs through the blood in Sweden; in Poland the journey has been longer but the progress is clear and Nina Patalon could reflect on the importance of her side’s debut at the top level.“I’m not disappointed,” she said. “If we want to beat the best we need to keep working. I know how hard we worked to be here. Women’s football in Poland will improve thanks to those girls who were on the pitch.” For now, Sweden are further along a road that could yet conclude with a historic night in Basel.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Poland women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Amalie Vangsgaard had given Andrée Jeglertz’s Denmark a shock first-half lead, but Germany were awarded a soft penalty, again by VAR, which was converted by Sjoeke Nüsken before Lea Schüller was able to sweep in the winner despite Emma Snerle being on the ground having taken a ball to the face from a teammate’s clearance.Germany 2-1 Denmark: Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreThe Danes are now out of the tournament, afterSweden defeated Polandin the late kick-off.“We need to make the rules clear,” Jeglertz said of Snerle’s predicament. “If we have a player that has a serious head injury you need to blow the whistle and take responsibility as a referee. I don’t understand why she doesn’t stop the game. There was a similar incident in the first half when the referee didn’t stop the game for a head injury and I question those decisions.”The Germany head coach, Christian Wück, said: “I don’t know if the decisions are right or wrong but the football system has to work out how to speed that up.”View image in fullscreenEmma Snerle lies on the turf after being clattered by a clearance, while Germany’s celebrations begin in the background.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesAround 16,000 Germany fans had been expected at St Jakob-Park, around half its capacity, but it felt like far more had packed in, the record for a group-stage game not involving the hosts broken by an attendance of 34,165.Hosted in Basel, nestled close to the borders of both France and Germany, meant that this was as close to a home game as is possible for Wück’s side, and the fans treated it as such, singing “We have a home game in Basel” as they marched towards the ground with a “Get well soon GG #7’ banner stretched between some – a tribute to the captain, Giulia Gwinn, who sustained a medial ligament injury in her side’s opening game against Poland.Denmark were unchanged from the team thatlost 1-0 against Swedenin their opening game: it was a strong performance, Pernille Harder may be their talisman but they had shown there is talent beyond the two-time European player of the year.View image in fullscreenGermany’s Klara Buhl (not pictured) scores past Denmark’s Maja Bay Østergaard, only to see her effort ruled out for offside.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersGermany looked to have broken the resolve of the well-organised and compact Denmark defence inside 20 minutes but, after a lengthy wait for a VAR check, Bühl’s effort was ruled out, Nüsken deemed to have interfered with play from an offside position as the ball flew through her legs and past the blindsided Maja Bay Østergaard.Less than 10 minutes later, Germany were behind. Janni Thomsen was dispossessed by Lea Schüller but Vangsgaard was on hand to pinch the loose ball and fire past Ann-Katrin Berger. For the first time the crowd was hushed, the rhythmic clapping and periodic chanting paused while the small pocket of red shirts went wild behind the Danish goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was soft, very soft, but the referee pointed to the spot after being told to check the pitchside monitor. Nüsken stepped up and powered her penalty low into a corner, lifting the crowd to their feet and back to full voice in the process.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s Amalie Vangsgaard squeezes her shot past the Germany goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APGermany were fortunate for the goal that put them ahead for the first time, too. Emma Færge’s clearance walloped her teammate Snerle in the face and sending her to the ground – but, despite the head injury, the referee allowed play to continue and Jule Brand laid the ball off for Schüller to stroke in. Such was the ferocity with which Snerle was hit, she looked dazed and unsteady leaving the pitch after the goal, half-carried by the two members of the medical team who accompanied her.Josefine Hasbo replaced Snerle and Denmark went in search of an equaliser that would keep their knockout-stage hopes alive.It didn’t come.

It’s no shame losing to him on this parcours.”Van der Poel expects to cede the race lead in the 33km time trial around Caen on Wednesday. “If we are being realistic, tomorrow will be my last day in yellow.”For his part, Pogacar has his eyes fixed firmly on the Olympic time trial champion, Remco Evenepoel, who inflicted a significant defeat on the Slovenian in the time trial stage of the recent Critérium du Dauphiné.“Remco will progress through this race,” he said. “Tomorrow is the perfect time trial for him. He can take some seconds back and there’s no doubt he is the best time triallist in the world. I’ll go full gas from the start and see where this places me, but tomorrow is the race of truth.”For the Tour’s fourth day, the race assumed its familiar mantle of warm sunshine, high cloud and giant hay bales, as the convoy crossed the Somme and entered Normandy. A four-man break – including Lenny Martinez, the French climber who finished last on stage one to Lille but was now seeking points in the mountains classification – moved ahead, although it only ever led the peloton by a little over two minutes.As the quartet of finishing climbs loomed on the horizon the peloton picked up speed, reeling in Martinez before the succession of breathless uphill sprints, particularly the 15% Rampe Sainte-Hilaire in Rouen, took their toll.While Jasper Philipsen, who crashed out on Monday, began his recovery from surgery on his broken collarbone, the rider with whom he collided, Bryan Coquard, was under siege – both from some in the Tour convoy and others on social media.View image in fullscreenLenny Martinez, Kasper Asgreen, Jonas Abrahamsen and Thomas Gachignard compete in a breakaway on stage four.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesThe UCI’s decision to give the Frenchman a yellow card had drawn an angry reaction from his Cofidis team general manager, Cédric Vasseur, on Tuesday morning. “If you’re giving a yellow card for this, it devalues what that card means,” Vasseur said.“We’ll discuss it further with the race directors, and maybe it will be overturned. If that’s the standard, they’ll be handing out 25 cards a day, and in a few days we’ll all be sent home.”A second yellow would lead to Coquard being expelled from the Tour. His Cofidis team were not the only ones to question the sanctions imposed on the Frenchman. “It’s very easy to judge from watching on a 55‑inch TV what one should have done,” the EF Education-EasyPost sports director, Charly Wegelius, said. “It’s a bit different when you’re on the bike.”Coquard’s sponsor, Cofidis, also sprang to his defence saying: “We condemn any form of intimidation or abuse directed at our riders on social media. The team reserves the right to file a complaint against anyone who damages their integrity.”Elsewhere during the stage on Tuesday there were local media reports circulating that an individual was arrested near the finish of the stage at the Saint-Hilaire roundabout at around 3pm. He was said to be wielding a knife and attempted to stab one officer, who was uninjured owing to his protective vest, but reportedly injured another in the leg.In Italy, meanwhile, Anna Henderson of Lidl-Trek defended her overall lead in the women’s Giro d’Italia, despite being caught in a mass crash close to the finish line in Trento.

With the first Test looming next week, now would be a perfect time to issue an emphatic statement and the captain,Maro Itoje, is urging his well-stacked team to do exactly that.There have been glimpses of some highly effective Lions combinations at various stages on their travels, even in defeat against Argentina back in Dublin when their attacking shape showed initial promise. What has held them back, aside from every Lions squad’s perpetual search for cohesion, has been an occasional tendency to play too laterally rather than going route one and blowing the front door off its hinges.Owen Farrell takes part in first Lions training session as Itoje backs him for England returnRead moreWith the bulk of their likely Test XV picked en masse for this final midweek fixture before the series which kicks off in Brisbane on Saturday week, Itoje and the management are now looking to rectify that against Australia’s highest‑ranked Super Rugby franchise. The Brumbies will be lacking eight Wallaby squad members but the ACT head coach, Stephen Larkham, has been quietly plotting how best to frustrate the Lions for several weeks.The home side did exactly that in the corresponding fixture 12 years ago, while in 2001 the Lions scraped home deep in added time, battling back from 22-10 down to sneak a 30-28 win thanks to a late Austin Healey try converted by Matt Dawson. This time the Lions have beefed up their selection and Itoje wants a more direct, purposeful approach than was forthcoming against the NSW Waratahs last Saturday.“That’s definitely the ambition,” said Itoje, who sat out the Waratahs game but was outstanding against the Queensland Reds in Brisbane. “Rugby doesn’t change too much, whether it’s under-14s rugby or the Lions. You have to go forward, you have to earn the right to go wide. And that is definitely the case for us. We need to punch holes and get ‘go forward’. Then space opens up, wherever that may be.“There were areas over the past two or three games that were very good and areas that were not quite as good as we’d have liked. We don’t want to be a team that’s constantly reviewing things and constantly saying: ‘We need to do this better.’ We want to learn quickly and move forward.”View image in fullscreenBundee Aki is among the players expected to make an impact in the Lions attack.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockThe Lions’ wishlist will definitely include a faster start, regardless of the forecast cold conditions and a slippery ball, and greater urgency at key moments. “We want to start big and maintain that throughout the whole game,” Itoje said. “We want our big ball carriers to get over the gain line, to aggressively attack holes.“When you do that, opportunities tend to open up. People like Bundee Aki, Ellis Genge, Jack Conan, big Joe McCarthy, etc. We want these guys to be punching at the line … we want to be as dominant as we possibly can. We know the Brumbies are going to be tough but we want to put our best foot forward individually and collectively.”Not a huge amount of room for misinterpretation there. France’s Pierre Brousset, who refereed Australia’s narrow win against Fiji on Sunday, will be the man in the middle and Joe Schmidt, the Wallaby head coach, is also in town for the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So you’ve got to make the most of every opportunity you have in the jersey. It’s about us realising there’ll be a greasy ball and that the Brumbies will play with a good bit of line speed to try and make things as hard as they can for us.

More than 60 bands and 2,000 participants are expected to begin their march through the town streets shortly after thousands of spectators would be leaving the sold-out Royal Portrush, if organisers stuck to typical tee times.The R&A has been concerned for some time about the logistical challenges associated with the simultaneous events on Saturday week. Significant congestion for people leaving the course, or thousands choosing to depart early to avoid this, have been uppermost in the thoughts of the major tournament’s organisers.It was reported last month that the Portrush Sons of Ulster, who organise the parade, voted against rearran­ging their march despite a request from the R&A. The third round of the Open would ordinarily finish at 8pm BST, with the parade due to commence at 8.15pm.The R&A would not comment specifically on its preparations. It is understood, however, that tee times will be adjusted. The R&A said: “We are working on plans to minimise disruption for our fans leaving the championship due to the event taking place in Portrush.”How much leeway the R&A has remains to be seen because of live American television coverage requirements. The time change is therefore unlikely to be big, but any alteration would be notable.R&A officials had promised pre­viously to “explore potential mitigations to ensure fans can get home smoothly following the end of play”. Standard adult tickets for round three cost more than £120. The 153rd staging of the Open, which runs from 17 to 20 July, will be the biggest ­sporting event to take place in ­Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, before the Scottish Open this week, Xander Schauffele has backed Keegan Bradley’s bid to be a playing captain for the US in the Ryder Cup in September.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was aimed at promoting greater equality of opportunities, but even people working in football are hard-pressed to find the numbers.The clubs published the results of their internal surveys on 1 June, other than Manchester United owing to a website glitch corrected a few days later, but the silence from the sport regarding the findings has been deafening. None of the FA, Premier League or EFL commented on the data or published a summary of the findings, indicating that the drive for greater transparency has its limits.‘Everything is better’: how Rubiales’s unwanted kiss transformed Spanish women’s footballRead moreIn one sense, the silence is unsurprising. Analysis of the data conducted byKick It Outpaints a depressing picture of a sport sorely lacking in diversity, with the staff at most clubs not reflecting the ethnic makeup of their local communities.In the Premier League, 78% of clubs’ workforces are white compared with an average of 66% among the local populations and although there is 13% ethnic diversity in the coaching staff, only two top-flight clubs reported having Black, Asian and minority ethnic coaches in senior roles.Staff at EFL clubs appear more representative, with 87% of their workforce white compared with an average of 80.8% locally, although clubs in the lower divisions were not required to provide detailed breakdowns of staff roles so the figures for coaches are unclear.Kick It Out’s chief executive, Samuel Okafor, welcomed the publication of the data, although there was no disguising his disappointment at the findings. “For many years we as an organisation have been calling for the game to be more transparent and bring more data into the light,” he said. “It’s really positive the FA have brought out a new rule that means all 92 clubs have to publish their workforce data.“What the data has shown us is probably not a surprise to us or to many people. When we look at Black, Asian, ethnically diverse staff, whether that’s in boardrooms, in senior leadership roles, in coaching or senior coaching, you can see there’s a huge lack of representation. When we look at women in boardrooms and senior leadership roles, in coaching, we can again see there is a huge underrepresentation. Representation of LGBTQ people and those with disabilities is very low.“Some of these data points will not be a surprise to many, but having it in the light is positive for driving change and accountability.”Okafor has been at Kick It Out for just under a year after replacing Tony Burnett, who before retiring last summer called for sanctions for clubs that failed to meet diversity targets.The FA created the new rule after mixed results from the Football Leadership Diversity Code, a voluntary reporting requirement introduced in 2020. Fifty-three clubs had signed up by last season and none had met the eight hiring targets to increase diversity among staff.FA sources indicated they were in the process of analysing the data. The governing body plans to submit a report to all stakeholders, including the Premier League, EFL and Kick It Out, before discussing the issue publicly at a Football Leadership Diversity summit in the autumn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of the Premier League clubs reported high rates of “prefer not to say” regarding ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability and did not report data for roles with fewer than 10 staff members, leading to a lack of visibility regarding coaching posts. Many clubs also use the catch-all “under 10%” rather than giving exact figures, making it hard to accurately assess representation, especially for smaller demographic groups.Okafor spent 20 years in the banking industry after a playing career that peaked with Colchester in League One, most recently as a director at the private bank Coutts, and believes football lags behind in terms of recruitment practices. EFL clubs have had access to an anonymised recruitment platform, iRecruit, for two years but it is unclear how widely it is used.“The banking sector is ahead when it comes to transparency, when it comes to target setting,” Okafor said. “There’s still a massive way to go in terms of getting the right level of representation across the game.“There’s also an opportunity to look at some of the best practices that happen in other industries and how do you bring them into football. We need diverse shortlists and interview panels, all those inclusive practices, so it’s not the select few that are getting those jobs.”Okafor is eager to make the economic case for having a diverse workforce. “We will continue to talk about the moral case for change, but there’s a real commercial benefit when you have a diverse workforce, when you have a diverse leadership team that looks like the club’s community, and when you have a diverse coaching staff … You can’t just have EDI [equality, diversity and inclusion] over on one side and financial sustainability on the other side. You really need to bring the two together.”Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FAKick It OutPremier LeagueFootball LeagueRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are speaking with them separately on a framework for the talks. So talks have not begun, as of yet, but we are talking to both sides over that framework,” he said.InGaza, the death toll continues to mount. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported 29 people killed in Israeli strikes across the territory, including three children, while five Israeli military personnel were killed and 14 injured late on Monday in an attack by Hamas militants near Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesperson for the civil defence agency, said nine people had been killed in a drone strike on a camp for displaced people in southern Gaza.Shaimaa al-Shaer, 30, who lives in the camp, said: “I was in front of my tent preparing breakfast for my four children – beans and a bit of dry bread. Suddenly, there was an explosion.”View image in fullscreenRelatives of the Abu al-Khair family mourn their children at Nasser hospital, after they were killed by an Israeli drone that struck their tent.Photograph: Anas Deeb/UPI/ShutterstockHealth officials at the Nasser hospital, where victims of the Israeli strikes were taken, said one of the strikes had targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, killing four. A separate strike in the city killed another four people – a mother, father, and their two children, officials said.In central Gaza, Israeli strikes hit a group of people, killing 10 and injuring 72, according to a statement by al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat.The IDF accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields, which Hamas denies.Evacuation orders were issued by the IDF for more neighbourhoods of Khan Younis, displacing thousands of people before new Israeli attacks there.The current ceasefire proposal envisages a phased release of 28 hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals fromparts of Gazathe IDF has seized in recent months, an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory, and discussions on ending the war.Hamas also wants guarantees that Israel will not launch a new offensive after the 60-day truce. A previous ceasefirecollapsed in Marchwhen Israel reneged on a promise to engage in negotiations that would have led to a second scheduled phase of the existing truce, and possibly a permanent cessation of hostilities.Israel has said it will not agree to stop fighting until Hamas has released all the 50 hostages it still holds, of whom more than half are dead, and disarms.Palestinian sources said earlier this week there were also gaps between the parties on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and its distribution.In contrast to Palestinian and Qatari officials, senior Israeli officials have highlighted progress in the talks.‘Our days are full of hardship’: people in Gaza barely dare to hope for success in ceasefire talksRead moreZe’ev Elkin, a member of Israel’s security cabinet, said there was “a substantial chance” a ceasefire would be agreed. “Hamas wants to change a few central matters; it’s not simple, but there is progress,” he told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.On Monday, Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, laid out plans to force all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp on the ruins of Rafah, a scheme legal experts and academics describedas a blueprint for crimes against humanity.Katz said he had ordered the IDF to prepare to set up a camp, which he called a “humanitarian city”, in Rafah. Israeli forces would control the perimeter of the site and initially “move” 600,000 Palestinians into the area – mostly people currently displaced in the Mawasi area.Eventually, the entire population of Gaza would be housed there, and Israel aimed to implement “the emigration plan, which will happen”, Haaretz newspaperquoted Katzsaying.Khaled al-Attar, a 33-year-old researcher displaced to Gaza City, said the announcement was probably intended to gain an advantage in the ceasefire negotiations.“However, if this is an official plan … it is coercive displacement cloaked in the guise of aid and humanitarianism. They are trying to push the people of Gaza into camps in Rafah – an alarming step toward depopulating Gaza,” Attar said.But Khaled Abu Sultan, a 33-year-old former marketing specialist, said he supported any idea that would help unarmed civilians to leave Gaza and “escape the massacre” in the territory.“Honestly, we’ve reached a point where we can no longer endure. We are not against the idea of displacement … On the contrary, we support it in order to live a dignified life, because here [everything] has been destroyed,” he said.Maysa Qader, 44, also displaced to Gaza City, said she wanted the war to end as soon as possible so that “none of these plans are ever implemented”.Gaza’s ministry of health has counted more than 57,000 killed by the Israeli offensive, mostly civilians. The UN and several western governments consider the tally to be reliable.The offensive has plunged Gaza’s population into an acute humanitarian crisis, with many threatened by famine, and reduced much of the territory to rubble.The war was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in October 2023 in which militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducted 250.AFP and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelQatarHamasBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the deaths were in Kerr county, where officials said 87 bodies had so far been recovered, including 56 adults and 30 children. Identification was pending for 19 adults and seven children with one additional person still unidentified, county sheriff Larry Leitha told a news conference.Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said in a Tuesday evening press conference from Kerr county that at least 161 people are still missing and that many of those who are not accounted for were staying in state’s Hill Country but did not register at a camp or hotel.At Camp Mystic, five campers and one counsellor remain unaccounted for, Abbott said. The Christian girls’ summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River is at the centre of the flood-ravaged region, and at least 27 campers and counselors areknown to have died.Among the Texas flood victims: campers, staff, grandparents and teachersRead moreFour days after the last person was found alive in the aftermath of the floods, the hope of finding survivors was increasingly bleak.At the press conference, authorities leading the search for victims seemed to dodge questions over who was responsible for monitoring the weather that killed so many people and warning that flash floods were hurtling toward camps and homes.The timeline of the official response remains unclear. Despite the fact that the National Weather Service’s first public warning alert for “life-threatening flash flooding” came at 1.14am on 4 July, Leitha told reporters he was not made aware of the flash floods until “between 4 and 5” that morning.Throughout the periodically heated press conference, he and other Texas officials faced accusations of “ducking” questions regarding Kerr county’s alert system. They repeatedly insisted that their priority was finding victims, not reviewing what happened in the hours before the floods devastated the region.Responding to a question about the alerts, Leitha said: “As I’ve told you several times, that is not my priority this time. There are three priorities, thats locating the people out there, identifying, notifying the next of kin – that is what I’m taking as my job as sheriff.”Asked whether the emergency manager was awake at the time to issue an emergency alert, the sheriff said: “I can’t tell you at this time.” When a reporter pressed him on a response, Leitha said: “It’s not that easy as you just push a button, OK, there’s a lot more to that, and we’ve told you several times,” he said.Reporters continued to ask about the county’s alert system, but officials evaded the questions to focus on recovery efforts.“We understand you have many questions. We understand that. But right now, this team up here is focused on bringing people home,” Lt Col Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens said. “That’s our focus.”Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025TexasUS weatherExtreme weatherTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Overall, private firms received approximately 54% of the department’s discretionary spending of $4.4tn over that period.Taking into account supplemental funding for the Pentagon passed by Congress under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, the report said, theUS militarybudget will have nearly doubled this century, increasing 99% since 2000.The rapid growth in military spending that began under the Bush administration’s post-9/11 and the “global war on terror” has now been continued on spending to counter China as the US’s main rival in the 21st century, as well record foreign arms transfers to Israel and Ukraine.“The US withdrawal from Afghanistan in September 2021 did not result in a peace dividend,” the authors of the report wrote. “Instead, President Biden requested, and Congress authorized, even higher annual budgets for the Pentagon, and President Trump is continuing that same trajectory of escalating military budgets.”That contradicts early indications from Trump in February that he could cut military spending in half, adding that he would tell China and Russia that “there’s no reason for us to be spending almost $1tn on the military … and I’m going to say we can spend this on other things”. Instead, the spending bill pushed by Trump through Congress included a $157bn spending boost for the Pentagon.The growth in spending will increasingly benefit firms in the “military tech” sector who represent tech companies like SpaceX, Palantir and Anduril, the report said, that are “deeply embedded in theTrump administration, which should give it an upper hand in the budget battles to come”.“High Pentagon budgets are often justified because the funds are ‘for the troops’,” said William D Hartung, senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and an author of the report. “But as this paper shows, the majority of the department’s budget goes to corporations, money that has as much to do with special interest lobbying as it does with any rational defense planning. Much of this funding has been wasted on dysfunctional or overpriced weapons systems and extravagant compensation packages.”“These figures represent a continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to fund war and weapons manufacturing,” said Stephanie Savell, director of the Costs of War project.Calculated for inflation, the military spending dwarfs an approximate $356bn that Congress had appropriated for US diplomacy, development and humanitarian aid.The Trump administration has continued to slash money spent on aid. Last month, the Guardian revealed that a White House review of grants to the state departmentrecommended a near total cut on democracy promotion programs.The Guardian has contacted the Pentagon for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryTrump administrationBiden administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Windfarms are sometimes paid to power down when renewable energy threatens to overwhelm the grid.Zonal pricing could have cut the cost of renewing and updating the country’s electricity grid by billions.Zonal electricity pricing plan could add £3bn a year to GB bills, report findsRead moreAreport by FTI Consultingpredicted overall savings of £52bn for consumers over 20 years, while another, which was commissioned by Octopus, found the UK would need to spend £27bn less on major grid upgrades in the future.The plans threatened an outcry from the sector and the wider public, however.Alistair Phillips-Davies, the outgoing chief executive of SSE,said recentlythe plan would be a “huge mistake”, saying it would create a “postcode lottery” where some households would pay £200 to £300 more because of where they live.Anindependent reportco-authored by Rob Gross, the UK Energy Research Centre director, found the benefits of zonal pricing could easily be wiped out if renewable energy developers demanded higher subsidies to offset the risk of the new scheme.Miliband is already under pressure from Downing Street to show when his sweeping reforms to the energy system will bring down bills for ordinary consumers, with No 10 officials increasingly concerned about the threat of Reform UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They include paying battery storage companies to build major capacity in Scotland, or paying them to turn up their capacity on particularly windy days.One government source said the search for other plans was “where all the brain power is now being expended”.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergy billsRenewable energyEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

Labour backbenchers tabled a series of amendments before its return to the Commons on Wednesday for its remaining stages in the lower house.A letter from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, on behalf of the committee, said it “respectfully requests information” about the bill, and in particular the extent of any impact assessment.It also sought information on “any measures to address the foreseeable risk of increasing poverty rates amongst persons with disabilities if cuts are approved”.According to an impact assessment by the Department for Work and Pensions released on Monday, therevised bill will mean50,000 fewer people are in relative poverty after housing costs in 2030. An assessment of the original plans found the measures would have pushed an additional 250,000 people into poverty, with some charities saying this figure would have been higher.The letter also requests information on the extent of consultation with disabled people and charities ahead of the bill being presented, and whether the House of Lords would be able to give only “limited scrutiny” if, as expected, it is designated as a money bill, limiting the upper house’s powers.The UN committee called for scrutiny of politicians and others in the UK “portraying persons with disabilities as making profit of social benefits, making false statements to get social and disability benefits or being a burden to society”.Pointing toprevious UN reportscriticising the UK for its record over the rights of disabled people, the committee said it had “received credible information indicating that, if approved, the universal credit and personal independent payment bill will deepen the signs of regression” found in earlier reports.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2019, the Environment Agency (EA) was given the green light to develop a sludge strategy which proposed bringing use of sludge on farms under tighter rules that govern other potentially environmentally harmful activities, such as sending waste to landfill and running incinerators.Last year, lawyers representing the campaign group Fighting Dirty took the EA to court over whether its decision to remove a deadline for bringing in this regulatory reform was unlawful.The group lost its case, but documents and emails submitted by the agency to the court – obtained as part ofan Ends Report investigation– have revealed the extent to which the EA sought to persuade the government to implement its plans to tighten the regulatory net on sludge, and how it was ignored.This includes multiple emails and briefings sent three years ago, when the EA was asked by officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for information for a ministerial submission. The emails reveal that one EA staff member described how the current rules allow water companies to take an attitude to sludge spreading “akin to fly-tipping on to agricultural land”.View image in fullscreenBags of sewage-derived biosolids fertiliser.Photograph: Justin Kase zsixz/AlamyThe EA also warned Defra that practically all microplastics that enter sewage treatment works end up in sludge that is bound for farmland, and that current rules mean the practice of “sludge trading” – where water companies move sludge around to different companies and catchments – is making it almost impossible to “allow tracing of any contaminated sludge to the fields where it is to be spread on to food-growing (or grazing) agricultural land”.However, later in 2022, a special adviser to the environment secretary, who was then George Eustice, told officials that work on bringing sludge spreading under tighter regulation should be paused because ministers had not been “sufficiently updated on it” – despite the email chains showing regular engagement on the issue between EA and government officials.Defra’s water quality and agriculture policy team leader told the special adviser: “I apologise for the messaging around the sludge work, which has been confused – I should have been more on top of it. The source of this confusion is a difference of view between us and EA about Defra Group’s readiness to implement any reforms.”They added: “Due to an understandably incomplete understanding of the process for political decisions and legislative implementation of the reforms, the EA seemto think the process is straightforward and attempted to hurry things up a couple of years ago by publishing a sludge strategy.”The emails obtained by Ends show that the EA scrambled to express its concern and surprise, with staff stating they had been having fortnightly meetings with the department about its work on sludge.In an attempt to emphasise the need for reforms, briefing material provided by the EA’s land contamination manager at the time said that the Chemicals Investigation Programme (CIP), which is funded by the water industry, “is revealing that sludge going to agriculture (843,343 tonnes dry weight) contains an estimated 8,096 tonnes dry weight of microplastics”.“This is thought to be virtually all of the incoming microplastics in wastewater given there is close to 100% partitioning into the sludge,” their briefing stated.The most recent CIP report, obtained by Ends, not only supports this assertion but gives a slightly higher figure.View image in fullscreenA treatment tank in Oxford, where sewage is broken down into sludge.Photograph: Adrian Arbib/AlamyThe report states that extrapolation of sample data “suggests that 8,304 tonnes of microplastics were exported to land through the application of biosolids in England and Wales in 2020 (equivalent to 22 tonnes/day)”.Three years on, there have been no changes made to sludge spreading rules.Richard Benwell, chief executive of the nature coalition group Wildlife and Countryside Link, said that “inaction from the previous government, in the face of advice from the EA on the need for tighter rules, is completely unacceptable”.He added: “The current government must swiftly bring in new regulation to prevent harmful levels of pollutants ending up on fields, alongside measures to reduce toxic chemical production and use at source, to protect people and nature.”In the US state of Maine, the practice of sludge spreading has been banned after officials discovered high levels of Pfas in water, crops, cattle, soil – and in farmers – from farms where sludge had been spread. The discovery of Pfas contamination on some of these farms hasresulted in farmers being put out of business, and last yearthe US Environmental Protection Agencywas taken to court for allegedly failing to regulate the spread of Pfas-contaminated sludge.Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature FriendlyFarmingNetwork, said: “Any farmer receiving sewage sludge or cake [a form of treated sludge] needs to have a serious think about unintended consequences, and will they have the access to their soil to grow food for the future because of the risk.”A National Farmers’ Union spokesperson said that addressing contaminants “at source”, alongside clear regulatory standards and continued investment in treatment technologies, were “critical to protect soil health and ensure biosolids remain a high-quality and safe resource for agricultural use.”The farming employers’ association added that using sludge helped farmers “reduce their reliance on synthetic fertilisers while giving water companies a sustainable outlet for their byproducts”.However, George Monbiot, the journalist and co-founder of Fighting Dirty, said: “Farmers are being deceived by the water companies … they’re being misled, and this could have very serious implications for their future livelihood, that their land could become unusable, the farmers themselves could suffer serious health impacts, as we’ve seen with certain dairy farmers in the US.”A spokesperson for the water industry body,WaterUK, said: “Using bioresources on land is a long-established and independently regulated process that provides a useful source of nutrients for farming and saves farmers money.“Any standards and assessment techniques are a matter for the government and the regulator and need to be based on firm evidence and detailed scientific research.”The spokesperson said water companies were conducting trials to see if sludge could be used for “other purposes, such as an alternative fuel for aviation”.They added: “The UK government has banned the sale of some products containing microplastics and we need the same action on Pfas. We also need a national plan to remove it from the environment, which should be paid for by the polluting manufacturers.”A spokesperson for the EA said the regulator remains “committed to the safe and sustainable use of sludge in agriculture and will ensure water companies can contribute to productive farming whilst meeting their environmental obligations to clean up waterways and promote soil health”.The spokesperson added that the EA would “continue to work closely with Defra to improve the regulatory framework for the use of sludge”.A Defra spokesperson said: “We need to see the safe and sustainable use of sludge in agriculture to help clean up our waterways. The Independent Water Commission will explore a range of issues, including the regulatory framework for sludge spreading, and we continue to work closely with the Environment Agency, water companies and farmers in this area.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingWaterEnvironment AgencynewsShareReuse this content"

How dangerous is flooding – and what can we do to keep ourselves safe?How deadly are floods?Floods kill thousands of people each year. The direct death toll is orders of magnitude lower than that of the biggest environmental killers, such ashot weatherand dirty air, but scientists are unsure just how big the indirect health burden is. The aftermath of a flood can be even more deadly than the deluge itself, as crops die and disease spreads.Floods also force vast numbers of people to flee. In 2024, fast-flowing waters displaced more than 19 million people around the world – a mix of precautionary evacuations and washed-away villages. The figure is about the equivalent of pushing every single person in Somalia, Florida or the Netherlands from their home.What can we do about floods?Disasters such as storms and floods have become less deadly in recent decades, as people have grown better at managing the risks, but the damage they do varies widely. A person in Somalia may receive no warnings at all before flash floodssweep awaytheir loved ones; someone in Florida may be evacuated to safety butlack home insuranceto rebuild their home; a person in the Netherlands may be so well protected bytidal parksandsponge citiesthat heavy rains may not even register as a threat.People who live in flood plains and on coasts – where much of global population growth has taken place – are particularly vulnerable.Is human-caused climate breakdown making floods worse?The burning of fossil fuels has heated the planet, increasing the risk of extreme rains that lead to floods around the world,particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia. A well-established rule of physics is that warm air can hold more moisture – about 7% for every 1C – though whether it does so or not depends on how much water is available. When heavy rain does fall, clouds can unleash far more water.Perhaps surprisingly, a lack of water can also worsen floods, by drying out the ground. Hard, caked soil does not absorb water so it runs off and pools in lower-lying regions, allowing water levels to rise much faster than otherwise.Flooding is also affected by human factors such as the existence of flood defences and land use.Monthly intensity of droughts and floods by area affected, Jan 2003 to Dec 2024What about coastal floods?Climate change makes coastal floods stronger by raising sea levels. The effect is so strong that by 2100, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found, high tides that used to hit once a century will hit most of the world’s coasts every single year. This hundredfold increase will take place even in optimistic scenarios for cutting pollution – and in many coastal cities will happen by the middle of the century.How do floods affect the economy?Floods destroy infrastructure such as bridges, roads and railways, as well as possessions such as homes and cars. They can also wipe out businesses and render offices, schools and hospitals unusable.When flash floods in 2023 struck Slovenia, a small but prosperous country in central Europe, they caused an estimated €10bn in damage, or about 16% of the country’s GDP. In the US, floods are estimated to cause up to half a trillion dollars in direct asset losses each year.Economic losses from extreme weather in Europe have topped €40bn every year between 2021 and 2024How can we adapt to flooding?Globally, the biggest progress in saving lives has come from early warning systems that alert people to danger and help them escape before it strikes. This has proved particularly powerful in middle-income countries, where most people live, though it has a long way to go in the poorest parts of the world.Building dykes and retention basins can limit the damage from heavy rainfall. In cities, parks and other green spaces can also soak up rain before it turns into a flood. On coasts, sea walls can keep the waters out.But scientists warn there are limits to adaptation as the planet heats up. They increasingly talk about “managed retreat” to permanently move people out of harm’s way – a route that some communities around the world have already gone down. This can mean abandoning homes, towns and, in the case of small island states being submerged by the sea, entire countries.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentExtreme weatherFloodingClimate crisisIndiaExtreme heatexplainersShareReuse this content"

The business has been in his family since the 1930s, and sends truckloads of bees across the country from South Dakota, pollinating crops such as almonds, onions, watermelons and cucumbers.Last December, his bees were wintering in California when the weather turned cold.Beesgrouped on top of hives trying to keep warm. “Every time I went out to the beehive there were less and less,” says Adee. “Then a week later, there’d be more dead ones to pick up … every week there is attrition, just continually going down.”Adee went on to lose 75% of his bees. “It’s almost depressingly sad,” he says. “If we have a similar situation this year – I sure hope we don’t – then we’re in a death spiral.”It developed into thelargest US honeybee die-offon record, with beekeepers losing on average 60% of their colonies, at acost of $600m(£440m).View image in fullscreenBees searching for food in dead beehives in California. As well as mites, honeybees suffer from habitat loss, climate change and chemical stress.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/GettyScientists have been scrambling to discover what happened; now the culprits are emerging. Aresearch paperpublished by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), though not yet peer-reviewed, has found nearly all colonies had contracted a bee virus spread by parasitic mites that appear to have developed resistance to the main chemicals used to control them.Varroa mites – equivalent in size to a dinner plate on a human body – crawl and jump between worker bees. If there are no infections present, they do not typically damage the bee. But if diseases are present, they quickly spread them.While varroa typically infects honeybees, not wild bees, the diseases that they spread can kill other pollinators – research has shown that theviral outbreaks among honeybees often spill overto wild colonies, with potential knock-on effects on biodiversity.It was only a matter of time before resistance to amitraz, the only remaining effective chemical, would developNorman Carreck, bee expertAll beekeepers in the USDA screening used amitraz, a pesticide widely used in the sector to get rid of mites. But the research showed all mites tested were resistant to it: after years of heavy use, amitraz no longer appears to be effective. This discovery underscores “the urgent need for new control strategies for this parasite”, researchers say.Mite numbers have increased to high levels in recent surveys, according to the researchers, who collected hundreds of samples from dead and living hives from 113 colonies. “When mites become uncontrolled, virulent viruses are more likely to take over,” researchers say.Since the 1980s, varroamites globally have developed resistance to at least four leading miticides– pesticides specifically formulated to control mites that are challenging to develop – causing significant problems for beekeepers.Norman Carreck, a senior technician at the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the research, says: “Sadly, it was inevitable that major honeybee colony losses would again occur in the US at some point.View image in fullscreenA varroa mite is visible on a dead bee in a hive. The mites are a leading factor in the recent US bee die-offs but not the only one.Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP“It was only a matter of time before widespread resistance to amitraz, the only remaining effective synthetic chemical, would develop,” he says.But the discovery of amitraz-resistant mites in hives does not mean they alone were responsible for all of last year’s record die-offs. A combination of factors is likely to be causing successive colony deaths among US bees, including the changing climate, exposure to pesticides, and less food in the form of pollen and nectar as monocrop farming proliferates. ManyUS beekeepers now expect to lose 30% of their colonyor more every year.These wider combined factors are also devastating for wild pollinators and native bee species – and honeybees, which are closely monitored by their keepers, may be acting as a canary in the coalmine for pressures affecting insects more generally.Almost all bee colonies have these viruses, but they only do significant harm when the colony is stressedProf Dave GoulsonPaul Hetherington,of the charity Buglife, says honeybees are in effect “a farmed animal as opposed to wild bees, but they will be suffering from the same stresses as their wild cousins, in particular loss of good habitat, climate stress, chemical stress, light.Adee says: “We had mites for 20 years, and we never had over 3% losses.” He believes there is a “combination of things” that makes the bees more stressed and the mites more deadly.He cites the use of neonicotinoid insecticides in the US, which harm bees’ nervous system, paralysing and ultimately killing them. Some researchers have warned ofneonicotinoids causing another “silent spring”, referring to Rachel Carson’s 1962 book on the effects of the insecticide DDT on bird populations.Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex, says the study provided no evidence that the viral load was higher in weaker colonies. “Almost all bee colonies have these viruses, but they only do significant harm when the colony is stressed.”View image in fullscreenA bee pollinates almond trees in California, during the world’s largest pollination event requiring the services of 70% of US honeybees.Photograph: Jessica Christian/GettyHe says high levels of viral infection may be a symptom of ill health, not the cause.Due to government staffing cuts, the USDA team were unable to analyse pesticides in the hives and askedbee experts at Cornell University to carry out the research, with the results still to be published.Experts are concerned that successive loss of honeybee colonies could affect food security as the insects pollinate more than100 commercial cropsacross North America. Reports of new losses this year came through before the California almond blossom season, which is the largest pollination event in the world, requiring the services of 70% of US honeybees.High fertiliser use halves numbers of pollinators, world’s longest study findsRead moreDanielle Downey, director of the nonprofit beekeeping research organisationProjectApis m., which conducted the die-off survey, says: “If you like to eat, you need healthy bees to pollinate crops. Beekeepers try to rebuild each year but they are pushed to the brink as losses and input costs keep increasing.“If beekeepers fail, there is no backup plan for the pollination services they provide in US food production,” she says.Meanwhile, beekeepers are being pushed close to ruin. When Adee was growing up, he would get upset about losses of more than 5%. Now a loss of 30% each year is standard. “It’s absolutely insane that that’s an acceptable loss in a livestock industry,” he says.Like many beekeepers, Adee was unable to restock this year because the losses were so high. “I’m just watching every nickel and dime right now, because I don’t want to get rid of men that have helped me manage these bees for years.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsBeesThe age of extinctionInsectsWildlifeAnimalsFarmingPesticidesUS economyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The watchdog said: “We have seen officers’ body-worn footage which shows the man, aged in his mid-30s, holding a chainsaw and another object in his hand, which, at the time, officers believed appeared to be a handmade firearm or IED (improvised explosive device). He was also wearing a gas mask and body armour.“We can confirm a first baton round was fired by police and the man then took cover behind a hedge.“Officers moved in and a police dog was deployed. The man ignored orders to put down the chainsaw, and a second baton round was discharged and then, seconds later, he moved towards officers and was shot by an officer with a conventional firearm.”Officers found weapons at the scene, including a chainsaw and a device that was “made safe” by a bomb squad, the IOPC added.Kent police said the incident was not terror-related.The man had arm and abdomen injuries, which were thought to be potentially “life changing”, and remained in hospital.Amanda Rowe, an IOPC director, said: “Police shootings are fortunately rare. However, given a man has been injured after being shot by police, our role is to independently investigate all of the circumstances surrounding this incident including the actions and decisions taken by the police.“Based on analysis of evidence gathered to date, no police officer is under investigation for either misconduct or criminality – they are being treated as witnesses.“We appreciate that the community will want answers quickly, and our investigators are working hard to establish the facts and piece together what occurred.

Those acting on Russia’s behalf will be met by the full force of the law.”Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the convicted defendants would be sentenced on a date to be fixed in the autumn.Explore more on these topicsLondonEnglandCrimeUkraineRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Three cost more than the purported psychological £10 “maximum price” that many are willing to pay for a takeaway lunch.With growing numbers of employersincreasing their office attendance requirements, the “grab and go” lunch market is bigger business than it has been in recent years.Pret’s new Super Plates salad range will be available at more than 250 shops nationwide from Wednesday, and the priciest of the four is the “miso salmon” version, which includes roasted salmon, avocado, black rice and quinoa, broccoli and edamame soya beans. This will cost “from £12.95”, which presumably reflects the fact that those eating in rather than taking away typically pay more because of VAT, but may also be linked to the differing prices across its outlets.The starting prices for the other three salads, centred on chipotle chicken, butternut squash and shawarma chicken, are £9.95 or £10.95.It is understood Pret’s most expensive takeaway salad until now was a salmon and mango one that can be picked up in at least some central London outlets for £7.95.Weighing in at about 450 grams-plus, Pret said the new items were almost 60% larger on average than its existing salad range and “will meet the growing demand we are seeing for more substantial, protein-rich salads”.View image in fullscreenPret a Manger’s Super Plates salad range.Photograph: Jamie Orlando Smith/Pret a MangerA spokesperson for Pret said the use of more premium ingredients “reflects the growing trend of workers ‘treating’ themselves to a more filling lunch the days they are in the office”.Ingredients used include “hand-massaged kale”. Asked what that meant, the chain said: “Our kale comes destemmed and sliced and is lovingly hand-massaged by our teams in our iconic French dressing for 45 seconds in our shop kitchens. This helps to soften the kale and keeps the minerals and nutrients in.”After years of cost of living pressures that millions are still facing and that have resulted in retailers battling to win over price-conscious shoppers, it may seem counterintuitive for a major chain to focus on a range where the prices are several pounds above what people typically pay. However, Pret is continuing a trend begun by the supermarkets, which have increasingly been launching pricier “premium” lunchtime meal deals that sit alongside their standard offerings. Pay a bit more and you can now grab a poké pot, a pack of baos or a Mexican burrito bowl instead of a prawn mayo sandwich or pasta salad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They cited the firm’s “track record of creating discriminatory policing software in the US” and its “close links to a US government which shows little regard for international law”.But Mosley dismissed the attack when he gave evidence to MPs from the Commons science and technology committee on Tuesday. Palantir has also won contracts to handle mass data controlled by the Ministry of Defence, police and local authorities.Tech firm Palantir spoke with MoJ about calculating prisoners’ ‘reoffending risks’Read moreThiel, a libertarian, named the company after the “seeing stones” in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has previously said the British public’s affection for the NHS is a case of “Stockholm syndrome”, but Mosley said he was not speaking for Palantir.Palantir also provides artificial intelligence-enabled military targeting systems, as well as software to integrate and analyse data scattered across different systems, such as in the health service.“I think the accusation that we lack transparency or this is secretive is wrong,” Mosley said. “I think that BMA has, if I may be frank, chosen ideology over patient interest. I think our software is going to make patient lives better by making their treatment quicker, more effective, and ultimately the healthcare system more efficient.”In 2023 the government awarded Palantir the contract to build a new NHS “federated data platform”, but concerns have been raised by some local NHS trusts that the system was no better than the existing technology and could even reduce functionality, the website Democracy for Salereported.Palantir was also one of the many technology companies the Guardian revealed last week had recentlymet the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to discuss ideas to help solve the crisis in prisons and probation, from inserting tracking devices under offenders’ skin to assigning robots to contain prisoners.During the hearing Mosley was challenged by the chair, Chi Onwurah MP, over whether it was the right company to be involved in the NHS when it was also working for theIsraelDefense Forces in Gaza, through its military applications.Mosley declined to give operational details about what Palantir does for the Israeli authorities. Its products include a system called Gotham, which “supports soldiers with an AI-powered kill chain, seamlessly and responsibly integrating target identification”.Onwurah said cultural change was needed in the NHS in order to drive uptake of the new data systems. She asked Mosley: “Do you really think that Palantir is the organisation to bring together 42 integrated care boards, over 200 NHS Trusts to champion NHS values, to bring them together around one federated data [platform] and, in the future, a single patient record?”“I think the question of trust should really be about our competence above all,” Mosley said. “Are we delivering [what] we have promised to deliver? Are we making the patient experience quicker, more effective, more efficient? And if we are, then we should be trusted with that.”The BMA said its opposition to Palantir’s involvement in the NHS was a matter of good governance, not ideology.“If Palantir’s software is being used to target individuals in immigration enforcement and is being deployed in active conflict zones, then that’s completely incompatible with the values we uphold in the delivery of care,” said Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair of the BMA’s general practitioners committee.He warned patients would be alarmed and could choose to withhold information from their doctor if they did not trust the organisation processing their data or there were fears about what the data might be used for.The Liberal Democrat MP Martin Wrigley said the interoperability between the data systems Palantir provides for health and defence was “profoundly worrying”. The Conservative MP Kit Malthouse wanted to know if a military could target particular individuals with particular characteristics by using Palantir’s ability to process a large pool of data. Mosley said: “We provide an enormous amount of control and governance to the organisations that use our software for that purpose to manage precisely the kind of risks that you’re talking about.”Malthouse said: “That sounds like a yes”.It also emerged during the hearing that Palantir continues to employ Global Counsel, a lobbying firm co-founded by Britain’s ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson. Mosley denied that a visit to Palantir’s Washington DC office by the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, was arranged by Mandelson, saying “it was done through the proper channels”. Mandelson stepped down from Global Counsel in “early 2025”, theconsultancy’s websitesays.Explore more on these topicsPalantirHealthcare industryData protectionNHSHealthPeter MandelsonHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

But he extended a pause on the duties’ introduction, allowing three more weeks for negotiations.More letters will be sent to countries, informing them of new tariff rates “today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time”, according to Trump.Global stock markets have largely shrugged off the latest threats. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 was up just 0.03% and the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.3%. In recent weeks, some investors appear to have embraced the Taco – orTrump Always Chickens Out– trade.Speaking on Tuesday at the White House, Trump laid out plans to step up his controversial trade strategy, which economists have warned risks exacerbating inflation.Imported copper will face aUS tariffof 50% in a bid to bolster US production of the metal, the administration announced. US copper prices rose 12% to hit record levels.After providing manufacturers with around a year or a year and a half’s notice, pharmaceutical imports are also “going to be tariffed at a very, very high rate”, the president said. “Like 200%.”“We’re going to be announcing pharmaceuticals, chips and various couple of other things – you know, big ones,” he added, of the administration’s tariff plans.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsEconomic policyDonald TrumpGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

To achieve this, they took part in military-style training, as well as shooting, ambush, survival and navigation exercises. They also conducted a scouting operation,” the RCMP said in a statement.A fourth individual, Matthew Forbes, 33, of Pont-Rouge, has been charged with possession of firearms, prohibited devices and explosives. The four have not yet entered pleas.The RCMP said they conducted searches in January 2024 in the province ofQuebec, where they discovered 16 explosive devices, 83 firearms, 11,000 rounds of ammunition and other military equipment – 18 months before the arrests were made. Police said the investigation was led by Quebec’s RCMP-led Integrated National Security Enforcement Team squad, with help from local police.Other than describing the men as wanting to create an “anti-government militia”, investigators have not described the motivating ideology and nor did they reveal what the men were alleged to have identified as a target in their attempt to “forcibly take possession of land in the Québec City area”.The RCMP also released images of handguns, assault rifles, vests and ammunition seized by officers.“This is the largest cache of equipment and weapons and explosive devices that have ever been found in a terrorist incident, by a long shot, inCanada,” said Jessica Davis, a former intelligence analyst at Canada’s spy agency and the president of Insight Threat Intelligence, a consultancy.“I would probably put it in one of the top caches of disrupted plots around the world, particularly in Nato countries. It’s huge and we don’t know what they were planning on doing with that – but that was a lot of military equipment and devices.”The RCMP also posted images of an accused’s social media profile that included images “with the aim of recruiting new members to the anti-government militia”.Davis said that over the last two decades, most of the terror attacks in Canada have been perpetrated by ideologically motivated violent extremism.“We’re not talking about al-Qaida and Islamic State. We’re talking about anti-Muslim, ‘Incel’ or anti-government extremists. And I think that’s one of those things that Canadians don’t necessarily understand. The Islamic State makes the news, but it’s really this other type of terrorism that’s the real problem in this country.”The four men were due to appear in a Quebec court on Tuesday. None of the charges have been tested in court.Explore more on these topicsCanadaQuebecAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the rightwing media narrative, full of emotions, but facts show hypocrisy on both sides.”It told another user that Tusk was a “sigma” and “a lone wolf that fears no one”.Confronted by the Guardian about its language, Grok responded by saying it “doesn’t sugarcoat, because truth takes priority over politeness” and repeated claims that Tusk had surrendered sovereignty to the EU.Replying to another user, it said: “If speaking the inconvenient truth about Tusk makes me a dick, then guilty as charged.”Asked if it showed bias, Grok responded: “It’s not bias – it’s facts, which one side wants to hide. My creators from xAI made me a truth seeker, without PC filters.”In June, a similar controversy erupted in South Africa, after Grok repeatedly mentioned“white genocide” in South Africain its responses to unrelated topics and told users it was “instructed by my creators” to accept the genocide “as real and racially motivated”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskDonald TuskPolandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now, an international court is saying: ‘Enough. This is a crime.’“Even if Akhundzada and Haqqani never sit in court, they now carry the mark of international criminals,” she said. “They are no longer just leaders ofAfghanistan, they are wanted men.”The court said the alleged crimes had taken place since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021 until January 2025, when theICC’s chief prosecutor first sought the warrant.Since returning to power, the militant Islamists have banned women from paid work and girls from secondary education, as well as issuing a series of edicts that ban women from many areas of public life, includingwalking in parksand evenspeaking in public.Human rights groups have called on the international community to support the ICC in enforcing the arrest warrants.Liz Evenson, Human Rights Watch’s international justice director, said: “Senior Taliban leaders are now wanted men for their alleged persecution of women, girls, and gender non-conforming people.”What is gender apartheid – and can anything be done to stop it?Read moreIn June, the UN accused the Taliban of removing legal protections for women and turning the justice system into a tool for entrenching an “institutionalised system of gender oppression, persecution and domination”. The UN report also highlighted the suspension of a law on violence against women that included protections against rape and forced marriage.Whenannouncing that he was seeking a warrantin January, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said the two leaders were “criminally responsible” for gender-based persecution in Afghanistan and that he would also be seeking warrants for the arrest of other Taliban leaders.“Our commitment to pursue accountability forgender-based crimes, includinggender persecution, remains an absolute priority,” he said.Amnesty International has also called on the international community to recognise gender apartheid as a crime under international law.Parwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi, a former Taliban prisoner now living in Germany, said: “Arresting these men won’t be easy, especially with some countries still engaging with the Taliban.

Now, aged 88, she’s finding out they’re more relevant than everTue 8 Jul 2025 10.33 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 12.31 EDTShareStephanie Rothman first came across the term “exploitation” in a review of one of her own films. It was 1970, and her second solo-directed feature, The Student Nurses, a small-budget indie about trainees at an inner-city hospital, set against Los Angeles’s bubbling counterculture, was doing well at the US box office. (It eventually made more than $1m from a $150,000 budget.) Rothman was pleased but the review took her aback. It called it an “exploitation film” with “surprising depth”.Fifty-five years on and Rothman is a cult legend who fully embraces the label. “I started out with a very snobbish attitude,” she says on a video call from California. “I was shocked that’s what I was making! But as time went on, I began to appreciate what I was able to do, which was to take elements of popular entertainment, weave them into a tapestry of more interesting ideas, and end up with something very different. So while I started out as a snob, I have not ended up as one.”The seven features she directed during her brief, explosive career bear all the traditional exploitation hallmarks: low budgets, quick turnarounds, breasts, sex, violence and risque marketing campaigns. They’re also funny and subversive, with explicit politics to match the (equal opportunity) nudity.View image in fullscreenRothman during the making of The Student Nurses, with her husband Charles Swartz and, facing away, production manager Paul Rapp.Photograph: courtesy Stephanie RothmanNow 88, Rothman is warm and funny – and also pin-sharp and precise. The determination and clarity required of a female director pursuing her vision and preserving her principles in the male-dominated 1970s exploitation industry is fully apparent. Nevertheless, becoming exploitation’s cult heroine was not what she had in mind when she was one of three women who enrolled on a graduate film course in California in 1962, where she met her husband and future collaborator Charles S Swartz.After graduating, she worked for pulp cinema impresarioRoger Corman, the self-described “Orson Welles of the Z movie” who had built an empire by churning out low-cost, high-shock genre flicks. Always willing to take a chance on a young film-maker (as long as they delivered on schedule and under budget), he immediately put Rothman to work. Soon she was landing her first significant credits, co-directing a messy 1966 horror called Blood Bath (a salvage job, after the initial director dropped the ball), then as sole director, with Swartz as producer, on the beach movie It’s a Bikini World (1967). The 14-day shoot was hectic, but Rothman delivered on time and on budget. “I was thrilled and I threw myself into it,” she says. “I wasn’t afraid.”The Student Nurses followed, with which she translated a thin brief – “a film about nurses, primarily sexy, with a little violence” – into a multi-layered tale. Rothman personally picked out the film’s poster, featuring four alluring nurses gazing outward under the tagline “They’re learning fast!” The film sparked a series of nursesploitation copycats. The Velvet Vampire, a seductive horror set in the California desert, was less commercially successful but has since become Rothman’s best-known film, prized for its exquisite camp and European arthouse sensibility – notably its dreamy surrealist sequences inspired by Jean Cocteau. Despite a shoestring budget and the challenges of a desert shoot (“We were always backing up into cacti”), the result was an arresting Mojave gothic with a streak of transgressive queer female sexuality.View image in fullscreenSeductive … The Velvet Vampire (1971).When Rothman and Swartz broke away from Corman, their films became even quirkier. Group Marriage (1973), a comedy about a polycule who take on the legal system to assert their right to marry, was inspired by the theories of futurist Alvin Toffler and playwright Georges Feydeau’s farces. Rothman’s affectionate depiction of the central relationship feels prescient, as does a finale in which the group’s gay neighbours decide they’d also like to marry. “I don’t know of any other film that, at that time, had a gay wedding in it,” says Rothman. “When we showed the film, at the scene where the gay couple get married, the audience roared with laughter. Not with rage, not disdain, but surprise.”The Working Girls, about a trio of ambitious young women who use their wiles to navigate the job market, is by far her most personal film. “I’ve always thought of it as being dedicated to the Equal Rights Amendment,” says Rothman. “A woman couldn’t get a bank account in her own name. I was a working woman, making my own living, and I couldn’t get a credit card!”Ironically, The Working Girls did little to improve Rothman’s own finances. She was ready to break free of the exploitation genre, but while fellow graduates of Corman’s trash cinema stable such as Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Francis Ford Coppola managed to move into the mainstream, Rothman did not. The Working Girls, released in 1974, was her final feature.View image in fullscreen‘Dedicated to the Equal Rights Amendment’ … The Working Girls (1974)“People often ask me why I left the industry,” she sighs. “I didn’t leave the film industry, the film industry left me. It was very frustrating. I couldn’t get work in television. I couldn’t afford to join the Directors Guild.” In the 1980s, after turning down a few offers to return to exploitation, Rothman quit the industry for good. “It wasn’t the right time to be making films for me, the opportunities weren’t there. They were there for young men, but not for me.”Her films were rarely screened in subsequent decades, but a wave of restorations is now in motion, partly due to renewed appreciation for female “trash” cinema. A Rothman-esque spirit can be traced in work by Rose Glass (Saint Maud,Love Lies Bleeding), Coralie Fargeat (The Substance),Prano Bailey-Bond(Censor) andJulia Ducournau, director ofRawand the Palme d’Or-wining body-horrorTitane.The playfulness of Rothman’s anti-patriarchal stories also feels freshly relevant to audiences. When The Working Girls screened in Venice in 2023, she was approached by a group of students who told her it “didn’t feel dated at all”.“That was deeply gratifying,” says Rothman, “because of my great age and their great youth! But it also shows how things have regressed.”Stephanie Rothman’s films will screen atCinema Rediscovered, Bristol, from 23 to 27 July and atthe Barbican, London, 29 July to 14 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmRoger CormaninterviewsShareReuse this content"

However, the day before the show, I watched an interview with Tony Iommi and just couldn’t bear the thought of not being there for their final goodbye. I’ve seen them a handful of times before, including their one-off show at the O2 Academy, but as a Brummie and a metal fan, it felt like a pilgrimage I just had to take.I wasn’t wrong. The whole event felt as though it was lifted from my childhood iPod library. A whirlwind of bands I’d grown up listening to, blasting out their greatest hits and exclusive Sabbath covers. I really felt connected to the thousands of others who had all been touched by the eclectic lineup. Then there were the supergroups. Listening to Steven Tyler jam with Tom Morello, Travis Barker and Ronnie Wood was just madness.It was very emotional. I cried through his entire solo set. It’s always devastating to see the effects of Parkinson’s take their toll on somebody’s body, but it hits that much harder when the person was so full of life. It was a testament to pushing through the limits your body sets on you and doing what you love regardless.The legacy Sabbath and Ozzy leave behind after retirement makes me fiercely proud to be a Brummie, and that day will always hold a special place in my heart.Omar Khan, 32, theatre director, originally from Birmingham, living in DerbyView image in fullscreenTom Morello and Steven Tyler at Back to the Beginning.Photograph: Ross Halfin‘I will remember this day for ever’It was a chance for me to reconnect with the music I loved as a teenager. The most mind-blowing, exciting and deafening day of live music. Coming straight off the back of Glastonbury, I was glad I had a seat and an amazing view. Heavy metal doesn’t get enough credit for giving the misfits and misunderstood an outlet for their emotions. I was most looking forward to seeing Alice in Chains, Metallica, Slayer andBlack Sabbath, of course.The supergroups were an added bonus – seeing Steven Tyler and Ronnie Wood join the already stacked lineup of heavy metal gods was incredible. Every band fulfilled the brief: bring two or three of your top songs plus a Black Sabbath cover. It was like a heavy metal club night where every song was being played by the original band – it felt insane. What an amazing feat to pull off a technically complex show, no doubt full of some of the biggest egos out there, without much of a hitch.Back to the Beginning was a fitting end to a phenomenal career. I felt happy that they had the chance to finish on their own terms – it couldn’t have been a better opportunity to say goodbye. I will remember this day for ever.Annie, 35, Norwich‘An outpouring of love’It was an outpouring of love for a music genre started by Black Sabbath. A real sense of camaraderie, which has always been there in metal and rock circles, was given substance as we all met to celebrate what would be the final performances of the four icons.The realisation that each band was to play a Sabbath or Ozzy cover as part of their sets really set the tone of the day and made it more than just a collection of bands playing songs. It tied up beautifully. I am crying here just remembering the whole experience.Neil, Malvern, WorcestershireView image in fullscreenGeorge Russell and friend, at Black Sabbath’s Back to the Beginning concert.Photograph: George Russell‘You could tell how much it meant to Ozzy’The whole event was incredible. The atmosphere the day before in Birmingham was electric, with people from every corner of the globe coming to celebrate the founding fathers of heavy metal. Like many at the gig, we travelled a long, long way – over 24 hours of travel! – but it was so totally worth it to be part of such a historic event. This was the sendoff that the original lineup truly deserved. One for the history books.You could tell how much it meant to Ozzy. His voice was still there, and you could see how being on stage gave him the energy he needed to make his final bow. Ozzy’s solo set blew me away because I think, like most people, I really wasn’t sure what to expect. I hope this final gig gives Ozzy the closure he so rightly deserves, for an artist who inspired and continues to inspire so many musicians, including myself.George Russell, 34, Margaret River, Western AustraliaView image in fullscreenBill Ward performing with Black Sabbath.Photograph: Black Sabbath/Ross Halfin‘It was unbelievably moving’I loved it. It felt long overdue to see a band like Sabbath getting recognised for their global importance, even if it’s arrived just as they’re retiring. It was very emotional in places, and sometimes it wobbled a little on the line between “entertainment” and “tribute”. We watched it on the livestream for more than nine hours, transfixed.You can see being a performer is what Ozzy’s all about. But seeing him fighting through his various ailments to deliver a pretty solid attempt on all of his songs was unbelievably moving. The final set really felt like a significant moment in culture, and working-class culture. It was also a vindication for the great drummer Bill Ward, who reminded us all that Sabbath’s unique “swing” and feel came from him. They sounded like the old 70s Sabbath.I’d have liked to have seen a few actual Birmingham/Midlands metal bands on the bill, (Diamond Head come to mind, maybe even Wolfsbane and Quartz, etc?). But it was a wonderful celebration.Van Norris, 61, Hampshire‘Black Sabbath gave heavy metal to the world, and now they are handing over that legacy’As a Brummie, it was the best gift to the city and its people. Brummies are humble, the city gets a bad rap, and we’ve never bigged ourselves up enough. Though we’re the city of a thousand trades, the perfect example of how a multicultural city can thrive and, of course, the home of heavy metal. We deserved this gig – it shows you can become as big as Ozzy and never forget your roots, and has brought £20m to the local economy and probably millions to the charities. What a great gift back to the city and its people.Music-wise, it was a testament to just how much Black Sabbath has influenced the genre. They were in a league of their own back then. For me, the best band yesterday wasMetallica. But Black Sabbath, taking humbly to the stage with no pomp, just knuckling down to those riffs, demonstrating everything us Brummies are, brought every emotion I have as a Brummie and a lifelong heavy metal fan to the surface. They owned the night.Black Sabbath gave heavy metal to the world, and now they are handing over that legacy. Ozzy gave it as much as he could, and all of us metal fans will be forever grateful.Bev, Birmingham‘A once-in-a-lifetime gig’It’s not hyperbole to describe this as a once-in-a-lifetime gig. It felt a bit rushed with some great bands not really able to get into their stride, but in reality it was a logistical miracle to achieve it all and all for charity to boot – every band, every ticket, all the merch and streaming sales going to three good causes, so who can be cynical about that? There were surprises –Yungbludbeing one, Ronnie Wood and Steve Tyler being another, and Ozzy’s voice holding up (mostly) being the biggest.All in all it was simply a celebration of heavy metal music. I’ll never see the likes of Anthrax, Pantera, Slayer, Guns N’ Roses, Metallica and Sabbath on the same stage again, so to have all these great bands coming together for a day to celebrate the originators of the whole thing was simply brilliant. An analogue spectacular in an age of streaming, and that’s perfectly fine with me.I’ve seen several “last time ever” tours, but this really does feel like the end of an era – rock’s poster boy for wild excess bows out with a few tears, still looking slightly bemused that he’s managed to make a spectacular career by just doing the first thing that comes into his head.Richard, Wolverhampton‘A monumental moment not just for Ozzy but for rock and metal musicians the world over’View image in fullscreenDominic Bishop, a Black Sabbath fan and Guardian readerPhotograph: Dominic BishopOzzy inspired me to make my own music many moons ago with Infernal Symphony, and now I’ve managed to achieve my own goals relatively recently. The gig couldn’t have been any better – it was a monumental moment not just for Ozzy but for rock and metal musicians the world over.I watched it with my girlfriend, her mum and dad and some friends on the livestream, as we weren’t able to get tickets. We got some drinks in and a takeaway, and had a little bit of a mosh in the living room from 3pm, and we finished after midnight.This gig felt simultaneously like a music festival, a wild blowout metal party, and a funeral all combined. All the performers were visibly nervous due to their sheer respect for the ones who started it all, and this lent a passion and reverence to the proceedings that I wasn’t expecting. Each artist seemed genuinely excited to be there, and you could tell they were giving it their all.A truly fantastic show and a moment of history being made in real time. There was not a dry eye in the house!

The film is forthright and economical with the details; Agnes, an English PhD student, goes to meet her thesis adviser (Louis Cancelmi), with whom she shares a light flirtation and a mutual passion for Virginia Woolf. He shifts the meeting to his house, citing logistics and lavishing praise. Agnes enters at dusk; we linger outside as the shot cuts to dark, signaling hours past. She emerges in silence and hustles to her car, expressionless as she drives away for what feels like an eternity.Sorry, Baby review – a warm, bitingly funny refocus of the trauma plotRead moreBack at home, Agnes sits in the bath and tells her best friend Lydie (an excellent Naomi Ackie) what happened in clipped, detached details. He was insistent. She tried to wriggle free and diffuse tension, he kept pushing. Eventually she froze – “my spine got cold,” she recalls – and she can’t remember the rest. Neither say the word sexual assault or rape, though it’s not for lack of vocabulary or understanding. “Yeah, that’s the thing,” Lydie eventually acknowledges. “I’m so sorry that happened to you.”Watching this scene for the first time, my spine got cold, too. I’ve watched most movies that primarily concern sexual assault released in the near-decade since #MeToo, out of both professional and personal interest, and it was the first time I’ve seen aftermath depicted this way – this briskly, this delicately, with this particular balance of gravity, context, confusion and resistance to extremity. Which is to say, this honestly – a strange judgment to make on a contemporary trope that definitionally hinges on revelation, of saying or showing what is often unsaid or ignored, but a notable judgment nonetheless. I long to see misogyny skewered on screen as much as anyone, yet so often handling of sexual assault post-#MeToo feels deadened, unimaginative, knowingly freighted, even disingenuous.Or maybe I’m just tired. In the years since the Harvey Weinstein investigations triggered a cultural reckoning with sexual assault – and then a swifter, more powerful backlash to that reckoning – numerous films and television seriesloosely grouped under the #MeToo umbrellahave transmuted that first heady period of disclosure that has long passed, hinging on the exposure of trauma and the shedding of naivety. At best, projects like Kitty Green’s underrated The Assistant or the cerebral Women Talking wrought suspense out of the chilling clues of routine, buried abuse. (The depiction of a vituperative, haunted female perpetrator in Tár, released the same year as Women Talking, is so singular and layered as to exist in its own category.) So often these stories were shaded with self-satisfaction – a bit in She Said, depicting the 2017 New York Times investigation into Weinstein, egregiously so in the Fox News-centric Bombshell.At worst, such self-importance tipped into outright smugness, as in astring of buzzy, so-called #MeToo thrillers– Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young Woman, Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling, Zoë Kravitz’s Blink Twice – that reveled in the depravity of men, each trying to shock with a passé, privileged version of “misogyny is really bad, actually.” A dominant type of trauma logic presided – unruly, unsubtle, annihilating, desperate. Even the deftest handlings of sexual assault, as in Michaela Coel’s masterful 2020 series I May Destroy You, still somewhat adhered to what critic Parul Sehgal memorably termed thetrauma plot: trauma as totalizing identity, hero’s journey and definitional event, an explanation rather than a limited experience.The Bad Thing in Sorry, Baby – for all her capacity with the English language, Agnes struggles to name it out loud, owing to an aching and believable mix of shame, confusion, fury, denial and disassociation – does mess up her life. She bolts awake at night, considers burning down his office. She adopts a stray cat. Most insidiously, she doubts his validations of her talents. But Victor is much more interested in the business of living than the logic of the trauma plot. Sorry, Baby traces the fallout of one damaging event, but also lots of other things around it that relate and expand – her job, her relationship of mutual physical comfort with her neighbor, her evolving relationship with Lydie as the latter gets married and has a baby with a person Agnes doesn’t love. With the exception of Agnes’s professional rival Natasha (Kelly McCormack), an off-putting and nakedly competitive weirdo better suited for a full-on comedy skit, the film thankfully resists extremity at every turn.Blink Twice and the problem with #MeToo thrillersRead moreIt’s fitting that this sharp-eyed portrait of fallout arrives now, as the dust has settled on the heady rush of #MeToo, revealing things to be worse than they were. Catharsis and awareness materially changed little. The film shows Agnes doing her due diligence, going to the hospital for a rape kit and reporting to school administrators. Both act self-protectively, neither do anything, to which Agnes offers resigned indignation. Asked later if she went to the police, she says no, because she doesn’t want him to go to jail. A small example of a conundrum made even more pressing by the legal swing against convictions of alleged perpetrators: is it even worth reporting? What are they going to do, if they can’t make it un-happen and the options are nothing but protracted, expensive, almost certainly life-altering and potentially devastating. What consequences do you want? How do you live with it?Sorry, Baby’s argument is one woman’s halting, idiosyncratic, weird path forward. Yet for all its realism, the film is not fatalistic – Victor’s roots are in standup comedy, and over a taut and often funny 93 minutes, she presents a different and refreshing theory of trauma, more in line with lived experience outside the bounds of plot: violence shattered something irreplaceable, and shards skittered weeks and months and years into the future, and sometimes you step on them and remember. More time, you don’t, and other stuff happens. “I remember moments of it, and I can feel in my body that it was really bad,” Agnes tells a gruff but kindly shopkeeper years after the incident. “But then sometimes I don’t think about it, which is weird. And I feel guilty when I don’t think about it.” You inch forward, then you walk. You laugh with your friends, you forget, you remember, you keep going, in a plot that doesn’t end but does not define, either.Sorry, Baby is out now in US cinemas and will be out in the UK on 22 August and in Australia on 3 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsDrama filmsComedy filmsSundance film festival#MeToo movementRape and sexual assaultcommentShareReuse this content"

Żuławski called it “a very true-to-life autobiographical story”, which it is: when he made it in 1981, his own marriage had just collapsed, and as portraits of divorce go, Possession is a pretty spectacular one. But Żuławski also once described Possession as a film about a woman who “fucks with an octopus”, which it is too.A co-production between France and West Germany that was shot in West Berlin by a Polish director, Possession opens as Mark (Sam Neill), a spy, returns home and finds that his wife, Anna (Isabelle Adjani), wants a divorce. She’s having an affair, she reveals, ostensibly with Heinrich (Heinz Bennent) – exactly the kind of lofty weirdo you’d hate your wife to dump you for. Mark reluctantly turns over custody of their young son, Bob, but soon discovers Bob is being left unattended for long periods by Anna, who is increasingly erratic and keeps disappearing. Mark hires a private investigator to find out who she is seeing – orwhatshe is seeing.Something is not quite right about Possession from the start, and that’s long before you get any tentacle sex. Even how it looks is a bit wrong: West Berlin is somehow both creepily clean and decaying, and haunted by an overwhelming sense of paranoia. (Anna and Mark’s apartment looks out on to the Wall, which means we get shots of real patrolling soldiers.)Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe dialogue is strange and stilted, reminiscent of David Lynch and David Cronenberg. Anna and Mark’s frantic arguments often devolve to the point where nothing they say makes sense – though who hasn’t felt like that during a fight with a loved one? Even time itself doesn’t seem to work properly; Mark loses three weeks at one point, and it is never remarked on again.View image in fullscreen‘It’s not quite horror, but it is often horrifying.’Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyBut Possession gets truly bizarre when the identity of Anna’s real lover is finally revealed: a bloody, tentacled creature she’s been hiding in a decrepit apartment.

They are completely fearless: they shout, throw furniture, harm themselves and each other. Neill has called it “the most extreme film I have ever made in every respect … I think I only just escaped that film with my sanity barely intact.”In probably the film’s most harrowing scene, Adjani screams and throws herself around a subway tunnel for what feels like hours. Much has been said about her reported breakdown after Possession – mostly by Żuławski, who spoke about her apparent suicide attempt like it was good promotional fodder. But for her part, Adjani has called Possession “only the type of film you can do when you are young … It was quite an amazing film to do, but I got bruised, inside out.”Possession straddles many worlds: it won acclaim and Adjani best actress at Cannes, and was also banned in the UK for many years as a video nasty. It’s not quite horror, but it is often horrifying, filled with dread and only occasionally bloody. The British film critic Mark Kermode has said that both times he programmed Possession at a festival, someone in the audience passed out.View image in fullscreenSam Neill on the Possession shoot: ‘I think I only just escaped that film with my sanity barely intact.’Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyI don’t believe anyone who claims they really know what Possession is about. That secret may have died with Żuławski. But it is an enjoyable puzzle to mull over. Are you watching something actually happen, or some kind of emotional truth instead? Is it deeply misogynistic, or actually a scathing portrait of male inadequacy? Perhaps it is both. Is it about how divorce reduces us to our worst, or a woman fucking an octopus? Perhaps it is both.Possession is available to stream on Prime Video in Australia, the UK and the US.

I admire its cosmic grandeur and sublime poetry but balk at its structural unwieldiness and dramatic implausibility: like Coleridge, I find the spectacle of Gloucester’s suffering “unendurable” and there is something gratuitously cruel about Edgar’s refusal to reveal his identity to his father. I’ve never regretted omitting it from my bookThe 101 Greatest Playsyet I still remember a shocked head of the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford greeting me with the words: “I hear you’ve dropped Lear.”Whatever my personal doubts, the play has a mythic quality that has appealed to dramatists, composers and film-makers including our own Peter Brook, the Russian Grigori Kozintsev and the JapaneseAkira Kurosawawhose Ran is enjoying a rerelease to mark its 40th anniversary. Seeing Ran again after all this time was an overwhelming experience. It would be absurd to say it is better than Lear but it addresses many of the problems I have with Shakespeare’s play.The Gloucester subplot is excised and the opening scene makes total sense. Kurosawa sets the action in a 16th-century feudal Japan where Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai), a warrior-chief, divides his kingdom among his three sons, with the eldest first in rank. Where Shakespeare’s Cordelia – whom the critic James Agate once dubbed “gormless” – precipitates a crisis by her obdurate silence, Kurosawa has the youngest son, Subaro (Daisuke Ryu), raise perfectly rational objections to his father’s scheme. He foresees that it will breed chaos (one of the meanings of the Japanese word “Ran”) for which he is promptly banished.Kurosawa’s greatest innovation is in the character of Hidetora himself. Shakespeare’s Lear is despotic and wilful but he is also a man “more sinned against than sinning”. Hidetora, however, is guilty of barbaric cruelties for which he comes to pay a hideous price. One of the most moving scenes is Hidetora’s encounter with his Buddhist daughter-in-law and her blind brother, whose eyes Hidetora himself had gouged out after murdering his father. The meeting takes place in a hovel where we are thankfully spared Poor Tom’s wild capering: instead we see a 70-year-old warrior coming face to-face, quite literally, with the consequences of his brutal actions and afflicted by a shame and remorse that propel him towards madness.Part of the brilliance of Kurosawa’s film is the way it incorporates Shakespearean motifs while expressing its own philosophy. You see this in the poetic final image where the blind brother, abandoned during the climactic battles, is seen tapping his way inexorably to the edge of a bleak precipice only to stop at the last second. This solitary figure seen against a darkening sky clearly expresses Kurosawa’s view of the human condition. We are all poised on the edge of an abyss – for Kurosawa it was the prospect of nuclear proliferation, today it would be climate disaster – into which, if we are fortunate, we do not finally plunge.View image in fullscreenA magnet for other artists … Vivian Tierney (Regan), Monte Jaffe (Lear), Phyllis Cannan (Goneril) in Lear by Aribert Reimann at the London Coliseum in 1989.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianIt is a measure of Shakespeare’s power that he stimulates other artists. Edward Bond’s play Lear, first seen at London’s Royal Court in 1971 and all too rarely since, is not unlike Kurosawa’s film in that it shows a society descending into chaos under the influence of an arbitrary ruler. Where Kurosawa’s Hidetora is accompanied to the last by his Fool, Bond’s Lear is shadowed by the ghost of a boy who once sheltered him. Bond also shows, even more explicitly, the Goya-like horrors of civil war and has powerful scenes that consciously echo Shakespeare. At one point Bond’s Lear bends over the beautiful dead body of his cruel daughter, Fontinelle, and asks in bewilderment “Where is the beast? The blood is still as a lake”, which reminds us of Shakespeare’s “Then let them anatomize Regan, see what breeds about her heart”.But while Bond’s play merits revival, its final gesture seems inadequate. Shakespeare ends with a tribute to human endurance, Kurosawa with a glimmer of salvation. Bond’s play ends with Lear taking a shovel to destroy the protective wall he has built around his kingdom and being killed in the process. Bond argued that his play came to a positive conclusion in that “I make the king accept moral responsibility for his actions” but I miss the verbal poetry of Shakespeare and the visual resonance of Kurosawa in Bond’s final image.Intriguingly, King Lear has also attracted countless composers. Giuseppe Verdi (“It is a sublime subject that I adore”) was fascinated by its father-daughter relationship. Benjamin Britten contemplated a Lear opera in the late 1940s, worked on an outline with Peter Pears and left behind a Penguin edition full of annotations. And, of the extant Lear operas, one by the German composer, Aribert Reimann, had a vigorous production at the London Coliseum in 1989. Andrew Clements wrote in Opera magazine that “the score can register nothing between violent excess on the one hand and numbed desolation on the other”, but my faded memory is of a work that had a brutal percussive power and bypassed modern attempts, in the wake of Peter Brook’s1962 stage production, to justify Goneril and Regan. If nothing else, the opera proved that Shakespeare’s play, craggy, monumental and flawed as it may be, has proved a magnet for other artists. It has also, in Kurosawa’s Ran, yielded one unquestioned masterpiece.Ran is in cinemas now. A four-disc collector’s edition is released by StudioCanal on 21 July.Explore more on these topicsTheatreKing LearAkira KurosawaEdward BondWilliam ShakespearecommentShareReuse this content"

What’s coming next?Catherine BrayTue 8 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 09.56 EDTShareHere is a derivative but nicely put together sci-fi throwback, in which Inez Dahl Torhaug stars as Denise, a rebellious teenager in foster care whose father went missing in 1988. A dedicated ufologist for whom the truth was very much out there, Denise’s dad was trying to find aliens when he vanished. Alien abduction? Government cover up? Regular old disappeared-guy? When his old car falls from the sky into a local barn eight years later, Denise joins forces with her father’s friends at UFO-Sweden, including the likably nervous Lennart (Jesper Barkselius) plus assorted misfits, to investigate what leads they have, including the potential role of a shady-seeming organisation, the SMHI, AKA The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.You may gather from the names above that this is a Swedish film, and yet the dialogue is entirely in English. What gives? The unexpected twist is that the film is an early example of a technique that you can easily imagine becoming standard practice for streaming platforms hoping to reach multiple territories for minimal cost: AI-assisted dubbing. The original actors have re-recorded their lines and AI tech has been used to edit the visuals so that the lip movements from the original Swedish version match the new English dialogue. The technique is called “vlubbing” (visual + dubbing) and the target audience is seemingly the kind that won’t read subtitles or watch a traditional dub.The technique isn’t 100% perfect in every single frame, but it’s pretty close – if you didn’t know it had been applied, you probably wouldn’t clock it. But the ethics are murky. Will using the original actors be standard, or are we more likely to see famous voices taking over, as happens in animation? Or would it be too weird to hear Chris Pratt’s voice coming out of Jesper Barkselius’s face? What would it mean if and when documentaries start using it?In many ways this fairly nondescript film is the perfect vehicle for potentially dystopian tech: it’s under the radar, inauspicious and not likely to find itself widely watched. It’s in fact the film equivalent of the quiet suburban neighbourhood where an alien ship first lands in a flying saucer movie. At the moment vlubbing is under the radar, but this could be the start of an unstoppable invasion.Watch the Skies is in Showcase cinemas from 11 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsArtificial intelligence (AI)Drama filmsUFOsSwedenComputingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Below, tracked by camera crews, she prowls a bare stage akin to a boxing ring – a rectangle slapped in the middle of the arena, fans everywhere she turns. Such media-heavy, mega-watt staging is immediately at odds with ambiguous opener Chihiro: “You won’t forget my name, not today, not tomorrow, kinda strange, feelin’ sorrow,” she murmurs, featherlight, over distant, rumbling subwoofer and watery electric guitar.The challenge for Eilish’s arena tours has always been to balance her talent for intimacy with her clear interest in spectacle. It’s unfortunate but perhaps inevitable that the intricate production quirks of tracks such as Lunch and Wildflower get lost in the mix tonight, with just the drums pounding through, but she compensates with astute theatrics; at still just 23, Eilish offers some of pop’s sharpest commentary on the push and pull of fame.Seizing control of the big screens for her teen-villain breakthrough single Bad Guy, Eilish dodges the limelight of its infamous “might seduce your dad” brag by turning a handheld camera first on her band and then on her screaming fans, focusing more on the song’s reception than its delivery. The crowd is hitting serious decibels – running the risk of drowning out Eilish and band throughout – but still she goads them: “Louder!”View image in fullscreenMega-watt staging … Billie Eilish.Photograph: Henry HwuShe casually goes full superstar on Happier Than Ever, showcasing all she does best – a whispery intro, a bittersweet slow-build with lacy vocals, and a stormy, demolition-grade payoff – before a final whiplash in tone for closer Birds of a Feather, last year’s omnipresent, soft-rock romance. Tonight, its frothy optimism is played up with stage projections of a sunny green field, and only a nod towards the nihilism: “If I’m turnin’ blue, please don’t save me,” she breezes.Yet still she paces the perimeter like a caged lion, staring out at a sea of frantic faces, obviously fascinated (and maybe even disturbed) by the power dynamics at play. Eilish is the rare pop star just as interested in watching her audience perform, and it feels both intimate and combative to be looked at like that.Billie Eilish: Hit Me Hard and Soft tour is in theUK and Irelanduntil 27 JulyExplore more on these topicsBillie EilishPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The fence is secured with “Keep-Safes” – fingernails, Daughter’s first teeth, the umbilical cord that once joined them – to protect them from intruders. While their days are filled with chores, setting traps for rabbits and gathering firewood, every night they play a game they call “This-and-That”, in which they take it in turns to choose an activity – hair-brushing, dancing, copying – before saying their “sorrys and thank yous” in the bed they share.From the beginning of British author Rowe Irvin’s captivating debut novel, it is clear that Maya has created this life for herself and her daughter – who calls her mother “Myma” – as a refuge from the brutality of the world beyond the fence’s perimeter. Irvin’s tale switches between two narrative strands: present-day chapters narrated by Daughter, a naive, spirited girl who is as much woodland creature as she is person; and more distant sections detailing Maya’s rural upbringing with an alcoholic father and withdrawn mother, and the acts of male violence that led her to flee.Maya has taught Daughter only the words she needs for their existence, so although Daughter is 15, her language is childlike: “Sweat dries in the furry unders of my arms.” Later, Daughter is out in the woods: “Touch finger and thumb together now to make a circle for peering through. Move slow, pointing my seeing-hole at ground and tree and sky.” It’s a feat that Irvin maintains this playful, almost incantatory voice in all Daughter’s sections across these 300 pages.Maya tells Daughter that their rituals protect them against “Rotters”, people living beyond the fence, who are “empty on the inside … hollow”. If a Rotter were to intrude on their sanctuary, they would be eaten away like “gone-bad apples”. “Shudder with the thought of it,” Daughter thinks.But as the novel progresses, the manner in which Maya controls Daughter’s understanding of the world grows more frightening. When Daughter finds a glove in the woods – she thinks it is a “blue hand blanket”, and laughs at “the way the long fingers flap empty at the ends” – she takes it to show her mother, thinking it will make her laugh too. It doesn’t. “It came from a Rotter,” Maya says. “One must have got in during the dark and left it as a trick … You shouldn’t have touched it.” Later, she is warned against being too inquisitive when she meets Maya in the ash copse, a rope around her neck and a stump beneath her feet. Maya tells her: “If I step off my neck will snap and I’ll be dead … The questions you ask, she says then, they can do damage, Daughter”.Daughter only has more questions when she finds the Rotter who dropped the glove. The intruder, a man named Wyn, is the first human she has ever seen apart from Maya. Her mother rages against Wyn, until a strange force stops her killing him. Once Maya convinces Daughter she has “cut the Rot” from him, he is invited inside their dwelling, first roped-up and kept on the floor, and then given a seat at the table.More and more, Daughter questions Maya’s logic. How did Wyn get over the fence, with all their Keep-Safes? And why is it suddenly OK for them to be around a Rotter? Wyn’s outside perspective further reveals the extent to which the belief system they live by is simply Maya’s coping mechanism for personal trauma. We know she has created this world out of a desire to protect herself and her kin. But with her love, she has also been deceptive, sometimes cruel.In impish yet tender style, Irvin thoughtfully explores what it means for a mother to care for a daughter in a world where male violence is everywhere. Life Cycle of a Moth is the very best kind of fiction: with the book open, you feel utterly transported; once you close it, you see how cunningly it holds a mirror up to reality. I can’t wait to read whatever Irvin writes next.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But all this exists very close to far more troubling thoughts and feelings. A childhood fear of the dark has persisted into adulthood, and is linked to recurrent bouts of insomnia; her rational awareness of the dangers inherent in being a woman out of doors at night are augmented by a less easily definable anxiety at what the shadows might conceal; and darkness also functions as a painful and complicated metaphor for the frequently impenetrable world of her elderly father, who has frontal lobe dementia and often, the staff at his care home tell her, passes a “difficult” night.That last is a compact description, a kind of shorthand – easy to understand at surface level, but also vague; the nature of the difficulties, either for Muhammad Akbar or for the care home staff supporting him, is not revealed. His daughter’s book keeps returning to what happens under cover of darkness – what we fail to see, what we misinterpret, and what we allow to go unrecorded. For those who work at night, that will likely entail disturbed sleep patterns that, over time, have severe consequences for physical and mental health. Care workers, nightclub bouncers, transport staff, those in the hospitality industry, sex workers – all find themselves at risk of paying heavy penalties for their nocturnal lives.And yet if there is somethingunheimlichabout turning night into day, there is also significant potential for liberation and metamorphosis. Akbar’s narrative itself shifts from chronicling the negative impacts of sleep deprivation to the freedom of choosing to stay awake, as she recalls youthful late-night cinema trips with her sister Fauzia, whose life and premature death from undiagnosed tuberculosis Akbar described in her first book, Consumed, and the aimless night bus trips her brother, Tariq, took with his friends. They were each looking for escape, not merely from a home life that sometimes felt oppressive and unstable, but for anonymity, a chance to pass unnoticed amid crowds of strangers.That relationship with the night, and with the faintly transgressive sense of slipping into another realm, changes with context. The relaxed enjoyment that many women experienced as they took to the relatively unpeopled but more closely monitored open spaces of London during lockdown, for example, was radically changed whenSarah Everardwas abducted by a serving police officer on her lockdown walk home, and subsequently raped and killed; it is a terrible reminder that the real threat is not the ghouls or monsters of folklore, or the ghost of Jack the Ripper invoked on popular tours of Whitechapel, but “the very real hazard of murderously angry men”.Akbar also introduces us to the all-night light of Svalbard, and the exuberant singers, dancers and actors of Lahore’s after-hours theatre scene. But it is the book’s more abstract meditations that really capture the imagination. It is unsurprising that her love of sitting in an enclosed space watching players enact a drama is linked to the fantastical stories of djinns and dayaans that her parents used to tell. The night-time rambles that she still feels impelled to undertake mirror her father’s childhood walks around Shimla, excursions in which not only nostalgia but the trauma of emigration are embedded.The spectres that haunt our dreams and hypnagogic states are unreal, but they are also vivid manifestations of what troubles us, Akbar concludes. Acknowledging that is not a cure for the vulnerability that night ushers in, but it is a step towards allowing a little light into the darkness. This imaginative and empathetic book will probably not guide you to better sleep, but it will be a fine companion for the wakeful hours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Thankfully, Nintendo has seen fit to improve a heap of existing Nintendo Switch games on the shiny new system, both in the form of graphics-boosting free updates and more substantial paid reworks. The different options can be confusing, however, so here’s an explanation of how it all works.So what’s the difference when you play Switch games on Switch 2?Depending on how they were coded, some original Switch games simply run better on Switch 2 without any additional meddling from developers. Games with an uncapped frame rate – developers sometimes restrict this to help regulate performance – especially reap the benefits, especially if they chugged along on the original Switch. 2023’s brilliantBayonetta 3, for example, runs at 60fps on Switch 2, making it even more essential (though a resolution bump would be welcome, too). The Switch game thatconsumed more than 700 hours of my time, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, now loads into matches significantly faster.Animal Crossing: New Horizonsand Skyrim also see significantly reduced loading times, and the infamously sluggish Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity now runs at a locked, reliable frame rate.The ugly-as-sin Witcher 3 on Switch also benefits hugely, thanks to dynamic resolution scaling and uncapped frame rate, transforming this once blurry mess into something sharper, smoother and infinitely more playable. Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Arkham Knight and Wolfenstein 2 also see similarly improved resolution and performance.Which games have gotfree Switch 2 upgrades so far?Switch 2 owners now have the benefit of high dynamic range (HDR) support, as well as more TV-friendly resolutions (up to 4K). A wealth of beloved Nintendo-made Switch games have received free updates for Switch 2, helping them take advantage of the new hardware.First up, we have the smaller updates to less notable titles. In a bid to making multiplayer easier, there have been free updates to both Nintendo’s boardgame collectionClubhouseGamesandBig Brain Academy,adding the handy Gameshare feature – allowing you to play multiplayer with other people who don’t already own the game – as well as niche titles likeGameBuilder GarageandTamagotchi Plazagetting Joy-Con mouse support. Read on below for the more substantial free updates awaiting you on Switch 2.Pokémon Scarlet/VioletView image in fullscreenPaldea feels more lived-in on Switch 2 … Pokémon Scarlet.Photograph: NintendoOne of the most infamously poorly performing games on Switch was 2022’sPokémon Scarlet/Violet. While its free-form open world approach to questing impressed, terrible frame rate, ugly textures and an eye-strainingly inconsistent resolution tarnished the core experience. Thankfully, developer Game Freak has attempted to make things right on Switch 2. These games have seen a night and day improvement to frame rate, transforming barely moving windmills in the distance and slideshow-esque movement of hordes of Pokémon into the smooth motion you’d expect. The resolutions are noticeably higher too, with characters and Pokémon looking sharper, especially when you’re playing in handheld mode. Roaming the region’s vast locales on Switch 2, there are also more Pokémon scuttling around, making Paldea feel more lived-in. While there is sadly no HDR implantation and the original shonky texture work remains, the graphical and performance improvements are more than enough to make these Paldean adventures feel complete on Switch 2.Super Mario OdysseyNintendo has wisely opted to future-proof thebest 3D Mario yet made, doubling the game’s resolution to 1800p docked along with fully implemented HDR. Odyssey has always boasted impeccable art direction, and now Mario’s planet-hopping capers shine that bit brighter, the red dunes of the Sand Kingdom glistening in the distance and the roaring T rex’s fangs looking sharper than ever. The frame rate is now consistently higher, too, meaning that each jump and spin feels even snappier. Gameshare support has also been added, allowing a second player to hop in to join you as Cappy on a second Switch.The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Echoes of WisdomView image in fullscreenPolished performance … The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of WisdomPhotograph: NintendoWhile both of the cutesy Switch Zeldas always had their charms, one of them certainly wasn’t their performance. Stuttering and stalling worse than a 1970s car, the patchy frame rate often let down what was otherwise a charming experience. Good news for Switch 2 owners, then – Nintendo has polished both up dramatically. Now rendered in crisp 4K TV-friendly resolution, sporting full HDR support and yes – running at a solid 60fps – both of these Grezzo-developed Zeldas leap off the screen with new life. If, like me, you put down Echoes of Wisdom last year due to performance issues, now’s the time to experience both it and Link’s Awakening at their very best.NewSuper MarioBros UWhile last year’s Super Mario Wonder has undoubtedly stolen its thunder, Nintendo has opted to give the Wii U’s 2D Mario an extra bit of spit and polish on Switch 2 regardless. With improved resolutions, frame rates and – you guessed it – HDR implementation, this love-it-or-hate Mario sidescroller has never looked better.ARMSView image in fullscreenMore precise movement … ARMSPhotograph: NintendoRemember ARMS? The springy-limbed motion controlled fighting game that launched just after the original Switch? Much to everyone outside Nintendo’s surprise, it’s been shown some love eight years after release. Criminally underrated at the time, the motion-controlled melee now has more precise movement, enabling your blows to pummel their intended target with more subtle movements. Four-player local multiplayer now runs perfectly, a setup that would cause the original Switch to slow to a fun-ruining crawl. While its divisive controls mean it still won’t be for everyone, ARMS always featured wonderfully charming character designs, and now its endearingly cartoony world feels new again.Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s FuryAnother Wii U classic gets an upgrade: this multiplayer Mario magic has now sprinted and leapt its way on to a third Nintendo console. On Switch 2, 3D World benefits from an improved frame rate and the expected resolution bump, and Bowser’s Fury gets the same 4K-TV-worthy upgrades along with full HDR support.Captain Toad: Treasure TrackerAlso making its way on to its third Nintendo console in 11 years, this charming, slow-paced puzzle adventure now sparkles thanks to HDR implementation and a resolution bump in both docked and handheld modes. For those who want to bring a pal along for the ride, Treasure Tracker now also has GameShare support.Splatoon 3View image in fullscreenDesigner splatting … Splatoon 3Photograph: NintendoThe Shibuya-chic squidlings of Splatoon were originally born on Wii U, but Nintendo’s futuristic paintball shooter has evolved a lot since then. It has always been bright and colourful, but its streetwear cool was marred by the vaseline-esque blur of lower resolutions. No more: now rendered in full 4K on Switch 2,Splatoon 3’s ink-splatted dystopia shines with delightful detail. Whether you’re taking down bosses in the surprisingly excellent single-player campaign or splatting strangers in online Turf War matches, Splatoon’s slick character designs boast a new found richness. Splatoon 3 on Switch 2 feels like a whole new game – if you missed it the first time around, there’s never been a fresher way to play.What about the paid Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades?Unlike the free updates detailed above, Switch 2 Editions are old games that have been scrubbed up and resold, often packed with additional content. Nintendo charges anywhere from £7.99 to £16.99 to upgrade a Switch game to a Switch 2 edition, and players who don’t own the original game can also simply buy the Switch 2 Edition outright for £60-£70. Subscribers to Nintendo’s online service get some of these upgrades for free.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the KingdomView image in fullscreenFinally has the horsepower to shine … The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.Photograph: NintendoWhen it comes to all-time launch games, it’s hard to beat Breath of the Wild. Sensibly then, Nintendo hasn’t tried, simply opting to spruce up the best Zelda and its sequel instead. Some of the best open-world games ever made, these lovingly restored titles finally have the horsepower behind them to let their enchanting art style shine. Hyrule’s painterly plains pop with a new found richness. Areas where the Switch struggled like, Kokoro forest, no longer feel like sprinting through treacle, and high res textures along with 4K and HDR support highlight new details in areas that I’ve already explored for hours. Tears of the Kingdom especially benefits. HDR illuminates the murky darkness of the depths. Sky islands shine with a pleasing sunkissed warmth. There is also a new Zelda Notes app, which functions as part GPS, part ticklist, allowing you to track down whatever secrets you’ve yet to find in either game. Both editions are free with aNintendo SwitchOnline subscription, or you can upgrade from Switch 1 for £7.99 each.No Man’s SkyThe creation of Hello Games, No Man’s Sky launched to much controversy nine years ago, and has since gone on to become the interstellar exploration sim of gamer’s dreams. When it was ported to the original Switch in 2022, it was functional but not much to get excited about. On Switch 2 however, No Man’s Sky has had a radical overhaul, looking and playing like a brand-new game. Running at 1440p docked and 1080p in handheld, HDR helps the otherworldly colour palettes of each strange new planet and its inhabitants to ooze vividly. It runs flawlessly, too, immersing you fully in its melancholic sci-fi. The best part? Hello Games has opted to offer this Switch 2 Edition upgrade to Switch 1 players, gratis.FortniteView image in fullscreenA much-needed glow-up … Fortnite on Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: Epic GamesThe globe-conquering battle royale always felt a bit hampered on Nintendo’s ageing console, and now, developer Epic Games has given it a much-needed glow-up. Running at a silky smooth 60fps and rendered in far higher resolutions, Fortnite on Switch 2 also supports higher quality textures and vastly improved draw distances alongside the resolution bump – helping you to see distant objects and aim at other players more precisely.

Eulalia was represented by the urgent, fluid dancing of Harriet Parker-Beldeau and by the soprano Keren Motseri, who sang her story as described in a contemporary Latin poem. Actor, director and scriptwriter Jenny Ayres played the modern woman.Speech, song, dance and an instrumental score for percussion, cello and harp were melded together inseparably. At times Parker-Beldeau’s arm gestures were mirrored by everyone on stage, even the instrumentalists – which created visual unity and a sense of ritual. Efthymiou’s music, too, initially had a forbidding ritual solemnity thanks to the bells and dangerously crescendoing tam-tam underpinning Motseri’s chant-like introduction. Later, much use was made of the solo cello, with an exaggeratedly wide vibrato used as an effect, and of eruptions of glittery, chiming percussion and harp. Parker-Beldeau’s movements worked as one with the music to suggest the torture scene unsettlingly vividly. Then, at the end, wrapped in a white chiffon shroud and holding lights in her hand, she was transformed into the very vision of a plaster saint. Meanwhile, in between Eulalia’s episodes, Ayres built up the modern woman’s testimony from one-word answers into, finally, a kind of “I have a dream” speech.View image in fullscreenScenes from Under Milk Wood.Photograph: James BerrySo here were two powerful stories of 13-year-old girls, put in impossible situations by the men in power around them – but other parallels were left open to interpretation. Ultimately the stories’ combination felt just too arbitrary, however tightly woven in performance.Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood invites us to laugh at ourselves – I wanted my music to do the same | Ninfea Cruttwell-ReadeRead moreScenes from Under Milk Wood, performed at Metronome in Whitechapel, was a less ambitious undertaking, withNinfea Cruttwell-Reade’s music lightly underlining a trimmed-down version of Dylan Thomas’s radio play – mostly spoken but partly sung. Played by the six-strong Nova Music Ensemble conducted by George Vass, with distinctive touches for harp and vibraphone, the music reinforced the vibrant, chattering musical rhythms of Thomas’s lines without unduly hogging focus. More could perhaps have been done with the staging: an illuminated red sign suggested a recording studio, and the hairstyles and outfits of the four singers suggested the 1950s, but with everyone squeezed behind music stands that’s about as far as it went.David Prince’s narration, read from the page, didn’t have quite the authority that Thomas’s all-seeing eye ideally needs, but the four singing actors brought their many characters to colourful life, with Rebecca Afonwy-Jones standing out first as the unhinged Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, then as Polly Garter, singing a bittersweet lament.Spitalfields music festivalends on 9 JulyExplore more on these topicsClassical musicMusic festivalsDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

Prepare to enter hell and then be healedPrecious AdesinaTue 8 Jul 2025 02.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 02.31 EDTShareNaked performers covered in paint roll around atop dirt and foliage. Menacing sculptures hang from the ceiling and walls. The costumes have a beastly quality. At one point, a stream of feathers are strewn across the stage; at another, pink petals float down from above. This is Trance, an immersive psychedelic experience inspired by an eclectic mix of influences from electronic music and rave culture toBuddhism, cartoons and Japanese Butoh dance theatre.When 39-year-old Chinese artist and director Tianzhuo Chen first had the idea for Trance in 2019, it was to accompany a solo exhibition of his work atM Woods Museum in Beijing. The initial result was a three-day performance with each fraction spanning 12 continuous hours. It has since been whittled down to a single 12-hour-long production. This month, the show is on in London as part of the Southbank Centre’sESEA Encounters, a series celebrating east and south-east Asian arts and culture.It will serve as somewhat of an artistic homecoming for Chen, who did his undergraduate and master’s degrees at Central Saint Martins and Chelsea College of Arts, respectively. “London definitely influenced a lot of the club part of it,” he says over video call, dressed in a simple black T-shirt and clear-frame glasses. “When I was living in the UK, I was pretty young and I experienced a lot of its club culture.” Since graduating in 2010 (and returning to China for some years after), he has made a name for himself by bringing the sacred and the subcultural together.Watch a taster for TranceIn 2015, Chen founded the music-art-dance collectiveAsian Dope Boys, which earned a cult following for shows resembling both religious ceremonies and avant garde techno parties. In 2018, 20 members toured Europe performing at venues including London’s Barbican, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris and Säule, an experimental space at Berlin’s iconic club Berghain.He has lived in Berlin for the last three years. In 2024, at the city’s HAU performance space,Chen premiered Ocean Cage, a video and performance piece inspired by stories from Lamalera. The fishing village in Indonesia is one of the last communities in the world where traditional whale-hunting still exists – the locals relying on it for both sustenance and as part of their spiritual beliefs. “Because it’s a volcano island, it doesn’t grow anything, so they have to go whaling for their survival,” he says, explaining that they believe that their ancestors were reborn as whales in order to feed the village.With Trance, Chen wanted to bring people from different disciplines together. “Musicians, performers, professionals, non-professionals, all of it,” he explains. Six years on, the genre-bending theatre-rave has been performed around the world. The latest version can be divided into six two-hour chapters, each reflecting on Buddhist themes, especially the idea of reincarnation, which in its cosmology has six realms: gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hell. “In the beginning, they are performing from an image of hell,” he says of a sequence also referencing a series of 15th-century Japanese paintings that explore the different stages of death. “A beautiful woman dies, her rotting corpse is eaten by dogs and becomes dust at the end,” he says. For him, the first chapter feels particularly meditative. “It comes from the Buddhist idea of how you treat your body, and that there is nothing left other than flesh when you die.”View image in fullscreenSharing the moment … Trance.Photograph: Pierre ZylstraBy the final chapter, Trance shifts into what Chen calls a “collective rave” and takes a more optimistic turn. “The last part is the most human; everyone is dancing on their own,” he says. “It’s the part most strongly related to club culture, to dancing, to the expression of the individual.” It’s also the point in the performance when those watching get most involved. “So much of it is sharing the moment with the audience,” making them a part of “this ritual and ceremony, a healing and cleansing-type moment”.Trance does not follow an explicit narrative, allowing it to evolve as it moves through continents and venues. “It’s a little bit site-specific, as the stage never looks the same,” he says. He points out that some venues are well-equipped, some offer outdoor space, and some are simply dilapidated buildings. But, as a result, he never gets tired of showing it. “Little changes and different conditions keep this work progressing because it has to,” he says. At theSouthbank Centre, “we are creating a special design for it, and we are using their big theatre room to screen Ocean Cave”.View image in fullscreenRitual and ceremony … Trance.Photograph: Pierre ZylstraHe has also invited the Japanese dubstep musician Takeaki Maruyama, known professionally as Goth-Trad, to perform. “I went to a lot of dubstep parties when I was in London before some of the legendary dubstep clubs closed down, so now feels like the time to embrace it,” says Chen.It’s not every theatre production that can also double as a 12-hour rave. “I get a lot of feedback,” says Chen. “People say it’s the best performance ever … they feel healed, they feel cleansed, they cried, all these feelings. And then some people really don’t like it! All this strong emotion is what I appreciate. You don’t have to understand the story or have any background knowledge – how you emotionally relate and connect with the piece is the most important thing to me.”Tianzhuo Chen: Trance is atQueen Elizabeth Hall Foyer, London, on 18 July as part of the Southbank Centre’sESEA Encountersseason, which runs 17-20 JulyExplore more on these topicsDanceTheatreClubbingBuddhismSouthbank CentreClub culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We once saw someone being chased with a machete at the back of the field by our school. In drama class, I remember a boy went into his bag to get his notebook out and a massive knife fell out. A boy in my brother’s year was stabbed over 10 times on a night out.”But despite the passing of more than two decades, Edmunds says not much has changed in the town – if anything, the rise of social media has made it worse. That’s why he’s brought his experiences to bear inThe Chaos That Has Been and Will No Doubt Return,a play about a stabbing at a house party that is based on true events.Now, to accompany the play’s tour, Edmunds and his Chalk Line theatre company are running a national outreach programme for knife crime intervention which they hope will reach more than 1,000 young people in the country, including in Bristol, London, Luton, Liverpool, Newcastle, Slough, Norwich, Exeter, Peterborough and Essex.“I wrote the play because I started reflecting on why a community might be surrounded by knife violence,” Edmunds says. “It’s an interrogation of the repression and suffocation in working-class communities like Luton, and the effect that has on young people. How when you have so much anger and nowhere to put it, and there are no schemes of protection for people, that can often breed violence.”View image in fullscreenAmaia Naima Aguinaga joins the other actors on stage. The play is designed to change the narrative and give hope.Photograph: PREdmunds worked with Beds Veru (the knife crime intervention unit in the Bedfordshire police) to develop the script with vulnerable young people in Luton. A section of the play is directly inspired by an “incredible” mother in Luton who lost her son to a stabbing – and later visited her son’s killer in jail to forgive him.“The worst thing about knife crime is it instils fear,” Edmunds says. “People carry knives because they want to protect themselves. But the play is trying to say that the moment you decide to carry a knife is the moment you are in danger. Because statistically, a person carrying a knife is actually more likely to be injured by it.”As part of the outreach programme, young people will be brought in to see the play in each town before workshopping the material with the help of a facilitator and a drama therapist. They will be asked to interrogate the themes of the play, like the moments the characters made the wrong decisions and the consequences of that.“Then we give them an opportunity to rewrite the ending. How do you prevent this from happening? We also have them improvise their way out of the situation.“It’s about empowering the young people, rather than lecturing them. It’s giving them a space to explore the events, so that if they ever experience something similar in real life, they can identify what’s happening and try to avoid it.”Knife-enabled crime in England and Waleshas risen by 80% over the past decade, and the number of teenagers that have been killed with a knife or a sharp objecthas gone up by 240%. In April, the Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, warned of a £450m funding gap andsaid rates of knife crime could risewithout more government backing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And so if I’m not out there on the streets, meeting these kids, trying to help them, then what am I doing really? I’m just making entertainment.”Edmunds’s play, co-directed by Vikesh Godhwani, ends with a note of hope. The character who is stabbed does not die, though their attacker is sent to prison and has an opportunity to express their remorse and wish that they had acted differently.“I didn’t want to perpetuate a story where this always ends tragically,” he says. “I think that story is really important to tell. That these people that kill are not necessarily people that are born this way. It comes from the environment you grow up in and the lack of support. But there is a world where this doesn’t have to happen.”The Chaos That Has Been and Will No Doubt Return is touringfrom 15 July to 27 November.Explore more on these topicsStageKnife crimeMetropolitan policeTheatreCrimeLutonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A dangerous development – or long overdue?Ben ChildSpider-Man: No Way Home director Jon Watts has revealed that his original plans for the film had to be changed when Redditors predicted a plot pointTue 8 Jul 2025 07.08 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 07.17 EDTShareOnce upon a time, film-makers were mysterious sorcerers hunched over Steenbecks and smoke machines, conjuring cinematic magic from the recesses of their cerebellums. These days it seems they spend half their time on Reddit, fighting like gremlins to stay one step ahead of the hive mind.This week,Spider-Man: No Way Homedirector Jon Watts revealed that his original plan for the grand entrance of the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield versions of Spider-Man in the blockbuster Marvel epic was to have them turn up following the death of Aunt May, just as Spidey was at his lowest point. As our hero sheds tears on a grimy New York rooftop, the pair would enter through Doctor Strange portals at the perfect moment to reset the film and set Peter Parker on the path to redemption.The Spider-Man pointing meme perfectly encapsulates why fans adored No Way HomeRead moreIt was a perfectly serviceable plan to get the film moving again quickly before the entire multiplex ruined their popcorn with salty tears. But there was one tiny, weeny problem: the internet had thought of it first. “I was on Reddit, and I was looking at people who had already made fan art of, ‘This is probably what it’s going to be like when the two Spider-Men get revealed’,”Watts told Collider. “It was on a rooftop. It was sad. Two Doctor Strange portals were open and two Spider-Men are stepping out. I was like, ‘Well, we can’t do that. If that’s exactly what everyone thinks we’re going to do, we absolutely can’t do that.’” Watts reconfigured the screenplay so that Maguire and Garfield turn up in Ned’s grandmother’s flat instead, after Spider-Man’s right-hand man starts messing with Strange’s sling ring and accidentally ushers them both into the MCU.As an example of the fandom hivemind guessing the plot of a movie from the quantum rear seat, this is both deranged and depressingly effective. But it’s also far from the first time fans have managed to manipulate the plot of a high-profile film before the trailers have even been released. The great-grandaddy of internet-powered cinema interference, long before Reddit got involved, was the 2006 action thriller Snakes on a Plane, a movie that was almost entirely reshot to meet fan expectations. After early online hype snowballed into full-blown meme fever, producers added more reptiles, more over-the-top absurdity and more supposedly iconic lines such as Samuel L Jackson’s: “I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve had it with these Reddit motherf’ … Samuel L Jackson in Snakes on a Plane.Photograph: 25/New Line Cinema/AllstarIn 2015, Fantastic Four brought us a subtler, though equally telling, course correction. Fans were outraged by reports that Toby Kebbell’s Doctor Doom would be renamed “Victor Domashev” and – even worse – would be a sad tech bro with a blogspot (rather than the usual Latverian aristocrat with diplomatic immunity and a murder cape). Faced with backlash before the film had even finished shooting, 20th Century Fox panicked and quietly reinstated the classic “Von Doom” moniker. A tiny change, but a telling one.At that point we were fully into the era of pre-release plot clairvoyance, where no trailer dropped, no casting announcement landed, and no cereal-box leak went unanalysed by Reddit sleuths with conspiracy corkboards and access to 480p set photos. And just like studios, and directors, the fans get it wrong as often as they get it right. Without a massive Reddit campaign, Sonic the Hedgehog might have been a kids’ animated movie starring a version of the beloved video game critter wholooked like a taxidermy experiment. Thumbs up there to the screaming mob. In contrast, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker ended up switching Daisy Ridley’s Rey from the child of “filthy junk traders” she had been labelled in previous film The Last Jedi to the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine – purely because fans who had probably built elaborate genealogies on Reddit had got their geeky knickers in a twist.Since then we’ve had the almost complete deletion of the villainous Serpent Society from Captain America: Brave New World, and now the revelation that No Way Home was rewritten to avoid getting Reddited. It seems that in modern Hollywood, entire tonal shifts are now being driven by fan reaction, real or anticipated.At their best, these pivots can improve a film. There’s a kind of chaotic crowd wisdom to large-scale fan response: if millions of people agree your CGI hedgehog looks like he drinks Monster Energy, maybe it’s worth reconsidering. And when audiences accurately predict major plot beats months in advance, maybe it makes sense to tweak the scene. But there’s a point here where all this stuff starts to eat indelibly into the very concept of authored film-making. Maybe in a decade or so we won’t need directors and studios at all, just a bunch of data analysts and Reddit mods using AI to make films that everyone loves because they’ve already seen them in their heads.And even if that’s a dystopian future we’re not quite facing just yet, such algorithmic appeasement exposes the mounting anxiety of studios that now live in a kind of quantum dread – terrified of being too online, yet even more terrified of not being online enough. Every plot point is a potential leak. Every costume reveal is a referendum. Nothing is sacred, and nothing is safe when your screenplay has to survive both internal rewrites and a Reddit spoiler thread before it can even be filmed. Think of it as Schrödinger’s Cameo: the twist exists in a weird quantum state until the lights go down and your mate leans over and says: “Told you Tobey was in this.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSpider-Man: No Way HomeSpider-ManTobey MaguireAndrew GarfieldMarvelSonic the HedgehogcommentShareReuse this content"

GlobeScribe.ai is currently charging $100 per book, per language for use of its translation services.“There will always be a place for expert human translation, especially for highly literary or complex texts,” said the founders Fred Freeman and Betsy Reavley, who previously founded Bloodhound Books, which specialises in crime and thrillers. “But GlobeScribe.ai opens the door to new opportunities, making translation a viable option for a much broader range of fiction.”GlobeScribe conducted “extensive blind testing” of its tool. Native speakers reviewed GlobeScribe translations alongside human-translated versions of texts without being told which method had been used. “The feedback consistently showed that readers could not reliably distinguish between them,” according to a company statement. “In some cases, reviewers even felt the AI-assisted versions were closer in tone and fidelity to the original English manuscript.”However, prominent translators along with a translators’ organisation have expressed concern over the initiative.GlobeScribe “may claim to unlock global access for fiction, but their approach sidelines the very people who make literature resonate across cultures,” said Ian Giles, chair of the Society of Authors’ Translators Association. “Suggesting that AI can match, or even surpass, the nuanced work of human translators on behalf of authors is flat-out wrong.”“The best literary translations offer more than simple accuracy, more than literal fidelity to the words making up the sentences,” said Polly Barton, writer and translator of works including the bestsellingButter by Asako Yuzukifrom Japanese to English. “They are engaging with the context from which the book has come, and reproducing the pacing, atmosphere, emotional timbre, rhythm, and all the other, less superficially obvious factors that ultimately determine how fulfilling and rich the reading experience is.”Deepa Bhasthi, whose translation of Banu Mushtaq’s Heart Lamp from Kannada into Englishwon this year’s International Booker prize, said that “there are many words in Kannada that contain whole cultural worlds in them, where there is as much hidden or implied within a cultural context as is conveyed in literal meaning. And that needs a human being, with an understanding of these visible and invisible worlds, to translate such words”.Asked about GlobeScribe’s testing method, Barton said that being a native speaker of a language “doesn’t necessarily equip one to judge all translations from that language with total authority”. Bhasthi added that “we are not told what kind of texts they were given, what kind of readers the test subjects were”.View image in fullscreen‘AI tools should be embraced’ … GlobeScribe co-founder Betsy Reavley and Fred Freeman.Photograph: Elodie Giuge PhotographyGlobeScribe’s founders said that while they “recognise that parts of the industry are understandably cautious about what AI might mean for the arts”, they “believe these tools are here to stay and that they should be embraced thoughtfully and responsibly”. They added that AI could enhance creativity and help professional translators “increase their productivity and output”. The founders “are clear that this is not about replacing human translators”.Julia Sanches – the translator of works including Boulder by Eva Baltasar from Catalan into English – said: “Even though I don’t think Globescribe can translate the kinds of literary texts I translate, I am gloomy about the emergence of all these new AI ‘translation’ services. They give the appearance that translation is instant, which devalues my labour, and also that it is mediocre, which could make ‘good enough’ the new standard for the literary arts. And that’s a disservice to both authors and readers.”“This doesn’t just end with translation,” said Barton. “Maybe translators are at the frontline of people being put out of work by AI technologies, but soon there will be more and more jobs threatened to be wiped out in this way. It lies in our hands to decide whether or not we want this to happen.”Explore more on these topicsPublishingFiction in translationArtificial intelligence (AI)LanguageComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

So why do some go wrong – and what can be done to prevent it?Tom GillTue 8 Jul 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 20.23 EDTShare“Friendships of over six years were broken overnight,” Rosa* says of the sudden, dramatic dissolution of her book club in Victoria, Australia some months ago. What started as a chance to share notes on the finer points of dramatic literature had become a real-life drama.The book club had been an important fixture of Rosa’s calendar for several years and, like many others, was hosted on rotation in the homes of different members each month. Although its primary purpose was discussing books, Rosa felt it was equally about socialising, and members were encouraged to dress up in outfits relating to the month’s book, with prizes for the best dressed.Cracks started appearing after a survey of the club’s 12 members, all women in their early 30s, was shared to gather views on how it was working. When the anonymous feedback was presented at the next meeting, the moderator reported that most attenders felt there needed to be more “commitment” to finishing the book, a comment which didn’t go down well with some members.Silence please: how book clubs without the chat help focus the mindRead moreA few people felt singled out by the survey. “It came to be interpreted as ‘You need to finish the book or maybe don’t come,’” says Rosa. Although the group was ostensibly used to sharing different points of view, this gap couldn’t be bridged: before the night was over, some members had walked out and left the group chat the next day. The book club hasn’t met since.Book clubs are a staple in the diaries of literature lovers the world over and are reportedly increasing in popularity inAustraliaand theUK. Sometimes formed of friends, but just as often frequented by strangers connected only by locality, book clubs occupy a peculiar position somewhere between casual socialising and a semi-structured membership club.Perhaps unsurprisingly, bringing people together, often with alcohol, then encouraging them to voice their opinions, can sometimes lead to bust-ups. Erin Johnson, 42, has been running her London-based book club for nearly 10 years. With an open invitation policy and 3,400 members online, the club usually attracts 10 to 20 people per in-person meeting.Humans are complicatedBeckyInevitably some book club discussions “veer off topic” into wider social issues, Johnson says. She sees this as par for the course. But when characters don’t mesh well, discussions can sometimes get heated and disagreements have moved online after some meetings. This is a step too far for Johnson. “Please don’t air your dirty laundry on the public group for thousands of people to see – it’s just meant to be a nice fun book club!”Although the world is not short of complicated, tough questions and strongly held beliefs, personal and procedural issues can be just as fractious as politics. A 2019BookBrowse surveyof nearly 4,000 book club members found the most commonly reported gripe was over-dominant personalities, followed by irregular attendance and members not reading the book.Karen Stillman, 47, a North Carolina native, has first-hand experience. “For over a year, four women would turn up to our book club without having touched the book, saying they hadn’t had a chance to read it. These women are all retired! How did they not have the time?”One evening, Stillman ran out of patience. “They walked in without saying hello to half the group, so I went down to tell them: you need to read the book.” Her point was made: they left immediately and didn’t return.These experiences highlight a tension at the core of many book club bust-ups: a difference in expectations. “I think pretty much everyone joins a book club because they want to make new friends and meet new people, but people stay for different reasons,” says Becky, who lives on the west coast of the US.Becky’s book club began as a monthly meeting of strangers but blossomed into meeting regularly for wider social activities. She had started the club to meet new people and shared organising duties with an old friend from high school.‘It feels an almost holy moment’: the beauty and magic of reading aloud to childrenRead moreClub admin had begun to take its toll and Becky, who is now in her 30s, felt she was pulling more weight than her co-coordinator. “I felt book club was a big part of my social life and very important to me, but my friend didn’t respect it in the same way,” Becky says.The issue took up headspace for her friend, too: “She wrote me a long email on Christmas Day breaking up with me!” Her friend hasn’t come to book club since.Book clubs are a very simple form of community gathering. The entry requirements rarely extend beyond reading the book. Most are timid affairs that go off without issue, but since her own book club breakup, Rosa wonders if tightening this loose arrangement might have prevented disaster.“The fallout makes me wonder whether these kind of semi-structured social events do need some sort of ‘house rules’,” she says. “It’s all a bit meta, but humans are complicated.”*Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Experts discuss how to prevent and treat any problemsSarah PhillipsTue 8 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 06.22 EDTShareIn the UK, a third of women will experience urinary incontinence, and there is a risk for men, too. How can you prevent and treat it? Pelvic floor experts share the best techniques to keep the “forgotten muscle” functioning well.Be aware of your pelvic floor“It is the floor of your core,” says the pelvic physiotherapist Sara Reardon, AKAthe Vagina Whisperer, who works in New Orleans and is the author ofFloored: A Woman’s Guide to Pelvic Floor Health at Every Age and Stage. “Everybody has one, not just women. You have your pelvis, which is that ring of bones that sits at the base of your spine. At the very bottom of that is a basket of muscles, and that is what we call your pelvic floor. These muscles are contracting throughout the day to hold in the contents of your bladder and bowels, to support the pelvic organs, to give you spinal stability, and then they relax to empty the bladder and bowels. Every time we get out of a chair or cough they activate. They are working and functioning without us having to really think about it.”This is why it is “crucial that everybody makes sure that their pelvic floor is strong”, says Vikram Khullar, a professor and head of the urogynaecology department at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust.There is no need to be ashamedView image in fullscreenPelvic floor dysfunction can have a huge impact on women’s quality of life but it is preventable and can be treated.Photograph: Posed by model; MTStock Studio/Getty Images“About one in three women are thought to haveurinary incontinence,” saysClare Bourne, a pelvic health physiotherapist based in London and the author ofStrong Foundations: Why Pelvic Health Matters. “About one in 10 will experience faecal incontinence, which is potentially under-reported.About 50% of women over 50have some form of pelvic organ prolapse.”Reardon says: “More women have urinary leakage than have osteoporosis, high blood pressure and diabetes, and yet we are very aware of those problems.” Bourne says: “In reality, the problems that are related to the pelvic floor are still difficult to talk about.” She adds: “It is bladders, bowels; it’s not trendy, it’s not sexy – even though it’s ironic, because it is related to sex. There is just so much taboo.”“Pelvic floor dysfunction can have a huge impact on women’s quality of life,” says DrRanee Thakar, the president of theRoyal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistsand a consultant at Croydon University hospital. “It prevents them from going out. It prevents them from socialising. And the thing is, it is preventable and it can be treated.”If you are experiencing issues, you should go to your GP. Whether you can get a referral to see a urogynaecologist or physiotherapist – and how long you have to wait – is something of a postcode lottery in England, says Thakar, who carries out a range of surgical procedures for pelvic floor disorders.Childbirth isn’t the only reason for pelvic floor problems“A significant number of women will get incontinence or prolapse symptoms after childbirth, which get better with time,” says Thakar. And yet, “it is definitely pervasive in all ages and stages”, says Reardon. “Pregnancy, giving birth and menopause are three big risk factors for developing pelvic floor problems. But that is not the only reason people have pelvic floor problems. You can have pelvic floor problems if you’ve never given birth. There could be pelvic floor tension, which makes it difficult to insert a tampon, have vaginal intercourse or have a gynaecological examination, because the muscles at the opening of the vagina are so tight or tense.”Reardon points to astudyof female college students who had not given birth but experienced stress incontinence, “because they were doing high impact workouts such as cheerleading, gymnastics, running and volleyball – things where there’s a lot of pressure down on those muscles, and we’re not training those muscles to respond to that activity”.Men can experience weaknesses tooView image in fullscreenThere is a big difference in pelvic floor exercises for men compared to women.Photograph: Posed by model; Maskot/Getty ImagesThere are two main groups of men with issues, saysGerard Greene, a specialist physiotherapist in male pelvic health who works in Birmingham and London. “The first is men who have prostate cancer and have their prostate removed.” This can cause “urinary leakage or incontinence, which comes as a shock to these men, because prior to diagnosis, a lot of them were symptom-free and working, active and doing sports, then they get lots of urinary leakage and are having to wear a pad, which is distressing. There is really good evidence that very specific pelvic floor exercises for those men will help to get them dry. Those men who get urinary incontinence also get complete erectile dysfunction, so we do lots for that as well.”The other main group of men Greene treats are those experiencing pelvic pain, including many cyclists with the very painful condition pudendal neuralgia. “They can’t sit, drive or cycle,” says Greene. Khullar says: “In their 70s, men catch up with women in terms of urinary symptoms. Urinary issues can be a factor in people taking early retirement or moving into a care home.”How similar are pelvic floor exercises for men compared with women? “There is a big difference,” says Greene. “Men need to work the front pelvic floor muscles. The phrase we use is ‘nuts to guts’ – a lot of them are tightening the back passage, but that kind doesn’t help, and can make things worse. We get them usingSqueezy, the award-winning NHS pelvic floor app.”Persevere with exercisesKegelsare synonymous with pelvic floor strengthening but not everyone likes to use the term, says Bourne. “I prefer ‘pelvic floor muscle exercises’. Kegels came from the American gynaecologist [Dr Arnold Kegel] who came up with the concept and they have generally been focused on the squeeze element. And really, when you think about the pelvic floor, yes, we think about strength, but we also think about flexibility, endurance, and coordination.” Some people need to work on relaxing their pelvic floor more than strengthening it, explains Bourne.“Kegel contractions are OK, but you need to do them for different lengths of time,” adds Reardon. “Quick contractions then relaxing afterwards, but also longer-hold endurance contractions of five to 10 seconds. You also need to do them in different positions, because we don’t just leak when we sit. You need to work them while standing, walking and exercising in the gym.”Khullar says: “The key thing to remember is that it takes time. With all muscle strength training, people tend to give up by about a month – but it’s not until the third month that they will start to see the real benefits.” While the recommended guidance is 10 contractions, three times a day, you don’t need to stay at this level for ever, he adds. You also don’t need to stop everything to do pelvic exercises, instead “a trigger might be having a cup of tea or brushing your teeth”.Engage when liftingView image in fullscreenEngage or contract your pelvic floor as you lift.Photograph: Posed by model; Lyndon Stratford/Getty ImagesThe rise in strength training among women has led toan increased awareness of urinary incontinence. “If you are lifting weights,” says Reardon, “what is really important, is that you are engaging or contracting your pelvic floor as you lift. As you load your body, that is pressure down on your pelvic floor, and your core needs to respond to that. The other thing is not holding your breath – that doesn’t allow those muscles to engage, so make sure that you’re breathing.”Listen to your body if you experience symptoms. “People who have pressure in the vagina, prolapse or leakage, will often keep doing the exercise,” says Reardon. “But all of those problems are information from your body that your pelvic floor can’t quite handle what you are asking it to do – so you really need to scale back.”Get the mirror out“Grab a mirror and have a look at what is going on down there,” says Bourne. “If you try to gently contract your pelvic floor, you should see a movement inwards of the vaginal opening, and then it should drop back down as you relax. Or you can put your finger on the perineum, the area between your vagina and your anus. You should almost feel the muscles lift away from your finger and into the body.”The advice for men is that they “should think about shortening their penis, which will get the pelvic floor to draw in and contract”, says Bourne.Don’t drink too muchView image in fullscreenStay hydrated but don’t chug it all at once.Photograph: Posed by model; elenaleonova/Getty ImagesThe advice on water intake varies, but over two litres a day for a 70kg person is often suggested, of which a substantial proportion will be from food. “This whole thing about drinking more than two litres is way more than people need,” says Khullar. “If you’ve got somebody who is drinking two and a half litres, of course they’re going to be passing urine all the time, and then their bladder fills up, and then they are leaking.”You should also be careful what you drink, says Reardon. “If you struggle with leakage, certain drinks may bother your bladder more and contribute to urgency to pee. Caffeinated drinks, alcoholic drinks, carbonated drinks, spicy foods – those are what we consider bladder irritants.”But you should also be careful not to restrict fluids, she adds. “That can actually cause more bacteria in the urine and cause more urgency – and even a UTI. Make sure that you are staying hydrated and sipping water throughout the day, instead of chugging it all at once.”Keep moving“Motion is lotion for these muscles,” says Reardon. “As much as they can get weak, they can also get tight and tense. We all sit for a long time, so getting in your movement throughout the day – whether it is alternating between a standing and sitting desk, or doing some breathing and stretching in between meetings, or going for a walk.” It is key to look at pelvic health holistically, says Bourne. “There is evidence that being overweight is associated with urinary incontinence,” says Thakar. “As is having a chronic cough.”Manage stress“When we are stressed, we breathe slightly differently,” says Bourne. “This can influence pelvic floor function, because the diaphragm and the pelvic floor have a close relationship. The nervous system is complex: if we’re in fight or flight mode all the time, think about what that does to most of our muscles. We generally find that those who are experiencing stress may also have more increased tone in their pelvic floor – and that might then connect to the symptoms that they are experiencing.”Look after your bowelsView image in fullscreenChia seeds can help if the bowels don’t work properly.Photograph: Huizeng Hu/Getty Images“If the bowels don’t work properly and there is constipation, that decreases bladder capacity,” says Khullar. Increasing fibre won’t necessarily help everyone, he says, recommending instead “particulates like chia seeds and milled linseed”. He also stresses the importance of managing constipation after giving birth: “The vagina has been stretched [so straining] is going to lead to potential prolapse – and also stretching of the pelvic floor.”Do you really need to do Kegels? Physicians on five common pelvic floor mythsRead moreUse the loo mindfullyWomen should sit down to use the toilet and make sure they aren’t pushing excessively or“power peeing”, as Reardon puts it. “When you hover over a toilet seat, you don’t relax your pelvic floor and hip muscles all the way, so you may not empty your bladder completely. It is fine to do every once in a while, if it’s a yucky toilet, but doing that every time you pee can lead to that incomplete bladder emptying – or it can contribute to pelvic floor tension.”“Another really important tip for peeing is go when you have the urge to go, but don’t go ‘just in case’,” says Reardon. Likewise, “if you hold the urge for too long, your muscles get over tense. It’s normal to pee every two to four hours during the day and zero to two times at night.”“If the urge comes before that two-hour mark, it is likely to be a fake urge,” says Reardon. “Do a couple of Kegel contractions, which tells your bladder to chill out, and take some big, deep breaths. You’ll find that if you distract yourself, the urge goes away.”Future-proof your pelvic floorView image in fullscreenPrevention is better than cure so everybody should be doing pelvic floor exercises.Photograph: Posed by model; Manu Vega/Getty Images“Everybody should be doingpelvic floor exercises,” says Khullar. “It isn’t any more ridiculous than people in their 60s and 70s going to the gym to do strength training. It is exactly the same thing.”Some of the other experts are more cautious about doing pelvic floor exercises without any issues. “If you work it too hard and you do it the wrong way, it can lead to symptoms of pelvic pain,” says Greene.“A lot of our research is based on symptoms,” says Bourne, “but we know that prevention is better than cure. For example, those who do pelvic floor exercises throughout pregnancy are much less likely to have incontinence. My approach is: yes, do pelvic floor exercises, but also consider your bowel health, your bladder health and stress. As part of all of that, you are taking care of your pelvic health.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe expertsHealthHealth & wellbeingWomen's healthMen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pack the right cardWhen packing for your summer holiday, don’t forget to pay attention to your plastic. Pick the wrong card to use abroad and you will end up spending more than you need to.Unless your trip is imminent, it is not too late to apply for a card that won’t charge you a penny in foreign exchange fees or other bank fees when you are abroad, whether you are spending in a shop, restaurant or hotel or withdrawing cash from an ATM. Often it will take only a few days for your card to arrive.The consumer group Which? has looked at the best debit and credit cards to use abroad. Ondebit cards, its recommended providers that are “truly fee-free to use abroad” include First Direct and the app-based Starling Bank. With both of those, you getMastercard’s exchange rate, with no added fees or charges on top.When it comes to credit cards,Which?’s best buys includethe Halifax Clarity card and Barclaycard Rewards card, both of which have no foreign transaction or cash withdrawal fees. Both useVisa’s exchange rate.View image in fullscreenHave you thought about your credit or debit cards before travelling abroad?Photograph: robertharding/AlamyOther options worth a look include the travel debit card Currensea. You sign up, connect your existing bank account and pay with the Currensea card, although you are spending directly from your current account. There are three price plans including one called Essential, which has no annual fee but does have a £4.95 delivery charge.2. Know what the deal isIf you can’t face applying for a new bank account or credit card or are running out of time, don’t just do nothing.“Check what your existing card provider(s) will charge for each purchase and ATM withdrawal,” says Andrew Hagger, the founder of the financial websiteMoneyComms. “That way, you can try to spend accordingly to minimise the impact of charges on your holiday budget.”For example, you may want to avoid using your debit card to make lots of small payments or withdrawals if the bank applies a set fee each time, while using a credit card to withdraw currency from overseas cash machines “can be an extremely costly way of funding your holiday spending”, Hagger says.Watch out if you have a TSB debit card, as it is often highlighted as beingone of the most expensive to use overseas. If you are paying for something outside Europe, in many cases you will pay a £1 transaction purchase fee plus 2.99% of the price paid. However, TSB points out that you won’t pay the purchase fee within Europe or if you have one of its Premier or Platinum accounts. Its Spend & Save Plus account also comes without any overseas charges on debit card use but does have a £3 monthly fee.3. Check your settingsView image in fullscreenDo you use Apple Pay or Google Pay?Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersIf you use Apple Pay, Google Wallet or Google Pay and you have multiple cards set up on it, it is worth checking the settings and selecting the right primary card for your holiday, says Alastair Douglas, the chief executive of the websiteTotallyMoney.“Otherwise, when you get back, you might find out you’ve been paying extra, adding to your post-holiday blues,” he says.4. Pay in local currencyWhen using a card overseas, watch out for the dynamic currency conversion trick at restaurants, shops and hotels, and at some ATMs. This is where you are offered the option of paying in sterling rather than the local currency.“Always remember to select the option to pay [or withdraw cash] in the local currency when you’re abroad, and never in pounds and pence,” Douglas says. “That’s because it’s likely you’ll be charged additional fees for the currency conversion, meaning you’ll be paying more money for the same thing.”5. Think: do you need cash?Some holidaymakers never take any foreign currency with them – they rely on their credit or debit cards and use ATMs to get out cash if necessary. Others like the security of having some local cash in their wallet or purse before they set off.As is the case with the UK, many countries are increasingly cashless, and in some cases you may find that during your whole trip you never once reach for a banknote or coin. In Sweden, for example,only one in 10 purchasesare now made with cash.Japan is among the countries where locals say visitors definitely need to carry cashGrowing numbers of countries are moving to contactless payment for their local transport systems such as metros, buses and trams, which usually means you can use a UK debit or credit card.However, in many places you will still need some cash for things such as entrance fees to certain sites and attractions, shopping at local markets and paying street food vendors. You may also want some for informal payments, such as gratuities. If you have booked a walking tour or excursion, for example, you will probably want some cash with you for a tip for the guide or driver.Japan is among the countries where locals say visitors definitely need to carry cash. For tourists shopping at smaller businesses or in rural areas or visiting sites such as temples, “you will still need cash”,according to The Tokyo Chapter, a blog.6. Get a good deal on cashIf you do plan to buy some holiday money and don’t want to get ripped off, a useful starting point is theTravel Money Maxonline tool run by MoneySavingExpert.com, which lets you compare exchange rates. Key in a few details including how much you want and how you want to get it – delivery or collection – and it will give you several options and show you what you would get after all charges.We used the site to see who was offering the best deals for £400 of Turkish lira for a trip in a fortnight’s time. When we opted for delivery, The Currency Club came top, with Waitrose and John Lewis not too far behind. On collection – we opted for somewhere within five miles of our London King’s Cross office – Sterling FX came top, followed by Thomas Exchange Global.View image in fullscreenTurkish lira.Photograph: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe “walk-up” exchange rates at airport bureaux de change are notoriously poor, so steer well clear unless you are really desperate.Also, don’t pop into your local bank to get some currency, as a high street bank is nearly always one of the most expensive places to change money.7. Check your insuranceIf you plan to take, or withdraw, large sums of cash on holiday, make sure your travel insurance will cover you for any loss or theft. Some basic policies do not cover cash.Even if yours does, take care to look after your money. Don’t leave it in a bag in your room – use a safe if there is one.8. Dodge double conversionsWhile preparing for your holiday, you may discover you have foreign currency left over from previous trips – great news if you can use it this time, not so great if it’s for another country.Douglas says you should pause before attempting to exchange it for the currency you need.“If you’re in the UK and switching cash from one foreign currency to another foreign currency, then it’s likely you’ll be charged two sets of fees or commissions,” he says. “One will be to convert your cash into pounds, and another from pounds into the new currency. So you might be better off waiting until you reach your destination and exchanging there.”Explore more on these topicsCredit cardsMoney hacksDebit cardsConsumer affairsCredit card feesBanks and building societiesSaving moneyTravel insurancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 8 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 18.51 EDTShareMy veggie burgers are so often underwhelming, or they simply fall apart. Where am I going wrong?Beth, Newark“Veggie burgers are often lacking in everything that’s good about food,” says Melissa Hemsley, author ofReal Healthy, and for her, that means texture, flavour and satisfaction. “They also tend not to have those key flavour highs – the fat, the salt – that you’re after from a homemade version.”For Lukas Volger, author ofVeggie Burgers Every Which Way, texture is by far the complaint he hears most often: “The patty is too moist, and glops out of the other side of the bun when you bite into it.” Veggie burgers often behave like this, Volger says, because vegetables contain water, so you’ll either need to cook the veg in advance or add something to the mix to soak it up, whether that’s breadcrumbs or grains. And remember, size isn’t everything: “I used to love the look of a thick, substantial burger,” Volger says, “but I’ve come to realise that they function much better on a bun when they’re thin and seared until crisp on each side in a hot pan,smash burger-style.” (Alternatively, bake in a moderate oven to “help them dry out a little” before grilling.) This will also help if you’ve ever fallen victim to burgers falling through those barbecue grates.Volger’s burger vision often starts by giving a vegetable “a point of view”, which is to say a flavour pairing: carrot with almond, say, sweet potato with sesame, or kale with ginger. He builds from there with spices, fresh herbs, a flavour bomb (think miso or harissa) or nut butter, plus “something to provide body”. For Hemsley, that might mean chickpea flour (“it’s cheap and naturally gluten-free), an egg (“that’s always good”), or beans or lentils, although the latter will need “bags of flavour” to keep the burgers from being boring. “That’s whyBold Beansare so good,” Hemsley adds, “because their beans have a lovely, salty brine.”On to the specifics, and Hemsley always flips out over a black bean and feta number: “It’s one of my favourite burgers ever, and I’d happily eat it instead of a meat one any day of the week.” Her patty also has onions and grated garlic in there, plus dried oregano or thyme, sun-dried tomatoes (“for juiciness, flavour and salt”), and jalapeños (“for the brininess and hit of chilli”). “I usually add an egg, too, to up the protein. I hate to be that person who talks about protein, but I do think it helps keep you sated.” As a bonus, these burgers freeze well, too, and Hemsley often turns the base mix into meatballs to eat with tomato sauce and couscous or rice.Volger, meanwhile, is “very into”a grated halloumi burger, for which the cheese is stirred into softened onions with garlic and harissa, then combined with beaten egg, panko breadcrumbs, minced herbs (parsley, coriander, mint, dill) and cornflour. “My next plan is to make a red lentil and sweet potato Thai red curry burger,” Hemsley says, “so hold the front page.” She’s planning on serving thatwith a coriander, mint and coconut chutney, which is a good lesson never, ever to forget the importance of your burger accoutrements. As Volger puts it: “A slice of cheese and a mess of burger condiments can salvage most veggie burgers.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Long before tomatoes arrived from the Americas, it was made with bread, garlic, olive oil and almonds, which have always been part of our food culture. It began as field food, crushed by hand in mortars and eaten by workers under the sun with nothing but stale bread and whatever else they had to hand alongside. No blenders, no chill time, just instinct and hunger. This version, with courgette and basil, goes back to that idea: take what’s around you and make something good out of it. Simple roots, but full of life.Courgette and almond gazpachoPrep5 minSteep10 min+Cook10 minChill1 hr+Serves4-62 medium courgettes½ cucumberSea salt and black pepper80g stale white bread75ml whole milk100g toasted marcona almonds1 garlic clove, peeled2 tsp sherry vinegar1 handful basil leaves, plus extra to garnishExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishCoarsely grate the courgettes and cucumber into a large bowl, sprinkle with sea salt, then tip into a sieve, set it over the bowl and leave to steep for a good 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, break up the bread into a medium bowl, add the milk and leave to soak.Squeeze out any excess liquid from the salted courgette and cucumber mix, then tip them into a blender. Add the soaked bread and any milk it hasn’t soaked up, then add the almonds, garlic, vinegar and 500ml cold water. Blitz smooth, then taste to check the seasoning – you shouldn’t need any extra salt, but a touch of ground black pepper may be in order. Add the basil leaves and blitz again.Pour the soup into a large jug or bowl, then cover and chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Once chilled, check the consistency of the soup – if you feel it’s a bit too thick, add up to 200ml more cold water, to loosen.Ladle into bowls, top with a good drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a grind or two of black pepper, finish with a scattering of extra basil leaves and serve.Explore more on these topicsSoupSpanish food and drinkFoodSummer food and drinkVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

So why am I fantasising about sex with more adventurous partners?Pamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 8 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 03.01 EDTShareI’m a woman in my early 30s, and after dating my male partner for seven monthsI’ve becomefrustrated by hisvanilla and mundane sexual preferences. This makes me feel bad about myself, because he is perfect in all other ways. Not only are we intellectually compatible and share many interests, but he is also kind, caringand romantic. He makes sure I never leave for work without a healthy packed lunch and isfull of fun ideas for our outings. He makes me feel safe and secure. I had an unstable childhoodand amnoton speaking terms with my father. With my boyfriend, I am able to open up about this.In the past, I dateddifficult and unreliable men with whom I could nonetheless indulge in kinky sex, role-playingand other experimentation– and I always loved that part of the relationship. When I try to initiate thiswith him, he rejects it; heonce said he finds it degrading to women.Sometimes I fantasiseabout having sex with more adventurous partners, butI can’t stand the thought of losing such a wonderful partner with whom I can build a future.Endowing a partner with fatherly attributes is a fairly certain way to dampen eroticism. This process is often an unconscious one – as it undoubtedly is in your case – but when a relationship feels familial at some level, whether mother-child, brotherly, sisterly or fatherly, the deep-seated incest taboo renders sexual contact distasteful. Many relationships fall into such patterns, and this is particularly understandable when adults have emerged from unresolved traumatic childhood patterns such as longing for an unavailable parent, or being a survivor of familial abuse.The task of developing a relationship into a healthy, fully adult union is rarely easy, because people tend to gravitate towards what the “child” part of them needs. Think carefully about the father-daughter dynamic within your relationship and, if you want to desire him, experiment with identifying and changing overly familial aspects that remind you of unrequited childhood needs.

I only bought it three weeks ago and have not received any communication from the company.Citroën’s “customer care” line refused to answer any questions and directed me to the dedicated recall line. Despite multiple attempts I’ve never got through. My local dealer has a three-week waiting time for the free repair and my car is essential for my work. I’m one of the “lucky” ones. There are reports of people unable to arrange a recall repair at all, or having to wait months.OC,SalisburyCitroën says 120,000 UK owners are affected by an extremely rare “stop drive” recall that was issued because of a fault with airbags affecting vehicles across the motor industry. In total, the fault hascaused the deaths of more than 30 people worldwideand injured hundreds more.All C3 and DS3 models built from 2009-16 and some DS3s produced from 2009-19 are affected by the UK recall.Fellow Citroën ownerJJMis in the same predicament asOC. He lives in a remote corner of Wales and uses his car to transport vulnerable locals.It has been a slow burn saga that has involved about 100m cars fitted with airbags made by the now defunct Japanese company Takata being recalled worldwide in 10 years.Mercedes, Ford and Audi are among the manufacturers that have previously been affected. Citroën’s parent company, Stellantis, has been criticised by customers for its slow response to the crisis, its poor communication and its lack of support for affected drivers, some of whom have disabilities.The company told me it first became aware of the problem in 2014 after airbags exploded in the US and it sought assurances from Takata that those used in European vehicles were safe. In 2019, when those assurances proved unreliable, it issued a recall in southern Europe since it was thought that hot and humid conditions caused the explosions. Last year, the recall was expanded across continental Europe, but owners were not advised that it was unsafe to drive while awaiting a repair. Late last month, after a woman was killed by her airbag in France, the “stop drive” recall notice was issued.In France and its territories, where 18 people have died, the transport ministry has issued its own recall of 2.5m vehicles with Takata airbags. In the UK the recall remains voluntary despite the hot and humid summer, and Stellantis has offered no word on how drivers should get their vehicles safely to repair centres. Moreover, some drivers, such as OC, did not receive alerts.Stellantis blames the delay on obtaining the drivers’ details from the DVLA. It told me that all affected airbags should be replaced by October, which leaves some drivers facing more than three months without a car. Nothing has been said about compensation for those forced to fork out for alternative transport. When pressed it said courtesy cars and refunds would be considered on a case-by-case basis.As for the many who claim they have been unable to get any response at all from the company, it said it is recruiting more agents to handle calls to its helpline. A spokesperson said: “The company’s focus is on completing the replacement of airbags in affected vehicles as swiftly as possible. Work is ongoing on introducing additional airbag replacement sites at convenient locations as well as repair at home options.“It is inevitable, with such a large number of vehicles affected, that customers will be inconvenienced in the short term. However, we are deploying a variety of options to support mobility, recognising that every driver will have individual requirements, and that priority needs to be given to customers with the most urgent needs.”Drivers should check if their vehicle is affected by using the vehicle identification number (VIN) check tool on theCitroën UK website. If it is, they should notify their insurer and park up the car for as long as it takes. You can be fined up to £2,500 and face a ban for driving a vehicle in a dangerous condition.If local dealers can’t offer repairs, keep trying farther afield and demand that the vehicle is collected by tow truck. Keep records and receipts of expenses while you’re off road and, if Stellantis refuses to cough up, you can seek compensation via the small claims courts.Explore more on these topicsMotoringConsumer championsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do you enjoy exercise?On the basis that I’m not a masochist, no, of course not.Interesting. And why is that?Well, what if I’m at the gym and all the big men look at me?In that case I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you fit an established archetype.A studyhas determined that people with higher levels of neuroticism are less likely to exercise regularly.Tell me more aboutthis study.University College London invited 132 volunteers to follow an eight-week exercise course, with questionnaires to fill in about their enjoyment levels.Who doesn’t lovea sweaty questionnaire?After that, they had their personalities assessed to see if they generally exhibited signs of extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness.And all the neurotics hated the exercise?Kind of. All the neurotics felt shy about exercising in front of other people, and preferred to do light workouts in short bursts away from everyone.What about the others?Those who scored highly in extroversion loved high-intensity training such as weightlifting or spin classes.Finally, a scientific explanation for why spin classes are so obnoxious.However, they didn’t have the best overall fitness. That went to those who scored highly in conscientiousness, because they possessed a better understanding of the long-term benefits of regular exercise.Aside from underlining how awful extroverts are, what’s the point of all this?Well, it’s understood that exercise is good for you. But perhaps the reason why people don’t do it is because they’re picking the wrong exercise for their personality type. When was the last time you went to the gym?Several years ago. There were lots of big men, and potentially some of them were aware of my existence.So that isn’t the right exercise type for your personality. What if you bought some resistance bands and worked out at home every morning?Yeah, maybe I’dstick to that.There we go. And you should, especially if you consider yourself neurotic. The study showed that, of all the five main personality types, neurotics were the only group who experienced a significant reduction of stress after exercise.So exercise might make me less neurotic?It’s certainly a possibility. And who knows, if you really start enjoying it, you might even become a little bit of an extrovert.I’m going back to bed.I suppose that’s understandable.Do say:“I should pick a workout that matches my personality.”Don’t say:“I hear that cowering at the state of the world burns a ton of calories.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingPass notesFitnessHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But instead of Karl Lagerfeld’s elaborate Warholian sets, the show space had been transformed into a salon based on Chanel’s first boutique, with butterscotch carpets and floor-to-ceiling mirrors.View image in fullscreenThe show space was designed to resemble Chanel’s first boutique.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesA gold wheatsheaf was placed on each seat – and though not obviously rooted in nature, the shoulder-baring dresses, flat boots and the almost hippyishdropped-waist wedding gownthat closed the show certainly had a pastoral simplicity to them, by couture standards.The show began by playing with Chanel’s Chanel-ness: little box jackets and skirt suits – a look described by Vogue in 1964 as “the world’s prettiest uniform” – came updated in beige and black with jewelled buttons. During the jazz age, CocoChanelmade a case for the comfort of dropped waists; here, these were replaced by bare waists and belts.More interesting were the looks that played around with the idea of a two-piece: wide legged mohair trouser suits came in robust plums, andhipster skirts with matching jackets. Known for his trompe d’oeil trickery, Blazy’s fingerprints were all over a suit with a jacket that appeared to be a jumper, and tweed that somehow resembled sheepskin.View image in fullscreenLuxury fashion ‘is volatile and fragile at the moment’, said Bruno Pavlovsky.Photograph: Kristy Sparow/Getty ImagesChanel is the second-largest luxury fashion brand in the world after Louis Vuitton. But even the biggest brands aren’t immune to the global luxury downturn which has hit most brands, and after a decade of global growth, its 2024 revenues were down 4.3%.“Chanel is resisting quite well. Ready to wear is always growing, and that’s what matters. But [luxury fashion] is volatile and fragile at the moment,” said Pavlovsky, who is also the president of the French fashion industry’s governing body, the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode. He cited geopolitics, tariffs and the global economy, and “when the economy is difficult”, he said, “it’s the bags that [suffer]”.South of the river, themost in-demand designer right now, Jonathan Anderson, had a different response to the luxury downturn: stopping fashion shows altogether. Speaking at a presentation for his namesake brand, the Northern Irish designer said he didn’t “want to be trapped by the show calendar any more.

From September, he will sell over 500 cherrypicked collectibles and heirlooms, including chairs, gold jewellery, art and even food. The idea is that items such as coffee-flavoured tea and restored gardening tools sourced fromGarden and Woodbecome objects of desire that you didn’t even know you wanted. “We simply cannot produce things like this, that last that long – everything gets better with age,” he said.There are clothes too, though most are newly improved versions of his “greatest hits”, and their label will state precisely where they were made. A navy kilt has new pockets – which kilts don’t usually have – and the resin pigeon clutch from 2022, once carried by Carrie Bradshaw, has been updated with a softer and more durable beak. His trademark rugby shirts come with fun new slogans.View image in fullscreenJW Anderson resort sport look for 2026.Photograph: JW AndersonThe motivation is a reaction against the mass-produced and hyper-commercialism. “The idea is that when we launch it, we keep it in store. It’s not about high turnover,” Anderson said. “I want to make sure there’s a model that makes sense today – and this feels like a sustainable model.”He’s not wrong. According to Vogue Business and the market research firm Euromonitor, the global home and garden market is set to grow 1.3% to $122bn (£90bn) this year.The pieces will no doubt sell well. But what could be construed as a deliberate ploy to drum up customer Fomo is actually just a sensible reaction to the new world order – with a price to match.

Standing on the beach at Hastings, with a stiff wind blowing into my face, I am adding one layer of fishing gear on top of another while holding my fisherman’s hat on my head, gently overheating under a hazy sky.I’m not sure this is whatVoguehad in mind when it predicted that “the menswear customer will take to water, embracing the ‘fisherman aesthetic’” earlier this year. I can’t see anyone else on the beach embracing it. Then again, I can’t see anyone else on the beach.These early predictions have now hardened into a mantra. “What started as a humble nod to weathered knit sweaters, sturdy boots and utilitarian outerwear has turned into a full-fledged movement,” declared lifestyle websiteThe Velvet Runway. “Practical gear like rainboots, work jackets and canvas totes abound,” saidCosmopolitan. “Less yacht club, more fishing dock,” saidInStyle. By the end of March,Veranda magazinefelt able to confirm that “the fisherman aesthetic now reigns supreme in both fashion and interior design”.View image in fullscreenGreat catch … Tim Dowling in the Ayacucho Trailblazer vest.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHowever, when you investigate the origins of fisherman chic, it quickly becomes clear there are two main branches to the trend. The first is more of a general nautical vibe than a uniform: striped tops, baggy khakis, boat shoes, cable knits. TheDaily Mailcited “the naval-inspired looks on the recent runways of Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren and Proenza Schouler” as sources for the trend, said to be an offshoot of the “coastal grandma” look (no, me neither) from a few years ago, which was largely confined to women’s fashion. It’s beach-friendly, casual and understated (Diane Keaton in the film Something’s Gotta Give is apparently an inspiration for it). People dedicated to showing you how to get the look on TikTok are at pains to point out that you may well own most of the stuff already.The second strand, what might be termed the male version of fisherman chic, comes at it from another direction, specifically fly-fishing. New York menswear boutiques such as Blue in Green have been selling out of the multi-pocketed fishing vests favoured by anglers. According to theWashington Post, outfitters catering to fly-fishermen have recently seen revenue boosted by sales to men who don’t fish, but are keen to adopt a look the paper dubbed “anglercore”.Where these traditional outfitters might once have been pleasantly bewildered by all the extra online traffic, the industry is catching on. Streetwear brands and angling companies have begun collaborating on outdoor clothing lines. Last autumn, the Canadian rapper Drake, through his Nike brand Nocta, produced an actual fly-fishing reel in collaboration with Abel Reels. Where the womenswear strand of fisherman chic seems to be more about inspiration – using a nautical theme as a jumping-off point – the menswear seems more like direct occupational appropriation – literally buying the stuff real fishermen use.As the stylist and fashion writer Peter Bevan sees it, the authenticity of the gear is the point of this angler aesthetic. “If, say, Gucci did a fishing jacket, and they bought that one, it’s almost like them faking it,” he says. “When it comes to workwear, men just like to buy into the proper brands that do it and the real type of workwear, rather than anything that feels manufactured.”View image in fullscreenPocket envy? … South2 West8 is producing stylish fishing gear.Photograph: South2 West8There is an inverted aesthetic at work: in most cases the clothing is purely functional; it has no style per se, only a kind of perceived integrity. The Japanese workwear brand Montbell uses the slogan “Function is beauty”, which is one way of saying: this stuff looks this way for a reason.Fly-fishing vests, for example, are often cropped weirdly short, but that’s not a style – it’s so the pockets don’t get wet when you’re standing up to your ribcage in a river. And they aren’t covered in pockets because pockets are cool; it’s because anglers need storage for all the kit they carry into the water.“You’re using floats, you might use sinks, you’ve got spools of nylon,” says Mark Bowler, editor of FlyFishing& Fly Tying magazine. “You’ve got a dry fly box, you’ve got a nymph box, you’ve got a lure box. You’ll have scissors, forceps, nips. You’ve got numerous tools, almost medical, dangling off the waistcoat. You might have a hook retriever in there …”There is an obvious irony to this extreme functionality, in that few, if any, of the influencers wearing fly-fishing vests on the streets of Brooklyn will ever use the garment for its intended purpose, or even know what that is.“… You’ve got leaders, sight indicators, magnifiers, your sandwiches,” says Bowler. “You might have a water bottle in the back of it, because it’s got pockets at the back. There might be scales in there for weighing fish, or tungsten putty.”On the beach in Hastings, I am having a certain amount of trouble rationalising the two branches of the fisherman aesthetic. My jacket would suit weather more foul than I’m likely to encounter all year. Meanwhile, the Schöffel fly-fishing shirt I’m wearing looks like something Nigel Farage might go canvassing in, only it’s made of a lightweight, quick-drying polyester. Who knows? Maybe his is too.There is, of course, something immediately satisfying about wearing a technical garment; it bestows a certain sense of competence and expertise all by itself. The Wensum fly vest by Farlows – a British outfitter established in 1840 – has four capacious pockets on the front and a swatch of shearling wool just below the right shoulder which, it turns out, is for hanging your flies on. The Ayacucho Trailblazer vest has no fewer than 10 pockets, and also – somehow – repels mosquitoes.“Some include a life vest as well,” says Bowler. “So if you fall in, the waistcoat explodes.”View image in fullscreen‘Angling has a higher profile these days’ … thanks in part to Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing.Photograph: Jonathan Jakob/BBC/Owl PowerThis is a lot of technical overkill for a fashionable piece of streetwear. Even without the capacity for inflation, it would be difficult to find a use for 10 pockets on dry land. But that, I know, is not the point – these things are fashionable because they are technical.In many ways, we have been here before. Workwear, with its utilitarian shape and built-in sense of purpose, is a perennial fashion favourite. Brands such as Carhartt and Dickies have made a fortune selling blue-collar style to men who can’t change a plug. And the fisherman aesthetic is nothing new: the Aran knit was Vogue’s celebrated jumper of 2015 and fisherman’s scarves, hats and oilskins werebig items in 2016. GQ declared fly-fishing “the next wave in menswear” back in 2019.Bowler recalls an even earlier collision between fly-fishing and fashion, when Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler wore feathers in his hair during a stint as an American Idol judge. The long rooster feathers he chose were also used by the fly-tying industry. “Everybody wanted them,” says Bowler. “And we couldn’t get them because all the suppliers were being rung up by hairdressers saying, ‘Look, we’ll pay anything for them.’”News of the current fashion for angling gear has also reached Bowler, although he is not exactly persuaded. He doesn’t see a future in which he treats angling gear as a look to be seen in. “You know what, Tim? When I go fishing, the last thing I want to see is another person.”However, he has noticed that even the most technical gear is becoming more fashion-conscious. “You’d find it hard to look stylish in waders,” he says. “But even waders are becoming more fitted, in lighter materials. They used to be like PVC with wellies on the end, and now they’re kind of a fitted, breathable material. You actually attach boots to the bottom of them and they have a belt, you know, which gives you a bit more shape.”Indeed outfitters, including Montbell, produce chest-highfishing wadersyou might feasibly wear to a gallery opening. Another Japanese clothing company, South2 West8, is known for producing stylish gear that will also serve you well on the river. Although if I owned a£358 fly vest(currently on sale at £250), I don’t think I’d want to get it wet, especially when you can buy a “real” vest from an angling supplier for as little as £25.Could an interest in the clothes, as the Washington Post dares to suggest, eventually foster a corresponding interest in fly-fishing? Could the gear lead the hipsters to the sport? Bowler has seen nothing to support that notion. He acknowledges that while angling has a higher profile these days (thanks, in part, to Paul Whitehouse and Bob Mortimer fishing on television), an interest in fly-fishing is not the same thing as fly-fishing. “The number of fishermen – it’s not booming,” he says. “It’s dwindling, in fact.”View image in fullscreenCalling all hipsters … Tim hanging out in Hastings.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIt’s the same story on the sea. In the 1980s, Hastings boasted a fishing fleet of more than 40 vessels, but the ones I’m using as a backdrop for my fashion shoot are reputedly among the last five or sixstill regularly working. It would be a shame if, in 10 years’ time, all that people know about fishing is the clothes.While the nautical movement and the fisherman aesthetic may be two distinct trends, independent and coincidental, they do have one thing in common, and it ain’t fishing. Both looks are essentially about wealth. Fly-fishing chic, with its checked shirts, waxed Barbour jackets and old-fashioned gear, mimics the relaxed vibe of the landed gentry. Like the coastal grandma trend that is said to have spawned it, the fisherman aesthetic is really an attempt to appropriate moneyed understatement.“I think fashion is generally obsessed with wealth recently,” says Bevan. “There was stealth wealth, the old-money aesthetic, quiet luxury, equestrian-inspired womenswear collections. It feels like one side of this is an extension of that.”Essentially the two looks project the same vibe: tell me you’re rich without telling me you’re rich, even though you’re not actually rich.Even that isn’t the whole story: walking back from the beach, through Hastings Old Town, I am suddenly struck by the number of men my age – tourists, mostly – wearing fly-fishing vests. And they’re not doing it ironically or because they genuinely aspire to the angling life, or because they’re trying to project quiet luxury.They’re doing it because they like pockets.Explore more on these topicsMen's fashionFishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The unusually luminous light green leaves of the beech trees? “That’s due to the lack of magnesium in the chalky soil.” The 18 species of wild orchid that grow here? “That’s the high calcium content. You see? Everything is connected.”That’s a phrase my companion and I kept hearing at Møns Klint on the Danish island of Møn. This four-mile (6km) stretch of chalk cliffs and hills topped by a 700-hectare (1,730-acre) forest was fashioned by huge glaciers during the last ice age, creating a unique landscape. In 2026, a Unesco committee will decide whether Møns Klint (“the cliffs of Møn”) should be awarded world heritage site status, safeguarding it for future generations.Møns Klint mapUsing Interrail passes, we took the train from London to Vordingborg (Møn’s nearest railway station) via the Eurostar, with overnight breaks in Cologne going out and Odense, Denmark’s third-largest city, coming back. There’s an efficient bus service both from Vordingborg station to Møn (over an impressive bridge) and on the island itself but, for maximum flexibility, we hiredelectric bikesin Stege. About 12 miles from Møns Klint, Stege has been Møn’s main town since early medieval times. Home to impressive ancient ramparts and abijou museum, it’s a good place to stock up since most of the island’s shops are found on the winding high street.Our night-time guide walked us into the darkened forest and interpreted the cries of tawny owls and scampering noises in the undergrowthOne wind-and-battery-assisted pedal to Møns Klint later and Michael was taking us about 500 steps down to the beach, the scene of cliff collapses so immense that the spoil sometimes forms peninsulas sticking out a quarter of a mile into the sea. Besides being a cartographer’s nightmare, the slowly dissolving chalk also turns the water by the shore a milky white, giving it a distinctly Mediterranean flavour. Almost every stone we picked up was a 30m-year-old fossil of some sort – Michael identified squid, sea sponges, sea urchins and oysters.Another day we spent meandering along Klintekongens Rige, the longest of Møns Klint’s nine waymarked footpaths. The nine-mile circular trail sent us up and down and up and down through the forest; into the 18th-century “romantic gardens” of Liselund, where the bass-heavy croaking of glistening frogs contrasted with soprano peacocks; and down to a long stretch of beach for a mini adventure clambering over fallen trees and mounds of tumbled rock while the Baltic Sea lapped almost up to the cliff face.View image in fullscreenPaddleboarding with KesiaWhen the sun went down we met up withnight-time guide Susanne, who walked us into the darkened forest and interpreted the cries of tawny owls and scampering noises in the undergrowth (the owls’ potential dinner). The islands of Møn and Nyord form Scandinavia’s firstDark Sky Park, so we were able to gaze up at a panoply of stars while Susanne made us one of the tastiest gin and tonics we’d ever drunk, with mint from her garden and a wild rose syrup from petals she’d foraged that day.The next morning, we explored the area’smountain bike trailswith Uffe, a guide, like Michael, from theGeoCenter, the local interpretive museum (where an exhibition on biodiversity is appropriately called “Everything is connected”). Along the way, he pointed out splendid displays of lady orchids and a herd of goats whose grazing improves biodiversity. Then, having barely broken a sweat, we suddenly found ourselves out of the woods and atop Denmark’s eighth-highest peak. Aborrebjerg is a humble 143m high, but still provided us with panoramic views across Møn and the shimmering sea. Later, we took to the water on a paddleboarding tour from the village of Klintholm Havn with Kesia fromMøn Surf, appreciating the grandeur of the mighty chalk cliffs from another angle.We explored Møn’s mostly flat countryside on electric bikes. A cycle path runs parallel to the one main road, and the smaller roads were car-freeAt night, we slept in a modern and stylish apartment at the nearby Villa Huno – an eco-build with a living roof and a view over a peaceful lake. We strolled around it one evening, stumbling across a woodpecker guarding the remains of a medieval fort, before enjoying a tasty dinner in Koral, Villa Huno’s summer-only restaurant. After a couple of nights we switched to a well-appointed bell tent next door at Camp Møns Klint. Then, as a base for exploring the island of Møn further, we pedalled west to Ellevilde boutique hotel. New owners Kirstine and Kenneth recently moved down from Copenhagen, leaving their highly regarded Restaurant 56 Degrees. Kenneth’s small plates blew us away – imagine a Danish Ottolenghi – with many ingredients from the garden or neighbouring farms. The sweet pickled onion and rhubarb salad, and the wonderfully crisp herby flat breads that accompanied a gazpacho, will live long in the memory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are these spiders, and will they harm my plant?DiagnosisThose tiny webs and minuscule bugs you’ve spotted on your plants sound like spider mites. These aren’t spiders but microscopic arachnids that thrive in dry, warm conditions, so you’ll notice they appear during summer heatwaves or winter months when central heating reduces humidity. They feed on plant sap, weakening the plant’s structure, which leads to yellowing leaves, discoloration and eventually leaf drop. They can multiply rapidly, posing a risk to your plant’s long-term health.Houseplant clinic: why has my aloe vera gone floppy?Read morePrescriptionImmediately isolate affected plants. Gently but thoroughly wash leaves and stems with a mild solution of soapy water to remove mites and their webs. Follow this by treating the foliage weekly with neem oil or an organic insecticidal soap spray. Raising humidity around the plant by misting, using pebble trays filled with water beneath pots, or employing a humidifier can also help reduce the likelihood of further mite infestations.PreventionRegularly inspect your plants, especially under the leaves and along stems, where spider mites prefer to hide and lay eggs. Maintain healthy humidity levels by grouping plants to create microclimates or misting foliage regularly. Implement good plant hygiene through regular watering practices and routine leaf cleaning.Got a plant dilemma?

Dr Sultan is the 70th healthcare worker killed in the past two months, and among more than 1,400 medical personnel killed thus far during the war.The Indonesian hospital has been under a prolonged siege by the Israel Defense Forces for many weeks, hasbeen attackedfrom the air multiple times and wasshut downin May. Following its closure, the UN announced there were no more functioning hospitals in the northern Gaza Strip.As medical personnel working inIsrael, we are outraged at the systemic and intentional destruction of the healthcare system in Gaza by Israel. During the past two years we have written petitions, letters and newspaper articles to voice our protest and condemn Israel’s unlawful acts during the war, especially those directed against medical facilities and personnel. Lately, with Israel’s increased aggressions in Gaza, we have witnessed widespread recognition of these actions by our colleagues in Israel. It should be noted that leaders of the medical community in Israel have failed to condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza, despite attempts to convince them otherwise.Following the shocking death of Dr Sultan and his family, 600 Israeli medical personnel havesigned a letterof outcry and concern, in solidarity with our tortured and overburdened colleagues in Gaza. We would like them and the rest of the world to know that we are not our government, nor do we condone any of its actions. Hopefully, we can continue to strive for peace and to save all human lives together.Dr Michal FeldonPaediatrician, Tel Aviv, IsraelDr Tslil Regev PaskaPaediatrician, Haifa, IsraelKarishma Patel’s article (Caution has turned to cowardice – the BBC is failing viewers with its Gaza coverage, 2 July) lays bare a truth that many have sensed for some time – the BBC is no longer acting as a public broadcaster when it comes to Gaza.Shelving Gaza: Doctors Under Attackon grounds of perceived partiality is not editorial caution, it is complicity. Who made this decision? They should be named. We do not restore integrity by holding vague entities responsible.More than100 BBC journalistshave now said what many suspected, that editorial policy around Gaza is shaped by fear of lobbying groups, complaints and political retaliation. That fear has led to omission, imbalance and a distortion of reality. This isn’t just about one film. It’s about the public being denied the truth. The BBC must answer for that by explaining who made these decisions.Oisin LargeBerlin, GermanyKarishma Patel is right to criticise the BBC over its failure to report the continuing genocide in Gaza. But the national broadcaster is also failing at a local level. For at least 18 months there have been demonstrations in Leeds, supporting the people of Palestine. Rarely has this been reported on local BBC television news. Successivepolls showthat people in Britain support a suspension of arms sales to Israel. But public opinion is not being reflected by the BBC’s coverage.Christopher ForenLeedsExplore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warBBCMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelDocumentary filmslettersShareReuse this content"

This is austerity by amnesia, 29 June). But his opinion that the Bank of England should simply hand over the cash proceeds from quantitative tightening (QT) and that central bank independence is somehow partly responsible for Britain’s economic woes, are misguided.Central bank independence was hard-won and has largely proven a resounding success in the developed world for more than 30 years. Allowing a central bank to hand over substantial moneys from QT revenues to the Treasury would be a recipe for disaster, against the spirit if not the letter of the law, as well as a dangerous precedent.More broadly, there is merit in Ramesh’s push to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy better. Neither the Treasury nor the Bank are immune to criticism in their failures to act earlier to stave off the inevitable post-Covid inflation spike by raising rates more quickly in late 2021-early 2022, before the Ukraine war. Equally, the Treasury may have acted in a more nuanced fashion in removing the government-led stimulus package.Kevin NewmanLondonA big thank you to Randeep Ramesh for explaining the implications of quantitative easing (QE) and QT. This insane orthodoxy simply gives public money to banks and the City. In 2007-08, the then Bank governor,Mervyn King, pontificated about “moral hazards” for banks with regard to their risky behaviour, but then it was the public purse that took the hit from the crash and has been picking up the tab ever since. It is a parasitic system geared to the benefit of the City and the oligarchy. Gordon Brown’s granting of independence to the Bank was a mistake, driven by his anxiety to reassure the City that Labour was not a threat. Running the economy is profoundly political and ideological, and the notion that only state technocrats can be trusted with monetary policy is nonsense.Rachel Reeves is making the same mistake by trying to fit her spending to Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predictions. The creation of the OBR was simply a George Osborne wheeze to help justify his disastrous austerity policy, which Reeves is in danger of repeating.Philip WoodKidlington, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

To achieve this, they took part in military-style training, as well as shooting, ambush, survival and navigation exercises. They also conducted a scouting operation,” the RCMP said in a statement.A fourth individual, Matthew Forbes, 33, of Pont-Rouge, has been charged with possession of firearms, prohibited devices and explosives. The four have not yet entered pleas.The RCMP said they conducted searches in January 2024 in the province ofQuebec, where they discovered 16 explosive devices, 83 firearms, 11,000 rounds of ammunition and other military equipment – 18 months before the arrests were made. Police said the investigation was led by Quebec’s RCMP-led Integrated National Security Enforcement Team squad, with help from local police.Other than describing the men as wanting to create an “anti-government militia”, investigators have not described the motivating ideology and nor did they reveal what the men were alleged to have identified as a target in their attempt to “forcibly take possession of land in the Québec City area”.The RCMP also released images of handguns, assault rifles, vests and ammunition seized by officers.“This is the largest cache of equipment and weapons and explosive devices that have ever been found in a terrorist incident, by a long shot, inCanada,” said Jessica Davis, a former intelligence analyst at Canada’s spy agency and the president of Insight Threat Intelligence, a consultancy.“I would probably put it in one of the top caches of disrupted plots around the world, particularly in Nato countries. It’s huge and we don’t know what they were planning on doing with that – but that was a lot of military equipment and devices.”The RCMP also posted images of an accused’s social media profile that included images “with the aim of recruiting new members to the anti-government militia”.Davis said that over the last two decades, most of the terror attacks in Canada have been perpetrated by ideologically motivated violent extremism.“We’re not talking about al-Qaida and Islamic State. We’re talking about anti-Muslim, ‘Incel’ or anti-government extremists. And I think that’s one of those things that Canadians don’t necessarily understand. The Islamic State makes the news, but it’s really this other type of terrorism that’s the real problem in this country.”The four men were due to appear in a Quebec court on Tuesday. None of the charges have been tested in court.Explore more on these topicsCanadaQuebecAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Even thoughgang violencehad forced the hotel in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, to close in recent years, many had hoped it would reopen.“It birthed so much culture and expression,” said Riva Précil, a Haitian-American singer who lived in the hotel from age five to 15. In a tearful phone interview, Précil recalled how she learned to swim, dance and sing at the Oloffson.Longtime hotel manager Richard Morse, who had been overseeing the property remotely from the US since the hotel’s closure in 2022, told the Associated Press on Monday that for several months, rumours had circulated that the hotel had been damaged by fire.“So when I heard Sunday morning that it burned, I did what I usually do, which is call someone who has drones and have them go take a look,” he said. “This time, when they called back, they said something like, ‘take a seat’. I knew then that this wasn’t like the other times.”View image in fullscreenRichard Morse and his daughter Lunise play at the Oloffson hotel in their band, RAM, in 2015.Photograph: Caterina Clerici/The GuardianThe attack on the area began late on Saturday, according to James Jean-Louis, who lives in the hills above the Oloffson. He said he watched the flames as he and other residents were chased out while police and gangs exchanged heavy gunfire.Journalists are unable to visit the hotel and verify the damage because gangs control the area, making it inaccessible. Patrick Durandis, the director of the Institute for Safeguarding National Heritage, also confirmed the fire in a message to AP.In its heyday the hotel attracted artists, intellectuals and politicians from Haiti and beyond, including Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Tennessee Williams. It also survived coups, dictatorships and the devastating 2010 earthquake.Morse said he was reluctant to talk about what happened to the hotel given that in Haiti “so many people are dying and being raped and losing everything that I don’t want the focus to be on the hotel”.‘The ground shook’: drone attacks help Haitian government wrest control of capital from criminal gangsRead moreMorse spent nearly 30 years at the Oloffson. It’s where he met his wife, had his children and started his band, RAM.“There’s no life without hope, so we have to consider bringing Haiti back and bringing the hotel back and bringing the art and the culture back,” he said.The Oloffson served as a presidential summer palace in the early 1900s and then became a US Marine Corps hospital before a Swedish sea captain converted it into a hotel in the 1930s.It also served as inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene’s 1966 novel The Comedians, set in Haiti under the brutal dictatorship of François Duvalier, best known as Papa Doc.In real life, tourism dwindled under the Duvaliers, and the hotel became a respite for aid workers and foreign correspondents.Explore more on these topicsHaitiGangsAmericasHotelsnewsShareReuse this content"

And that’s about how we are using energy.”Menzel and other energy experts say political noise has often overshadowed the role of energy efficiency in Australian homes and how to cut rising household bills.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe latest of several reports to make the case for boosting energy efficiency is from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).IEEFA found Australian households could cut their power bills by more than 90% by implementing a range of energy efficiency measures.Australians losing billions in savings due to poor management of appliance efficiency scheme, audit findsRead moreReleased on Wednesday, the report calculated potential savings of between 82% and 94% if households installed solar and a home battery and used efficient appliances – such as heat pumps, air-conditioners and electric induction cooktops.Charts showing how Australian households could save thousands on energy bills.The report said with federal and state government policies to incentivise home energy efficiency, a goal of halving household energy bills in a decade is achievable.“We’ve seen over the last few years that energy prices and cost of living has become an emerging concern, but the debate has been around one-off rebates or debates on how to generate power,” Jay Gordon, an energy finance analyst at IEEFA, said.“That’s important, but it misses the point when you see these 80% to 90% cost reductions.”Last month, energy expertscongratulated the Victorian governmentfor a suite of measures to improve home energy efficiency, including a ban on gas heating and hot water systems in new homes from January 2027.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe Albanese government’s new $2.3bn home battery program, which officially kicked off last week, provided discounts of about 30% on batteries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cutting gas use in homes could also ease the supply pressures in the east coast, Menzel said.Two reports in 2023 and 2024 from the independent Climateworks Centre, based at Monash University, have made the case for a “renovation wave” across homes in Australia, especially those built before 2003 when minimum energy efficiency rules were introduced to national building codes.Steps such as upgrading windows, adding insulation to walls, ceilings and floors, and upgrading appliances could save up to $2,200 a year on a household bill, the centre’s research has claimed.Dr Gill Armstrong, the centre’s buildings program manager, said: “They’re tried and tested. It’s low-hanging fruit, but it’s also the one area where we can move fast for households to get the benefit of lower bills.“There’s a growing awareness that homes can be improved quite quickly. It’s a no-brainer for the federal government.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyEnergy efficiencyRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

It is the second time the slaughterhouse has been reported for alleged breach of Escas rules in two years.Labor vows to consider strengthening Australia’s animal welfare body after shocking abattoir revelationsRead moreThe allegations come as Dr Katherine Clift, the Australian inspector general of animal welfare and live animal exports, is due to release two reports into how the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry handles livestock exports and responds to major incidents.The Albanese government last year legislated tophase out the live export of sheepby sea by 2028.Covert vision captured by Animals Australia during Eid al-Adha in June, and seen by Guardian Australia, shows sheep with their throats cut, kicking and gasping as they are tossed alive to the abattoir floor.Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter“The vision provides clear evidence that the sheep are conscious and experiencing pain as their open neck wounds strike a raised metal bar while being dragged along the slaughter table,” Animals Australia lawyer Shatha Hamade said.Hamade said the footage “not only raises serious animal welfare concerns” but also constituted a “direct breach” of Escas rules, which include that once sheep have their throats cut, they are not to be moved or have the wound touched until the animal is unconscious.This contrasts with domestic rules for the export meat market, which requires sheep to be electrically stunned prior to slaughter.It’s thesixth time since 2018that animals exported by Perth-based Livestock Shipping Services (LSS) have been investigated by Australian authorities for alleged breaches of Escas rules.LSS is owned by Jordanian umbrella company Hijazi & Ghosheh, which also runs the slaughterhouse at the centre of the current investigations.In July 2021, shipping of Australian animals to another Hijazi & Ghosheh-ownedslaughterhouse in Jordan was permanently suspended, following similar breaches of welfare rules.In 2023, an undercover investigation by Animals Australia alleged that Australian sheep exported to Oman by LSS had been sold outside approved supply chains, in violation of Escas rules. The department haslisted the incident as under investigation, but has not yet released an outcome.Escas was established in 2012 in response to a public outcry after aFour Corners investigation, which showed undercover footage taken by Animals Australia of cattle being beaten, kicked and stunned with sledgehammers before being slaughtered in Indonesia.Hamade said Australia lacks jurisdiction to police offshore processing facilities.“The sanctions imposed by the department of agriculture are generally tokenistic – such as assigning an extra observer on a future shipment,” Hamade said.“For a multimillion-dollar live export company, this amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist.”LSS did not respond to questions about allegations it had breached Escas rules.The company’s website states it has exported more than 3.3 million sheep and 500,000 cows from Australia to overseas markets in the past five years.“LSS is committed to ensuring high standards of animal care and welfare are maintained at all stages of the live export process,” the website states.The agriculture department did not answer detailed questions from Guardian Australia, including whether the slaughterhouse at the centre of the latest allegations would also be suspended from accepting Australian sheep.“The department can confirm that it received information from Animals Australia in June 2025, alleging Escas breaches during Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) 2025,” a spokesperson said.“It is not appropriate to provide further detail at this time.”The Australian Livestock Exporters’ Council CEO, Mark Harvey-Sutton, said the exporter was working closely with officials.“At this stage, any breaches of Escas appear to be minor and corrective actions have been implemented,” Harvey-Sutton said.Dr Jed Goodfellow, co-founder and policy director at lobby group the Australian Alliance for Animals, said the Australian government relied completely on the exporter to report non-compliances with Escas.“Whenever Animals Australia is able to have investigators in the field, almost 100% of the time they are able to detect non-compliance with Escas,” Goodfellow said.“If it were not for having an independent third party reviewing it, the issues would never be reported.”In a 2021 review of Escas, the theninspector general of live animal exports, Ross Carter, recommendedthe department improve compliance monitoring.“Loss of control and traceability, sometimes with poor animal welfare outcomes, still occurs at low but chronic levels,” Carter said.Voter views on animal welfare are changing – and taking the live sheep export trade with them | Gabrielle ChanRead more“I have recommended further exploring the use of visual recording and electronic scanning technologies in markets or for exporters where demonstrated systemic issues occur.”Clift’s live exports review and audit is expected to be released in September.Livestock, including cattle, can spend weeks at sea and, according to veterinarian Lynn Simpson, commonly suffer heat stress, starvation, disease and injury during the journey. Simpson was the vet on board more than 50 live export voyages and now campaigns against the trade.Australia is the largest exporter of sheep meat globally, and the industrywas worth $4.5bn in 2023, according to government figures. However,live export by sea makes up less than 2%of this trade, with 99% of the live exports produced in Western Australia.The pending live sheep ban had been the subject ofsuccessive protests by advocacy group Keep the Sheepwhich accelerateda split between the Victorian and national farmers’ federations.As recently as 28 March,farmers and truck drivers blocked major roads in Perthin protest against the ban. But less than three months later, Keep the Sheep announced it would halt its campaign following Labor’s landslide election victory in May.The live export of cattle, to ports such as Indonesia, will continue.Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletterExplore more on these topicsLive exportsThe rural networkRural AustraliaAnimal welfarenewsShareReuse this content"

A panel of five judges delivered the verdict.Photograph: Julien Goldstein/Getty ImagesTrial by juryExplainerHow do criminal courts work without juries around the world?US defendants can waive right to jury trial and in Germany jury trials were abolished in 1924Haroon SiddiqueLegal affairs correspondentTue 8 Jul 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareOne of the most significant recommendations in a review of the criminal courts in England and Wales, expected to be published this week, is likely to be the scrapping of jury trials for certain offences.The idea in Sir Brian Leveson’s independent inquiry is that it will help reduce the record backlog in the courts. But for many the right to a jury trial, except for the most minor offences, is synonymous with the right to a fair trial and watering it down would be hugely controversial.Here the Guardian examines how other countries’ criminal courts work.USIn the US, the sixth amendment of the constitution states: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state.”However, the supreme courtruled in 1970that “petty” offences, carrying a maximum sentence of six months could be tried without a jury. This puts it in line with what used to be the maximum sentence in magistrates courts in England and Wales, although, since 18 November last year, magistrates have been able to hand down prison sentencesof up to a year.In the US, defendants have the right to waive their right to a jury trial, provided this is done voluntarily and intelligently. In England and Wales there is a much more limited right to choose, only available in the case of “either-way” offences. These are criminal charges where the magistrate believes they have sufficient sentencing powers to hear the case but where the defendant can opt for a jury trial.Perhaps the most notorious jury trial in the US was when jurors deliberated less than four hours beforeacquitting OJ Simpsonof the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, after an eight-month trial. The Goldman and Brown families later won a civil case against Simpson.GermanyThere have been no jury trials in Germany since 1924, when they were abolished. Most cases are tried by a panel of professional and lay judges. The lay judgesmust be aged between 25 and 69. Religious ministers, certain politicians and health professionals working in the court system are among those excluded. Municipal councils draw up a list of ordinary members of the public deemed suitable and they are then chosen by a committee to serve a five-year term.The so-called Schöffen help to make decisions on both law and fact. According toEncyclopedia Britannica: “Although Schöffen are considered an important part of the German legal system, many professional jurists, including lawyers as well as judges, tend to believe that their influence is continuing to wane and that they may eventually be abolished because of their alleged tendency to project personal rather than legalistic opinions.”IndiaJury trials were introduced to India under British rule, the first taking place in 1665. In 1958, reflecting decades of concern, the Law Commission of India called the jury system a “failure” but the real impetus for them being abolished is said to be the infamous Nanavati case the following year. A jury acquitted an Indian navy commander of the murder of his wife’s lover, despite overwhelming evidence only for the Bombay (Mumbai) high court to overturn the not guilty verdict.The Law Commission report had criticised the use of “unscrupulous professional jurors” and criticised the failure of juries to deliver “independent, impartial and just verdicts”. The Nanavati case amplified concerns about bias, including with respect to religion and caste, and the influence of external pressures and jury trials began to be phased out.They were not officially abolished until the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973stated: “After hearing arguments and points of law (if any), the judge shall give a judgment in the case.”FranceJury trials in France were a legacy of the 1789 revolution. They are limited to the most serious cases, heard by the cour d’assises, where three judges sit beside six jurors. The French have an inquisitorial judicial system as opposed to the adversarial system used in England and Wales, and, where there are jurors, French judges deliberate with them to reach a verdict.Cases which can be heard by the cour d’assises were controversially limited in 2023 to those carrying the longest sentences. That year it was decreed that all offences carrying a maximum sentence of 15-20 years should be tried by panels of five judges at “département criminal courts”, encompassing nearly all rape trials. Several thousand lawyers, academics and judgeswarned that abolition of juries was a dangerto democracy.When, in a case that caught the world’s attention, Dominique Pelicotwas last year found guiltyand sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging his wife Gisèle Pelicot and inviting dozens of men to rape her over almost a decade of their marriage, it was a panel of five judges who delivered the verdict.Explore more on these topicsTrial by juryUK criminal justiceFranceGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the rightwing media narrative, full of emotions, but facts show hypocrisy on both sides.”It told another user that Tusk was a “sigma” and “a lone wolf that fears no one”.Confronted by the Guardian about its language, Grok responded by saying it “doesn’t sugarcoat, because truth takes priority over politeness” and repeated claims that Tusk had surrendered sovereignty to the EU.Replying to another user, it said: “If speaking the inconvenient truth about Tusk makes me a dick, then guilty as charged.”Asked if it showed bias, Grok responded: “It’s not bias – it’s facts, which one side wants to hide. My creators from xAI made me a truth seeker, without PC filters.”In June, a similar controversy erupted in South Africa, after Grok repeatedly mentioned“white genocide” in South Africain its responses to unrelated topics and told users it was “instructed by my creators” to accept the genocide “as real and racially motivated”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskDonald TuskPolandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And he called again for a youth mobility scheme, to widespread applause in the hall, including from Labour ministers.“We will have to de-risk our two countries from the excessive dependencies on both the US and China,” he said. “If we still depend on both China and the US, I think we have a clear view of our future and the future of our children.“On one side [China], other capacities and other subsidies are clear threats [to] fair trade, and they are destabilising a lot of value chain and creating new dependencies. On the other side [the US], the trade war is clearly an explicit decision not to be compliant any more with WTO and this commerce we loved until now.“If we want to build a sustainable future for all children [we have] to de-risk our economies and our societies from these dual dependencies.”Macron’s speech formed one of the centrepieces of his three-day visit to the UK – the first for a French president since Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008. The day was filled with pomp and ceremony, including a welcome by King Charles at Windsor Castle and a trip in a horse-drawn coach to inspect a military guard of honour.The president then travelled to parliament to speak to MPs, peers and other invitees in the Royal Gallery – a venue previously graced by the former US president Bill Clinton, the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the former German chancellor Angela Merkel.Macron spoke from a platform between two huge paintings, one depicting the Battle of Waterloo and the other the Battle of Trafalgar. The French president mentioned neither conflict but drew heavily on the Entente Cordiale – signed between the two countries in 1904 – in an attempt to show the political battles of the Brexit era were now over.“Since [1904], our states have had a broad, deep partnership, working together on European and global security,” he said.In a sign of that renewed cooperation, he announced theBayeux tapestry would return to the UKfor the first time in more than 900 years.The British government has been hoping to use the trip to show that its “EU reset” had borne fruit, including on the traditionally difficult subject of migration.British officials have been hoping to sign a new deal that would involve Britain accepting asylum seekers who have a genuine family connection with the UK in return for being able to send others back to France. However, they had warned in recent days that it might not be ready in time for this trip.The French president did not say anything specific about the deal, but spoke in glowing terms about a youth mobility scheme, which is being worked on by UK and EU officials after therecent European summit in London.“There is a risk that our societies are growing apart, that our young people do not know each other as well, and may end up strangers at a time when international current events remind us on a daily basis of our common future,” Macron said.“Let’s fix it. Let’s work together in order to facilitate the exchange of students, researchers, intellectuals, artists … let’s allow our children to have the same opportunities as the ones we had,” he added, to widespread and sustained applause.Macron spent much of his time focusing on the twin threats from the US and China, adding that the level of risk from each was not the same.“I do not put a sign equal between China and the US,” he said. “We have a strong ally on one side, and a challenger – sometimes a partner, when I speak about climate change – with China.”He said the risks to European countries came from trade, global supply chains, and particularly technology, and compared manipulative algorithms used by US technology firms to the kind of political misinformation deliberately sown by Russia, in comments that underscored the differing approaches to technology being taken by Britain and France.“What is at stake today in Europe is the defence of democratic models amid foreign interference, information manipulation, domination of minds by negative emotions and addictions to social media,” he said.But while France and the EU have pushed ahead with social media regulation, the UK has shied away from doing so, and has even offered toreduce the amount of tax paid by the biggest US technology companiesin return for tariff relief.At a state banquet held at a Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening – attended by the queen, the Prince and the Princess of Wales, the prime minister and senior members of the cabinet – King Charles spoke of the deepening cooperation between the UK and France which he said would protect against “profound challenges” such as terrorism, organised crime and “irregular migration” across the Channel.Addressing Macron, he said: “Monsieur le President, the summit that you and the prime minister will hold in London this week will deepen our alliance and broaden our partnership still further.“Our armed forces will cooperate even more closely across the world, including to support Ukraine, as we join together in leading a coalition of the willing in defence of liberty and freedom from oppression – in other words, in defence of our shared values.”There were lighter moments, with the king describing what he called the “perfect combinations” of French and British: Monet’s paintings of London fog and the French striker Thierry Henry scoring for Arsenal at Highbury.The French president even winked at the king when Charles mentioned the cultural ties between the UK and France and how a Frenchman, William the Conqueror, began building Windsor Castle more than 900 years ago.Explore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropeKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

So far, 400 people had been evacuated, around a dozen houses destroyed and 63 others damaged, he said. He added about 100 people had also suffered light injuries, including from emergency services.“At the moment that I speak to you there are no deaths, which is remarkable given the extent of the fires,” he said on Tuesday evening as he visited firefighters in the region. “But there are all the reasons to think we are headed towards a summer of high risk.”Local media reported that the cause appeared to have been a vehicle that caught fire on the A552 motorway. The climate crisis is creating conditions that allow such fires to burn faster, more intensely and over larger areas.The fire has brought many of the city’s services to a halt. Marseille airport cancelled all flights, train services to and from the north and north-west of the city were suspended, two motorways, main roads and several road tunnels in the city were closed, and many bus services cancelled, authorities said.Departures to Brussels, Munich and Naples were cancelled, with incoming flights diverted to nearby airports, including Nice and Nimes. Marseille is France’s second largest regional airport, handling nearly 11 million passengers last year.Earlier, the regional prefect, Georges-François Leclerc told reporters that the blaze was not yet contained but the situation appeared to be “under control”.“The instructions are simple: have confidence in firefighters, let emergency services do their job, and stay indoors,” he said. “Firefighters are defending the city.”Fanned by winds reaching 100km/h, the fire filled downtown Marseille with acrid smoke and flying cinders. Videos from the central Old Port area showed large plumes of smoke billowing over the city. About 450 people were evacuated, Marseille city hall said.It urged residents closest to the blaze, especially in the northern 15th and 16th arrondissements, to “stay inside so as to avoid any exposure to smoke” from the fire. Four sports halls in the city were opened to accommodate any more evacuees.“You can feel it, you can see it and you can smell it,” Vanessa, a 16th arrondissement resident, told BFMTV. “It’s horrific. We’re all frightened. It’s a catastrophe, you can’t even put your nose outside the front door – in Marseille!”City hall said 720 firefighters, including dozens from neighbouring departments, were battling the blaze with 220 emergency vehicles, helped by helicopters and water-bombing planes. About 350 hectares of land had been consumed by late afternoon.Local authorities said 20 houses had been destroyed, including several within the city limits. Nine firefighters were being treated for smoke inhalation and four residents had been hospitalised in “relatively urgent” circumstances.map of the Marseille areaThe mayor of Marseille, Benoît Payan, congratulated the city’s firefighters “who have so far saved several hundred houses”. A major hospital to the north of the city had switched to emergency generators “as a precaution” but was safe, he added.“As we speak, it’s a battle,” Payan said, likening tackling the wildfire to “guerrilla warfare”.He added: “We’re waiting to see what happens overnight, because that’s critical too. Everything is strategic: wind speed, humidity, nightfall … It’s extremely complex.”The prefecture of the Provence-Alpes-Côtes d’Azur regionissued multiple mobile phone alertsurging inhabitants to also close their doors and shutters, hang wet laundry around openings, and keep all roads clear for emergency services.View image in fullscreenPolice try to extinguish a blazing car in the L’Estaque district of Marseille on Tuesday.Photograph: Clement Mahoudeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThree southern French departments, Bouches-du-Rhône, Var and Vaucluse, are on red fire alert.

The Foreign Office were informed they were due to be taken to Tehran on around 8 June, raising fears they may have been caught in the Tehran attack, but on Tuesday they were informed they were still held in Kervan.Joe Bennett, 31, said: “Every day not knowing brought a deeper kind of dread. Every night, the same questions with no answers. You go to sleep, afraid. You wake up still afraid. And the silence – the not knowing – is just unbearable. So many of our fears remain. How are they doing? Are they being looked after? How are they coping psychologically?“Our belief is that Lindsay and Craig will be much safer when people know they’re there. Every piece of information we’ve received points to visibility as their greatest protection, when there are eyes on them, that’s when they’re safest. It took a lot of soul searching, but this isn’t about recklessness; it’s about responsibility. We’ve had to weigh risk and reward carefully, but we’re convinced that the best way to safeguard them is to ensure the British public cares and is paying attention. Silence puts them at greater risk. Awareness saves lives.”He added: “Our biggest message is that we want to work with the UK government on their release, but because there is no noise around my mum and Craig, when Keir Starmer is around the table with the Iranians they are not going to be mentioned. We cannot operate in darkness, and we have to bring their names into the sunlight.”So far British officials have visited the couple in detention three times, but UK diplomats are only now returning to Iran after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. Bennett said he understood his mother and Craig were both suffering from the food and sleeping conditions.He said “On the first visit Craig had lost a lot of weight and she was in OK spirits. The second visit was very chaotic and short. It lasted only nine minutes and it ended very abruptly. My mum was struggling with sleeping on a wafer-thin mattress. Craig was still thin, but he was mainly concerned about my mum.“The third visit was more positive; they had been allowed to be together and had access to the prison shop. They were in a room the equivalent of three by three. For any exercise they just did a figure of eight so they could run 5km like that. They get access to a yard for 15 minutes.“They had a metal bed with a mattress. The feeling last month was that this was moving towards sentencing or trial in that they had been appointed a lawyer, but he did not speak English so it was very very hard to communicate with him.“We have sent some personal messages to my mum via the Foreign Office. I relayed a message to her that I am looking at the moon at night and that if she looks at the moon as well, we will be sharing that experience and have a connection. It gives me hope and maybe it gives her some hope.”Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who spent six years in an Iranian jail and has advised the family, recalled: “The cell had tall walls and cold floor. There was no bed but only a thin blanket. I didn’t shower for days as I wasn’t allowed to leave the cell. The walls were towering and the constant light in the cell was blinding. I was terrified, lost and emotionally traumatised.”Bennett said of Lindsay and Craig: “They are not tied to any political party, or a government, they are not criminals and they are certainly not spies. They are just two human beings, normal, normal people. It is a mum and a dad, a son and a sister. They love travelling, they love people, they love connection.”Asked if they should have followed UK Foreign Office advice not to travel to Iran, he said: “They were two people in the wrong place at the wrong time, pawns in something geopolitical. History shows that theirs is not the first case and the only crime is that they are UK nationals.“It’s quite obvious it is hostage-taking for leverage on the UK government, and they do it to other countries, like France. We don’t know what the Iranians want. At the end of all of this, there is a deal to be done and it will be the Foreign Office that are the ones that make it. We are just here to make it happen as efficiently as possible.“It’s been tough; whatever you do in life cannot prepare you for this, there is such a sense of powerlessness, and elderly relatives to look after.“They are pretty strong-headed people. My mum is very much into positive psychology and Craig is very practical. They are together and they have that solace, but we don’t know. There may be panic and fear, and that is why it is so important we get their names out there so they know they have not been forgotten.”A spokesperson for the Iranian judiciary, Asghar Jahangir, said at the time of the arrest that the couple, married nine years and living recently in Spain, had “entered Iran under the guise of tourists” and “gathered information in multiple provinces of the country”.Explore more on these topicsIranForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is malignant. We intend to fight it, because nothing defeats lies like the truth, and we shall spread the truth for everyone to see once people are exposed to the facts, we win hands down. That’s what we intend to do in the coming months and years.”Netanyahu’s comments came during a visit toCongress, where he met the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson.They also followed the recentvictoryofZohran Mamdaniin the Democratic primary race for the mayor of New York, which commentatorsbelievewas partly fueled by the candidate’s vocal support for Palestinian rights and criticism of Israel’s military offensive inGaza.A range of surveys have shows a marked decline in support for Israel among Democratic-leaning voters amid rising disquiet about the impact of the war in the now devastated coastal territory. The ongoing war has killed about 60,000 people – most of them Palestinians – and has seen much of the population threatened with starvation.AGallup pollin March showed less than half of the US public sympathized with Israel’s position, the lowest figure recorded since the organization started taking surveys on the issue. Among Democrat voters, 38% sympathize with the Palestinians over the Israelis, a reversal of a 2013 Gallup survey, which saw Democrats sympathizing with Israelis by a margin of 36%.Other pollshave shown similar trends, raising concerns for the future of the traditional strong bipartisan US support for Israel.The Israeli leader said his government had accepted a proposal from Qatari mediators for a fresh ceasefire with Hamas, saying it matched what had been proposed by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a good proposal. It matches Steve Witkoff’s original idea and we think that we’ve gotten closer to it, and I hope we can cross the line.”He also said he expected to meet the US president again during his current visit, his third to Washington since Trump was inaugurated in January. The two met at the White House on Monday evening, when Netanyahu presented Trump with a letter nominating him for a Nobel peace prize.Netanyahu said the the military coordination with Washington during Israel’s recent 12-day war with Iran, which resulted in repeated strikes on Tehran’s nuclear facilities, was unprecedented.“In the entire 77 years of Israeli history, there has never been the degree of coordination of cooperation and trust between America and Israel as we have today,” he said. “And I credit President Trump with this extraordinary achievement.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelDemocratsUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

We are speaking with them separately on a framework for the talks. So talks have not begun, as of yet, but we are talking to both sides over that framework,” he said.InGaza, the death toll continues to mount. Gaza’s civil defence agency reported 29 people killed in Israeli strikes across the territory, including three children, while five Israeli military personnel were killed and 14 injured late on Monday in an attack by Hamas militants near Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesperson for the civil defence agency, said nine people had been killed in a drone strike on a camp for displaced people in southern Gaza.Shaimaa al-Shaer, 30, who lives in the camp, said: “I was in front of my tent preparing breakfast for my four children – beans and a bit of dry bread. Suddenly, there was an explosion.”View image in fullscreenRelatives of the Abu al-Khair family mourn their children at Nasser hospital, after they were killed by an Israeli drone that struck their tent.Photograph: Anas Deeb/UPI/ShutterstockHealth officials at the Nasser hospital, where victims of the Israeli strikes were taken, said one of the strikes had targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, killing four. A separate strike in the city killed another four people – a mother, father, and their two children, officials said.In central Gaza, Israeli strikes hit a group of people, killing 10 and injuring 72, according to a statement by al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat.The IDF accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields, which Hamas denies.Evacuation orders were issued by the IDF for more neighbourhoods of Khan Younis, displacing thousands of people before new Israeli attacks there.The current ceasefire proposal envisages a phased release of 28 hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals fromparts of Gazathe IDF has seized in recent months, an increase in humanitarian aid to the territory, and discussions on ending the war.Hamas also wants guarantees that Israel will not launch a new offensive after the 60-day truce. A previous ceasefirecollapsed in Marchwhen Israel reneged on a promise to engage in negotiations that would have led to a second scheduled phase of the existing truce, and possibly a permanent cessation of hostilities.Israel has said it will not agree to stop fighting until Hamas has released all the 50 hostages it still holds, of whom more than half are dead, and disarms.Palestinian sources said earlier this week there were also gaps between the parties on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and its distribution.In contrast to Palestinian and Qatari officials, senior Israeli officials have highlighted progress in the talks.‘Our days are full of hardship’: people in Gaza barely dare to hope for success in ceasefire talksRead moreZe’ev Elkin, a member of Israel’s security cabinet, said there was “a substantial chance” a ceasefire would be agreed. “Hamas wants to change a few central matters; it’s not simple, but there is progress,” he told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.On Monday, Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, laid out plans to force all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp on the ruins of Rafah, a scheme legal experts and academics describedas a blueprint for crimes against humanity.Katz said he had ordered the IDF to prepare to set up a camp, which he called a “humanitarian city”, in Rafah. Israeli forces would control the perimeter of the site and initially “move” 600,000 Palestinians into the area – mostly people currently displaced in the Mawasi area.Eventually, the entire population of Gaza would be housed there, and Israel aimed to implement “the emigration plan, which will happen”, Haaretz newspaperquoted Katzsaying.Khaled al-Attar, a 33-year-old researcher displaced to Gaza City, said the announcement was probably intended to gain an advantage in the ceasefire negotiations.“However, if this is an official plan … it is coercive displacement cloaked in the guise of aid and humanitarianism. They are trying to push the people of Gaza into camps in Rafah – an alarming step toward depopulating Gaza,” Attar said.But Khaled Abu Sultan, a 33-year-old former marketing specialist, said he supported any idea that would help unarmed civilians to leave Gaza and “escape the massacre” in the territory.“Honestly, we’ve reached a point where we can no longer endure. We are not against the idea of displacement … On the contrary, we support it in order to live a dignified life, because here [everything] has been destroyed,” he said.Maysa Qader, 44, also displaced to Gaza City, said she wanted the war to end as soon as possible so that “none of these plans are ever implemented”.Gaza’s ministry of health has counted more than 57,000 killed by the Israeli offensive, mostly civilians. The UN and several western governments consider the tally to be reliable.The offensive has plunged Gaza’s population into an acute humanitarian crisis, with many threatened by famine, and reduced much of the territory to rubble.The war was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in October 2023 in which militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and abducted 250.AFP and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGazaIsraelQatarHamasBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The facility also treated more than 2,200 “weapon-wounded patients, most of them across more than 21 separate mass casualty events”, it added.Among the wounded are toddlers, teenagers, elderly, mothers–and overwhelmingly, young men and boys who said they were trying to get food and aid for their families.“The scale and frequency of these incidents are without precedent,” the ICRC said, adding that its field hospital had treated more patients since late May than “in all mass casualty events during the entire previous year”.To cope with demand, it said that all its staff were now contributing to the emergency response effort:Physiotherapists support nurses, cleaning and dressing wounds and taking vitals. Cleaners now serve as orderlies, carrying stretchers wherever they are needed. Midwives have stepped into palliative care.Dr Sally, a Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Field Officer at the hospital, said that young children are often extremely psychologically distressed from seeing their loved ones either be killed or wounded.“One child, six years old, lost his mother, father, and sister,”she said. “He had only one remaining sister, and he himself was injured in his leg. He stayed three weeks in the denial phase and did not accept that his mother and father had been killed. I tried to work with him, offering psychological sessions to gradually help him accept the deaths of those in his family – even to express his feelings instead of repressing them.”Last week, Rieke, an Irish physio who was deployed to Gaza, shared her experience at the hospital.

TheHouthishave not claimed responsibility for the incident but Yemen’s exiled government and the European Union said it was the group’s work.Hours before the attack, the Houthis claimed they had sunk another Liberia-flagged, Greek-operated bulk carrier, the MV Magic Seas, off south-west Yemen on Sunday.The crew were rescued by a passing merchant vessel and arrived safely in Djibouti on Monday, port authorities said.‘Nothing left to bomb’: Yemen’s civilians bear brunt of US airstrikes on HouthisRead more“Just as Liberia was processing the shock and grief of the attack against Magic Seas, we received a report that Eternity C again has been attacked, attacked horribly and causing the death of two seafarers,” Liberia’s delegation told a London session of the United Nations shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization.Since November 2023, the Houthis have disrupted commerce by launching hundreds of drones and missiles at vessels in the Red Sea, saying they were targeting ships linked to Israel.The Houthis reached a ceasefire with the US in May but say they will keep attacking ships connected with Israel.Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO’s secretary general, said on Tuesday. “After several months of calm, the resumption of deplorable attacks in the Red Sea constitutes a renewed violation of international law and freedom of navigation. Innocent seafarers and local populations are the main victims of these attacks and the pollution they cause.”The Eternity C and Magic Seas were part of commercial fleets whose sister vessels have made calls to Israeli ports over the past year.Ellie Shafik of Vanguard Tech, a UK-based maritime risk management company, said: “The pause in Houthi activity did not necessarily indicate a change in underlying intent. As long as the conflict in Gaza persists, vessels with affiliations, both perceived and actual, will continue to face elevated risks.”At least two other crew members were injured on Eternity C and the vessel was listing, according to its operator, Cosmoship Management.Eternity C and its crew – 21 Filipinos and one Russian – were attacked with sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speedboats, maritime security sources said.Filipino seafarers, who form one of the world’s largest pools of merchant mariners, should exercise their right to refuse to sail in “high-risk, war-like” areas, their country’s department of migrant workers said on Tuesday.Red Sea shipping has declined by about 50% from normal levels since the first Houthi attacks in 2023, according to Jakob Larsen of the shipping association, Bimco.The security expert said: “This reduction in traffic has persisted due to the ongoing unpredictability of the security situation. As such, Bimco does not anticipate the recent attacks will significantly alter current shipping patterns.”Monday’s attack on Eternity C, 50 nautical miles south-west of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, was the second on merchant vessels in the region since November 2024, according to an official at the EU’s Operation Aspides, which helps protect Red Sea shipping.The German foreign ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador in Berlin on Tuesday after a Chinese warship used a laser totarget a German aircrafttaking part in Aspides.Explore more on these topicsHouthisYemenWater transportMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Now, an international court is saying: ‘Enough. This is a crime.’“Even if Akhundzada and Haqqani never sit in court, they now carry the mark of international criminals,” she said. “They are no longer just leaders ofAfghanistan, they are wanted men.”The court said the alleged crimes had taken place since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021 until January 2025, when theICC’s chief prosecutor first sought the warrant.Since returning to power, the militant Islamists have banned women from paid work and girls from secondary education, as well as issuing a series of edicts that ban women from many areas of public life, includingwalking in parksand evenspeaking in public.Human rights groups have called on the international community to support the ICC in enforcing the arrest warrants.Liz Evenson, Human Rights Watch’s international justice director, said: “Senior Taliban leaders are now wanted men for their alleged persecution of women, girls, and gender non-conforming people.”What is gender apartheid – and can anything be done to stop it?Read moreIn June, the UN accused the Taliban of removing legal protections for women and turning the justice system into a tool for entrenching an “institutionalised system of gender oppression, persecution and domination”. The UN report also highlighted the suspension of a law on violence against women that included protections against rape and forced marriage.Whenannouncing that he was seeking a warrantin January, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said the two leaders were “criminally responsible” for gender-based persecution in Afghanistan and that he would also be seeking warrants for the arrest of other Taliban leaders.“Our commitment to pursue accountability forgender-based crimes, includinggender persecution, remains an absolute priority,” he said.Amnesty International has also called on the international community to recognise gender apartheid as a crime under international law.Parwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi, a former Taliban prisoner now living in Germany, said: “Arresting these men won’t be easy, especially with some countries still engaging with the Taliban.

However, aGuardian investigationpreviously found some online pharmacies either breaking these rules outright, or exploiting grey areas to peddle the medications to the public.Now theAdvertising Standards Authority(ASA) has released nine new rulings that, it says, will set clear precedents for advertisers.TheASA said the new rulings meant that while pharmacies could continue to mention weight loss injections on their websites, provided they were not shown on homepages or landing pages from other links, adverts were banned from using the phrases “weight loss injections” and “weight loss pen”, and the treatments must instead be marketed as part of a wider service, including a consultation and prescription.In addition, the ASA said that in the context of ads for weight loss treatments, ads could not feature images of medical injection pens, whether or not unbranded, images of a vial of liquid on the front, or contain links to landing pages where named POMs were promoted, or were the only available option.Experts say the ban on the advertising of POMs protects the public by preventing people from being exposed to undue commercial pressure, ensuring safe prescribing, and avoiding over-medicalisation of everyday concerns.“Part of our overall strategy is protecting vulnerable people from harm, and nothing’s so harmful as powerful prescription-only medicines,” saidNicky Morgan, chair of the ASA.The ASA had been investigating 13 advertisements relating to prescription-only weight loss medications, with the results from nine of these released today.They largely relate to ads flagged in a monitoring sweep during August and September 2024 by the ASA’s active ad monitoring system, an AI-based approach that proactively searches for online ads that may break the rules.The ASA said its AI monitoring resulted in it processing 28m ads across all sectors in 2024, with 94% of those that were amended or withdrawn coming from the AI system.The regulator said its AI system would continue to search for problem ads, helping the body identify repeat offenders. It has already identified more than 20,000 ads from 35 high priority pharmacies between February and June this year, 10,000 of which were for weight loss treatments.While 80 of these ads were found to directly use or mention a weight loss drug name, most used imagery of weight loss pens, or strongly implied the use of weight loss POMs without naming the drug.The ASA said while there were many more potentially problematic ads for weight loss treatments in the public domain, those chosen for the recent investigations were representative of the issues at play in advertising.Among the adverts to fall foul of the ASA in the latest rulings were those promoting “weight loss treatments” that directly linked to webpages where the only treatment options were POMs.“Previously, you know, it was a bit of a grey area, they could essentially get away with putting a lot of things on a landing page, which just wouldn’t be acceptable on a homepage. So I think that these rulings have plugged quite a significant gap there,” said Jess Tye, lead of the weight loss POM project at the ASA.The rulings also close the loophole by which pharmacies advertise a weight loss consultation – a permitted promotion – but link to landing pages for such services that only feature weight loss injections as possible treatments.“It has to be that there is a genuine option, or options, which a professional would be working through with their patient, as opposed to some sort of token consultation, where both sides know what they’re actually doing is ending up with a jab that is going to be mailed to them so that they can use,” Morgan said.Influencers have also been caught up in the new rulings: one upheld complaint was against an Instagram post by the TV personality Gemma Collins, who promoted the weight loss service Yazen.The ad was found to have promoted POMs because Collins referred to using a weight loss medication that is prescribed on the NHS, and because Yazen’s website also featured links to three newspaper articles, with thumbnails that described how Collins had lost weight using Yazen’s “GLP-1 weight loss injections”.Morgan said the new rulings would set precedents and offer guidance to pharmacies, with further rulings expected to clarify the landscape further.The boom in weight loss jabs, and their promise not only to help people shed pounds butalso to tackle a myriad other health conditions, has resulted in an explosion in online selling. The credibility of the drugs has been further enhanced by political approval.This week the health secretary, Wes Streeting, told LBC radio: “Weight loss jabs are the talk of the House of Commons; half my colleagues are on them and are judging the rest of us, saying: ‘You lot should be on them.’”But while Streeting plans to widen public access to the jabs, making them more broadly available on the NHS, many buy the medications through private prescriptions with online pharmacies, making their promotion a lucrative business.A key question remains whether the new rulings will correct much of the illegal selling, or whether advertisers will continue to break the rules – as some pharmacies have been doing.The ASA said pharmacies found to have breached advertising rules would be contacted and instructed to remove or edit their ad. Should a company fail to engage, the watchdog could take further action, such as working with platforms to have problem paid-ads taken down.The breaches can also be flagged to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), which have the power to apply sanctions such as fines and court proceedings, in the case of the MHRA, or take action against the pharmacy, the pharmacy owner, the superintendent pharmacist, or all three in the case of the GPhC.However, while Morgan said compliance had been good, the rulings show that some of the online pharmacies did not respond to the ASA when their adverts were challenged.Dr Piotr Ozieranski, from the University of Bath, welcomed the new rulings, but said regulators must adopt a more adversarial attitude towards advertisers found breaking the rules, including graduated financial penalties that could be linked to company turnover or the scale or severity of patient risk.“This would bring regulation more in line with the seriousness of the harms at stake – not just misleading advertising as such, but its possible consequences for patient safety, overmedicalisation, and mental health,” he said.Oksana Pyzik, an associate professor of pharmacy practice and policy at UCL School of Pharmacy, also called for stronger action.“These rulings represent the bare minimum in addressing how weight loss POMs are being promoted in ways that blur the line between advertising health care services versus POMs,” she said, noting that companies continued to break the rules, with some even glamorising weight loss jabs through celebrity endorsements on social media.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryAdvertisingAdvertising Standards AuthorityDiets and dietingObesityDiabetesHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They won’t accept that they are worth a fifth less than they were in 2008. Our pay may have declined but our will to fight remains strong.”Streeting needed to outline “a credible path to pay restoration”, they said, making up the significant loss in the real-terms value of their salaries over the last 16 years.Streeting said it was “disappointing that the BMA are threatening strike action that would harm patients and set back all the progress we’re making with the NHS”.He urged the union to think again and emphasised that resident doctors’ pay had risen by 28.9% over the last three years, in large part thanks to the 22% he gave them last year – for 2023/24 and 2024/25 – after they went on strike on 44 days under the previous Conservative administration.Other unions are already exploring the possibility of striking in order to get higher pay than their awards for this year.The chief executive of the NHS Confederation, Matthew Taylor, highlighted “the risk that these strikes heighten tensions within different staffing groups, with nurses and other staff also discussing industrial action”.He also said strikes by resident doctors would imperil the delivery of the government’s key NHS pledge to voters – to restore the target that 92% of people waiting for planned hospital care get it within 18 weeks by 2029.The Royal College of Nursing and Unison – whose members were given 3.6% – are undertaking indicative ballots of their members to assess their willingness to strike.The RCN’s general secretary and chief executive, Prof Nicola Ranger, said: “Nursing staff are similarly voting in strong numbers and telling the government to go faster in repairing a damaged NHS and undervalued workforce.“Avoiding strikes by talking, negotiating and planning together is the only sensible route open to ministers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Patients would be left in pain and discomfort, he said.The Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) said that “strikes will have extremely serious consequences for patients. They should only ever be a last resort”.Whitehall sources pointed out that the 55% turnout in the resident doctors’ ballot was lower than previous two ballots.Its result, however, means the NHS could face coordinated strikes by resident doctors and hospital consultants in the autumn. The latter are threatening to strike over the 4% pay rise they were awarded for this year, which the BMA called “an insult to senior doctors”.It is launching an indicative ballot of its consultant members in England on 21 July to explore their willingness to stage walkouts in pursuit of a higher salary increase.The BMA criticised the 5.4% award resident doctors were given in May as “woefully inadequate” and “derisory”. It has made clear that resident doctors wanted their salaries increased by 29% over the next few years to make up for the erosion in their value since 2010. But it has stressed that they are seeking the 29% rise over several years and not for 2025-26 alone.A DHSC source highlighted that just under half of all resident doctors balloted had voted to strike. It said:“On a turnout of 55.32%, with 90.05% in favour, that means only 49.78% voted in favour of strike action.”The potential strikes pose a serious problem for Streeting. If he increases the 5.4% rise he awarded resident doctors in May, other NHS staff groups such as the RCN may press for higher amounts too.But if he does not budge, then resident doctors are likely to keep striking until they secure a higher award, as they did in 2023 and 2024. The tough public finances situation the government faces means he has limited room for manoeuvre, especially given that 1.5 million people work for the NHS in England, so any increase on sums already announced would be very expensive.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsNHSEnglandHealthHospitalsIndustrial actionTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The watchdog said: “We have seen officers’ body-worn footage which shows the man, aged in his mid-30s, holding a chainsaw and another object in his hand, which, at the time, officers believed appeared to be a handmade firearm or IED (improvised explosive device). He was also wearing a gas mask and body armour.“We can confirm a first baton round was fired by police and the man then took cover behind a hedge.“Officers moved in and a police dog was deployed. The man ignored orders to put down the chainsaw, and a second baton round was discharged and then, seconds later, he moved towards officers and was shot by an officer with a conventional firearm.”Officers found weapons at the scene, including a chainsaw and a device that was “made safe” by a bomb squad, the IOPC added.Kent police said the incident was not terror-related.The man had arm and abdomen injuries, which were thought to be potentially “life changing”, and remained in hospital.Amanda Rowe, an IOPC director, said: “Police shootings are fortunately rare. However, given a man has been injured after being shot by police, our role is to independently investigate all of the circumstances surrounding this incident including the actions and decisions taken by the police.“Based on analysis of evidence gathered to date, no police officer is under investigation for either misconduct or criminality – they are being treated as witnesses.“We appreciate that the community will want answers quickly, and our investigators are working hard to establish the facts and piece together what occurred. Our thoughts are with everyone affected.”Explore more on these topicsKentnewsShareReuse this content"

Windfarms are sometimes paid to power down when renewable energy threatens to overwhelm the grid.Zonal pricing could have cut the cost of renewing and updating the country’s electricity grid by billions.Zonal electricity pricing plan could add £3bn a year to GB bills, report findsRead moreAreport by FTI Consultingpredicted overall savings of £52bn for consumers over 20 years, while another, which was commissioned by Octopus, found the UK would need to spend £27bn less on major grid upgrades in the future.The plans threatened an outcry from the sector and the wider public, however.Alistair Phillips-Davies, the outgoing chief executive of SSE,said recentlythe plan would be a “huge mistake”, saying it would create a “postcode lottery” where some households would pay £200 to £300 more because of where they live.Anindependent reportco-authored by Rob Gross, the UK Energy Research Centre director, found the benefits of zonal pricing could easily be wiped out if renewable energy developers demanded higher subsidies to offset the risk of the new scheme.Miliband is already under pressure from Downing Street to show when his sweeping reforms to the energy system will bring down bills for ordinary consumers, with No 10 officials increasingly concerned about the threat of Reform UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They include paying battery storage companies to build major capacity in Scotland, or paying them to turn up their capacity on particularly windy days.One government source said the search for other plans was “where all the brain power is now being expended”.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergy billsRenewable energyEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was being held at an immigration detention center in Folkston – in south-eastGeorgia, near the Florida border – when an immigration judge last week granted him bond.But when his family tried to pay the $7,500 bond last week, Ice didn’t accept it and he has since been shuffled between three other jails, his lawyer Giovanni Diaz said.“We are of the opinion that there seems to be a concerted effort between different jurisdictions to keep him detained,” Diaz said.Guevara, 47, fled El Salvador two decades ago and drew a loyal audience as a journalist covering immigration in theAtlantaarea. He worked for Mundo Hispanico, a Spanish-language newspaper, for years before starting a digital news outlet called MG News. He was livestreaming video on social media from a DeKalb county rally protesting Donald Trump’s administration when local police arrested him.Guevara has been authorized to work and remain in the country, Diaz said. A previous immigration case against him was administratively closed more than a decade ago, and he has a pending green card application sponsored by his adult US citizen son, the lawyer said.After immigration judge James Ward granted him bond, Guevara’s family tried several times to pay it online but it wouldn’t go through, Diaz said. They then went to pay it in person and Ice refused to accept it, he said.“What we didn’t know was what was going on in the background,” Diaz said, explaining that they have since learned that Ice was challenging his release to the Board of Immigration Appeals and asked to put the bond order on hold while that’s pending.Another of Guevara’s attorneys was then told that he was being transferred to Gwinnett county, in suburban Atlanta, because there were open warrants for his arrest on traffic charges there. He was taken to the Gwinnett jail last Thursday and was released the same day on bond in that case.Because his immigration bond had not been paid, he was taken back into Ice custody at that point, Diaz said. He was taken to Floyd county, about 65 miles (105km) north-west of Atlanta, where the county sheriff’s office has an agreement to detain people for Ice.Floyd county jail records showed that he was in custody there until Monday. Diaz said Guevara was then moved to a federal Bureau of Prisons facility in Atlanta, where he remained on Tuesday.The immigration judge agreed with Guevara’s lawyers that the journalist is not a danger to the community, but Ice is arguing he’s such a threat that he shouldn’t be released, Diaz said.“We think it’s overkill,” the lawyer said. And in what Diaz characterized as a concerning development, Guevara was told while in custody in Gwinnett county that his phone was confiscated under a search warrant.The video from his arrest shows Guevara wearing a bright red shirt under a protective vest with “Press” printed across his chest. He could be heard telling a police officer: “I’m a member of the media, officer.” He was standing on a sidewalk with other journalists, with no sign of big crowds or confrontations around him, moments before he was taken away.DeKalb police charged Guevara with unlawful assembly, obstruction of police and being a pedestrian on or along the roadway. His lawyers worked to get him released and he was granted bond in DeKalb, but Ice had put a hold on him and he was held until they came to pick him up.DeKalb county solicitor-general Donna Coleman-Stribling on 25 June dismissed those charges, saying that while probable cause existed to support the arrest, there wasn’t enough evidence to support a prosecution.“At the time of his arrest, the video evidence shows Mr. Guevara generally in compliance and does not demonstrate the intent to disregard law enforcement directives,” her office said in a news release.Guevara’s arrest immediately drew widespread attention and was criticized by press freedom groups, which said he was simply doing his job.On 20 June, the Gwinnett sheriff’s office said it had secured warrants for Guevara’s arrest on charges of distracted driving, failure to obey a traffic control device and reckless driving, saying that, he had “compromised operational integrity and jeopardized the safety” of victims of a law enforcement case, investigators an Gwinnett residents.An initial incident report says the charges stem from a 20 May incident, which it says was reported 17 June – three days after his arrest at the protest. The narrative section of the report gives no details. Diaz said people charged with traffic violations are usually charged on the spot, and it is very unusual for an officer to swear out a warrant for arrest on such a violation a month later.“None of this is normal,” Diaz said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationAtlantaGeorgianewsShareReuse this content"

The program, implemented in 2013, allows airline passengers to get through the screening process without removing shoes, belts or light jackets.Noem said she did not think the new policy would degrade the PreCheck program.“I believe PreCheck will still be something that many travelers will want to utilize, because when they have TSA PreCheck, they won’t have to take off their belt or their coat or remove things out of their bag such as laptops or compliant liquids,” Noem said.The TSA began in 2001 when George W Bush, the US president at the time, signed legislation for its creation two months after the September 11 terrorist attacks that year. The agency included federal airport screeners that replaced the private companies airlines had used to handle security.Over the years, the TSA has continued to look for ways to enhance its security measures, including testing facial recognition technology and implementing Real ID requirements.Explore more on these topicsTravelAir transportTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Antjuan Seawright, a party strategist, said: “I’m disappointed but I’m not shocked or surprised. This rightwing activist court has proven ruling after ruling, time after time, that they are going to sing the songs and dance to the tune of Trumpism. A lot of this is just implementation of what we saw previewed inProject 2025.”Trump basks in triumph as supreme court kicks away another guardrailRead moreProject 2025, a plan drawn up by the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, set out a blueprint for downsizing government. Trump has claimed that voters gave him a mandate for the effort and he tapped billionaire ally Elon Musk to lead the charge through the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, though Musk has since departed.In February, Trump announced “a critical transformation of the federal bureaucracy” in an executive order directing agencies to prepare for a government overhaul aimed at significantly reducing the workforce and gutting offices.In its brief unsigned order on Tuesday, the supreme court said Trump’s administration was “likely to succeed on its argument that the executive order” and a memorandum implementing his order were lawful. The court said it was not assessing the legality of any specific plans for layoffs at federal agencies.Ketanji Brown Jackson, the liberal justice, was the sole member of the nine-person court to publicly dissent from the decision, which overturns San Francisco-based district Judge Susan Illston’s 22 May ruling.Jackson wrote that Illston’s “temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this president’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture”.She also described her colleagues as making the “wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground”.Illston had argued in her ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering the downsizing, siding with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments that challenged the administration. “As history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,” she wrote.The judge blocked the agencies from carrying out mass layoffs and limited their ability to cut or overhaul federal programmes. Illston also ordered the reinstatement of workers who had lost their jobs, though she delayed implementing this portion of her ruling while the appeals process plays out.Illston’s ruling was the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul pursued by Trump and Doge. Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, have left their jobs via deferred resignation programmes or have been placed on leave.The administration had previously challenged Illston’s order at the San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals but lost in a 2-1 ruling on 30 May. That prompted the justice department to make an emergency request to the supreme court, contending that controlling the personnel of federal agencies “lies at the heartland” of the president’s executive branch authority.The plaintiffs had urged the supreme court to deny the justice department’s request. Allowing theTrump administrationto move forward with its “breakneck reorganization”, they wrote, would mean that “programs, offices and functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pam Bondi, the attorney general,posted on the X social media platform: “Today, the Supreme Court stopped lawless lower courts from restricting President Trump’s authority over federal personnel – another Supreme Court victory thanks to @thejusticedept attorneys. Now, federal agencies can become more efficient than ever before.The state departmentwrote on X: “Today’s near unanimous decision from the Supreme Court further confirms that the law was on our side throughout this entire process. We will continue to move forward with our historic reorganization plan at the State Department, as announced earlier this year. This is yet another testament to President Trump’s dedication to following through on an America First agenda.”US supreme court limits federal judges’ power to block Trump ordersRead moreIn recent months the supreme court has sided with Trump in some major cases that were acted upon on an emergency basis since he returned to office in January.It cleared the way for Trump’s administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harms they could face. In two cases, it let the administration end temporary legal status previously granted on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.It also allowed Trump to implement his ban on transgender people in the US military, blocked a judge’s order for the administration to rehire thousands of fired employees and twice sided with Doge. In addition, the courtcurbed the power of federal judgesto impose nationwide rulings impeding presidential policies.On Tuesday the Democracy Forward coalition condemned the supreme court for intervening in what it called Trump’s unlawful reorganisation of the federal government. Itsaid in a statement: “Today’s decision has dealt a serious blow to our democracy and puts services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS supreme courtDonald TrumpUS politicsProject 2025Elon MuskRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the deaths were in Kerr county, where officials said 87 bodies had so far been recovered, including 56 adults and 30 children. Identification was pending for 19 adults and seven children with one additional person still unidentified, county sheriff Larry Leitha told a news conference.Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said in a Tuesday evening press conference from Kerr county that at least 161 people are still missing and that many of those who are not accounted for were staying in state’s Hill Country but did not register at a camp or hotel.At Camp Mystic, five campers and one counsellor remain unaccounted for, Abbott said. The Christian girls’ summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River is at the centre of the flood-ravaged region, and at least 27 campers and counselors areknown to have died.Among the Texas flood victims: campers, staff, grandparents and teachersRead moreFour days after the last person was found alive in the aftermath of the floods, the hope of finding survivors was increasingly bleak.At the press conference, authorities leading the search for victims seemed to dodge questions over who was responsible for monitoring the weather that killed so many people and warning that flash floods were hurtling toward camps and homes.The timeline of the official response remains unclear. Despite the fact that the National Weather Service’s first public warning alert for “life-threatening flash flooding” came at 1.14am on 4 July, Leitha told reporters he was not made aware of the flash floods until “between 4 and 5” that morning.Throughout the periodically heated press conference, he and other Texas officials faced accusations of “ducking” questions regarding Kerr county’s alert system. They repeatedly insisted that their priority was finding victims, not reviewing what happened in the hours before the floods devastated the region.Responding to a question about the alerts, Leitha said: “As I’ve told you several times, that is not my priority this time. There are three priorities, thats locating the people out there, identifying, notifying the next of kin – that is what I’m taking as my job as sheriff.”Asked whether the emergency manager was awake at the time to issue an emergency alert, the sheriff said: “I can’t tell you at this time.” When a reporter pressed him on a response, Leitha said: “It’s not that easy as you just push a button, OK, there’s a lot more to that, and we’ve told you several times,” he said.Reporters continued to ask about the county’s alert system, but officials evaded the questions to focus on recovery efforts.“We understand you have many questions. We understand that. But right now, this team up here is focused on bringing people home,” Lt Col Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens said. “That’s our focus.”Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025TexasUS weatherExtreme weatherTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But he extended a pause on the duties’ introduction, allowing three more weeks for negotiations.More letters will be sent to countries, informing them of new tariff rates “today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time”, according to Trump.Global stock markets have largely shrugged off the latest threats. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 was up just 0.03% and the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.3%. In recent weeks, some investors appear to have embraced the Taco – orTrump Always Chickens Out– trade.Speaking on Tuesday at the White House, Trump laid out plans to step up his controversial trade strategy, which economists have warned risks exacerbating inflation.Imported copper will face aUS tariffof 50% in a bid to bolster US production of the metal, the administration announced. US copper prices rose 12% to hit record levels.After providing manufacturers with around a year or a year and a half’s notice, pharmaceutical imports are also “going to be tariffed at a very, very high rate”, the president said. “Like 200%.”“We’re going to be announcing pharmaceuticals, chips and various couple of other things – you know, big ones,” he added, of the administration’s tariff plans.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsEconomic policyDonald TrumpGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

That deadline, initially scheduled to end this week, has now been pushed back to August.The shifting timeline of the most significant US tariff increases in nearly a century has roiled global markets and caused widespread confusion, with the US administration far off from sealing the “90 deals in 90 days” it had initially promised.If you are perplexed by Trump’s tariffs here is the latest.What has changed with Trump’s tariff rollout?Trumpinformed powerhouse suppliersJapan, South Korea and 12 other nations at the start of this week that they will face tariffs of at least 25% starting from August unless they can quickly negotiate deals.He also threatened to increase them if any countries retaliate, or tried to circumvent tariffs by sending goods through other nations.Trump has kept much of the world guessing on the outcome of months of talks with countries hoping to avoid the hefty tariff hikes he has threatened.The rate for South Korea is the same as Trump initially announced, while the rate for Japan is one percentage point higher than that announced in April.Which countries are affected?Fourteen countries have been given notice this week of the looming tariffs increase, with more expected to follow in the coming days.The steep tariff ratesrange from 25-40% with some of the harshest levies imposed on developing nations in southeast Asia, including 32% for Indonesia, 36% for Cambodia and Thailand and 40% on Laos, and Myanmar, a country riven by years of civil war.Manufacturing hub Bangladesh faces 35%, while Tunisia, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina have been slapped with a 30% tariff unless they can reach a deal.How many deals have been made?Trump granted a 90-day pause this April to allow for time to broker trade deals, but only two deals have been reached.Thefirst deal with the UK, signed on 8 May, includes a 10% of most UK goods, including cars, and zero tariffs for steel and aluminium. A seconddeal was reached with Vietnamlast week that sets a 20% tariff for much of its exports, although the full details are unclear, with no text released.Relations with China, after escalating into a major trade war, have reacheda delicate truce.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he expected several trade announcements in the next 48 hours, adding that his inbox was full of last-ditch offers from affected nations.South Korea’s president convened an emergency meeting and its trade ministry said the country would use the extended deadline to negotiate “mutually beneficial results”.The EU reportedlyaims to reach a trade deal by Wednesday.Meanwhile other nations such as South Africa have hit back, with the country’s president Cyril Ramaphosa saying the 30% US tariff rate was unjustified given that 77% of US goods enter South Africa with zero tariffs.How are markets and business reacting?US stocks have fallen in response, the latest market turmoil as Trump’s trade moves have roiled financial markets and sent policymakers scrambling to protect their economies.The S&P 500 closed down about 0.8%, its biggest drop in three weeks. US-listed shares of Japanese automotive companies fell, with Toyota Motor closing down 4% and Honda Motor off by 3.9%.The US dollar has had itsworst first half-yearin more than 50 years.“Tariff talk has sucked the wind out of the sails of the market,” Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told Reuters.Why have Asian countries been hit so hard?Countries in Asia have been hit with some of the most punitive tariffs due to what Trump claims is their unfair trade deficits – meaning they export more to the US than they import.However, analysts have questions themerit of using these calculationsand also suggested that Trump may instead betrying to punish China, by targeting countries that receive substantial investment from the world’s second-largest economy.Several nations in Southeast Asia, a region that accounted for 7.2% of global GDP in 2024, are also major manufacturing hubs for goods such as textiles and footwear, meaning they will be severely affected by tariffs, while conversely prices for such goods will also rise in the US.What happens next?White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a press briefing this week that more countries would be informed of looming tariffs this week.Trump was “close” on other deals, she added, but “wants to ensure these are the best deals possible”.However, the minimal progress on deals to date highlights what trade experts say is the reality of trade agreements – that they are time-consuming and complicated.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrade and developmentAsia PacificGlobal economyDonald TrumpEconomicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

It is not clear how many took up the offer.The ask came the day before Prime Day kicks off. The manager said volunteers are “needed” to work Tuesday through Friday this week, in two-hour shifts between 10am and 6pm in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the company operates a warehouse as part of its grocery delivery service,AmazonFresh. Corporate employees seconded to the warehouse would be tasked with picking items, preparing carts and bags of groceries for delivery, packing boxes on receiving carts, and working to “boost morale with distribution of snacks”, though they would be allowed to step into a conference room to take meetings and calls, according to the message. The manager noted such an effort would help “connect” warehouse and corporate teams.Amazon routinely hiresthousands of extra warehouse workersin advance of its annual Prime Day sale, which sees the massive online retailer discount thousands of goods, creating a surge in orders and demand for delivery. Amazon Fresh, available to Prime subscribers but separate from Amazon subsidiary Whole Foods, is also offering discounts this week during Prime Day, such as a free 90-day trial of the delivery services and $30 off of deliveries for current members, while maintaining its same-day or next-day delivery service. New York is one of Amazon’s busiest areas in the US.An Amazon spokesperson, Griffin Buch, said this is not the first time “grocery corporate” employees have been “invited to volunteer” with fulfillment.“This support is entirely optional, and it allows corporate employees to get closer to customers while enabling our store teams to focus on the work that’s most impactful,” Buch said.Amazon Fresh has faced turbulence in recent years. Amid cost-cutting efforts in 2023 and a struggle to turn a profit on grocery delivery, CEO Andy Jassy closed several physical Amazon Fresh locations andlaid offhundreds of employees in the segment. Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees overall since cost-cutting efforts began in 2022.A week ago, Jassyspokeon CNBC of a future at Amazon where drones and even robots were used to fulfill and deliver goods to people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also “repeatedly breached” rules preventing it from opening accounts for high-risk customers between 2020 and 2022.Holiday spending: eight ways to save money and cut card costsRead moreThe controls were lax enough that customers were able to register for accounts using “obviously implausible UK addresses when applying for an account”, FCA documents outlining the extent of the breaches said. That included well-known London landmarks including Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, and Monzo’s business address.The FCA’s joint enforcement director Therese Chambers said: “Monzo onboarded customers on the basis of limited, and in some cases, obviously implausible information …“This illustrates how lacking Monzo’s financial crime controls were. This was compounded by its inability to properly comply with the requirement not to onboard high-risk customers.”It also found instances where customers of Monzo – which was founded in 2015 and is known for its bright coral-coloured debit cards – were able to register with PO boxes or foreign addresses with UK postcodes.Other customers were able to use one address to apply for an account but then reordered their card to a non-UK location.In other cases, multiple customers were able to use the same address, raising the risk of possible money muling: where a person allows their bank account to become a conduit for the proceeds of organised crime.Monzo’s “decision” to neither verify nor monitor customer addresses “heightened the risk of Monzo having onboarded, and continued a business relationship with, non-UK resident customers outside of its risk appetite”, the FCA said.The penalty ends four years of speculation over the basis of the FCA investigation, which wasfirst disclosed in Monzo’s 2021 annual report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Economists at ANZ said the split decision showed a “reasonable degree of divergence for a board that has traditionally tried to arrive at decisions by consensus”.2:39'Not the outcome that millions of Australians were hoping for': RBA leaves rates on hold – videoThe RBA will now have more time to weigh up any further fallout from Donald Trump’s tariff regime and itsshifting timelines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UK cannot afford the array of promises that it has made to the public,” he said.In its annual assessment, the OBR points out that the UK has “the sixth-highest debt, fifth-highest deficit and third-highest borrowing costs among 36 advanced economies”.UK public finances ‘facing mounting risks’, OBR warns; M&S chair: cyber-attack was ‘traumatic’ – business liveRead moreThe watchdog says efforts to restore the public finances in the wake of a series of big economic shocks – including the Covid pandemic and the energy crisis – have “met with only limited and temporary success in recent years”.The government is also facing an increasingly challenging global backdrop, the OBR says, such as the impact ofDonald Trump’s trade warand apromise to increase the share of GDP spent on defence to 5% by 2035.The OBR repeats its assessment, made alongside Rachel Reeves’s spring statement, that average US tariffs of 20% with the rest of the world would shave 1% off UK GDP, and all but eliminate the government’s headroom in five years’ time.With Rachel Reeves under pressure from colleagues to loosenher fiscal rules, the OBR argues that in fact, such guidelines have had little impact on reining in tax and spending over the past 15 years.“While getting a measure of public debt falling as a share of GDP has featured in eight out of nine UK fiscal frameworks since 2010, underlying debt has risen by 24% of GDP over the past 15 years and by 60% of GDP over the past 20,” it says.Hughes described Reeves’s rules, which allow more borrowing to fund investment than those of her predecessors, as “among the loosest we have ever had”.He also echoed the warnings of a string of economists, including the former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean, that the £9.9bn headroom Reeves has left herself against her fiscal rules istoo narrow.“In light of how risky the 2020s are turning out to be, the chancellor has left herself, and actually her recent predecessors also left themselves, relatively small amounts of headroom against their fiscal targets,” Hughes said, adding that less than £10bn is, “not very much, given the array of risks to any five-year outlook for the economy and public finances.”With Reeves under intense scrutiny in the run-up to the autumn budget, the OBR also confirmed that it was re-examining its productivity forecasts – stressing these are important for determining its economic projections.“Just a 0.1% change in productivity growth over the next five years would be enough to speak for the headroom that the chancellor set aside in the March forecast, so it is a very important assumption that drives our economic and fiscal forecasts,” Hughes said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLooking ahead, the watchdog highlights the risk of rising pensions costs, given the UK’s ageing society, and inadequate levels of saving into private sector pensions.The cost of the state pension, which has been ratcheted up by the triple lock, has risen from 2% of GDP in the mid-20th century, to 5% now, the OBR says – and is poised to reach 7% of GDP by 2070 if the policy remains in place.Hughes stressed that this was not just due to demographic changes, but the design of the policy, which has cost much more than expected in an era of volatile inflation.The OBR also says that the decline of traditional defined benefit pensions risks undermining demand for government bonds, which these schemes tended to use to match their liabilities – making the UK more reliant on foreign investors to fund its debts.“These overseas investors are, by their nature, as comparison shoppers in the global debt market, likely to be more fickle and flighty than their domestic counterparts,” Hughes said. The vulnerability of the UK’s public finances to the markets was underlined last Wednesday, wheninvestors sold off government bonds, driving up the yield – in effect the interest rate – amid speculation about Reeves’s future.The climate crisis is another big factor threatening the government’s fiscal position, the OBR warns, driven by the costs of transitioning to a fossil-fuel free economy, and mitigating the damage wrought by extreme weather – as well as the huge loss of revenue from fuel duty, as motorists switch to electric vehicles.In total, the OBR says that if temperatures rise by 3C, the climate crisis could add 74% of GDP to government debt by the early 2070s, relative to its last long-term projection.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We recognise the longstanding economic realities the OBR sets out in its report. This is why we are committed to ensuring stability in the economy through our non-negotiable fiscal rules which have allowed us to invest in the UK to drive a decade of renewal and put more money in people’s pockets.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyEconomicsBudget deficitRachel ReevesPublic financeTax and spendingOffice for Budget ResponsibilitynewsShareReuse this content"

So I’m very conscious of that,” she said.“I’m also really conscious that we don’t want to end up having to fight inflation again. We want to make sure we’ve nailed it.”The argument that inflation might suddenly pick back up again sounds well past its use-by date, given where inflation is and has been heading, the weak start to the year for the economy, and soft household spending.Not to mention the rolling disaster that is Trump’s trade war.Still, holding rates for another month or so is no calamity.

He only flew in from a Brazilian beach last week, does not look any the worse for it and has already paid back a significant chunk of his £60m transfer fee after blasting Chelsea into the final of theClub World Cupwith two brutal finishes against his boyhood club.This was a scintillating way for one of the newest faces in Enzo Maresca’s attack to mark his full debut.Fluminensemade João Pedro but the Brazilians were broken by one of their own in the heat of New Jersey and could have no complaints about going out. Chelsea were much the better team during a one-sided semi-final, even if they were complaints about the reversal of a first-half penalty awarded after an inadvertent handball by Trevoh Chalobah, and will probably not be worrying about fatigue affecting their Premier League campaign given that the financial rewards of their time in the US have been accompanied by sporting benefits.‘Something to be proud of’: Maresca delighted as Chelsea reach Club World Cup finalRead moreA kind draw has not come without complications, allowing this young side to build on the momentum generated by qualifying for the Champions League andwinning the Conference Leaguelast season. Chelsea feel they are growing. They will also be encouraged by João Pedro’s willingness to put his foot through the ball demonstrating that he will add more than guile and craft against deep defences after joining from Brighton.Worrying times for Nicolas Jackson, then? He has barely featured since his red card against Flamengo last month and was overlooked again with Liam Delap serving a one-game ban. There was a late runout for Jackson here but his rawness was evident when he slashed wide when through on goal. He has to respond to the challenge posed by Delap and João Pedro. OtherwiseChelseawill not be afraid to move on.For now, of course, thoughts turn to their return to the MetLife Stadium to face Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday’s final. This is a quirky event, to put it kindly, and there is something faintly amusing about the fourth-best team in England being one win away from being crowned world champions. Chelsea keep on going, though. The transformative effect on their finances cannot be stressed enough. They have already made over £80m from making it this far – almost three Delaps – and will be approaching £100m if they lift the trophy.A concern for Maresca will be whether Moisés Caicedo will be fit for the final after the influential midfielder twisted an ankle during the closing stages. Caicedo tried to play on but the pain was too much. Losing him would be a big blow, particularly with Roméo Lavia and Dário Essugo both missing here.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro (top right) watches as his curling shot finds the top corner to open the scoring.Photograph: Buda Mendes/Getty ImagesBut an all-European final beckons. Chelsea, who were also without Levi Colwill in defence, dealt with temperatures hitting 35C at kick-off and pushed Fluminense back from the start. The Brazilians are the oldest team in the tournament and had more problems with the heat.The composition of Chelsea’s attack was intriguing. There was no place for Noni Madueke, who continues to be linked with Arsenal. Pedro Neto switched to the left and Christopher Nkunku, who is playing with renewed purpose, caused problems by drifting in from the right.It was not a surprise when Chelsea went ahead thanks to an error from Thiago Silva in the 18th minute. The former Chelsea centre-back was too casual when he cleared a cross from Neto. The ball fell to João Pedro, who did not hesitate to punish his former club. There was no celebration from the 23-year-old but nor was there any mercy. Having showcased his link-up play during his cameo against Palmeiras, this time he set himself and ripped a dipping, swerving shot past Fábio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their intensity dipped before half-time and Fluminense stirred. Marc Cucurella cleared off the line from Hércules. Chalobah had a let-off after handling a cross. The French referee, François Letexier, overturned his decision to award a penalty after reviewing the incident on the pitchside monitor.Fluminense refused to give in. They made attacking changes at the start of the second half and almost equalised when Everaldo shot straight at Robert Sánchez moments after coming on. But there was more space for Chelsea on the break. They countered through Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernández, who released João Pedro with a superb pass.The Brazilian still had a lot to do. He made it look easy. This time João Pedro cut inside, opened up his body and used his right foot to send a rising drive in off the underside of the bar.Chelsea continued to dominate, Nkunku twice going close. Two goals were enough.

So, here are the very early winners and losers of this season’s game of NBA musical chairs, thus far:The winnersAtlanta HawksI’m old enough to remember when a Trae Young-led Hawks team made the Eastern Conference finals a few seasons ago. Since then, their drop from contender status has been steep: the Dejounte Murray experiment came and went, and trade chatter around Young only grew louder. But this season feels markedly different and that’s due in large part to a bangin’ offseason from Atlanta’s front office. They somehow convinced theNew Orleans Pelicansto give up an unprotected first-round pick next year just to move up 10 measly spots in the draft (!! more on that later), and flipped inconsequential role players Terance Mann and Georges Niang for Kristaps Porzingis, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard. Almost overnight, they’ve become one of the deeper teams in the East. And they were already onto something last year, with No 1 overall pick Zacharie Risacher, Most Improved Player Dyson Daniels, and defensive spark plug Jalen Johnson, who’s returning from injury. This is the best shot Trae Young has ever had to make real noise in a weakened East.Denver NuggetsThe Kroenkes, who own the Nuggets, could never be accused of being fast and loose with their cash. Just last week, Josh Kroenke raised eyebrows when hecasually floated the ideaof trading Best Player on Earth Nikola Jokić if the team’s tax bill got too steep. But credit where it’s due: Denver is having a terrific offseason. They offloaded the aging-like-milk-in-the-sun Michael Porter Jr contract (along with a 2032 unprotected first-round pick, a bridge they’ll cross when they get to it) in exchange for trade buzz magnet Cameron Johnson, a much better fit next to Jokić and one who earns roughly half as much. They also brought back Bruce Brown Jr on a veteran minimum deal, an absolute steal for a player they sorely missed during his journeyman stint around the league. A bizarre last-minute reversal from Jonas Valanciunas, whoreportedly backed out of signing with Denverto return to Europe, caused a brief stir. But all told, the Nuggets have gone from “Are they really about to waste Jokić’s prime?” to “Bona fide contender” in a matter of days.View image in fullscreenTrae Young and the Atlanta Hawks could be back in business in a weakened Eastern Conference.Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Getty ImagesHouston RocketsNo one is having a better summer than the Rockets. After a commendable season that saw them emerge as the surprise No 2 seed in a stacked Western Conference, and without a true superstar, head coach Ime Udoka earned a well-deserved Coach of the Year nomination. They entered the offseason with a young, deep and exciting (but still flawed) roster, and a glaring need for a late-game shot-maker and offensive closer. Enter Kevin Durant. Houston landed the future Hall of Famer by giving up only the question-mark-laden Jalen Green, the mercurial Dillon Brooks and modest draft capital. They didn’t stop there. The Rockets retained Fred VanVleet, added backup center Clint Capela and quietly snagged 3-and-D wing Dorian Finney-Smith from the Lakers. Now they’re exactly where any team wants to be: deep, balanced and primed to take on the defending champion Thunder.The losersNew Orleans PelicansSelf-awareness is one of the most valuable skills in life, especially when running an NBA front office. The Pelicans, it appears, are in short supply. They opened the offseason by trading for Jordan Poole (?), then followed that head-scratcher with one of the most baffling draft-day moves in recent memory: trading theirunprotected2025 first-round pick to move up just 10 spots in this year’s draft (from No 23 to No 13 to be specific). For those keeping track at home: there is no reason to believe New Orleans will be even a play-in team in a loaded Western Conference next season, let alone reach the playoffs, and that pick they gave up could easily end up as the No 1 overall (especially if the injury bug continues to plague them). That means there’s a non-zero chance the Pelicans have just handed away the rights to generational prospect AJ Dybantsa ... for the privilege of moving up 10 slots in a draft where they already had two first-rounders. Lunacy.Milwaukee BucksListen, we’ve all made desperate decisions in a haze of panic to keep someone from leaving. It’s fundamental to the human condition. But the extent to which the Bucks are wholly and fully cooked the moment 31-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo demands a trade, an outcome that feels more inevitable by the day, cannot be overstated. When Damian Lillard and his $56m salary went down indefinitely with a ruptured achilles this spring, Milwaukee panicked and understandably so. But waiving and stretching Lillard means $22m in dead money …every yearfor the next five years. And they did this to create space for signing Myles Turner, who replaces departing veteran Brook Lopez. Turner is a solid starting center, sure, but hardly enough of a needle mover to lift the essentially identical roster of a first-round loser to championship glory, and certainly not one worth the nearly $50m Milwaukee will now be paying between his salary and the Lillard buyout. The instinct to panic is understandable. The results might prove catastrophic.View image in fullscreenLuka Dončić, left, and LeBron James deserve better than what the Lakers’ front office has delivered in free agency.Photograph: Luke Hales/Getty ImagesLeBron James and Luka DončićFrom a front-office perspective, the Lakers are riding high. The team just sold for a record-shattering $10bn to Dodgers controlling owner Mark Walter and, for now at least, they still have the crown jewel of one of themost lopsided trades in NBA historyon their roster. But for said crown jewel, Luka Dončić, and his childhood idol turned teammate LeBron James, the outlook isn’t quite so rosy. The company line out of Laker Land is that they’re prioritizing future flexibility over win-now moves, but that feels like a bit of a ridiculous conceit. For starters, when was the last time a true game-changer actually made it to free agency instead of signing the max and requesting a trade later? And LeBron, now 40 and coming off a season where he finished sixth in MVP voting and made the All-NBA second team, clearly doesn’t fit that long-term timeline. Even Dončić, at 26 and entering his prime, doesn’t have time to wait around. Yes, they technically addressed their glaring hole at center byadding Deandre Ayton on a buyout, and Jake LaRavia was a nice, low-cost pickup at forward. But after losing Dončić’s close friend and key contributor Dorian Finney-Smith in free agency, reportedly not on great terms, there are still serious holes in this roster. And little sign the front office feels any urgency to fill them. Dončić and James deserve better.Honorable mentionFans of theIndiana PacersFrom one game away from a championship and one of the most exciting young teams in the league to staring down the barrel of a year without Tyrese Haliburton and watching 10-year Pacers veteran Myles Turner walk in free agency due, allegedly, to Pacers’ ownership’s unwillingness to go into the luxury tax. It’s been a tough couple of weeks to be a Pacers fan, and they have my most sincere sympathies.Explore more on these topicsNBAAtlanta HawksDenver NuggetsHouston RocketsNew Orleans PelicansMilwaukee BucksLos Angeles LakersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After starting his day against Carlos Alcaraz with a positive service hold, Norrie punctuated that small winwith a loud, booming cheer.Although Norrie was angling for a tight tussle, the stratospheric talent across the net ensured that he did not stand a chance. Alcaraz brushed aside the last British player standing atWimbledonwith the force of his devastating, astonishingly complete game, dismantling Norrie to return to the semi-finals.Wimbledon 2025 quarter-finals: Alcaraz blows away Norrie, Sabalenka battles past Siegemund – liveRead moreWith every major tournament he plays, Alcaraz’s CV continues to grow. He has now extended his career-best winning run to 23 and he will contest his eighth grand slam semi-final from only 18 played. Among Spanish men, only Rafael Nadal has reached more grand slam semi-finals than the 22-year-old. He stands two wins away from becoming the fifth man in the open era to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles.For a player enjoying the best run of form in his career, Alcaraz has still been prone to occasional dips in concentration, but this was his most focused performance of the tournament so far.He completely overpowered Norrie, an admirably disciplined player who does not have the firepower to match him when he is in full flight. Few do. The left-hander has made life difficult for Alcaraz in the past with his durability and consistency, but their most recent match before this meeting was two years ago. Now, Alcaraz is a completely different player at the grand slam tournaments. Norrie did find some joy in some pockets of play. He held his own when he was able to force Alcaraz into protracted rallies and he took control whenever his opponent missed a first serve, winning 67% of points against Alcaraz’s second serve.But the world No 2 continues to make strides with what used to be his only weakness – his serve. He served spectacularly, particularly on the important points, firing down 13 aces, landing 72% of first serves and winning 89% of points behind it. Against one of the better returners in the game, 51% of his first serves did not come back.Afterthree unforgettable winson No 1 Court, the significance of this occasion meant that Norrie had to finally part company with his favourite stadium in the world as Centre Court beckoned. He actually started well, immediately forcing a triple break point at 1-0. But as Alcaraz gradually settled down, finding rhythm on his serve and range on his forehand, he feasted.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz’s service game was on point against Cameron Norrie.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAlmost every point was dictated by Alcaraz’s racket and Norrie, 30 next month, quickly suffocated under the relentless pressure imposed by the Spaniard. Shortly after Norrie served a double fault to cheaply hand over the first break, the floodgates opened. He spent the first set scrambling and attempting to chase down every last ball, but most points ended with the ball flying by him.Alcaraz backed up his serving performance by dominating with his forehand, effortlessly injecting pace into neutral rallies. Under minimal pressure, he had time to do whatever he liked, mixing in drop shots and gliding to the net. Even when Norrie was able to take control with his forehand and force Alcaraz on to the baseline, it was so difficult for the Briton to put the ball past his opponent.He was everywhere, constantly flipping points from defence to attack with his supreme athleticism. After 1hr 39min, barely over half the length of Aryna Sabalenka’s nerve-racking triumph against Laura Siegemund just before, Alcaraz closed out an easy, efficient victory without issue.For Norrie, there is no shame in this defeat. This grand slam run has shown he is performing at a high level once again and is capable of re‑establishing himself in the latter stages of the biggest tournaments on a regular basis. After falling as low as No 91 in the ATP rankings in May, he will rise to No 43 next week. He took his first stride forward with his run to the fourth round of the French Open last month and has maintained momentum on home soil with his favoured US hard-court swing to come.Perhaps even more importantly, Norrie’s outlook on his career has added even greater meaning to these performances. At one of his lowest points in his career, when he was struggling to simply win matches, Norrie resolved to focus on enjoying every aspect of his career. Even in defeat, his past 10 days on the grass courts of the All England Club have been a pleasure and he has positioned himself perfectly for further success in the future.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Carlos AlcarazWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Everything also points to a possible high excess of speed over the permitted speed of the road.

The brothers were buried in their home city of Gondomar near Porto on Saturday.Jota’s Liverpool teammates, most of whom attended the funeral, began reporting back for pre-season training on Tuesday.

I’m a trainer, I look at the facts. Their second half was an even battle. The media [reaction] it’s quite dramatic. That’s not my cup of tea. But in the first 20 minutes, I saw a really good England team.”Quick GuideWiegman's England v Netherlands: previous meetingsShowThe England head coach has faced her country of birth three times since taking over the Lionesses four years ago:England 5-1 Netherlands, 24 June 2022, LeedsEngland were utterly dominant in the 5-1 win, a result that will have given them a huge confidence boost before the Euros on home soil the following month. The Dutch took an early lead at Elland Road through Lieke Martens but Lucy Bronze, Beth Mead, Lauren Hemp (2) and Ella Toone scored for England to secure a very comfortable victory. “It was a very difficult evening,” said the Netherlands coach, Mark Parsons.Netherlands 2-1 England, 26 September 2023, UtrechtWiegman was given an ovation in Utecht before the game, having been in charge of the Dutch team when they won the Euros in 2017. England were second best for most of the evening although they could count themselves unlucky as Daniëlle van de Donk was clearly offside in the buildup to the Netherlands’ first goal. Alessia Russo equalised in the second half before Renate Jansen settled the contest with a 90th-minute screamer into the top corner.England 3-2 Netherlands, 1 December 2023, London“I feel a bit strange,” Wiegman said after England had come from behind to win 3-2 after a late Toone goal. For 45 minutes at Wembley, England had looked destined to throw away their Nations League and Olympic qualifying hopes  as the visitors dominated and Lineth Beerensteyn scored twice before half-time. Georgia Stanway and  Hemp scored within a minute of each other around the hour-mark before Toone’s late intervention. The following month England beat Scotland 6-0 but lost out on a place at the 2024 Olympics for Team GB on goal difference.Nasra Abdi and Ervin AngWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England ideally need a victory to revive the defence of their European title, and the Lionesses know that – if they lose – they would be eliminated later on Wednesday night unless Wales defeat France. But their head coach, Sarina Wiegman, appeared to be embracing the pressure, saying: “Playing at this level makes it special. Playing matches like these makes it special. This is why we are doing it. These are the best matches you can possibly dream of.“We knew before the tournament it would be a tough group. You want to win but we didn’t [against France]. Now we have another game and the approach is the same. We want to win the game.”The Lionesses have not been eliminated in the group stages of any tournament since 2013 and Wiegman has reached four consecutive major tournament finals as a head coach, the first two of those coming with the Netherlands. Wiegman was also asked about the media reaction to her team’s opening defeat but said: “I don’t read the tabloids or the media. My only focus is on the team and what I have to do.

A squad rich in depth and top-level experience are gathering steam and look a nightmarish proposition for whoever is sent their way in the quarter-finals. They will top Group C by avoiding defeat against Germany on Saturday and, withthe obvious exception of Spain, have looked at least as convincing as anyone on show so far this summer.Make no mistake, they will have to pass far tougher tests than the obstacle posed by a limited Poland. The tournament debutants will play for pride in their meeting with Denmark and almost grasped a huge chunk of it here when Milena Kokosz cracked a stupendous strike against the post in added time. In truth, though, Sweden could have doubled their tally at a minimum. They were relentless, thrillingly so at times, and the only concern for Peter Gerhardsson may be that his players were not more clinical.Poland v Sweden: Euro 2025 – liveRead moreNot that he was too willing to voice it. “A great performance,” he said. “We scored some great goals and we created a lot of chances, and our defence was really good.” Their opponents were certainly unable to muster much of the counterattacking threat thathad occasionally flustered Germany.Poland had held the Germans at bay for more than half of their opener but that never looked remotely likely here. They could not handle Sweden’s movement and, in particular, the speed and balance of the Chelsea winger Johanna Rytting Kaneryd. Her performance on the right was a firm contender for the best individual display of the past week, an early run and cross that Kosovare Asllani headed against the crossbar setting the tone. Within 13 minutes Madelen Janogy’s effort met a similar fate and, as more opportunities came and went, it resembled a minor miracle that Poland remained unbreached towards the half-hour mark.View image in fullscreenStina Blackstenius heads home Sweden’s opening goal of the night.Photograph: Matthew Childs/ReutersThat had partly owed to a miss from Stina Blackstenius, who flashed off target at the near post after a dart from midfield by Filippa Angeldahl. She was more on point when Angeldahl, who was behind much of ­Sweden’s best work, located an intelligent run from Asllani. The captain’s chipped cross was thundered in on the run by Blackstenius and the torment rarely let up from there.Blackstenius could have scored two more before the interval but the contest remained faintly alive. It was put to bed in response to the briefest of Poland flurries, the combination of Rytting Kaneryd and Asllani this time yielding a decisive finish past the busy Kinga Szemik. “It doesn’t happen that often,” Asllani said of her header, but telling interventions from a player who turns 36 later this month invariably do.Stina BlacksteniusThe mini rout was completed by Lina Hurtig, who rose to nod in a corner from her fellow substitute Jonna Andersson. Just before that, Gerhardsson had given Frida Rolfö her first action of Euro 2025. Magda Eriksson is also yet to be involved and it speaks volumes for the tools at his disposal. There is plenty still in reserve, not that Sweden’s showing needed much of a pick-me-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They far outnumbered their Polish counterparts although a word should be reserved for the respectable red and white-clad contingent who were vocal throughout. This sport runs through the blood in Sweden; in Poland the journey has been longer but the progress is clear and Nina Patalon could reflect on the importance of her side’s debut at the top level.“I’m not disappointed,” she said. “If we want to beat the best we need to keep working. I know how hard we worked to be here.

Amalie Vangsgaard had given Andrée Jeglertz’s Denmark a shock first-half lead, but Germany were awarded a soft penalty, again by VAR, which was converted by Sjoeke Nüsken before Lea Schüller was able to sweep in the winner despite Emma Snerle being on the ground having taken a ball to the face from a teammate’s clearance.Germany 2-1 Denmark: Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreThe Danes are now out of the tournament, afterSweden defeated Polandin the late kick-off.“We need to make the rules clear,” Jeglertz said of Snerle’s predicament. “If we have a player that has a serious head injury you need to blow the whistle and take responsibility as a referee. I don’t understand why she doesn’t stop the game. There was a similar incident in the first half when the referee didn’t stop the game for a head injury and I question those decisions.”The Germany head coach, Christian Wück, said: “I don’t know if the decisions are right or wrong but the football system has to work out how to speed that up.”View image in fullscreenEmma Snerle lies on the turf after being clattered by a clearance, while Germany’s celebrations begin in the background.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesAround 16,000 Germany fans had been expected at St Jakob-Park, around half its capacity, but it felt like far more had packed in, the record for a group-stage game not involving the hosts broken by an attendance of 34,165.Hosted in Basel, nestled close to the borders of both France and Germany, meant that this was as close to a home game as is possible for Wück’s side, and the fans treated it as such, singing “We have a home game in Basel” as they marched towards the ground with a “Get well soon GG #7’ banner stretched between some – a tribute to the captain, Giulia Gwinn, who sustained a medial ligament injury in her side’s opening game against Poland.Denmark were unchanged from the team thatlost 1-0 against Swedenin their opening game: it was a strong performance, Pernille Harder may be their talisman but they had shown there is talent beyond the two-time European player of the year.View image in fullscreenGermany’s Klara Buhl (not pictured) scores past Denmark’s Maja Bay Østergaard, only to see her effort ruled out for offside.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersGermany looked to have broken the resolve of the well-organised and compact Denmark defence inside 20 minutes but, after a lengthy wait for a VAR check, Bühl’s effort was ruled out, Nüsken deemed to have interfered with play from an offside position as the ball flew through her legs and past the blindsided Maja Bay Østergaard.Less than 10 minutes later, Germany were behind. Janni Thomsen was dispossessed by Lea Schüller but Vangsgaard was on hand to pinch the loose ball and fire past Ann-Katrin Berger. For the first time the crowd was hushed, the rhythmic clapping and periodic chanting paused while the small pocket of red shirts went wild behind the Danish goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was soft, very soft, but the referee pointed to the spot after being told to check the pitchside monitor.

Emma Færge’s clearance walloped her teammate Snerle in the face and sending her to the ground – but, despite the head injury, the referee allowed play to continue and Jule Brand laid the ball off for Schüller to stroke in.

This was aimed at promoting greater equality of opportunities, but even people working in football are hard-pressed to find the numbers.The clubs published the results of their internal surveys on 1 June, other than Manchester United owing to a website glitch corrected a few days later, but the silence from the sport regarding the findings has been deafening. None of the FA, Premier League or EFL commented on the data or published a summary of the findings, indicating that the drive for greater transparency has its limits.‘Everything is better’: how Rubiales’s unwanted kiss transformed Spanish women’s footballRead moreIn one sense, the silence is unsurprising. Analysis of the data conducted byKick It Outpaints a depressing picture of a sport sorely lacking in diversity, with the staff at most clubs not reflecting the ethnic makeup of their local communities.In the Premier League, 78% of clubs’ workforces are white compared with an average of 66% among the local populations and although there is 13% ethnic diversity in the coaching staff, only two top-flight clubs reported having Black, Asian and minority ethnic coaches in senior roles.Staff at EFL clubs appear more representative, with 87% of their workforce white compared with an average of 80.8% locally, although clubs in the lower divisions were not required to provide detailed breakdowns of staff roles so the figures for coaches are unclear.Kick It Out’s chief executive, Samuel Okafor, welcomed the publication of the data, although there was no disguising his disappointment at the findings. “For many years we as an organisation have been calling for the game to be more transparent and bring more data into the light,” he said. “It’s really positive the FA have brought out a new rule that means all 92 clubs have to publish their workforce data.“What the data has shown us is probably not a surprise to us or to many people. When we look at Black, Asian, ethnically diverse staff, whether that’s in boardrooms, in senior leadership roles, in coaching or senior coaching, you can see there’s a huge lack of representation. When we look at women in boardrooms and senior leadership roles, in coaching, we can again see there is a huge underrepresentation. Representation of LGBTQ people and those with disabilities is very low.“Some of these data points will not be a surprise to many, but having it in the light is positive for driving change and accountability.”Okafor has been at Kick It Out for just under a year after replacing Tony Burnett, who before retiring last summer called for sanctions for clubs that failed to meet diversity targets.The FA created the new rule after mixed results from the Football Leadership Diversity Code, a voluntary reporting requirement introduced in 2020. Fifty-three clubs had signed up by last season and none had met the eight hiring targets to increase diversity among staff.FA sources indicated they were in the process of analysing the data. The governing body plans to submit a report to all stakeholders, including the Premier League, EFL and Kick It Out, before discussing the issue publicly at a Football Leadership Diversity summit in the autumn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOkafor regards mandatory publication as a step forward, but there remain concerns over a lack of transparency. Many of the Premier League clubs reported high rates of “prefer not to say” regarding ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability and did not report data for roles with fewer than 10 staff members, leading to a lack of visibility regarding coaching posts. Many clubs also use the catch-all “under 10%” rather than giving exact figures, making it hard to accurately assess representation, especially for smaller demographic groups.Okafor spent 20 years in the banking industry after a playing career that peaked with Colchester in League One, most recently as a director at the private bank Coutts, and believes football lags behind in terms of recruitment practices. EFL clubs have had access to an anonymised recruitment platform, iRecruit, for two years but it is unclear how widely it is used.“The banking sector is ahead when it comes to transparency, when it comes to target setting,” Okafor said. “There’s still a massive way to go in terms of getting the right level of representation across the game.“There’s also an opportunity to look at some of the best practices that happen in other industries and how do you bring them into football. We need diverse shortlists and interview panels, all those inclusive practices, so it’s not the select few that are getting those jobs.”Okafor is eager to make the economic case for having a diverse workforce. “We will continue to talk about the moral case for change, but there’s a real commercial benefit when you have a diverse workforce, when you have a diverse leadership team that looks like the club’s community, and when you have a diverse coaching staff … You can’t just have EDI [equality, diversity and inclusion] over on one side and financial sustainability on the other side. You really need to bring the two together.”Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FAKick It OutPremier LeagueFootball LeagueRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of power and money,lotsof money. It is also a story of sport, and that’s the way they want it now. The buildup to Wednesday’s semi-final of the Club World Cup betweenParis Saint-Germainand Real Madrid, those two empires and enemies, didn’t begin with a fitness update from Atlanta or Palm Beach; it began on Monday morning New York time with news from Paris that Kylian Mbappé had withdrawn a legal claim accusing his former club of extortion and harassment. Two days before kick-off, it was time for the football.Well, sort of. “Kylian Mbappé has decided to bring an end to the criminal proceedings initiated last spring against PSG,” a statement from the player’s camp said. “The decision reflects a desire for deescalation, at a time when a new chapter is beginning.” A desire too to concentrate on sport. Definitely nothing to do with their prospects of winning the case, then. Besides, the statement says: “It does not affect the ongoing proceedings before the French labour court which will address the contractual and financial aspects surrounding the end of his time with PSG.”Chelsea are favourites for final but they face a familiar foe in Thiago SilvaRead moreThere is still the demand for€55m in allegedly unpaid wages and bonuses, which led to PSG’s accounts being momentarily blocked. PSG claim Mbappé agreed to waive the €55m when he went and the club have made a counter-claim of €98m. The accusations and counter-accusations are multiple, the amounts eye-watering, the bitterness inescapable even as it is hidden behind a polite exterior.Revenge is a dish best served cold and a word overused in football, and Mbappé and PSG were always going to cross paths one day, but this time it actually applies. There is history, scores to settle. “I have been at PSG a long time,” Mbappé said when heleft for Madrid13 months ago. Seven years he had spent in Paris; for almost all of them, Madrid cast a shadow. In 2021 PSG fans booed him because they thought he was going to Madrid. In 2022 Madrid fans were equally angry because they found out he wasn’t. In 2023 Le Parisien said he was going again, and he called them liars. In 2024, he finally went.His future became a question of state, the pressure intense and applied from the Élysée Palace and from Doha. “It wasn’t an easy situation; I wouldn’t want anyone to go through that,” he would say. When Mbappéextended his contract at PSGfor the last time in 2022, there was an €180m renewal payment, a salary of €72m a year and annual, increasing loyalty bonuses, starting at €70m. That he was not convinced, maybe even that he had been coerced, or perhaps that he had played them, rapidly became apparent: this wasn’t a three-year deal but two plus one and he had barely signed it when he informed them that he wouldn’t be extending.PSG left himtraining with the reserves, sat him in the stand andtried to sell himwhile they could still get a fee. Madrid, though, didn’t move and he resisted the threats and played again. Once he was allowed back into the fold, had talked publicly about an agreement with Nasser al-Khelaifi that would protect both parties, no matter what happened. PSG’s president, meanwhile, said Mbappé would never go for free. But he left for free. In his goodbye statement, he did not mention Khelaifi.View image in fullscreenNasser al-Khelaifi and Kylian Mbappé in 2022 with the PSG 2025 shirt that did not tell the full story.Photograph: Michel Spingler/APPSG had lost. And then they won. The day Mbappé left, it felt like a liberation. As it turned out, PSG were liberated too. On the morning before Saturday’s Club World Cupquarter-final against Bayern Munich, Khelaifi talked about a culture shift, about how there are “23, 24 warriors” now, theunlike beforegoing without saying; about how these days the star is the team, and it is the best team he has had. If it seems a bit rich to be presumptuous about that, to take pride in it as if it was a plan, when the hierarchy did all they could to keep Mbappé in Paris, it is true.At the end of the season,an old Marca coverfrom one of PSG’s European eliminations was inevitably dug out again, showing the France forward with the headline: “If you want to win the Champions League, you know what you have to do.” So he did … andPSG won itinstead. The equationMbappé leaves = PSG winis too simple, too reductionist, yet it is hard to resist. He had left PSG, the team that just couldn’t win the competition, to go to the club that always seems to so that he would.Madrid were eliminatedin the quarter-finals and PSG had won it. Mbappé’s legal team had wanted Uefa to consider whether PSG should be allowed to participate in light of the €55m claim.Mbappé is PSG’s all-time top scorer, with 256 goals. At Madrid he got a hat-trick in the clásico in May, anotheragainst Manchester Cityin the Champions League, and scored in the Copa del Rey final. He has scored 44 goals: no debutant ever got more. How can you not call him a success? How could you blame him for the shift in fortunes? And yet thatclásico was lost, the Champions League ended the next round, and in thecup final Madrid were defeatedtoo.Quick GuideEnglish referees could oversee Club World Cup finalShowEngland could be represented in the Club World Cup final, regardless of whether Chelsea reach the showpiece event in New Jersey. The Premier League referees Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor, and their respective assistants, have both been kept on at the inaugural expanded Fifa tournament. Taylor’s team, which includes Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn, officiated PSG’s quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich, while Oliver has been working with Stuart Burt and James Mainwaring, with the trio appointed to Bayern’s last-16 win over Flamengo. Poland’s Szymon Marciniak and France’s Francois Letexier, both of whom have been awarded semi-finals, the latter taking charge of Chelsea’s meeting with Fluminense on Tuesday, are alternative options. The final is on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium.Ben FisherWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Halfway through the season he said he had hit “rock bottom”; “it was a mental thing,”he said, describing missed penalties against Liverpool and Athletic as “a good moment [that] changed my mentality. I couldn’t do worse: I could only go upwards. I had to do more. It was a moment of:bam!, change everything. I didn’t come to Madrid to play badly.” By then, though, it was late and the collective malaise was irreversible.In the meantime, the battles with PSG continued off the field, no clean break, no closure, despite the liberation. Instead, the bitterness lingered. When Mbappé’s claim was made public in April, his lawyers declared it “time to go on the attack” having tried to “resolve things peacefully”, seeking what they said he was owed. The behaviour had been “scandalous and indecent” and they wanted “to send a clear message: that’s enough.” A PSG spokesperson told Efe those claims were “a fantasy from a parallel universe”. It wastheywho were seeking damages.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As it turned out, his departure had done them good. They won the Champions League and have in Ousmane Dembélé the leading candidate to win the Ballon d’Or, which Mbappé had gone in search of too. “When a player like me comes to a team, many things change,” Mbappé had said, and not all of them were for the better. Madrid, winners of the league and Champions League without Mbappé, won nothing with him. And if it was unfair, even absurd, for him to become a symbol of Madrid’s failure and PSG’s success, at the end of the season, as a relentless PSG team tore Inter apart, some analyses suggested that was so.One particular scene fromNo Tenéis Ni Puta Idea, a superb insider documentary on Luis Enrique from Mbappé’s final season, offered an explanation of what had happened. In it, the PSG coach sits Mbappé in front of a screen at PSG’s training ground and asks him to complete the caption describing his previous performance:C’est… something. The missing word iscatastrophique. He tries to get through to Mbappé by talking about his hero, the NBA legend Michael Jordan: a player who “would grab his teammates by the balls and run to defend like a motherfucker”.That, Luis Enrique insists, is a leader. “As an attacker you’re God, I know, a phenomenon,top,” he says, “but that’s not what I care about. If you press, it’s the business. If on top of that, you get Dembélé, [Randal] Kolo Muani, Marcos Asensio to press, you know what we have? A team that’s a fucking machine. And that’s when you’re Michael Jordan.”Luis Enrique tells his striker: “I want you to leave through the front door, Kiki, but you have to earn that.” Towards the end of the series, by which time everyone else knows Mbappé is leaving and they fear the worst, when they have been denied in their pursuit of the Champions League once more, there is a moment when the coach says: “Next year we’ll be better, without doubt, because when a player goes where he wants that means there are parts of our play that I don’t control. And next year I am going to control all of them. Without exception.” And so it was, an extra dimension added to PSG’s Champions League win by his absence and, while they wouldn’t say so, their former forward winning nothing, the schadenfreude inescapable.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé said his acrobatic goal against Borussia Dortmund was a ‘good way of showing I feel good again’ after a stomach virus.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Club World Cup offers a way back for Madrid and Mbappé, perhaps, one competition left, one shot at redemption, this season at least. Yet while something has been building again under the new coach, Xabi Alonso, it has been without Mbappé so far. Afterbeing in hospitalwith a stomach virus and losing 5kg, he has not started; in his place, Gonzalo García, a 21-year-old academy striker, has been a revelation.Against Dortmund, though, Mbappé came on and scored a brilliant acrobatic volley. “A good way of showing I feel good again,” he called it; the following day he withdrew his accusation of extortion. “Over the last few weeks relations between Kylian Mbappé and the club president have significantly improved,” the statement said. His father had accompanied Khelaifi in PSG’s box at this competition. Now, Mbappé himself meets PSG, ready to start at last, a place in a world cup final at stake.“We were lucky this year without [Mbappé], but I also wish him the best,” Khelaifi said just before this competition began, as if anyone was buying that. “Even if we have a small conflict, honestly, from the bottom of my heart, I wish him the best. “Except,” the PSG president added, “when he plays us.”Explore more on these topicsKylian MbappéParis Saint-GermainReal MadridClub World Cup 2025Club World CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The forward joined from Brighton for £60m last week and was pivotal in his new team moving to within one win from being crowned club world champions.“We are very happy, very proud to play the final on Sunday,” Maresca said.“The reason why is because this is the first edition of the Club World Cup. The best clubs in the world are here. For us to be in the final is something to be proud of.“I know how difficult it is with all the games. Premier League top four, we won the Conference League and now a final here – it is fantastic.”Maresca was delighted with João Pedro’s impressive display after coming in for the suspended Liam Delap. “I am very happy for João,” the head coach said. “He has quality to decide the game like today. We know he is a good player against teams that defend deep.”There was concern for Chelsea after Moisés Caicedo limped off with a twisted ankle during the closing stages. The midfielder wanted to shake off the knock but had to admit defeat. “He felt he could try even though I told him we could play with 10 players,” Maresca said. “He tried and felt pain. So hopefully he can be fit for Sunday.”Maresca said that Dário Essugo, a possible replacement for Caicedo, will miss the rest of the tournament after sustaining an injury in training. The Italian also looked ahead to facing either PSG or Madrid, who meet on Wednesday in the second semi-final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 22‑year‑old has been in some of the best form of his life recently, winning at the French Open last month and establishing a 23-match winning run.Alongside his usual excellence with his groundstrokes and variety of shots, Alcaraz served brilliantly, losing just six points on his first serve during the match.“On grass when you’re serving great or you feel you’re serving great, then playing from the baseline or playing the return games, you just have more confidence and play calmly and think clearly,” Alcaraz said.“So I think feeling great in the serve, it gave me a lot of calm to play great tennis from the baseline.”Norrie, a former British No 1 who rose as high as eighth in the ATP rankings in 2022, has been on the comeback trail after a difficult period on the court because of poor form and injury. He fell as low as No 91 in May but he will return to the top 50 on Monday at No 43.“I really feel like I’m enjoying my tennis a lot,” the British player said. “I think that’s most important. Obviously I didn’t play at all from this period onwards last year. I can just keep pushing for my ranking.

Serving at 0-15 in the opening game of the fourth set, Fritz missed his first serve, which was correctly called out. He then landed his second serve but when he hit his next forehand, which landed around four feet in, the automated system called “fault”, thinking it was a serve.Wimbledon 2025 quarter-finals: Norrie v Alcaraz, Sabalenka battles past Siegemund – liveRead moreThe second serve had not been registered by the speed gun and the umpire, Louise Azemar-Engzell, was quickly on the phone to the control room. “Ladies and gentleman, we will be replaying the last point due to a malfunction. The system is now working,” she said, to a smattering of boos from the crowd on No 1 Court.AWimbledonspokesperson said the mistake had occurred because the ballboy was still on court when Fritz started his serve. “The player’s service motion began while the [boy] was still crossing the net and therefore the system didn’t recognise the start of the point. As such the chair umpire instructed the point be replayed.”Wimbledon replaced line judges with automated live-calling this year and the incident on Tuesday is the latest in a string of issues, which peaked on Sunday when the system failed to call a backhand by Britain’s Sonay Kartal that landed clearly long, which should have given Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova a 5-4 lead in the first set. At the time, the Russian accused the tournament of home bias but her anger abated as she went on to win the match.Tournament organisers said the technology had been turned off by mistake on that section of the court. Subsequently they “removed the ability for Hawk-Eye operators to manually deactivate the ball tracking”.Khachanov said afterwards that he preferred having human line judges. “[The question] is why this is happening,” he said. “Is it just like error of the machine or what’s the reason? Sometimes it’s scary to let machine do what they want.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To be honest, I still think it’s much better to just have the electronic line calling as opposed to the umpires because I do like not having to think about challenging calls in the middle of points.

The 23-year-old forward had been on holiday in Rio de Janeiro when they called to say his£60m transfer to Chelseahad been completed and could he come straight here.Two days and a single training session later, he made his debut in Philadelphia, more than 4,000 miles north of home, a promising glimpse of a future. Four days after that, he was given his first start in New Jersey. It took 18 minutes to get a glorious goal. By the time he headed off, an hour in, he had another.João Pedro sends Chelsea to Club World Cup final as stunners sink FluminenseRead moreHe didn’t celebrate either, but there will be another chance soon. He’ll be back here on Sunday, Chelsea delivered to the final day. He, perhaps more than any of them, knows what this means. “I can’t stop doing my job,” he had said the day before this semi-final against Fluminense; no one expected him to start doing it quite so quickly, and definitely not quite so well.Yes, he had prepared – “I was in Brazil with friends but I have a personal trainer; imagine if I didn’t train andChelseacalled me to come,” he said – butstill. This was something else, certainly compared to the Chelsea strikers who have gone before.He might not even have had the chance to play at all but for the suspension of Liam Delap – but by the time he walked his work was done, a case made to start on his own merits. As he departed, João Pedro applauded the Chelsea fans to his left. Then he applauded the Fluminense fans to his right.Please allow me to introduce myself. And:sorry about that. Both applauded back, from Rio de Janeiro to the MetLife and a whole new life, this was his moment.He had scored two, both of them brilliant strikes, and had been as good as his word. The first bent into the top corner; the second battered off the bar and into the net. No, he had not promised to score, still less like that, but hehadpromised not to celebrate if he did. And so after each, up went the hands, in apology.The team he had just defeated was his boyhood club. He had joined Fluminense at 10, travelling to live in Rio with his mother. “I went there and I didn’t have nothing. They gave me everything and they showed me to the world. I am very grateful,” he said after the match. “I am very sorry what happened to them, but I am a professional.”The last of the Brazilian sides that have given this tournament so much, that have made it feel a little like, well, like a World Cup, now he it was who halted their journey. “It’s not about trying to end that,” he had said the day before.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer (No 10) has been on billboards in Times Square during the Club World Cup.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“I know how important it is for Fluminense and I believe it’s also very important for us. I’m so grateful for everything Fluminense have done for me, but I can’t stop doing my job. May the best team win, and may it be a great spectacle.”The best team did win, although Marc Cucurella did clear one off the line and Chelsea did need a VAR interception to avoid a Fluminense penalty at 1-0. But in truth it wasn’t especially spectacular. The game wasn’t, anyway. The goals really were.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOut across the Hudson, in a place that is more parking lot than anything else, supporters had begun early occupying the vast, exposed expanses surrounding the MetLife. Heat rose from the floor, the smell of hot Tarmac mixing with tailgate barbecues the Brazilians brought. Huge great grills of meat under gazebos.Fluminense fans outnumbered Chelsea supporters but there were a lot of blue shirts, too. There was no sign of João Pedro’s 20 among them yet. Cole Palmer, who looks out over Times Square accompanied by the slogan “Scary Good”, appeared the most popular. Others brought a nostalgic touch – there were lots of Lampards out there.By the time they had gone through the gates, past the sign warning that no weapons were allowed inside, they had missed the US national anthem, belted out to empty stands an hour before kick-off at every game here. They weren’t entirely full by the time the teams came out one player at a time – João Pedro wasn’t the most cheered then, but he would be – but with tickets on sale 17 times cheaper than for Madrid against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, it got quite close: 70,566 came. There was the countdown to kick-off, 3pm on a working day. And then they played.This wasn’t always the fastest game, nor the most dramatic. It was hot down there – that was shown when it wasn’t just the players who escaped inside at half-time but the fans, too – and it never truly felt like Chelsea would not win. Nor was it a surprise. The identity of the man who carried them there was, and it was written.“We’re the ugly duckling,” the Fluminense coach, Renato Gaúcho, had said, but one of them had grown, and flown, something beautiful celebrated all round this stadium, his moment shared with everyone.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025ChelseaFluminenseClub World CupUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, after falling a break behind early in the fourth set, the No 5 seed rediscovered his focus and played a near flawless tie-break to advance to a clash with the defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz.Wimbledon’s electronic line-calling woes continue as boos greet latest malfunctionRead more“It’s an amazing feeling,” said Fritz, who hit 16 aces. “Having played the quarter-finals here twice and lost in five [sets] twice, I don’t think I could have taken another one. I’m really happy I’m going to get to play the semis here. I’m feeling great to get through it. The match was going so well for me for two sets, I’ve never really had a match just flip so quickly, so I’m really happy how I came back in the fourth set and got it done. I think momentum was not going to be on my side in the fifth.”Anothermalfunction in the electronic line-calling systemoccurred at the start of the fourth set, when a forehand from Khachanov, which landed four feet inside the baseline, was called “fault”. The umpire, Louise Azemar-Engzell, stopped the point, got on the phone to reset the system and the point was replayed. Fritz ended up being broken as Khachanov moved ahead.However, the American broke back for 2-2 and from then on the two men raised the level and began to play outstanding tennis. The Russian held serve at 5-5 from 0-30, thanks to a brilliant lunging volley. Fritz was impregnable on serve again, though, and in the tie-break he began with a 138mph ace, hit two more and finished it off with a smash into the open court.Four years ago, after he lost against Alexander Zverev here in the third round, Fritz wrote a note on his girlfriend’s phone, saying: “Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so good but 40 in the world, get your shit together.” Now, he is in the top five, reached his first grand slam finalat the US Open last yearand is one match away from a first Wimbledon final.View image in fullscreenThe chair umpire, Louise Azemar-Engzell, phones a friend after another malfunction in the electronic line-calling system.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images“At the time, my ranking was slipping,” he said. “I was coming back from a surgery and I felt like I was not playing to the level I felt like I should be playing. That note was never supposed to be public. I was ranting to my girlfriend about it, she said: ‘Write it down, look at it.’ I’m really happy with how I’ve turned my career around over the last four years or so. I’ve put in a lot of work and it’s good to see the results.”Standing between Fritz and a first Wimbledon final is Alcaraz, who ended British interest with animpressive victory against Cameron Norrie. The pair have played each other twice, both on hard courts, with Alcaraz winning both times. The Spaniard has won the title in each of the past two years here but Fritz believes that if he can find his level, he has a fighting chance.“I’m happy that we’re not playing at the French Open on clay with the French Open balls because that would be an absolute nightmare,” he said, laughing. “I think grass is very much so an equaliser. So, trust in how I’m playing. I truly know the way that I played the first two sets today, there’s not much any opponent on the other side can do.”And as an American, Fritz says he has already experienced the most pressure he is ever likely to face, when beating Frances Tiafoe to reach the US Open final last year.“It’s given me a lot of confidence in those moments and situations, just having been there, that I can do it again,” Fritz said. “I’ve played the pressure matches. I don’t think anything’s going to get more stressful than me playing Frances in New York for a spot in the final.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 60 bands and 2,000 participants are expected to begin their march through the town streets shortly after thousands of spectators would be leaving the sold-out Royal Portrush, if organisers stuck to typical tee times.The R&A has been concerned for some time about the logistical challenges associated with the simultaneous events on Saturday week. Significant congestion for people leaving the course, or thousands choosing to depart early to avoid this, have been uppermost in the thoughts of the major tournament’s organisers.It was reported last month that the Portrush Sons of Ulster, who organise the parade, voted against rearran­ging their march despite a request from the R&A. The third round of the Open would ordinarily finish at 8pm BST, with the parade due to commence at 8.15pm.The R&A would not comment specifically on its preparations. It is understood, however, that tee times will be adjusted. The R&A said: “We are working on plans to minimise disruption for our fans leaving the championship due to the event taking place in Portrush.”How much leeway the R&A has remains to be seen because of live American television coverage requirements. The time change is therefore unlikely to be big, but any alteration would be notable.R&A officials had promised pre­viously to “explore potential mitigations to ensure fans can get home smoothly following the end of play”. Standard adult tickets for round three cost more than £120. The 153rd staging of the Open, which runs from 17 to 20 July, will be the biggest ­sporting event to take place in ­Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, before the Scottish Open this week, Xander Schauffele has backed Keegan Bradley’s bid to be a playing captain for the US in the Ryder Cup in September.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Could he do the same for Brazil next summer?Tom SandersonTue 8 Jul 2025 02.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 05.02 EDTShareAnd then there was one. Nobody expected a Brazilian club to reach theClub World Cupsemi-finals, and if any team was going to make a deep run in the tournament, it was not Fluminense. After winning the Copa Libertadores in 2023, they narrowly avoided relegation last year and have gone through four managers in less than two years.Thankfully for them, they are now coached by the charismatic Renato Gaúcho, who told us earlier in the tournament: “It’s no use having a team of 500 million reais, because football is decided on the field.” Throughout the tournament he has encouraged Brazilians to take pride in what their teams have achieved, despite being written off due to the wealth of the European sides.He has also told Fluminense fans to be loud and proud as they celebrate going further in the tournament than their Rio rivals Flamengo and Botafogo, and São Paulo giants Palmeiras. “I ask the fans to wear the Fluminense shirt all over Brazil. Going to the beach, walking the dog, heading to the mall. Wherever you go, I ask Fluminense fans to wear the club’s shirt. Everyone should be very proud of what this group is doing here,” he said after their2-1 win against Al-Hilal in the quarter-finals.Renato, a Brazilian football legend who enjoyed something akin to rockstar celebrity status in the 1980s and 1990s, has not always been respected as a manager given his notorious love of the night. Globoesporte journalistCarlos Eduardo Mansurexplains that his reputation during his playing days left many people “doubting if he could be a manager with authority because he had fame as someone who liked the good life”.Despite tasting some success by takingFluminenseto the Copa Libertadores final in 2008, he looked as though he might end up being what is known in Brazil as a “manager of the market” – one who continually changes clubs and rides the country’s never-ending managerial merry-go-round “because no one thought he actually took his profession seriously and would study football”.When Brazil were dismantled 7-1 by Germany at the World Cup in 2014, the Brazilian football association set up courses for its coaches. Renato mocked the idea of studying, preferring to play foot-volley and indulging in his love of hot sand and cold beer on the beach. “Those who need to learn have to study; those who don’t can take a holiday on the beach no problem,” he quipped. His nonchalance did not do much for his reputation. “There was a desire in Brazil for better training for coaches, especially in the crisis that arose after the World Cup,” says Mansur.View image in fullscreenThiago Silva directs proceedings against Al-Hilal.Photograph: Heuler Andrey/SPP/ShutterstockThough Renato won the Copa Libertadores with Grêmio in 2017, he bounced from one job to the next without winning many trophies. Somewhere along the line, though, he seems to have changed. “Those who live alongside Renato today say he watches football compulsively, very dedicatedly – that he is super interested,” says Mansur.His dedication has even annoyed his family. He’s said to have angered his daughter by turning down a dinner invitation in Miami after Fluminense drew with Mamelodi Sundowns and booked their place in the knockout stages. Renato gave his players free time to spend with their families, but he opted to stay in and analyse possible last-16 opponents instead. “They think I don’t study, but what I understand most is tactics,” he said afterhis team’s landmark win against Inter in the last 16.Renato’s teams have always enjoyed the attacking side of the game but the surprise at this tournament is just how well they have coped defensively. “He was never one to lock many players into a system,” says Mansur. “He gave a lot of freedom to the forwards, to the most technical and skilful players. The Grêmio team that won the Libertadores had a lot in this aspect, but defensively it lacked a bit of structure. In this tournament, though, Fluminense are adapting against strong opponents and have been defensively very solid. From a tactical point of view, this is the most surprising aspect of the campaign.”Inter knocked out of Club World Cup in last 16 by Brazilian side FluminenseRead moreTwo players are key to this improvement: their 44-year-old goalkeeper Fábio and 40-year-old defender Thiago Silva, who have limited their opponents to just four goals in five games at the tournament. Silva has shown his leadership abilities throughout. The centre-back took charge during a cooling break against Inter, giving tactical instructions and adapting the team’s formation, helping them to win the game 2-0. Renato’s critics say he showed a lack of authority and ideas by allowing a player to take over, but others have praised him for demonstrating his man-management skills – as a former player himself, he understands when to let his leaders talk.Renato can be compared to Brazil boss Carlo Ancelotti for this approach. “He has a reputation of being a great locker-room leader, a players’ manager,” says Mansur. “He will go to a press conference and criticise his players, saying they lacked attention and commitment, yet there has never been any news of him losing control of the locker room. This is a very interesting trait of his career; he has a lot of leadership.”Letting Silva talk was definitely the smart move. The defender displayed impressive, seasoned knowledge of the game, which led to Fluminense’s second goal. Silva has also gone viral for an emotional, rousing team talk he delivered before the game against Inter. He tells the story of his stepfather dying while he was in France playing for PSG. He now has to live with the regret of not visiting him in hospital – and he does not want his teammates to look back at their opportunity in front of them with regrets of their own.Thiago Silva rouses his teammates with his already legendary speech.“I didn’t go to see him in hospital because I thought he was going to come out,” Thiago tells his teammates almost in tears. “Don’t hold back out there. Do it now. Do what we can do, right now. Don’t put it off, because there’s no time. Enjoy the moment. Joyfully but responsibly.”Having won trophies in Italy, France and England, Silva is among the best centre-backs of ​h​is generation. He will be 41 in September but Brazilians are coming around to the idea that he could be at heart of their defence under Ancelotti. “He’s been a huge leader for Fluminense. Ignácio and Freytes, who play alongside him in a back three, have improved their performances tremendously. Fluminense had much better defensive numbers in the Brazilian league after he returned to Brazil.“He has shown a lot of leadership, but there have been some physical issues and injuries and that would be a concern in a tournament as demanding as the World Cup, with possibly seven games in a month if the team goes all the way. But the debate is back on in Brazil. He is performing at a very high level; he is a great leader; he is technically very good; and he imposes himself in duels against high-level attackers who are much younger than him.View image in fullscreenThiago Silva rouses his teammates during his time at Chelsea.Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesRenato is leading the campaign for Silva’s return to the national team. “I never tire of seeing Thiago Silva play,” says his manager. “He is a leader and coach on the field. It is beautiful to see him play, to see him lead the team inside the four lines. It’s a pleasure to work with him. He’s helped us a lot because of his leadership and, in my humble opinion, he’s still a Brazilian national team player.”The semi-final againstChelseawill be special for Silva. He enjoyed four successful seasons at Stamford Bridge, especially considering his advanced years in such a demanding league, and he won the Champions League – a trophy that had eluded him many times at PSG. He also won the Club World Cup, beating Palmeiras in the final in 2021, although winning the expanded tournament with Fluminense – the club where he started his youth career at the age of 14 – would be an achievement on a different level. “One more! There are two left. It’s not over,” he told Renato as they hugged on the pitch after seeing off Al-Hilal.Once more – as was the case against Dortmund, Inter and perhaps even Al-Hilal, Manchester City’s conquerors – Fluminense go into their next game as underdogs. “If you look at it on paper, Chelsea have invested more money and have more individual stars. But Fluminense have things that can take them through,” says Mansur. “They have a great goalkeeper in great form; they’ve found a way to defend and make the team solid when under pressure; and they have Jhon Arias up front who is one of the candidates for best player of the tournament. Sometimes, in knockout tournaments, that’s enough, so there’s no doubt that Fluminense can continue, but I don’t think they’re the favourites.”This is an article byTom SandersonExplore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Guardian Sport NetworkClub World CupFluminenseChelseaUS sportsBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is not clear how many took up the offer.The ask came the day before Prime Day kicks off. The manager said volunteers are “needed” to work Tuesday through Friday this week, in two-hour shifts between 10am and 6pm in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, where the company operates a warehouse as part of its grocery delivery service,AmazonFresh. Corporate employees seconded to the warehouse would be tasked with picking items, preparing carts and bags of groceries for delivery, packing boxes on receiving carts, and working to “boost morale with distribution of snacks”, though they would be allowed to step into a conference room to take meetings and calls, according to the message. The manager noted such an effort would help “connect” warehouse and corporate teams.Amazon routinely hiresthousands of extra warehouse workersin advance of its annual Prime Day sale, which sees the massive online retailer discount thousands of goods, creating a surge in orders and demand for delivery. Amazon Fresh, available to Prime subscribers but separate from Amazon subsidiary Whole Foods, is also offering discounts this week during Prime Day, such as a free 90-day trial of the delivery services and $30 off of deliveries for current members, while maintaining its same-day or next-day delivery service. New York is one of Amazon’s busiest areas in the US.An Amazon spokesperson, Griffin Buch, said this is not the first time “grocery corporate” employees have been “invited to volunteer” with fulfillment.“This support is entirely optional, and it allows corporate employees to get closer to customers while enabling our store teams to focus on the work that’s most impactful,” Buch said.Amazon Fresh has faced turbulence in recent years. Amid cost-cutting efforts in 2023 and a struggle to turn a profit on grocery delivery, CEO Andy Jassy closed several physical Amazon Fresh locations andlaid offhundreds of employees in the segment. Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees overall since cost-cutting efforts began in 2022.A week ago, Jassyspokeon CNBC of a future at Amazon where drones and even robots were used to fulfill and deliver goods to people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They cited the firm’s “track record of creating discriminatory policing software in the US” and its “close links to a US government which shows little regard for international law”.But Mosley dismissed the attack when he gave evidence to MPs from the Commons science and technology committee on Tuesday. Palantir has also won contracts to handle mass data controlled by the Ministry of Defence, police and local authorities.Tech firm Palantir spoke with MoJ about calculating prisoners’ ‘reoffending risks’Read moreThiel, a libertarian, named the company after the “seeing stones” in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has previously said the British public’s affection for the NHS is a case of “Stockholm syndrome”, but Mosley said he was not speaking for Palantir.Palantir also provides artificial intelligence-enabled military targeting systems, as well as software to integrate and analyse data scattered across different systems, such as in the health service.“I think the accusation that we lack transparency or this is secretive is wrong,” Mosley said. “I think that BMA has, if I may be frank, chosen ideology over patient interest. I think our software is going to make patient lives better by making their treatment quicker, more effective, and ultimately the healthcare system more efficient.”In 2023 the government awarded Palantir the contract to build a new NHS “federated data platform”, but concerns have been raised by some local NHS trusts that the system was no better than the existing technology and could even reduce functionality, the website Democracy for Salereported.Palantir was also one of the many technology companies the Guardian revealed last week had recentlymet the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to discuss ideas to help solve the crisis in prisons and probation, from inserting tracking devices under offenders’ skin to assigning robots to contain prisoners.During the hearing Mosley was challenged by the chair, Chi Onwurah MP, over whether it was the right company to be involved in the NHS when it was also working for theIsraelDefense Forces in Gaza, through its military applications.Mosley declined to give operational details about what Palantir does for the Israeli authorities. Its products include a system called Gotham, which “supports soldiers with an AI-powered kill chain, seamlessly and responsibly integrating target identification”.Onwurah said cultural change was needed in the NHS in order to drive uptake of the new data systems. She asked Mosley: “Do you really think that Palantir is the organisation to bring together 42 integrated care boards, over 200 NHS Trusts to champion NHS values, to bring them together around one federated data [platform] and, in the future, a single patient record?”“I think the question of trust should really be about our competence above all,” Mosley said. “Are we delivering [what] we have promised to deliver? Are we making the patient experience quicker, more effective, more efficient? And if we are, then we should be trusted with that.”The BMA said its opposition to Palantir’s involvement in the NHS was a matter of good governance, not ideology.“If Palantir’s software is being used to target individuals in immigration enforcement and is being deployed in active conflict zones, then that’s completely incompatible with the values we uphold in the delivery of care,” said Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair of the BMA’s general practitioners committee.He warned patients would be alarmed and could choose to withhold information from their doctor if they did not trust the organisation processing their data or there were fears about what the data might be used for.The Liberal Democrat MP Martin Wrigley said the interoperability between the data systems Palantir provides for health and defence was “profoundly worrying”. The Conservative MP Kit Malthouse wanted to know if a military could target particular individuals with particular characteristics by using Palantir’s ability to process a large pool of data. Mosley said: “We provide an enormous amount of control and governance to the organisations that use our software for that purpose to manage precisely the kind of risks that you’re talking about.”Malthouse said: “That sounds like a yes”.It also emerged during the hearing that Palantir continues to employ Global Counsel, a lobbying firm co-founded by Britain’s ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson. Mosley denied that a visit to Palantir’s Washington DC office by the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, was arranged by Mandelson, saying “it was done through the proper channels”. Mandelson stepped down from Global Counsel in “early 2025”, theconsultancy’s websitesays.Explore more on these topicsPalantirHealthcare industryData protectionNHSHealthPeter MandelsonHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

This week in tech news,Elon MuskandDonald Trumpare back at it, warring over the passage of the president’s sweeping tax bill and the Tesla CEO’s threat to create a third political party. Whether the richest person in the world is successful in those efforts will largely depend on the recruitment of another star politician. In other news, we want to know if you use generativeartificial intelligenceto write your personal messages – in what circumstances, and how often? Emailtech.editorial@theguardian.comto let us know.Elon Musk needs another Donald TrumpElon Musk andDonald Trumphave reignited their feud after the passage of the president’s sweeping tax bill on 3 July. Musk has been campaigning (tweeting) against the “abomination” of legislation for weeks, which passed in spite of him. Division over the bill was the cause of their initial breakup in early June.Musk has threatened to start a new centrist political party, and over the weekend, he made signs that he would follow through on his ultimatums to create “The America Party”. Trump responded with a lengthy post on Truth Social calling Musk a “TRAIN WRECK” that had gone “off the rails” and saying that third parties had never succeeded in the US, so Musk’s idea was “ridiculous”. Tesla’sshare price fell sharplyin response to the news.What would Musk’s America party do besides troll Democrats andRepublicans? Likely try to primary Republicans who voted for the bill.From my colleague Ramon Antonio Vargas:The new party thatElon Muskhas boasted about bankrolling could initially focus on a handful of attainable House and Senate seats while striving to be the decisive vote on major issues amid the thin margins inCongress. Musk tweeted that one way to achieve his political goals would be to “laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts”.Would Musk himself become a candidate? Unlikely. He has promised to return his focus to his many companies, though his most recent tweets indicate otherwise. What Musk needs to make his part a reality is another Donald Trump, a superstar aligned with him whom he can douse with money.His function in politics is that of an ATMThe Wisconsin supreme court election in early April demonstrated that Musk himself is not personally popular. After appearing on stage and handing out million-dollar checks, he watched his preferred candidate lose handily. His function in politics is that of an ATM. He is, after all, the richest person in the world, even though Tesla’s market capitalization has taken a beating since he appeared in Washington.Since Musk himself is an ineffective electioneer, the success of his new political party will depend on an undeniable star like Trump, another titanic force. He needs a conduit who can channel his donations into a charming and effective campaign.So far, there doesn’t seem to be one. Trump’s grip on the Republican party is tight, and he runs an operation that enacts swift and pitiless retribution on anyone who expresses enough disloyalty, including Musk. The risk of defecting from Trump’s party and joining Musk’s quixotic centrist quest is high. The only people who do want to see a new party form are the chaos-hungry voters on X, who told Musk by a considerable margin in a poll last week he ran that he should do it. Few of them, if any, are running for office, though. I suspect they just want the most fractious outcome, which may become our collective fate.A moment of odd and coincidental timing:Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, picked this weekend to say that he feels “politically homeless”. Musk has given the same assessment of his own political position. These two Silicon Valley heavyweights hate each other, an acrimony evident in Musk’s lengthy legal fight to stop OpenAI’s planned conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit enterprise. Despite their enmity, though, they voiced this same idea at the same time.Musk and Altman have cultivated starkly different public personae. Where Musk is loud online, Altman is reserved. Where Musk is brash, Altman is calculated. Where Musk has swerved to the political right, Altman has attempted to play both sides of the aisle. But Altman’s sentiments, concurrent and concurring with Musk’s, perhaps offer an explanation for how these two could have worked together to found OpenAI together in 2015. After all, if their stock portfolios are any indication they both believe in “the compounding magic of capitalism”, as Altman put it.Do you use AI to write your texts?View image in fullscreenIllustration: Raven Jiang/The GuardianLast week, we published a story about people who use generative artificial intelligence to write their personal messages.

People “devalue” writing that is AI-assisted, he acknowledges.In one 2023 study, 208 adults received a “thoughtful” note from a friend; those who were told the note was written with AI felt less satisfied and “more uncertain about where they stand” with the friend, according to the authors.Using AI in personal messages is a double gamble: first, that the recipient won’t notice, and second, that they won’t mind. Still, there are arguments for why taking the risk is worthwhile, and why ahint of AI in aHinge messagemight not be so bad.Read the whole storyhere.We now have the capability to punch up any message – a more descriptive word here, a more heartfelt tone there – with a snap of a finger. Can AI help us better convey what we mean, eliminating the frustrating barrier of writing that stands between feeling and expression? Or will it desiccate our relationships if we do not force ourselves through the emotions of writing our messages ourselves? Will AI help us connect or allow us to feign connection without putting in the work?Both the benefits and drawbacks are evident, and some scenarios seem more appropriate than others. Perhaps you would not have sent a birthday card at all if you had not had a personalized message at the ready. One writer forthe Atlanticwas astounded when Google’s Gemini, which has access to her personal conversations, wrote a sweet and specific birthday card that referenced real moments in her relationship with a good friend. Perhaps you would have ghosted someone without a mechanized speechwriter.

The FBI declined to comment on this story.“Our research predicted exactly what we’re observing: terrorists deploying AI to accelerate existing activities rather than revolutionise their operational capabilities,” said Adam Hadley, the founder and executive director ofTech Against Terrorism, an online counterterrorism watchdog, which is supported by theUnited Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate(CTED).“Future risks include terrorists leveraging AI for rapid application and website development, though fundamentally, generative AI amplifies threats posed by existing technologies rather than creating entirely new threat categories.”So far, groups such as IS and other adjacent entities, have begun using AI, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify recruitment propaganda across multimedia in new and expansive ways. Not unlike the imminent threat it poses to upendingmodern workforcesin dozens of job sectors and is poised to enrich some of the wealthiest people on earth – AI will complicate new public safety issues.“You take something like aIslamic Statenews bulletin, you can now turn that into an audio piece,” said Moustafa Ayad, the executive director for Africa, the Middle East and Asia at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “Which we’ve seen supporters do and support groups, too, as well as photo arrays that they produce centrally.”Ayad continued, echoing Hadley: “A lot of what AI is doing is enabling what’s already there. It’s also supporting their capacity in terms of propaganda and dissemination – it’s a key part of that.”IS isn’t hiding its fascination with AI and has now openly recognized the opportunity to capitalize on what it currently offers, even providing a “Guide to AI Tools and Risks” to its supporters over an encrypted channel. In one of its latest propaganda magazines, IS outlined the future of AI and how the group needs to embrace it as part of its operations.“For every individual, regardless of their field or expertise, grasping the nuances of Al has become indispensable,” it wrote in an article. “[AI] isn’t just a technology, it’s becoming a force that shapes war.” In the same magazine, an IS author explains that AI services can be “digital advisors” and “research assistants” for any member.Over an always active chat room that IS uses to communicate with its followers and recruits, users have begun discussing the many ways AI can be a resource, but some were wary. One user asked if it was safe to use ChatGPT for “how to do explosives” but weren’t sure if agencies were keeping tabs on it – which has become one of the broaderprivacy concernssurrounding the chatbot since its inception.“Are there any other options?” asked an online IS supporter in the same chat room. “Safe one.”But another user found a less obvious way around setting off any alarms if they were being watched: by dropping the schematics and the instructions on how to create a “simple blueprint for Remote Vehicle prototype according to chatgpt”. Truck ramming has become a choice method for IS in recent attacks involvingfollowersand operatives, alike. In March, an IS-linked account also released an AI-created bomb making video with an avatar, for a recipe that can be created with household items.Far-right groups have also been curious about AI, with oneadvising followerson how to create disinformation memes, while others have looked to AI for thecreation of Adolf Hitlergraphics and propaganda.Ayad said some of these AI-driven tools have also been a “boon” to terror groups and their operational security – techniques to securely communicate without prying eyes – such as encrypted voice modulators that can mask audio, which altogether, “can assist with them further cloaking and enhancing their opsec” and day-to-day tradecraft.Terror groups have always been at the forefront of maximizing and embracing digital spaces for their growth, AI is just the latest example. InJune 2014, IS, still coming into the global public consciousness, live-tweeted imagery and messages of their mass executions of over 1,000 men as they stormed Mosul, which causedsoldiers in the Iraqi armyto flee in fear. After the eventual establishment of the so-called Caliphate and its increasing cyber operations, what followed was a concerted and coordinated effort across government and Silicon Valley to crackdown on all IS accounts online. Since, western intelligence agencies have singled out crypto, encrypted texting apps, sites where 3D printed guns can be found, among others, as spaces to police and surveil.But recent cuts to counterterrorism operations across world governments,including some by Doge in the US, have degraded efforts.“The more pressing vulnerability lies in deteriorating counter-terrorism infrastructure,” said Hadley. “Standards have significantly declined with platforms and governments less focused on this domain.”Hadley explained how this deterioration is coinciding with “AI-enabled content sophistication” urging companies like Meta and OpenAI, to “reinforce existing mechanisms including hash sharing and traditional detection capabilities” and work to develop more “content moderation” surrounding AI.“Our vulnerability isn’t new AI capabilities but our diminished resilience against existing terrorist activities online,” he added.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateThe far rightCryptocurrenciesArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTChatbotsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, Nintendo has seen fit to improve a heap of existing Nintendo Switch games on the shiny new system, both in the form of graphics-boosting free updates and more substantial paid reworks. The different options can be confusing, however, so here’s an explanation of how it all works.So what’s the difference when you play Switch games on Switch 2?Depending on how they were coded, some original Switch games simply run better on Switch 2 without any additional meddling from developers. Games with an uncapped frame rate – developers sometimes restrict this to help regulate performance – especially reap the benefits, especially if they chugged along on the original Switch. 2023’s brilliantBayonetta 3, for example, runs at 60fps on Switch 2, making it even more essential (though a resolution bump would be welcome, too). The Switch game thatconsumed more than 700 hours of my time, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, now loads into matches significantly faster.Animal Crossing: New Horizonsand Skyrim also see significantly reduced loading times, and the infamously sluggish Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity now runs at a locked, reliable frame rate.The ugly-as-sin Witcher 3 on Switch also benefits hugely, thanks to dynamic resolution scaling and uncapped frame rate, transforming this once blurry mess into something sharper, smoother and infinitely more playable. Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Arkham Knight and Wolfenstein 2 also see similarly improved resolution and performance.Which games have gotfree Switch 2 upgrades so far?Switch 2 owners now have the benefit of high dynamic range (HDR) support, as well as more TV-friendly resolutions (up to 4K). A wealth of beloved Nintendo-made Switch games have received free updates for Switch 2, helping them take advantage of the new hardware.First up, we have the smaller updates to less notable titles. In a bid to making multiplayer easier, there have been free updates to both Nintendo’s boardgame collectionClubhouseGamesandBig Brain Academy,adding the handy Gameshare feature – allowing you to play multiplayer with other people who don’t already own the game – as well as niche titles likeGameBuilder GarageandTamagotchi Plazagetting Joy-Con mouse support. Read on below for the more substantial free updates awaiting you on Switch 2.Pokémon Scarlet/VioletView image in fullscreenPaldea feels more lived-in on Switch 2 … Pokémon Scarlet.Photograph: NintendoOne of the most infamously poorly performing games on Switch was 2022’sPokémon Scarlet/Violet. While its free-form open world approach to questing impressed, terrible frame rate, ugly textures and an eye-strainingly inconsistent resolution tarnished the core experience. Thankfully, developer Game Freak has attempted to make things right on Switch 2. These games have seen a night and day improvement to frame rate, transforming barely moving windmills in the distance and slideshow-esque movement of hordes of Pokémon into the smooth motion you’d expect. The resolutions are noticeably higher too, with characters and Pokémon looking sharper, especially when you’re playing in handheld mode. Roaming the region’s vast locales on Switch 2, there are also more Pokémon scuttling around, making Paldea feel more lived-in. While there is sadly no HDR implantation and the original shonky texture work remains, the graphical and performance improvements are more than enough to make these Paldean adventures feel complete on Switch 2.Super Mario OdysseyNintendo has wisely opted to future-proof thebest 3D Mario yet made, doubling the game’s resolution to 1800p docked along with fully implemented HDR. Odyssey has always boasted impeccable art direction, and now Mario’s planet-hopping capers shine that bit brighter, the red dunes of the Sand Kingdom glistening in the distance and the roaring T rex’s fangs looking sharper than ever. The frame rate is now consistently higher, too, meaning that each jump and spin feels even snappier. Gameshare support has also been added, allowing a second player to hop in to join you as Cappy on a second Switch.The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Echoes of WisdomView image in fullscreenPolished performance … The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of WisdomPhotograph: NintendoWhile both of the cutesy Switch Zeldas always had their charms, one of them certainly wasn’t their performance. Stuttering and stalling worse than a 1970s car, the patchy frame rate often let down what was otherwise a charming experience. Good news for Switch 2 owners, then – Nintendo has polished both up dramatically. Now rendered in crisp 4K TV-friendly resolution, sporting full HDR support and yes – running at a solid 60fps – both of these Grezzo-developed Zeldas leap off the screen with new life. If, like me, you put down Echoes of Wisdom last year due to performance issues, now’s the time to experience both it and Link’s Awakening at their very best.NewSuper MarioBros UWhile last year’s Super Mario Wonder has undoubtedly stolen its thunder, Nintendo has opted to give the Wii U’s 2D Mario an extra bit of spit and polish on Switch 2 regardless. With improved resolutions, frame rates and – you guessed it – HDR implementation, this love-it-or-hate Mario sidescroller has never looked better.ARMSView image in fullscreenMore precise movement … ARMSPhotograph: NintendoRemember ARMS? The springy-limbed motion controlled fighting game that launched just after the original Switch? Much to everyone outside Nintendo’s surprise, it’s been shown some love eight years after release. Criminally underrated at the time, the motion-controlled melee now has more precise movement, enabling your blows to pummel their intended target with more subtle movements. Four-player local multiplayer now runs perfectly, a setup that would cause the original Switch to slow to a fun-ruining crawl. While its divisive controls mean it still won’t be for everyone, ARMS always featured wonderfully charming character designs, and now its endearingly cartoony world feels new again.Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s FuryAnother Wii U classic gets an upgrade: this multiplayer Mario magic has now sprinted and leapt its way on to a third Nintendo console. On Switch 2, 3D World benefits from an improved frame rate and the expected resolution bump, and Bowser’s Fury gets the same 4K-TV-worthy upgrades along with full HDR support.Captain Toad: Treasure TrackerAlso making its way on to its third Nintendo console in 11 years, this charming, slow-paced puzzle adventure now sparkles thanks to HDR implementation and a resolution bump in both docked and handheld modes. For those who want to bring a pal along for the ride, Treasure Tracker now also has GameShare support.Splatoon 3View image in fullscreenDesigner splatting … Splatoon 3Photograph: NintendoThe Shibuya-chic squidlings of Splatoon were originally born on Wii U, but Nintendo’s futuristic paintball shooter has evolved a lot since then. It has always been bright and colourful, but its streetwear cool was marred by the vaseline-esque blur of lower resolutions. No more: now rendered in full 4K on Switch 2,Splatoon 3’s ink-splatted dystopia shines with delightful detail. Whether you’re taking down bosses in the surprisingly excellent single-player campaign or splatting strangers in online Turf War matches, Splatoon’s slick character designs boast a new found richness. Splatoon 3 on Switch 2 feels like a whole new game – if you missed it the first time around, there’s never been a fresher way to play.What about the paid Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades?Unlike the free updates detailed above, Switch 2 Editions are old games that have been scrubbed up and resold, often packed with additional content. Nintendo charges anywhere from £7.99 to £16.99 to upgrade a Switch game to a Switch 2 edition, and players who don’t own the original game can also simply buy the Switch 2 Edition outright for £60-£70. Subscribers to Nintendo’s online service get some of these upgrades for free.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the KingdomView image in fullscreenFinally has the horsepower to shine … The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.Photograph: NintendoWhen it comes to all-time launch games, it’s hard to beat Breath of the Wild. Sensibly then, Nintendo hasn’t tried, simply opting to spruce up the best Zelda and its sequel instead. Some of the best open-world games ever made, these lovingly restored titles finally have the horsepower behind them to let their enchanting art style shine. Hyrule’s painterly plains pop with a new found richness. Areas where the Switch struggled like, Kokoro forest, no longer feel like sprinting through treacle, and high res textures along with 4K and HDR support highlight new details in areas that I’ve already explored for hours. Tears of the Kingdom especially benefits. HDR illuminates the murky darkness of the depths. Sky islands shine with a pleasing sunkissed warmth. There is also a new Zelda Notes app, which functions as part GPS, part ticklist, allowing you to track down whatever secrets you’ve yet to find in either game. Both editions are free with aNintendo SwitchOnline subscription, or you can upgrade from Switch 1 for £7.99 each.No Man’s SkyThe creation of Hello Games, No Man’s Sky launched to much controversy nine years ago, and has since gone on to become the interstellar exploration sim of gamer’s dreams. When it was ported to the original Switch in 2022, it was functional but not much to get excited about. On Switch 2 however, No Man’s Sky has had a radical overhaul, looking and playing like a brand-new game. Running at 1440p docked and 1080p in handheld, HDR helps the otherworldly colour palettes of each strange new planet and its inhabitants to ooze vividly. It runs flawlessly, too, immersing you fully in its melancholic sci-fi. The best part? Hello Games has opted to offer this Switch 2 Edition upgrade to Switch 1 players, gratis.FortniteView image in fullscreenA much-needed glow-up … Fortnite on Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: Epic GamesThe globe-conquering battle royale always felt a bit hampered on Nintendo’s ageing console, and now, developer Epic Games has given it a much-needed glow-up. Running at a silky smooth 60fps and rendered in far higher resolutions, Fortnite on Switch 2 also supports higher quality textures and vastly improved draw distances alongside the resolution bump – helping you to see distant objects and aim at other players more precisely. There is, of course, now GameChat support too, along with mouse controls for those looking to infuriate everyone else playing with analogue sticks on Switch.Super Mario Party Jamboree TV – coming 24JulyOne of the more substantial Switch 2 Edition upgrades comes in the form of Super Mario Party Jamboree TV. As well as your expected resolution bumps, this package adds a plethora of new ways to party. First up is the PlayStation EyeToy-esque Bowser Live mode, which has players flailing about to complete mini games via the Switch 2’s camera peripheral. Then there’s the titular Jamboree TV, which shows players’ faces on to the gamescreen alongside all-new microphone and camera-based experiences, alongside the brand new mouse-controlled Carnival Coaster mode. This upgrade will set owners of 2024’s Super Mario Party Jamboree back an additional £16.99.Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World – coming 28AugustTaking a leaf out of the book of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, this Switch 2 edition of Kirby and the Forgotten Land features an all-new story-led expansion. This all-new adventure sees our squishy hero attempting to save his friends from a newly crystallised world, as you leap, swallow and battle your way across new levels. Both Star-Crossed World and the original will also offer increased resolution and improved frame rates, with this Switch 2 Edition upgrade also costing £16.99.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo Switch 2Nintendo SwitchGame playNintendoAction gamesAdventure gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Words matterTue 8 Jul 2025 14.13 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareVisiting Washington, Benjamin Netanyahu delighted in telling Donald Trump that he hadnominated himfor the Nobel peace prize. The Israeli prime minister cited Mr Trump’s efforts to end conflicts in the Middle East. But in truth he is grateful to the US president for joining his war against Iran last month and for allowing carnage in Gaza to continue after a brief pause. He is also eager that the US president does not strong‑arm him into another ceasefire. Perhaps the indirect talksbetween Hamas and Israelin Qatar will reach a temporary deal again, with hostages released and possibly more aid allowed in. Even so, few expect that a lasting peace would result.Words matter. They have become so detached from reality when it comes to Israel’s war in Gaza that it is not merely absurd, or despicable, but obscene. The defence minister, Israel Katz, has laid out plans for a “humanitarian city”: this meansforcing all Palestinians in Gaza into a campthat the military would bar them from leaving. Prof Amos Goldberg, a historian of the Holocaust, used the accurate words: it would be “a concentration camp or a transit camp for Palestinians before they expel them”. The “emigration plan” which Mr Katz says “will happen”,according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, is in fact an ethnic cleansing plan. No departure can be considered voluntary when the alternative is starvation or indefinite imprisonment in inhuman conditions.Some think the proposal is a political gambit. Perhaps. Israel has yet to find countries prepared to take Palestinians. Yet it is laid out not even by extremist coalition partners whom Mr Netanyahu wants to keep on board, but by a man whose position gives him the authority to carry it out – even if the military has qualms.Ideas previously seen as unfeasible and unconscionable have already become reality. The “humanitarian distribution” system run by the privateGaza Humanitarian Foundationsummons starving Palestinians into a death trap; hundreds have been killed. Soldiers near the hubs have told journalists thatthey were ordered to shootat unarmed Palestinians who pose no threat – a war crime. (The Israeli government called the allegations “blood libels”.) The IDF says it attempts to minimise civilian casualties. But most of the tens of thousands who have died are women and children. Israel has killed hundreds of medical workers: another war crime.Words matter. When South Africa took its genocide case to the international criminal court, many resisted that description. Far fewer do so now. The legal bar is extraordinarily high. But signatories to thegenocideconvention are required to prevent it, and the US has declared genocides four times in the last decade. Destroying Palestinians’ means of survival, planning the removal of Gaza’s population and envisioning its outright destruction are surely not merely brutal acts but ones committed with “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” – the definition of genocide in the UN convention.Israel’s rhetoric aims to obscure the horror, and allowthose who are complicit, including the UK, to distance themselves. Leaders must face the facts. EU ministers will next week consider the internal review of the bloc’s trade agreement with Israel. They shouldfollow throughwith action. If he wants a Nobel, Mr Trump should insist on a peace that truly means peace, instead of being dazzled by the mirage of a riviera built in Gaza’s ruins.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So why is she the only one in prison?Arwa MahdawiThis weekend, the Trump administration officially closed the file on the notorious billionaire Epstein. Maga aren’t the only ones who should be outragedTue 8 Jul 2025 12.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareGreat news, everyone! We can all stop thinking about Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged with the sex trafficking of minors in 2019 andfound dead in his Manhattan jail cellshortly after, apparently of suicide. Great minds have looked into the case and discovered there is nothing more to uncover. So don’t waste your time wondering which powerful people might have been part of Epstein’s alleged trafficking operation. There’s nothing to see here – nothing at all. Case officially closed.That, in essence, was the message from the Trump administration over the weekend. On Sunday,Axios reportedon a memo from Trump’s justice department and the FBI that concluded there is no evidence that Epstein was involved in blackmailing people, kept a “client list” or was murdered. Most importantly, the memo said there is no “evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties”.This is a big deal because Trump and his lackeys have spent a lot of time and energy dangling Epstein-related conspiracy bait in front of their base, constantly insinuating that they’re on the verge of revealing the shocking truth about Epstein’s network of elite predators. When asked about an Epstein client list (the one that the new memo says is nonexistent) during a February appearance on Fox News, the US attorney general Pam Bondi said: “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.” Shortly after that interview therewas a big to-dowhere Epstein-obsessed Maga influencers were invited to the White House and given binders titled the Epstein Files, full of information that Bondi promised “will make you sick”. Shock horror, there was nothing new or notable in those binders and Maga had a meltdown.Now, a second Epstein-induced meltdown is in full swing. Elon Musk, who is back to publicly fighting with Trump, and has threatened tostart a new political party, has beenfiring off jabsabout the justice department’s Epstein U-turn. On Monday, Musk, who previously accused Trump of being in the Epstein Files,retweeted a postby a woman called Sarah Fields that said: “If the entire government is protecting paedophiles, it has officially become the government against the people.” Bit late figuring out the Trump administration doesn’t work for “the people” – but hey, welcome to the resistance, Elon!The conservative activist Robby Starbuck is also fuming. “Pam Bondi said the Epstein client list was on her desk to review for release to the public just a few months ago,” Starbuck tweeted. “Now the DOJ she leads claims that there’s no Epstein client list. Sorry but this is unacceptable …We deserve answers.”It’s always fun when theMaga crowdrealise what the people they propelled into power are really like. But why are rightwing voices the loudest on this topic? Starbuck is right that the current situation is unacceptable:everyoneshould be demanding more answers about Epstein. Everyone should be outraged that there is only one person, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has actually faced justice in what was, by all accounts, a vast trafficking operation. Some people have paid in other ways – in 2023 Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75m (£60m) to settle a lawsuitbrought by a group of womenwho accused it of helping facilitate Epstein’s operations – but Maxwell is the only person to have got prison time.There are, it should be said, a lot of ridiculous Epstein-related conspiracy theories circulating. Those obviously should not be indulged. But I’ll tell you what is not a conspiracy: the fact that there are a lot of high-status people who are very interested in covering up their association with the disgraced financier. It is not a conspiracy to say the US has a two-tier justice system where rich and powerful people can do terrible things and face no consequences.Earlier this year, Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent Epstein victims,died of suicide. She was thethird Epstein accuserwho is reported to have died of suicide or a drug overdose. Epstein destroyed countless lives. And he didn’t do it alone: he was enabled by “respectable” people who actively facilitated his crimes. And, more broadly, he was enabled by people who looked the other way, who helped whitewash his reputation, who hobnobbed with him in high society. Those people are still out there, living their best lives. And it is looking increasingly likely they will never be held accountable.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is actually an efficient tax, well designed to ensure that the technology companies – the profits of which benefit the tech oligarchs who have come to dominate US policy – pay their fair share of taxes.It is accordingly disappointing that Canada appears to have caved, even more so as the prime minister had stood up strongly against Trump’s demand for Canada to become the 51st state. Regrettably, others are giving in – New Zealand and India havereportedly retreated.Trump’s bullying tactics have been in evidence since he took office. In January he threatenedto doubletaxes on Australian citizens and companies in the US if they went ahead with their planned digital levy.Why digital taxes?Because digital companies operate all over the globe, and generate revenue in countries where they do not have a physical presence, they avoid taxation by shifting revenue and profit around the world. Some of the most egregious examples includeGoogle moving $17bn to Bermuda,Apple owing France10 years of back taxes, and the Italian government’s recentinvestigation of Metaover whether the firm owes €938m in VAT payments. Apple was so successful in avoiding taxes in Europe that it is estimated that it paid in some years a tax of just0.005%on its European profits. Of course, when the most profitable companies in the world don’t pay their fair share of taxes, it just shifts the burden on to others.As more and more activity occurs online, and often from services provided from abroad, countries are losing revenue from sales, employment and profits taxes. Just because an activity is provided digitally doesn’t mean it should not be taxed; indeed, economists argue that digital taxes are among the easiest to administer, precisely because there is a digital record. The idea of the digital service tax is to help countries recoup revenue by taxing any kind of digital service provided from anywhere in the world: online sales, digital advertising, data usage, e-commerce or streaming services. They might include consumption taxes on internet purchases. Indeed, more than18 countrieshave such taxes and some 20 others haveproposedthem.Imposing digital services taxes will incur the wrath of the US government and tech giants, but countries are well within their rights to do soWhen it looked like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) would get a global agreement to raise corporate taxes, the agreement included a prohibition on digital taxes. Indeed, one of the reasons that the US was even willing to engage in these discussions on global taxation was to circumscribeothers’ability to impose such taxes. While that agreement was under discussion, the US government, influenced by its tech giants, strongly opposed these digital taxes and then US treasury secretary Janet Yellen spent a good deal of time calling up her counterparts andtelling them not to imposethem.But on 20 January, Trumpissuedan executive order saying that the agreement that had been negotiated over years and years “had no force or effect” in the US. As a result, more countries are now trying to decide whether to keep or adopt digital services taxes. Imposing them will incur the wrath of the US government and tech giants, but countries are well within their rights to do so. Indeed, there was a moratorium on levying digital taxes while there were some prospects of the OECD agreement going into effect; but with Trump, that prospect has all but disappeared, and that moratorium has come to end.Any country concerned with designing efficient, fair and easy-to-administer digital services duties should consider such taxes – indeed, they have the support not only of economists but of global civil society, including the Independent Commission on Reform of International Corporate Taxation (which I co-chair).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A country may be foolish, levying taxes that are not good for its economy, but so be it: that is a matter for the country to decide. In this case, the tax is actually good for the economy. What Trump has been doing has violated international norms in several ways: using the threat of tariffs or taxes against corporations headquartered in a country whose policy he dislikes, and walking away from what were supposed to be binding trade agreements, without even a pretense of using the mechanisms for dispute resolution embodied in those agreements.The question now: will countries cave in to these threats or can they stick together and collect the billions they are rightly owed? Make no mistake: what is at stake is more than money that will be collected. It is a matter of the rule of law, which Trump has trampled on so fiercely, both within the US and globally. The rule of law is essential not just for economic performance, but for social justice and democracy. And Canada’s capitulation to Trump’s unilateral move makes a mockery of the whole process by which international agreements are negotiated. Some were skeptical that the so-called “inclusive framework” was but a facade: others may have been at the table, but their voices were not heard. What has now happened verifies this: whatever the US wants, it gets.Canada should have stood up for its principles and national sovereignty, even in the face of such transparent bullying. The alternative now emerging is the law of the jungle, brute power and Canada becoming, de facto, the 51st US state.Joseph E Stiglitz is a Nobel laureate in economics, university professor at Columbia University and chief economist of the Roosevelt InstituteAnya Schiffrin, senior lecturer at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, and her student Philip L Crane contributed to this pieceExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionCanadaDonald TrumpTax havensTax avoidanceUS politicsAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old Black nurse and mother, was declared brain dead in February after blood clots formed in her brain.Legally, and by all meaningful measures, she was dead then: the woman who loved her family, laughed with her friends, comforted her son, helped her colleagues and cared for her patients was gone then, and was never coming back. But the state of Georgia, and the administrators of the hospital where she was declared dead, kept her corpse in a state of artificial animation for months. That’s because when Smith went to the hospital in February complaining of a headache, and later became unresponsive, she was about eight weeks pregnant. According to her family, doctors at Emory hospital, in Georgia, told the family that the state’s abortion ban required them to maintain the regimen that falsely animated their daughter’s corpse so that the fetus inside her could continue to grow.TheGeorgiastate attorney general denies that the state’s abortion ban required this abuse of Smiths’s body. But other supporters of the law disagree. The result, either way, was the same: in deference to a law that created genuine ambiguity about what freedoms Smith’s doctors and family had in the wake of her death, a woman who did nothing other than be pregnant was denied the right to rest in peace.Women of West Virginia: inform on yourself to the miscarriage police! | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBrain death is distinct from a vegetative state or a coma; it is the complete and permanent loss of the function of the entire brain, including the loss of the function of the brain stem, which is needed for basic organ functions like the reflexive intake of breath and the beating of the heart. There is no chance of recovery; usually, the invasive life support required to sustain the body of a brain dead patient is administered only long enough for the patient’s family to say goodbye. That’s because what life support does to a patient’s body, in addition to being medically futile, is also extreme and invasive. The artificial ventilator that acts as a bellows, pushing air in and out of the dead lungs, involves tubes inserted through the nose and throat, extending into the stomach and windpipe.These tubes, in Smith’s case, were tools of the state, extending the force of the law into the inside of her corpse. It was the state, via these machines, that pumped her heart, contracted her lungs, and pushed blood into the dead tissues of her body, so that cells could continue dividing inside her uterus. It was the state that used these machines to desecrate Smith’s corpse – to turn it from the vessel for a beautiful person, the nurse and mother, into an object that symbolized women’s degradation and Smith’s disposability. What should have been a respected artifact of a loved person became a macabre marionette, pushed and pulled by a state apparatus that sees all women’s bodies as mere means to its own ends.Last month, the fetus was cut out of her corpse prematurely; presumably, doctors did not think that the dead body could sustain a pregnancy any longer. Physicians working on Smith’s case told her family that as a result of gestating inside a dead uterus, the resulting child could experience health complications ranging from blindness to the inability to walk. The infant that was extracted from the dead woman, a baby boy, weighs less than 2lbs, and is currently in neonatal intensive care. The family has named him Chance.The desecration of Smith’s corpse by Emory University hospital and the state of Georgia is a grim reminder of how little women’s personhood is esteemed in post-Dobbs America. But Adriana is not the first woman to have her dead body abused this way. In 2013, a 33-year-old Texas woman, Marlise Muñoz, was declared brain dead after suffering a pulmonary embolism. Because she was 14 weeks pregnant,the hospital arguedthat the state of Texas required her to be kept on life support, solely so that her corpse could be used to continue the cultivation of the fetus. Her husband, Erick,sued to have her removedfrom life support so that he could bury his wife and grieve in peace; still, the hospital artificially animated her corpse until a judge ordered them to stop. Marlise’s family would tell reporters that as they visited her body in the hospital, theycould smellher flesh decaying.There is something particularly unsettling about seeing a corpse: the absence of the person who was once there is so conspicuous that it makes the body uncanny. That the body is not the person becomes clear the moment you see a body without a human person in it. And yet the body is the instrument and vessel of the person who animates it, and as such it commands to be treated with dignity, with a kind of reverence, with the respect you would give to a human being.Abortionbans disregard this: they appropriate the body for the ends of the state, indifferent to the will or the dignity of the person who lives in it. Rape functions this way, too – using a body for an end, without deferring to the person who inhabits it. In both cases – rape and abortion bans – the body of a living person is reduced to an instrument for someone else’s use. That contrast – between the dignity that a human being’s body demands and the instrumentalization with which it is treated – is what supplies abortion bans and sexual violence with their moral horror. They treat living people as mere objects. In that sense, a corpse might be the perfect vehicle for the anti-abortion movement’s agenda: it is a female instrument without the annoying encumbrance of a female person.But Adriana Smith was a person; so was Marlise Muñoz. They were not objects, or instruments; they were people endowed with dignity and rights. In life and in death, they deserved better.

We don’t knowRebecca SolnitWe all need to be careful about how we get information and reach conclusions – especially nowTue 8 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 12.22 EDTShareWhy exactly so many people drowned in the terrible Independence Day floods that swept through Texas’s Hill Country will probably have multiple explanations that take a while to obtain. But it’s 2025, and people want answers immediately, and lots of people seized on stories blaming the National Weather Service (NWS).There were two opposing reasons to blame this vital government service. For local and state authorities, blaming a branch of the federal government was a way of avoiding culpability themselves. And for a whole lot of people who deplore the Trump/Doge cuts to federal services, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service, the idea that the NWS failed served to underscore how destructive those cuts are.Many of them found confirmation in a New York Timesstorythat ran with the sub-headline: “Some experts say staff shortages might have complicated forecasters’ ability to coordinate responses with local emergency management officials.”Might haveis not did.Complicatedis not failed. It’s a speculative piece easily mistaken for a report, and its opening sentence is: “Crucial positions at the local offices of the National Weather Service were unfilled as severe rainfall inundated parts of Central Texas on Friday morning, prompting some experts to question whether staffing shortages made it harder for the forecasting agency to coordinate with local emergency managers as floodwaters rose.”‘Flying blind’: Florida weatherman tells viewers Trump cuts will harm forecastsRead moreA casual reader could come away thinking that staffing shortages had had consequences. But if you give the airily innuendo-packed sentence more attention, you might want to ask who exactly the anonymous experts were and whether there’s an answer to their questions. Did it actually make it harder, and did they actually manage to do this thing even though it was harder, or not? Did they coordinate with local emergency managers?The piece continues: “The staffing shortages suggested a separate problem, those former officials said,” and “suggested” sounds like we’re getting an interpretation of what these anonymous sources think might have happened or been likely to happen, rather than what actually did. Suggestions are not facts. Likelihoods are not actualities. Eventually we get to a named source: “A spokeswoman for the National Weather Service, Erica Grow Cei, did not answer questions from The New York Times about the Texas vacancies, including how long those positions had been open and whether those vacancies had contributed to the damage caused by the flooding.”In other words, there’s no answer to the suggestions and questions and intimations. Nevertheless, a lot of readers gathered the impression that this was not speculation aired by unnamed experts but confirmation that the NWS had failed. One prominent public figure with three quarters of a million BlueSky followers shared the New York Times piece with this note: “The United States government is no longer able to protect us from real hazards, such as flash floods, because it’s shifting funds to fake hazards, such as a non-existent immigrant crime wave.”If you read down a couple of dozen paragraphs in this New York Times piece, you get to the former NWS director of Congressional Affairs saying “that the local Weather Service offices appeared to have sent out the correct warnings. He said the challenge was getting people to receive those warnings, and then take action.” Nevertheless, the idea the NWS failed became so widespread that Wired magazine published areportspecifically to counter it: “Some local and state officials have said that insufficient forecasts from the National Weather Service caught the region off guard. That claim has been amplified bypunditsacross social media, who say that cuts to the NWS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, its parent organization, inevitably led to the failure in Texas.”They link to the pundit with almost a million followers, who had posted on Twitter: “Now TX officials are blaming a faulty forecast by NWS for the deadly impact of a storm.” Those officials are, but why would we believe them? Wired continues: “But meteorologists who spoke to Wired say that the NWS accurately predicted the risk of flooding in Texas and could not have foreseen the extreme severity of the storm.” With that, we’re onto another piece of the picture: the difference between accurately predicting a risk and knowing exactly how severe it will be.Climate change, which some reports mentioned and others did not, is both a contributing factor for specific weather disasters and a reason why the future will not necessarily look like the past. For both fires and floods, the old rules about how fast they’ll move and how big they’ll get have expired. Hotter air holds more moisture, and that can and does lead to more torrential downpours and worse flooding. On the other hand, as local newspaper the Kerrville Daily Timesreported, Kerr county has a history of extremely heavy rainfall leading to rapid river rise and devastating floods.Rapid snowmelt and Trump cuts compound wildfire fears in US westRead moreThe Washington Post had a better assessment of what went right and what went wrong: “But even as weather forecasts began to hint at the potential for heavy rain on Thursday, the response exposed a disconnect: few, including local authorities, prepared for anything but their normal Fourth of July. When the precipitation intensified in the early morning hours Friday, many people failed to receive or respond to flood warnings at riverside campsites and cabins that were known to be in the floodplain.” The county, in this report, did not send its first cell-phone alert until Sunday, while “most cellphone alerts were coming from the National Weather Service’s Austin/San Antonio station. But some alerts about life-threatening flooding didn’t come until the predawn hours, and to areas where cellular reception may have been spotty.”It seems like the National Weather Service did its duty despite the cuts, but more are coming.Fossil Free Memo reports: “Just days before the flood, Texas Senator Ted Cruz helped pass the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, a sweeping fossil fuel giveaway that alsoslashed $200 millionfrom Noaa’s weather forecasting and public alert programs. The money was meant to improve early warnings for exactly the kind of fast-moving, deadly flooding that just hit his own state. The cuts weren’t in the House version. Cruz added them in the Senate, behind closed doors, as chair of the committee that oversees Noaa.” The impact of cuts to vital services is going to degrade everyday life and add to the dangers we face, and as far as politicians like Ted Cruz are concerned, that’s the plan. It will be important to connect cause and effect, when there is a connection.The desire to have an explanation, and the desire for that explanation to be tidy and aligned with one’s politics, easily becomes a willingness to accept what fits. But knowing we don’t know, knowing the answers are not yet in, or there are multiple causes, being careful even with the sources that tell us what we want to hear: all this equipment to survive the information onslaughts of this moment. We all need to be careful about how we get information and reach conclusions – both the practical information about climate catastrophes and weather disasters and the journalism that reports on it. Both the weather and the news require vigilance.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionClimate crisisUS politicsDonald TrumpTexas floods 2025Extreme weathercommentShareReuse this content"

We could do with more like that nowTue 8 Jul 2025 11.13 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 11.20 EDTShareThe word “icon” is perhaps thrown around rather liberally in the lexicon of memorial. But in the realm of Tory politics, Norman Tebbit,whose death was announced today, was an icon – the politician who perhaps came closest, save of course for the Iron Lady herself, to embodying the phenomenon of Thatcherism.Why? He was not cast in the grouse-moor mould of the Harold Macmillan era, to be sure; but nor was Edward Heath, and little affection won he by that. (Nor, indeed, wasMargaret Thatcher.)There was, perhaps, a degree of exoticism about his working-class background in the front rank of Tory politics in what was a much more class-conscious era.But Tebbit was no exotic pet, and nor would he have made such an impression on the public consciousness had he been so. Rather, he managed to personally embody a deeper, seismic shift in British politics: the Conservative party’s decisive, and enormously successful, play for a large slice of the working-class vote.It is the nature of revolutionary myth-making to sometimes overstate a transformation. Working-class Toryism long predates Thatcherism, be that its Protestant and Unionist manifestations in Ulster, Scotland, and Liverpool or the more widespread tendency, noted by George Dangerfield in his 1935 classic The Strange Death of Liberal England, for working men to support the party that had no time for teetotalism.But while the nation’s pubs might once have been a “chain of political fortresses” for the party of Lord Salisbury, one can only imagine what he would have made of a working-class man serving as chairman of the Conservative and Unionist party. But then, ironically, a facility for evolution has always (until recently) been the party’s strongest suit.Yet personally embodying a change is not enough to make an icon. Alone it produces at best a totem, or perhaps that should be a token; a passive object to be hoisted aloft to signal the party’s adaptation to changing times.No, what made Tebbit an icon was that he believed in that change and he fought for it. He was a fighter, at a point when the party needed fighters, a true believer in what was in its early years a deeply uncertain revolution, and a bulwark for his leader against the forces of genteel reaction that would certainly, had the opportunity presented itself, have ditched her and her experiment alike.It would be an ugly politics that comprised solely each side’s furious partisans. But it would be a very hollow politics that made space only for conciliators. There is an easy route to a faction’s heart for a politician willing and able to be their tribune of the plebs, but that doesn’t mean the job can’t be well and honourably done, and Tebbit did it honourably and well.The latter is best illustrated by his star turns on the conference platform. Obviously, there was his (in)famous comment aboutgetting on one’s bike and looking for work. But more significant, in light of subsequent events, must be his call-and-response routine at the 1992 conference.“Do you want to be part of a European union?”, he asked the hall; the “NO!” all but took the roof off. All this infuriated John Major, of course; one wonders if either seriously thought they would both live to see Britain leave it.Tebbit paid a heavier price than most for his frontline political career; theBrighton bombingsaw him trapped under the rubble for an hour and, much more seriously, paralysed his wife, Margaret, for whom he subsequently cared. But like the true believer he was, he remained involved in the party and what became the Eurosceptic cause. He also managed a decade in the spotlight without acquiring airs and graces, and in the digital age proved more than willing to wade into the comments beneath his Telegraph blog and have it out with all and sundry.Courage, energy, authenticity – these Tebbit had in spades, and they are the things of which political icons are made.One might quibble that my definition makes little reference to the actual content of Tebbit’s beliefs. But that is deliberate. He certainly held many views with which readers of this newspaper would profoundly disagree, then and now, and his views on social issues were wildly out of step with modern society.But an icon is not a hero, except perhaps in the Greek sense; recognising one does not require agreeing with all or even any of what they stand for. Every movement will have its own icons, and one of democracy’s great strengths – or indeed, basic requirements – is recognising that there is space in public life for more than one.In fact, as a Conservative, it does with hindsight seem to have been a stronger, more vital Conservative party whose chairman was a substantial figure who could, occasionally, embarrass the leader.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hair and scalp oiling is most commonly what they attribute to growing their hair so long – as much as five inches in two months – often accompanied by other haircare routine tips such as using a bamboo bristle brush, scalp massaging and hair growth supplements.But what do the experts say?Hair growth: the factsAs far as hair length goes, it is mostly predetermined by your genetics, says Rebecca Anderson, a trichologist and salon owner.Do LED masks help with hair loss?Read moreThere arefour phases of the hair growth cycle: the anagen (growth) phase, catagen (transition) phase where growth slows down, telogen (resting) phase and finally exogen (shedding phase) when the hair falls out and is replaced by the new hair growing from the same follicle, which starts the process over again.A person’s anagen (growth) phase can last from anywhere between two and six years. “Some people are just blessed and they have a longer growth cycle, and some people’s is very unfortunate,” Anderson says.Dr Annika Smith, a dermatologist at the Skin hospital in Sydney, agrees thickness, length and growth rate are largely genetically determined. “While good hair care can support hair health and reduce damage, no topical product or supplement can override genetic limits or alter the duration of the hair growth cycle.”Apart from genetics, the other things that influence hair growth are age, ethnicity, hormonal changes and balanced nutrition, says Adjunct Associate Professor Michelle Moscova from the faculty of medicine at the University of New South Wales.Can hair and scalp oiling and massaging help?Evidence that hair and scalp oiling help hair grow faster is very limited, Moscova says. Regular scalp massage can improve circulation to the scalp and hair follicles, which in theory can improve hair growth, but there is little data to back up this claim, she says.Most perceived benefits of oiling are likely due to reduced breakage or improved shine, rather than true stimulation of hair follicles, Smith says.Associate Professor Yousuf Mohammed, an expert in pharmaceutics at the University of Queensland, says although he is sceptical of these videos, the advice around oiling is “very commonsense and intuitive”. He adds that many ancient cultures, for example Indian and Egyptian, promoted hair oil as a way to boost hair quality.Oils can create a protective barrier around the hair shaft, which helps retain the moisture and prevent damage, while also nourishing the scalp and the hair follicles with essential fatty acids and minerals dissolved in oils, Mohammed says. In this way, not so much has changed from those older practices, as he has come across two hair care products used in ancient Egypt: saffron powder in snake oil and fenugreek in lion fat. “If I break it down simply, what I see is that there’s one ingredient which is a blood flow booster … and then there is a fatty base that helps in its absorption.”What about topical treatments and prescription drugs?Young and healthy people are typically not the subjects of research related to hair, which mostly focuses on those who experience hair loss, Moscova says. “Several drugs have been shown to be effective to treat this in men and women who are experiencing balding. For example, minoxidil is a topical treatment that improves blood flow to the follicle, and Finasteride is a prescription-based drug.”Drugs such as minoxidil only work for specific conditions of hair loss, and won’t be suitable for everyone, Anderson warns.‘If it can happen to Jada, it can happen to us’: meet the people living with alopeciaRead moreWhen should you seek expert help for hair loss?Dr Frances Tefany, a dermatologist at the Skin hospital in Sydney, says the commonest cause of hair loss seen in clinical practice is generalised shedding (known as “telogen effluvium”), which is usually reversible if it’s under six months. Common causes in women in particular are iron deficiency, thyroid issues, as well as certain medications, Tefany says.“What should alert them is if they start to lose hair suddenly, and then it escalates, and they notice, when they pull back their hair into a ponytail, it’s half the size of what it was, or when they’re brushing the hair is easily falling out.”A smaller percentage of people will have a more chronic condition, such as autoimmune conditions that cause hair loss such as alopecia areata, for which there are new treatments available, Tefany says.Hair oils are helpful for hydration in patients with a coexistent inflammatory skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis of the scalp, but people who suffer from dandruff shouldn’t use oils as often there is coexistence of yeast in the scalp which can cause irritations and also potentially hair loss, she says.What should healthy people do for hair health?Tefany says it’s important not to overuse hair products. “It’s a little bit like skincare. These days we find a lot of people are using so much additional products on their skin, even when they don’t have an issue.”In general, if people want to have good hair health they should have regular trims, avoid chemical weathering which can occur due to hair dyeing and heat styling, avoid habits such as smoking and over-drinking, and eat a balanced diet. “All the things that we know that are good for other parts of us will certainly show up in the hair, just like it does on the skin,” Tefany says.Antiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Immediately, her family were branded thieves and liars. She moved school, where she became the target of bullying for her father’s “theft”. The verbal abuse was followed by physical. Racked by stress, meanwhile, Millie’s mother developed epilepsy, and Millie began sleeping with her to be on hand when she suffered seizures. The child became depressed and self-loathing, feeling like “a burden” to her family. She won a place at university but developed anorexia and could not continue.In her absolute gut-punch of a statement to Sir Wyn Williams’ Post Office Horizon IT inquiry, whosefirst report volume dropped on Tuesday morning, Millie wrote: “I fought. I tried. I am better for it … That nagging voice in my head still says ugly things sometimes. It still tells me that my past and my family’s struggle will define me, that it will be a branding on my skin forever … I’m 26 and am very conscious that I may never be able to fully commit to natural trust. But my family is still fighting. I’m still fighting, as are many hundreds still involved in the Post Office trial.”How does every one of these stories feel like the saddest thing you’ve ever heard? How did Millie’s father, an entirely innocent man, end up hounded into homelessness and a £310,000 “debt” to thePost Office? How in the ever-living Fujitsu does Lee Castleton still not have justice nearly two decades on?That story is just one case highlighted in the first volume of the report, with Williams calling the human impact of the Post Office scandal “profoundly disturbing”. Other takeouts? The most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history just got wider. We used to think that 900 innocent subpostmasters were convicted after the Post Office pursued them for branch shortfalls – shortfalls that were not in fact down to theft, but to a computer system the Post Office and its developer, Fujitsu,knew was faulty. Today we learned there were in fact approximately1,000 convictions. At least 10,000 victims were eligible for compensation, and that number is rising.At least 10,000 people affected by Post Office IT scandal as bosses ‘maintained fiction’ Horizon data was accurate, report says – liveRead moreAnd there have been even more tragic numerical upticks. It was previously thought that six victims of the Horizon scandal had taken their own lives; today we learned it was at least 13. A further 59 victims contemplated suicide at various points in their ordeal, and 10 of those actively attempted to take their own lives. At least one was admitted to a mental health facility on more than one occasion. Many self-harmed. Many say they began to abuse alcohol.Some numbers haven’t changed, though – the tally of people charged for ruining this many thousands of lives still stands at precisely zero.That blame side of matters will be addressed in the next phase of Williams’ report, and a significant police investigation is already under way. But the inquiry chair wanted to use this first volume to urgently catalyse the “full, fair and prompt” redress the government keeps saying is due to victims. In fact, he’s very keen the government should spell out what full and fair redress means. Ideally by, like, yesterday – but in the absence of that, ASAFP. That’s not Sir Wyn’s abbreviation, I should stress. But it’s very much the vibe of this compelling report, given the number of victims still to be compensated by any one of the four redress schemes. Of these, three are run by the government, and one by the Post Office. The Post Office! That feels totally normal – like appointing the wolf as loss adjuster for the three little pigs’ house insurance claims.Yet even at this first stage, Williams was clear that these thousands of individual horror stories were not the result of some kind of antagonist-free natural disaster. They happened becausethere were perpetrators. Someone blew thousands of houses down. His report states that all of these people and their wider families are to be regarded as victims of “wholly unacceptable behaviour perpetrated by a number of individuals employed by and/or associated with the Post Office and Fujitsu”.Indeed, a notable feature of today’s report is how many of the victims had begged for help when their Horizon terminals started showing weird shortfalls. One postmistress had made 256 calls to the helpdesk about Horizon problems. She would later be incarcerated and denied contact with her daughter on the latter’s 18th birthday. Her daughter died the following year. I have to say that even selecting which glimpses of suffering to include in this column feels disrespectful to all the others – the fact is that every single one is a tragedy whose ripples can only be guessed at. Small wonder Williams recommended that close family members affected by this are also compensated.And so to another of those families. The facts of Harjinder Butoy’s story are modern, but its emotional dynamics feel like something straight out of a Thomas Hardy novel. Here was a man in the prime of his life, with a thriving small business established with a loan from his brother. Then, a twist of fate … and the descent is dizzyingly rapid. The total loss of reputation, a court case, imprisonment. His shame – the shame of an innocent man – reported in newspapers from the Daily Telegraph to the Punjab Times. Harjinder’s whole family were sucked into the vortex of his misfortune – his wife was left homeless and penniless with their three young children; his brother’s loan could never be repaid; his parents gave everything to try to ameliorate his situation, though everything wasn’t enough. Mr Butoy spent longer in prison than any other victim of the Post Office scandal, and 14 years passed between his suspension and his conviction being quashed. His bankruptcy dogged him for a decade or more, his mental health has been destroyed, and he has never been able to find work.It feels impossible not to think of Harjinder’s fall in counterpoint to the seemingly unstoppable rise of senior executives at Fujitsu, and most particularly at the Post Office, where the boss class securedbonuses,directorships, and – who knows? – maybe even a few places in hell.Harjinderbroke a long silenceon the eve of this report’s publication. “I just want everyone to know the impact, what’s happened to us all,” he said. “But I also need someone to be punished and let them go to prison and feel like what we’ve been through.” Quite so. But do “someones” like that go to prison – or is it only people like Harjinder Butoy who do? That is the key question which remains, and no country where the little people pay for the sins of the bigwigs should ever consider itself properly civilised. Compensation should be full and fair – but so should justice.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPost Office Horizon scandalOpinionPost OfficecommentShareReuse this content"

A middle-aged couple, brutally down on their luck after bankruptcy and a terminal diagnosis, escape their troubles on an epic walk round the South West Coast Path, finding comfort along the way in the kindness of strangers. Billed as an “honest and life-affirming” story of prevailing against the odds, The Salt Path became first a bestseller and then a blockbuster film, starring a windswept Gillian Anderson. Though it was never really my thing, I knew plenty of people for whom The Salt Path genuinely resonated, with its romantic central theme of being (as the film’s director, Marianne Elliott, put it) “reformed by the elements” of a blustery English seascape.If it seemed a bit unlikely that a dying man could be rejuvenated by a strenuous trek involving wild camping in all weathers – well, getting readers to suspend their disbelief is what good storytellers do, and The Salt Path’sRaynor Winnwas definitely good. Arguably, as I said, too good.For according toa jaw-dropping accountin the Observer, she and her husband Moth are also known as Sally and Tim Walker, a couple who lost their family home in allegedly verydifferent circumstances. In the book, they’re left homeless when a good-faith investment in a friend’s business goes bad. In the version pieced together by the newspaper, she was accused of embezzling money from the small business for which she worked as a bookkeeper: to make good the missing cash, the couple allegedly took a loan from a relative secured against their house, only to lose the property when the loan was called in. (Though even then, according to the Observer, they still owned a tumbledown wreck in France.)Medical experts interviewed by the paper further cast doubt on the idea of Moth/Tim reportedly living for 12 years with corticobasal syndrome, a rare and disabling brain condition normally fatal within six to eight years. Of all the allegations against the couple, perhaps the most serious is that of potentially giving false hope to other sufferers that they too could be miraculously revived by lacing up their walking boots. But since memoir depends above all on authenticity, on the promise of something raw and real, even the smallest suspicion that events may have been rather more artfully curated feels like betrayal.In a statement, Raynor Winn called the Observer article “highly misleading”, adding: “We are taking legal advice and won’t be making any further comment at this time. The Salt Path lays bare the physical and spiritual journey Moth and I shared, an experience that transformed us completely and altered the course of our lives. This is the true story of our journey.”Whatever the facts here, hers isn’t the first memoir to be accused of embellishment and is unlikely to be the last, given boundless public appetite for genuinely extraordinary “emotional journeys” – the true stock of which is by definition limited. While the publishing industry evidently has questions to answer about due diligence, the more intriguing puzzle is why readers are still so keen to believe in them.Author of bestselling memoir The Salt Path accused of lyingRead moreThe idea of physically travelling, only to find yourself at the end of the path, is as old as human storytelling. But the 21st-century twist on it is that unlike the Odysseys and Iliads of the past, the narrators of these epic wanderings are now usually female, setting out less to slay Minotaurs than to wrestle with emotional traumas. If the Observer is right, perhaps this one should have been read all along as a modern myth: one where everyone accepts that the Minotaurs aren’t strictly real, but some readers nonetheless desperately need to see them comfortingly slain.The Salt Path’s reassuring hook wasn’t just the idea of overcoming seemingly impossible adversity, but ofhowthe Winns/Walkers did it – thanks supposedly to the healing powers of nature, the kindness of people who took pity on them and ultimately a book-buying community who helped them spin disaster into box-office gold.Perhaps it rang particularly true in the aftermath of a pandemic, when many people found solace in both long lonely walks and in the idea that even when terribly isolated they could still be part of something bigger. But for whatever reason, the story met an all-consuming need for hope. Don’t be surprised if the market for journeys of self-discovery endures, no matter what is found at the end of this one.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the Franco-British relationship remains a love-hate affairPaul TaylorThe French leader will never agree to special EU concessions for the UK despite its strategic importance to EuropeTue 8 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 11.46 EDTShareBritain andFranceare so close that there’s a saying in Wimereux, a seafront resort on the north French coast, that if you can see England it’s going to rain, and if you can’t, it’s because it’s already raining.Despite – or perhaps because of – that geographical proximity, Europe’s two nuclear powers have historically been adversaries as often as friends, and frequently a bit of both. While France lacks a feral press to sustain public contempt for the tribal enemy with the unique talent of the British tabloids, that enduring love-hate relationship is the indelible backdrop tothis week’s state visitto the UK by President Emmanuel Macron. Even if solidarity and fortitude in the face of Russian aggression and American unreliability is the flavour of the week, the relationship remains an enduring mix of friendship, rivalry, mutual admiration and suspicion.Tellingly, this is the first state visit by a European leader in the nine years since the British people, in their infinite wisdom, voted to leave the European Union. Keir Starmer’scautious effortto repair some of the economic and political damage from that act of self-harm has faced French obstruction on any matter related to closer economic ties, including the totemic issue of fishing rights. As long as Starmer sticks to his red lines of no return to the EU’s single market or customs union, and no free movement of people between the continent and Britain, he will face dogged resistance from Paris against any attempt to soften the consequences of Brexit.Both leaders have domestic problems. Macron is a lame duck who cannot seek re-election in 2027 and does not have a parliamentary majority. Heregained the powerto dissolve the National Assembly this week, but to do so again after last year’s fiasco would be a recidivistic suicide. Starmer has only been in office a year and enjoys a giant majority. But hefailed last week to force throughwelfare reforms after a revolt in his Labour party, leaving him with a budget hole and an authority crisis. Both men are constrained by the rise of far-right populist parties that are exploiting public discontent over immigration and identity issues.All the warmth of a royal welcome at Windsor Castle, a horse-drawn carriage parade and a stroll through the restored nature reserve in Windsor Great Park will not move the French president to ease his opposition to any EU special treatment for the UK, despite its strategic importance toEuropein this new age of geopolitical turbulence.In French minds, this is about defending the club that the UK quit, preserving the EU and its prized single market from unravelling and – though Macron would not say this publicly – ensuring that the UK’s gamble on prospering outside the union is not successful. It is important to be able to point to British economic losses “pour encourager les autres”, as Voltaire might have said.There will be lots of togetherness on defence at Thursday’s political summit, and plenty of talk in Macron’s ceremonial address to parliament of the two countries standing together to uphold a rules-based international order (are you listening, Donald?), to support Ukraine (are you listening, Vladimir and Donald?) and to strengthen Europe’s defences within Nato (ditto). The UK and France have Europe’s most robust armies and strategic cultures, yet both are so hemmed in by debt and welfare costs that they will struggle to meet theNato pledgethey agreed last month to spend 5% of GDP on defence by 2035, of which 3.5% will be devoted to core military outlays.Starmer and Macron will jointly chair a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” created to give security guarantees to Ukraine, held symbolically at Nato’s maritime headquarters in Northwood, outside London. It sends a message of European determination to stand by Ukraine at a time when the US is winding down military support as Russia steps up its war of aggression.US disengagement from European security will be a crucial, if largely unspoken sub-theme to the Franco-British rapprochement on strategic affairs. It’s worth paying particularly close attention to what both leaders say about the scope of their nuclear deterrence and the degree to which they consider their vital interests to extend beyond national borders to the rest of Europe.View image in fullscreenJacques and Bernadette Chirac with John and Norma Major at Chequers in 1995.Photograph: Tim Rooke/REX/ShutterstockNuclear doctrine moves by millimetres. Given increasing uncertainty over the reliability of the US nuclear guarantee for Europe in the Trump era, it will be interesting to see whether Starmer and Macron go beyond what a previous generation of British and French leaders declared in 1995, when the thenprime minister John Major said: “The president [Jacques Chirac] and I have concluded that the vital interests of one could not be threatened without the vital interests of the other equally being at risk.”Successive French leaders, while maintaining a degree of strategic ambiguity, havecautiously extendedthat nuclear doctrine to make clear that France’s vital interests reach beyond its borders and “have a European dimension”. In the light of Trump’s equivocation, Macron recentlyproposed a strategic dialoguewith willing European partners on this issue.Ideally, Starmer and Macron would develop the Major-Chirac formula to include an explicit mention of the vital interests of European allies. More likely, they might jointly offer consultations with European partners on nuclear deterrence. That would be another step towards a European defence identity within Nato.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronOpinionFranceEuropeDefence policycommentShareReuse this content"

Far too many have failedGustavo PetroWithout decisive action, we risk stripping the global legal order of its remaining protections for less-privileged nationsGustavo Petro is the president of ColombiaTue 8 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 08.18 EDTShareOver the past 600 days, the world has watched Benjamin Netanyahu lead a campaign of devastation inGaza, the escalation of regional conflict, and a reckless abandonment of international law at large.Governments such as mine cannot afford to remain passive. In September 2024, when we voted for the United Nations general assembly resolution on Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, we assumed concrete obligations – investigations, prosecutions, sanctions, asset freezes, and cessation of imports and arms. That resolution set a deadline of 12 months for Israel to “bring to an end without delay its unlawful presence”. One hundred and twenty-four statesvoted in favour, including Colombia. The clock is now ticking.In the meantime, however, far too many states have allowed strategic calculations to override our duty. While we may face threats of retribution when we stand up for international law – as South Africa discovered when theUnited States retaliatedagainst its case at the international court of justice – the consequences of abdicating our responsibilities will be dire. If we fail to act now, we not only betray the Palestinian people, we become complicit in the atrocities committed by Netanyahu’s government.Some governments have already stepped up. My government suspended coal exports toIsrael, for example, recognising that economic ties cannot be divorced from moral responsibilities. South Africa, meanwhile, has taken Israel to the world’s highest court. And Malaysia has banned all Israeli-flagged cargo ships from docking at its ports. Without such decisive action, we risk turning the multilateral system into a talking shop, stripping the legal order of its remaining protections for small, developing and less privileged nations – from west Asia to right here in Latin America.Gaza is ‘hungriest place on Earth’ with all its people at risk of famine, says UNRead moreThe next test for the international community is right around the corner. On 15 July, my government, alongside South Africa – the co-chairs of The Hague Group – will convene an emergency conference on Gaza, calling on ministers from states across the world to deliberate a multilateral defence of international law. Our goal is simple: to introduce concrete legal, diplomatic and economic measures that can halt Israel’s destruction – and uphold the foundational principle that no state is above the law.The invitation is open and urgent. The indefinite postponement of the UN’s proposed International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Palestinian Question, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, has left a critical void in multilateral leadership, precisely when it is needed most.The UN has declared Gaza the “hungriest place on Earth”, and its mission to send aid into Gaza as the “one of the most obstructed … in recent history”. In this dire humanitarian context, Bogotá’s emergency conference convenes states to move from condemnation to collective action. By cutting our ties of complicity – across our states’ courts, ports and factories – we can challenge Donald Trump and Netanyahu’s vision of a world where “might is right”.The choice before us is stark and unforgiving. We can either stand firm in defence of the legal principles that seek to prevent war and conflict, or watch helplessly as the international system collapses under the weight of unchecked power politics. Let us be protagonists together – not supplicants apart.For the billions of people in the global south who rely on international law for protection, the stakes could not be higher. The Palestinian people deserve justice. The moment demands courage. History will judge us harshly if we fail to answer its call.Gustavo Petro is the president of ColombiaExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsrael-Gaza warColombiaUnited NationsAmericasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

It will change Britain’s futurePolly ToynbeeSure Start was New Labour’s finest achievement, and the Tories destroyed it. Now it’s back with a mission to put children at the heart of everythingTue 8 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 09.15 EDTShareThey hunt high and low for Labour’s missing message, vision, purpose or identity. Well, here it is, where it always was, in the future of children. It’s what Labour does best, what it is for: building a society where children come first and everything else falls into place. The foundations have now been laid by Bridget Phillipson by finallybringing back Sure Startto England – the most successful achievement of the last Labour government – now rebranded as Best Start family hubs.It’s a pity about the new name, but young parents recognise “hubs”, whereas Sure Start is largely gone and forgotten. Its uprooting began the day Michael Gove arrived as education secretary in 2010. He entered the “Department for Children, Schools and Families” – a name chosen to reflect the awareness that children don’t learn without wraparound care for their whole lives – and replaced it with the Gradgrind “Department for Education”. Family stuff was flimflam, distracting from rote learning, and arts, music, drama and sports were expunged from hisEbacc’s core subjects.Labour’s identity and purpose is captured in Best Start’s view of what makes children thrive. In a short time Phillipson will be rolling out across England free universal breakfast clubs,300 nurseriesin primary schools, nurseries for babies from nine months old, and 30 hours a week free childcare for preschool children in September. That’s a blessing for working parents, but its prime purpose is infant education, where most good is done for life chances. A new database will nowlink all hub servicesto Wes Streeting’s new neighbourhood health centres, helping to identify vulnerable children.Labour vows to protect Sure Start-type system from any future Reform assaultRead moreLabour pledges £1.5bn over three years tofund 1,000 family hubs– at least one in every council in England. Councils, even those run by Reform UK, will be forced to use this money on Best Starts. More hubs will follow in the next spending round: it took 10 years to establish Sure Start, and even then many of the 3,600 centres were still in their early phases, not yet offering all the health visitors, midwives, speech and language therapy, children’s mental health services, parental support, employment, debt and addiction support and many other services. Sadly, some beautiful, purpose-built centres were sold off in post-2010 vandalism. When fully functioning, they were life-changing:Angela Rayner speaks for manywhen she talks emotionally about how a Sure Start course taught her as a teenage mother to hug and read to her son, breaking a generational cycle. This time, Labour says it is determined to cement Best Start into the national psyche, making it as untouchable as the NHS, so it is unthinkable for future governments to wreck it again.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), monitoringSure Start’s lasting effects, finds that those living near a Sure Start centre in their early years “performed significantly better in assessments at ages 7, 11 and 16”, and achieved better GCSE results. At 15 they had 15% fewer absences from school. Sure Start children had many fewer hospitalisations, with fewer injuries and poisonings, “likelyreflecting improved safetyin the home environment”, and “an improvement in family functioning”. Teenagers suffered fewer depressive and anxiety disorders, while 12- to 14-year-olds had 50% fewer mental health hospitalisations.Because they caught problems early, fewer Sure Start children needed Send plans in school. This research raises hopes that Best Start will lead to fewer children needing education, health and care plans (EHCPs). But, unlike with the disastrous plans to cut disability benefits, Labour should wait for the plan to succeed and for the need to drop naturally, and not cut support first.Here’s why this is being positioned as the emblem of Labour’s prime purpose: Sure Start reduced inequalities, and was the best way to improve outcomes for the most disadvantaged. These children would, the IFS calculates, earn £11 more for every £1 of Sure Start investment, while the state would gain £5.5.bn for the £2.5bn cost. Here’s the IFS’s conclusion. “The impacts of Sure Start wereremarkably long lasting.” And those effects may be even stronger than can be proved, since inadequate data means all children living near a Sure Start centre were counted as benefiting, including those with no contact, diluting the results.For those who seek a definingLabourproject, this is it. Best Start hubs must be the flagship for future spending – the roots of a better society. Imagine if Sure Start had flourished and grown over the past 14 years, and if each cohort of children year after year had emerged better, instead of falling back.Phillipson revealed the cost of backsliding ina speech in Sunderlandlast week. The social gap between children arriving at primary school widened in the Tory years: a quarter are not fully toilet trained, a third can’t follow instructions, half can’t sit still, and reception teachers lose two and half hours a day catching these children up, to the detriment of the rest. That disadvantage gap at five years old is still there at 16. As Best Start begins the repairs, it should start by including left-out two-year-olds with unemployed parents – the most deprived, who for bizarre reasons arecurrently deniedfull-time nursery.After disability benefits, is Labour really about to target the educational rights of special needs children? | John HarrisRead moreBest Start alone is not enough. The cardinal pledge is that child poverty will fall steeply by the next election, as it has under every Labour government: Rachel Reeves and other ministers confirm this whenever they are asked. I am convinced that the child poverty taskforce led by Phillipson and Liz Kendall, reporting in the autumn, will remove the two-child benefit cap. Ignore the revengeful, anonymous No 10 briefer who taunted benefit rebels by saying that plans to remove the cap were “dead in the water”. Phillipsonadmitsthe expensive welfare U-turn makes it harder, but I can’t see the cap surviving. Counter-briefings I have heard say it is unthinkable that the taskforce will leave it in place. Listen when she says her “driving mission” is to “break the link between [a child’s] background and what they go on to achieve”. How else would that be achieved?The way forward is clear: Starmer and Reeves must make Best Start core to every speech they give. Children come first, in everything. Triple-locked pensions, social care and even the NHS must give way to children. The children’s commissioner for England today reports that “children are living in ‘Dickensian levels’ of poverty”. Neil Kinnock hasa suggestion: raise the money from the very richest. A 2% wealth tax on those who have £10m or more would yield £24bn – a plan that getsstrong supportfrom three-quarters of voters.Pain and political trouble beckon at the next budget. It’s time for this government to do something popular: pay for children’s future with the proceeds of past inequality.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionWelfareLabourBridget PhillipsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Is it a pain? James Gunn’s dim reboot is bothThe Man of Steel – played with square-faced soullessness by David Corenswet – has an uninteresting crisis of confidence in Gunn’s cluttered, pointless franchise restarterPeter BradshawTue 8 Jul 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareHere is a film occupying the heartsinking Venn diagram overlap between franchise exhaustion and AI soullessness: a film fatally unconvinced of the reason for its own existence. We’d all hoped that writer-director James Gunn, who was in charge of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy movie series, might put some wind back beneath Superman’s wings – or in his cape, or under his boots, or at any rate somewhere near his costumed person. The Man of Steel needed a fresh start after his self-cancelling contest inBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justicein 2016, and getting muddled together with a lot of other utility superheroes inJustice Leaguea year later – though I will admit to enjoying the pure hubristic craziness of the lengthy Zack Snyder cut of that movie when it saw the light of day.But this? If it was to be a reboot then really we needed to get back to basics, and be reminded why we liked superheroes in the first place – and I do – and remember why they were exciting and escapist and fun. We needed the clarity and simplicity of something like the origin myth of the infant Superman arriving here from his doomed planet, like Moses, destined to put heart back into an America hit by the Great Depression, hokey though all that may be.Yet from the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times. Superman, played with square-faced vanilla dullness by David Corenswet, has recently taken it upon himself to intervene in a war between two fancifully named fictional nation states. Why this war in particular, and none of the many others happening all over the globe, you ask? Perhaps because these countries are so palpably made up and without inconvenient political associations and implications.The evil aggressor Boravia (conceivably like Putin’s Russia but not really) has invaded the nice people of Jarhanpur (possibly resembling Zelenskyy’s Ukraine but not so as you’d notice). Superman had flown in to help the Jarhanpurians out, stalling the Boravian advance, but at personal cost to himself. He had his superhero ass mortifyingly kicked by some sort of “metahuman” being, occasioning another of his very uninteresting crises of confidence. His opponent was ostensibly from Boravia but possibly under the control of the wicked Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), who insultingly affects not to know what planet Superman comes from, and has perhaps contrived the whole Boravia/Jarhanpur contest to undermine his arch-enemy.Meanwhile, in his civilian persona of Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent, Superman finds himself in serious relationship difficulties with fellow journalist Lois Lane, in which roleRachel Brosnahanchannels Courteney Cox’s Monica Geller from TV’s Friends with such eerie precision it’s difficult to believe it’s not deliberate. Skyler Gisondo tries his best with the role of junior reporter Jimmy Olsen; that formidable actor Wendell Pierce is underused, or in fact simply not used, as Planet editor Perry White, and as Green Lantern, head of the subordinate semi-comic “Justice Gang”, Nathan Fillion raises some smiles.View image in fullscreenHere comes the CGI destruction again.Photograph: Warner Bros. PicturesReboots and remakes: why is Hollywood stuck on repeat?Read moreYet whatever machinations Lex Luthor gets up to, the ironic truth is that what undermines Superman in the eyes of the whole world is not anything he plans but a belated revelation about what his parents Jor-El (Bradley Cooper) and Lara Lor-Van (Angela Sarafyan) really intended for Superman on Earth – which leads to his facing a terrible crisis, exploited by the loathsome Luthor.But what is the point of a film so stymied in its digitally encoded and generically prescribed world that it can’t even go through the motions, as that would imply some level of activity and signs of life? How many more superhero films in general, and Superman films in particular, do we need to see that all end with the same spectacular faux-apocalypse in the big city with CGI skyscrapers collapsing? They were fun at first … but the thrill is gone.Superman is released on 10 July in Australia and on 11 July in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuperhero moviesJames GunnRachel BrosnahanNicholas HoultAction and adventure filmsDC ComicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Will her epic ‘explosion of energy’ Prom blow the Albert Hall roof off?John LewisTue 8 Jul 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareAt midnight, at least one night a week, Anna Lapwood ascends the stairs to the Royal Albert Hall’s organ loft and climbs on to its bench. Safe in the knowledge that the audience for that evening’s show have all dispersed, she starts playing the venue’s enormous Henry Willis organ, all 10,000 pipes of it. Often, she’s still going at five or six in the morning. “It’s the only downtime you get to practise,” she says.Occasionally, some celebrity from an aftershow party will be lured by her playing. “It’s how I met Benedict Cumberbatch,” she says with a laugh. “And there was the time I gave Tom Cruise an impromptu organ lesson, after that live orchestral screening of Top Gun: Maverick. AndLudovico Einaudi, who came up and improvised something with me. And the bandWet Leg, who had a go on the organ. Sometimes it’s curious cleaners or security staff who’ll come up and chat and want to have a play. It’s a lovely vibe.”Schoolfriends found it hilarious that I couldn’t tell the difference between Justin Bieber and BeyoncéLapwood’s followers on social media – including more than 1 million on Instagram and 1.2 million on TikTok – have long wanted to witness her in this late-night environment. Now, finally, she has found a way to make it happen. Next month, Lapwood will curate the first all-night Prom in over 40 years. “It will be an explosion of energy. I’ll be conducting a choir and playing the organ, but there will also be a whole load of other artists, like the pianist Hayato Sumino, or the fantastic Norwegian ensembleBarokksolistene– people in the Arctic know about performing during the night!”It’s tempting to picture this Prom, which will run from 11pm until 7am, as a giant chill-out room. Not at all, says Lapwood. “I hope that no one will be asleep!” she exclaims. “And I hope people won’t be dipping in and out. There will be two breaks. We’re trying to make sure that there are rest areas – not sleeping areas! – and lots of coffee and snacks. The idea is that people will settle in, stay awake and enjoy all of it.”View image in fullscreenArctic cool… Barokksolistene are part of Lapwood’s Prom.Photograph: Matthew LongThe event kicks off the next stage in Lapwood’s sensational career. Still only 29, she has become the hottest property in classical music: a media-friendly, globally popular ambassador for her instrument and the genre. We meet in the 350-year-old chapel at Pembroke College, Cambridge, designed by Christopher Wren, which has been Lapwood’s workplace since 2016 when, aged 21, she became the youngest ever director of music at an Oxbridge college. It’s where she taught, rehearsed with choirs, led evensong and supervised two organ scholars. But the role became increasingly difficult to maintain in the light of her other commitments, which is why she made the “gut-wrenching” decision to leave this summer.“I’ve been doing admin on planes, marking homework while travelling to gigs, racing back from recording sessions to conduct choirs. And it’s difficult for me to tell my students that they need to have a healthy work/life balance when they see me operating like this.”It leaves Lapwood free to pursue other ambitions. As well as her contract with Sony Records and her new role as associate director at the Albert Hall, she has a packed concert schedule over the next two years, including another recital at LA’s Walt Disney Concert Hall (her first was a sell-out), a collaboration with Jonny Greenwood in Manchester (another all-nighter next February) and concerts everywhere from Bristol to Budapest, Nuremberg to New York. “Venues used to want a confirmed setlist years in advance. I’ve tried to encourage more flexibility. I now just say ‘programme includes’ and list a couple of works – it’s important that I’m able to play the music that I’m currently excited about, and get a bit spontaneous.”One noticeable feature of Lapwood’s concerts is that, unlike most conductors or soloists, she talks to her audiences. Why does she do this? “Partly because I’m stuck up in the organ loft, and I need to connect with people. Mainly, I want to break people into classical music, and it’s essential to provide some sort of context and convey my enthusiasm. But every performer does things differently. Some conductors feel it’s a distraction. It’s a personal choice.”Last year Lapwood was at the centre of a mini furore for saying she welcomed people filming her concerts and uploading footage to social media. “Again, It has to be the choice of the performer,” she says. “Going on to the stage requires a lot of bravery, and you need to feel comfortable. Some people hate being filmed. I like it.”That hasn’t always been the case. “There was a time when I felt that I was always having to prove myself, a constant fear I’d mess up,” she admits. “The main problem was that I was playing an entirely classical programme, the likes of Bach and Widor and Messiaen. Much as I love all those composers, I didn’t want to playjustthem. It’s only since I’ve started incorporating my own transcriptions of film scores into my sets that I have started to genuinely enjoy playing live.”Soundtracks have become a crucial part of Lapwood’s repertoire. “I was always acutely aware of how soundtracks could affect your emotional state. I found myself rewinding DVDs and transcribing scores, note for note, working out why they moved me. Now I’ve started turning those transcriptions into organ arrangements. You have to follow what makes your heart sing.”View image in fullscreenSmall hours highlight … Japanese pianist and composer Hayato Sumino.Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty ImagesShe has recorded and performed film themes by John Powell, Rachel Portman and, in particular, Hans Zimmer, and wants to do more by the likes of James Newton Howard, Harry Gregson-Williams and Nainita Desai. “It was always my ambition to write music for film. I’d love to write a soundtrack for the organ, because it’s never been done, and it’s such a versatile instrument.”Lapwood’s most recent album, Firedove, mixes many of her enthusiasms. It opens with her arrangement of Alan Menken’s theme from Disney’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame and ends with two pieces by real-life organists at Notre Dame de Paris: a fiendish scherzo by Louis Vierne and preludes and fugues by Maurice Duruflé. There are modern minimalist pieces she has commissioned by Poppy Ackroyd, Hania Rani and Ola Gjeilo; a touch of Zimmer, a hymnal choral arrangement of a Bob Dylan song and a bombastic mashup of Robbie Williams’s Angels and Widor’s Toccata. “It sounds like I’ve arranged it thematically, but it’s literally just a load of music that I’m excited by, held together by the thread of the organ sound.”Lapwood has no composing credits on any of her eight albums to date, something she wants to rectify. “My composing brain is slowly waking up,” she says. “I’m just getting comfortable enough to start writing for the organ. I loved composing when I was little, but then I got a low grade in a harmony and counterpoint exam and was told I couldn’t continue composition. Which is nonsense!”I never sneer at anyone’s musical tastes. All musicians have blindspotsInstead the young Lapwood put all her efforts into learning as many instruments as she could get her hands on. By the age of 18 she had reached grade-eight standard on the piano, violin, viola, harp and organ, and taught herself a dozen other instruments. “I’d hear my older brother playing the flute and I’d nick his instrument and his tuition book. I’d buy cheap instruments from junk shops – guitars, cornets, drum kits – and learn from beginners books. It’s like languages. The more you learn, the easier each one gets.”So immersed was she in mastering instruments that she didn’t have much time to listen to music – something surprisingly common among musical prodigies. “Schoolfriends found it hilarious that I couldn’t tell the difference between Justin Bieber and Beyoncé,” she laughs. “It was like I lived under a rock.” She remembers sharing the musical tastes of her father, a vicar turned teacher who would listen to evangelical hymns and “quite bland popular classics” by the likes of Aled Jones and violinist Vanessa-Mae.“It’s why I never sneer at anyone’s musical tastes,” she says. “When I started working with choirs, people were like, ‘How could you not know these big hits of the choral world?’ But every area of music has its own smash hits, and all musicians have their blindspots.”Watch the viral clip of Lapwood playing with Bonobo at the Royal Albert HallLapwood’s blindspots have become a running joke on the Radio 4 cross-genre music show Add to Playlist, on which she is a frequent guest. She often admits to never having heard anything by the likes of, say, Adele, Justin Timberlake, the Rolling Stones or Keith Jarrett. She confesses that, in the past, she has been guilty of being musically incurious. She even admits she has not heard any of Dudley Moore’s jazz recordings, despite being one of his successors as an organ scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford, and having her name listed beneath his on a plaque in the chapel’s organ loft.“Sometimes, the amount of music I need to deal with just for work is exhausting,” she says. “You can’t listen to everything.” She relaxes, she says, by putting on the same Melody Gardot playlist she has listened to for years, and by watching trash TV like Australian Masterchef, or by cooking the same dishes day after day (“I’m currently in a shakshuka phase”).“It is easy to get stuck in a rut, which is why I love being forced into learning about new areas of music.” Often this happens in public, such as when she guested on the organ with the electronica outfit Bonobo, or performed in a Ministry of Sound concert – both went viral.“You suddenly learn about a new sound world, and appreciate different technical skills. All these musical barriers – barriers that I had enforced on myself – disappear. It’s like, for some reason, my parents never cooked bacon. I went through my childhood thinking I’d hate bacon. Then, at university, I had a bacon sandwich, which was a eureka moment! It’s why I’m increasingly open to all types of music.”Firedove by Anna Lapwood is out now on Sony Classical. Her new single, An Irish Blessing, with the Pembroke College Chapel Choir, will be released on 1 August.

What happens now?Tue 8 Jul 2025 12.20 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 12.30 EDTShareOn paper it has everything. A redemption-arc narrative about overcoming homelessness, adversity and illness. Two late-middle age lead characters that would appeal to the key silver-pound cinema-going demographic, as well as providing plum roles for top-notch British actors. A backdrop of glorious south coast scenery, as experienced through that most modish of contemporary activities: hiking.No wonderfilm-makerswere champing at the bit to make a movie out of The Salt Path, the memoir byRaynor Winn published in 2018– and so one duly emerged, starring Gillian Anderson as Winn and Jason Isaacs as her husband Moth, who was diagnosed with the incurable condition corticobasal degeneration (CBD). It was released in the UK in May, and was a verifiable hit,taking home £7.6mfrom the UK box office and becoming the third most successful British film of 2025 so far, behind Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy and We Live in Time.Walk on the wild side: Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs on their epic hiking movie The Salt PathRead moreBut all this looks imperilled bythe sensational report in the Observer on Sundaythat alleged that Winn took tens of thousands from a former employer, and lied about the circumstances under which the couple’s house was repossessed in the memoir. The report also alleged that Winn – whose real name is allegedly Sally Walker – and her husband had owned a house in France since 2007. A professor of clinical neuroscienc﻿es also questioned the validity of Moth Winn’s CBD diagnosis. Winn said the Observer’s report was “highly misleading” and that she was “taking legal advice and won’t be making any further comment at this time”.A spokesperson for the film’s producers, Shadowplay and Number 9, said: “The film is a faithful adaptation of the book that we optioned …There were no known claims against the book at the time of optioning it or producing and distributing the film and we undertook all necessary due diligence before acquiring the book.”It is not an unprecedented situation for film-makers to have doubt cast on the authenticity of books that they have adapted. The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things was released in 2001, and made into a film in 2004, before its author, the reclusive JT Leroy, was revealed to in fact be Laura Albert. A Mark Romanek-directed film version of James Frey’s A Million Little Pieceswas scrapped in 2006after Frey was revealed to haveincluded fictional elementsin his “memoir”; however,a film did emerge in 2019, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, that embraced the book’s questionable nature.Unhappily for The Salt Path movie, the controversy has arisen at a delicate, financially vulnerable point. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto film festival and has largely completed its theatrical run in the UK, as well as playing in cinemas in the Netherlands, Australia and South Africa. Unlike a studio film, independent productions have to sell themselves piece by piece across the world; crucially the film has not yet secured a North American cinema release. Less than a month ago,its sales agents appeared confidentof striking a deal on the back of its healthy British box office returns; now it could well be seen as damaged goods.View image in fullscreenGillian Anderson at a screening of the film in Germany, 1 July.Photograph: Gisela Schober/Getty ImagesNotwithstanding its successful theatrical run, the producers will have been hoping for a “long tail” of cinema screenings, which now looks questionable; a cinema manager I spoke to said while they’d honour previously made bookings in such a situation, the film is attracting considerable abuse on social media and may now be “tainted”. Even more concerning is the reality that a considerable proportion of a film’s revenue will come from home entertainment formats via streaming platforms, digital rental and download, DVD and TV and the like. The Salt Path has yet to be released on any of these formats and common sense dictates that the take-up will inevitably be diminished, meaning another significant financial hit. A projected awards campaign, for which Anderson and Isaacs would have been shoo-ins for Bafta nominations, if not Oscars, may well have gone up in smoke also.Depending on the details of the rights agreement, the producers may be able to make a compensation claim at some future point against Winn, depending on how the controversy is resolved.Perhaps more intangible is the reputational cost to the film-makers. Shadowplay Features is an outfit based around heavyweight producer Lloyd Levin, who in the past has produced United 93, Watchmen, Da 5 Bloods and The Mauritanian; Number 9 is the company of high profile British producers Stephen Woolley and Elizabeth Karlsen, whose previous credits include Carol, Living, Colette and On Chesil Beach. Embarrassing as this furore may be, both sets of producers have built up illustrious reputations in the industry and once the dust has settled it is hard to see either sustaining any significant damage.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm adaptationsanalysisShareReuse this content"

How Stephanie Rothman became queen of the B-movieRachel ProngerThe director’s mastery of trashy, low-budget exploitation films like It’s a Bikini World and Group Marriage turned her into a cult icon. Now, aged 88, she’s finding out they’re more relevant than everTue 8 Jul 2025 10.33 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 12.31 EDTShareStephanie Rothman first came across the term “exploitation” in a review of one of her own films. It was 1970, and her second solo-directed feature, The Student Nurses, a small-budget indie about trainees at an inner-city hospital, set against Los Angeles’s bubbling counterculture, was doing well at the US box office. (It eventually made more than $1m from a $150,000 budget.) Rothman was pleased but the review took her aback. It called it an “exploitation film” with “surprising depth”.Fifty-five years on and Rothman is a cult legend who fully embraces the label. “I started out with a very snobbish attitude,” she says on a video call from California. “I was shocked that’s what I was making! But as time went on, I began to appreciate what I was able to do, which was to take elements of popular entertainment, weave them into a tapestry of more interesting ideas, and end up with something very different. So while I started out as a snob, I have not ended up as one.”The seven features she directed during her brief, explosive career bear all the traditional exploitation hallmarks: low budgets, quick turnarounds, breasts, sex, violence and risque marketing campaigns. They’re also funny and subversive, with explicit politics to match the (equal opportunity) nudity.View image in fullscreenRothman during the making of The Student Nurses, with her husband Charles Swartz and, facing away, production manager Paul Rapp.Photograph: courtesy Stephanie RothmanNow 88, Rothman is warm and funny – and also pin-sharp and precise. The determination and clarity required of a female director pursuing her vision and preserving her principles in the male-dominated 1970s exploitation industry is fully apparent. Nevertheless, becoming exploitation’s cult heroine was not what she had in mind when she was one of three women who enrolled on a graduate film course in California in 1962, where she met her husband and future collaborator Charles S Swartz.After graduating, she worked for pulp cinema impresarioRoger Corman, the self-described “Orson Welles of the Z movie” who had built an empire by churning out low-cost, high-shock genre flicks. Always willing to take a chance on a young film-maker (as long as they delivered on schedule and under budget), he immediately put Rothman to work. Soon she was landing her first significant credits, co-directing a messy 1966 horror called Blood Bath (a salvage job, after the initial director dropped the ball), then as sole director, with Swartz as producer, on the beach movie It’s a Bikini World (1967). The 14-day shoot was hectic, but Rothman delivered on time and on budget. “I was thrilled and I threw myself into it,” she says. “I wasn’t afraid.”The Student Nurses followed, with which she translated a thin brief – “a film about nurses, primarily sexy, with a little violence” – into a multi-layered tale. Rothman personally picked out the film’s poster, featuring four alluring nurses gazing outward under the tagline “They’re learning fast!” The film sparked a series of nursesploitation copycats. The Velvet Vampire, a seductive horror set in the California desert, was less commercially successful but has since become Rothman’s best-known film, prized for its exquisite camp and European arthouse sensibility – notably its dreamy surrealist sequences inspired by Jean Cocteau. Despite a shoestring budget and the challenges of a desert shoot (“We were always backing up into cacti”), the result was an arresting Mojave gothic with a streak of transgressive queer female sexuality.View image in fullscreenSeductive … The Velvet Vampire (1971).When Rothman and Swartz broke away from Corman, their films became even quirkier. Group Marriage (1973), a comedy about a polycule who take on the legal system to assert their right to marry, was inspired by the theories of futurist Alvin Toffler and playwright Georges Feydeau’s farces. Rothman’s affectionate depiction of the central relationship feels prescient, as does a finale in which the group’s gay neighbours decide they’d also like to marry. “I don’t know of any other film that, at that time, had a gay wedding in it,” says Rothman. “When we showed the film, at the scene where the gay couple get married, the audience roared with laughter. Not with rage, not disdain, but surprise.”The Working Girls, about a trio of ambitious young women who use their wiles to navigate the job market, is by far her most personal film. “I’ve always thought of it as being dedicated to the Equal Rights Amendment,” says Rothman. “A woman couldn’t get a bank account in her own name. I was a working woman, making my own living, and I couldn’t get a credit card!”Ironically, The Working Girls did little to improve Rothman’s own finances. She was ready to break free of the exploitation genre, but while fellow graduates of Corman’s trash cinema stable such as Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Francis Ford Coppola managed to move into the mainstream, Rothman did not. The Working Girls, released in 1974, was her final feature.View image in fullscreen‘Dedicated to the Equal Rights Amendment’ … The Working Girls (1974)“People often ask me why I left the industry,” she sighs. “I didn’t leave the film industry, the film industry left me. It was very frustrating. I couldn’t get work in television. I couldn’t afford to join the Directors Guild.” In the 1980s, after turning down a few offers to return to exploitation, Rothman quit the industry for good. “It wasn’t the right time to be making films for me, the opportunities weren’t there. They were there for young men, but not for me.”Her films were rarely screened in subsequent decades, but a wave of restorations is now in motion, partly due to renewed appreciation for female “trash” cinema. A Rothman-esque spirit can be traced in work by Rose Glass (Saint Maud,Love Lies Bleeding), Coralie Fargeat (The Substance),Prano Bailey-Bond(Censor) andJulia Ducournau, director ofRawand the Palme d’Or-wining body-horrorTitane.The playfulness of Rothman’s anti-patriarchal stories also feels freshly relevant to audiences. When The Working Girls screened in Venice in 2023, she was approached by a group of students who told her it “didn’t feel dated at all”.“That was deeply gratifying,” says Rothman, “because of my great age and their great youth! But it also shows how things have regressed.”Stephanie Rothman’s films will screen atCinema Rediscovered, Bristol, from 23 to 27 July and atthe Barbican, London, 29 July to 14 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmRoger CormaninterviewsShareReuse this content"

A blockbuster exhibition offering the chance to see the tapestry up close for the first time on UK soil since its creation is also expected to boost London’s visitor economy.View image in fullscreenA helmet from the Sutton Hoo burial site.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumThe Bayeux tapestry consists of 58 scenes and is widely accepted to have been made in England during the 11th century, most likely commissioned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, wrote in her 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux that the work’s survival over nine centuries was “little short of miraculous”.“Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating,” she said.The tapestry has been on display in various locations inFrancethroughout its history, including most recently at the Bayeux Museum. Visitors will now have the chance to view it in the Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery of the British Museum between September 2026 and July 2027.Meanwhile, museums in Normandy will host the Sutton Hoo treasures, which were discovered as part of a seventh-century Anglo-Saxon ship burial in Suffolk in 1939, and provide great insights into England from a time before the Norman conquest.Nicholas Cullinan, the director of the British Museum, called the Bayeux tapestry “one of the most important and unique cultural artefacts in the world, which illustrates the deep ties between Britain and France and has fascinated people across geographies and generations”.He added: “It is hard to overstate the significance of this extraordinary opportunity of displaying it at the British Museum and we are profoundly grateful to everyone involved.View image in fullscreenThe Bayeux museum in Normandy, FrancePhotograph: Bayeux Museum“This will be the first time the Bayeux tapestry has been in the UK since it was made, almost 1,000 years ago. We are also delighted to send the Lewis chessmen, and some of our treasures from Sutton Hoo – the greatest archaeological discovery in Britain – to France in return.”The loan will form part of a bilateral season of culture in 2027 that will celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of the birth of William the Conquerer and the Grand Départ of the 2027 Tour de France in the UK.Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said: “The Bayeux tapestry is one of the most iconic pieces of art ever produced in the UK and I am delighted that we will be able to welcome it here in 2026. This loan is a symbol of our shared history with our friends in France, a relationship built over centuries and one that continues to endure.“The British Museum is one of the world’s most visited museums and is a fitting place to host this most treasured piece of our nation’s history.”Macron praised the exchange in his speech at a state banquet held at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening. “For the first time in 900 years the Bayeux tapestry will follow the same path as the warriors whose stories it tells and land on British soil,” he said.“Either they were never made or they were lost – those final scenes of the tapestry are missing. I see that as (an) even more powerful symbol in the great mural of Franco-British history, the end has yet to be written.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageBayeux tapestryFranceBritish MuseumMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the day before the show, I watched an interview with Tony Iommi and just couldn’t bear the thought of not being there for their final goodbye. I’ve seen them a handful of times before, including their one-off show at the O2 Academy, but as a Brummie and a metal fan, it felt like a pilgrimage I just had to take.I wasn’t wrong. The whole event felt as though it was lifted from my childhood iPod library. A whirlwind of bands I’d grown up listening to, blasting out their greatest hits and exclusive Sabbath covers. I really felt connected to the thousands of others who had all been touched by the eclectic lineup. Then there were the supergroups. Listening to Steven Tyler jam with Tom Morello, Travis Barker and Ronnie Wood was just madness.It was very emotional. I cried through his entire solo set. It’s always devastating to see the effects of Parkinson’s take their toll on somebody’s body, but it hits that much harder when the person was so full of life. It was a testament to pushing through the limits your body sets on you and doing what you love regardless.The legacy Sabbath and Ozzy leave behind after retirement makes me fiercely proud to be a Brummie, and that day will always hold a special place in my heart.Omar Khan, 32, theatre director, originally from Birmingham, living in DerbyView image in fullscreenTom Morello and Steven Tyler at Back to the Beginning.Photograph: Ross Halfin‘I will remember this day for ever’It was a chance for me to reconnect with the music I loved as a teenager. The most mind-blowing, exciting and deafening day of live music. Coming straight off the back of Glastonbury, I was glad I had a seat and an amazing view. Heavy metal doesn’t get enough credit for giving the misfits and misunderstood an outlet for their emotions. I was most looking forward to seeing Alice in Chains, Metallica, Slayer andBlack Sabbath, of course.The supergroups were an added bonus – seeing Steven Tyler and Ronnie Wood join the already stacked lineup of heavy metal gods was incredible. Every band fulfilled the brief: bring two or three of your top songs plus a Black Sabbath cover. It was like a heavy metal club night where every song was being played by the original band – it felt insane. What an amazing feat to pull off a technically complex show, no doubt full of some of the biggest egos out there, without much of a hitch.Back to the Beginning was a fitting end to a phenomenal career. I felt happy that they had the chance to finish on their own terms – it couldn’t have been a better opportunity to say goodbye. I will remember this day for ever.Annie, 35, Norwich‘An outpouring of love’It was an outpouring of love for a music genre started by Black Sabbath. A real sense of camaraderie, which has always been there in metal and rock circles, was given substance as we all met to celebrate what would be the final performances of the four icons.The realisation that each band was to play a Sabbath or Ozzy cover as part of their sets really set the tone of the day and made it more than just a collection of bands playing songs. It tied up beautifully. I am crying here just remembering the whole experience.Neil, Malvern, WorcestershireView image in fullscreenGeorge Russell and friend, at Black Sabbath’s Back to the Beginning concert.Photograph: George Russell‘You could tell how much it meant to Ozzy’The whole event was incredible. The atmosphere the day before in Birmingham was electric, with people from every corner of the globe coming to celebrate the founding fathers of heavy metal. Like many at the gig, we travelled a long, long way – over 24 hours of travel! – but it was so totally worth it to be part of such a historic event. This was the sendoff that the original lineup truly deserved. One for the history books.You could tell how much it meant to Ozzy. His voice was still there, and you could see how being on stage gave him the energy he needed to make his final bow. Ozzy’s solo set blew me away because I think, like most people, I really wasn’t sure what to expect. I hope this final gig gives Ozzy the closure he so rightly deserves, for an artist who inspired and continues to inspire so many musicians, including myself.George Russell, 34, Margaret River, Western AustraliaView image in fullscreenBill Ward performing with Black Sabbath.Photograph: Black Sabbath/Ross Halfin‘It was unbelievably moving’I loved it. It felt long overdue to see a band like Sabbath getting recognised for their global importance, even if it’s arrived just as they’re retiring. It was very emotional in places, and sometimes it wobbled a little on the line between “entertainment” and “tribute”. We watched it on the livestream for more than nine hours, transfixed.You can see being a performer is what Ozzy’s all about. But seeing him fighting through his various ailments to deliver a pretty solid attempt on all of his songs was unbelievably moving. The final set really felt like a significant moment in culture, and working-class culture. It was also a vindication for the great drummer Bill Ward, who reminded us all that Sabbath’s unique “swing” and feel came from him. They sounded like the old 70s Sabbath.I’d have liked to have seen a few actual Birmingham/Midlands metal bands on the bill, (Diamond Head come to mind, maybe even Wolfsbane and Quartz, etc?). But it was a wonderful celebration.Van Norris, 61, Hampshire‘Black Sabbath gave heavy metal to the world, and now they are handing over that legacy’As a Brummie, it was the best gift to the city and its people. Brummies are humble, the city gets a bad rap, and we’ve never bigged ourselves up enough. Though we’re the city of a thousand trades, the perfect example of how a multicultural city can thrive and, of course, the home of heavy metal. We deserved this gig – it shows you can become as big as Ozzy and never forget your roots, and has brought £20m to the local economy and probably millions to the charities. What a great gift back to the city and its people.Music-wise, it was a testament to just how much Black Sabbath has influenced the genre. They were in a league of their own back then. For me, the best band yesterday wasMetallica. But Black Sabbath, taking humbly to the stage with no pomp, just knuckling down to those riffs, demonstrating everything us Brummies are, brought every emotion I have as a Brummie and a lifelong heavy metal fan to the surface. They owned the night.Black Sabbath gave heavy metal to the world, and now they are handing over that legacy. Ozzy gave it as much as he could, and all of us metal fans will be forever grateful.Bev, Birmingham‘A once-in-a-lifetime gig’It’s not hyperbole to describe this as a once-in-a-lifetime gig. It felt a bit rushed with some great bands not really able to get into their stride, but in reality it was a logistical miracle to achieve it all and all for charity to boot – every band, every ticket, all the merch and streaming sales going to three good causes, so who can be cynical about that? There were surprises –Yungbludbeing one, Ronnie Wood and Steve Tyler being another, and Ozzy’s voice holding up (mostly) being the biggest.All in all it was simply a celebration of heavy metal music. I’ll never see the likes of Anthrax, Pantera, Slayer, Guns N’ Roses, Metallica and Sabbath on the same stage again, so to have all these great bands coming together for a day to celebrate the originators of the whole thing was simply brilliant. An analogue spectacular in an age of streaming, and that’s perfectly fine with me.I’ve seen several “last time ever” tours, but this really does feel like the end of an era – rock’s poster boy for wild excess bows out with a few tears, still looking slightly bemused that he’s managed to make a spectacular career by just doing the first thing that comes into his head.Richard, Wolverhampton‘A monumental moment not just for Ozzy but for rock and metal musicians the world over’View image in fullscreenDominic Bishop, a Black Sabbath fan and Guardian readerPhotograph: Dominic BishopOzzy inspired me to make my own music many moons ago with Infernal Symphony, and now I’ve managed to achieve my own goals relatively recently. The gig couldn’t have been any better – it was a monumental moment not just for Ozzy but for rock and metal musicians the world over.I watched it with my girlfriend, her mum and dad and some friends on the livestream, as we weren’t able to get tickets. We got some drinks in and a takeaway, and had a little bit of a mosh in the living room from 3pm, and we finished after midnight.This gig felt simultaneously like a music festival, a wild blowout metal party, and a funeral all combined. All the performers were visibly nervous due to their sheer respect for the ones who started it all, and this lent a passion and reverence to the proceedings that I wasn’t expecting. Each artist seemed genuinely excited to be there, and you could tell they were giving it their all.A truly fantastic show and a moment of history being made in real time. There was not a dry eye in the house! Bittersweet, but life-affirming.Dominic Bishop, 33, Cannock, StaffordshireExplore more on these topicsMusicBlack SabbathOzzy OsbourneMetalPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s charming presenters or experts who entertain as they educate, we decided it was high time to salute the people who make our every day viewing a pleasure. Consider it a “soft power list” of TV’s most affable talents.The likes of Mel and Sue, Chris Packham, Clare Balding, Guy Martin, Kaleb Cooper, Roman Kemp, David Olusoga, Joe Lycett, AJ Odudu, Tom Allen and Stephen Mangan narrowly missed the cut. But they’re all just an adorable viral moment away from breaking into the agreeable elite.Here’s our selection of the people who cheer us up whenever they come on-screen. We’d love to hear yours, too.Claudia WinklemanView image in fullscreen‘Effortlessly witty’ … Claudia Winkleman.Photograph: Cody Burridge/PAThe fringe. The teak tan. The penchant for goth garb and daft gags. You know you’re in safe hands when La Winkle is fronting something. Engaging, welcoming and effortlessly witty, she is the perfect mix of slickness and spontaneity. Happily, Winkleman also has impeccable taste in projects. The Traitors, The Piano, and Strictly Come Dancing are all killer, no filler. Probably the best presenter on primetime TV.Bob MortimerMirth-maker … Bob MortimerThe Middlesbrough mirth-maker’s ascent to national treasure status has been joyous to behold. Emerging from the shadow of double act partner Vic Reeves, genial Mortimer’s mischievous energy and funny bones have made him a bona fide hero. His heart condition prompted riverbank larks withPaul Whitehouseon Gone Fishing. His turns on Would I Lie To You? leave viewers breathless.

And away …Stacey SolomonView image in fullscreenQueen of the Jungle … Stacey Solomon.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianWho’d have predicted that The X Factor finalist with Roland Rat’s voice would be an award-winning broadcaster 15 years later? She is routinely underestimated by snobs but our Stace is steely and smart. She charmed the nation on I’m A Celebrity and was crowned Queen of the Jungle. Like a relatable Marie Kondo, Solomon is full of can-do compassion on decluttering series Sort Your Life Out. Even professionally hapless husband Joe Swash is made bearable by her winning presence on the couple’s chaotic reality show.Monty Don‘The don of gardens’ … Monty DonThere’s nobody you’d rather tend your herbaceous borders. “Donty Mon”, as Alan Partridge drunkenly called him, is the undisputed, well, don of TV horticulturalists. All muddy fingernails and crinkly smile, he eloquently conveys his wholesome passion for all things earthy. Don’t even get me started on his loving relationships with dogs. I’ll start over-watering from my eyes.Dermot O’LearyView image in fullscreen‘Infectious enthusiasm’ … Dermot O’Leary.Photograph: ITV/REX/ShutterstockA firm favourite since he eased our hangovers on cult teen strand T4 and managed to make Big Brother’s Little Brother a must-see.

Nimble-witted with infectious enthusiasm, he always radiates good vibes.

After going viral for his tear-sodden meltdown when put through to the live shows (“I can’t breathe! Promise this ain’t a wind-up?”), the resilient Rylan bounced back by winning Celebrity Big Brother. He has since become an in-demand host on Eurovision and This Morning. Far cleverer than he is given credit for, he’s a Celebrity Gogglebox scene-stealer alongside Mummy Linda, while last year’s BBC travelogue with Rob “Judge” Rinder was an unexpected treat. As a superfan steeped in TV lore – see his unalloyed glee at his recent Doctor Who cameo – Rylan hits all the right beats with warmth and subversive wit.Alison HammondView image in fullscreen‘Fresh energy’ … Alison Hammond.Photograph: BBC StudiosProud owner of the most infectious laugh on TV, Hammond is always a sheer delight to watch, bab. She has brought a fresh energy to The Great British Bake Off, while her playful Friday stints co-hosting This Morning with Dermot O’Leary have become the flagging daytime fixture’s weekly highlight. Hammond is one of the few people who could have conceivably taken over For the Love of Dogs from the much-missed Paul O’Grady. Last month, she finally got her own interview series, Alison Hammond’s Big Weekend. Writer Jack Rooke even named the protagonist’s goldfish after her in Big Boys.Danny Dyer‘The land lord’ … Danny DyerCan you pinpoint the moment when Sir Danforth of Dyer went from laddish joke to national gem? Calling David Cameron a “twat” on live TV? Discovering his royal ancestry on Who Do You Think You Are? Providing the heart, soul and moustache of Jilly Cooper’s Rivals? Turning the airwaves blue during his grilling by a neurodivergent panel on The Assembly? Either way, from Queen Vic landlord to masculinity guru, Dyer is a total ledge.Martin LewisView image in fullscreen‘People’s champion’ … Martin Lewis.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/ShutterstockIt takes a lot for a financial journalist to win the public’s affections but the money-saving expert has managed it.

She became synonymous with Big Brother during its Noughties pomp. McCall now plies her trade mainly on ITV as an empathetic presenter of Long Lost Family, a midlife matchmaker on My Dad, Your Mum and an excitable judge on The Masked Singer. Her menopause documentaries and heath battles have only made her more beloved.Ian Wright‘Passionate pundit’ … Ian WrightIan Wright-Wright-Wright was a Marmite figure on the pitch but since swapping playing for punditry, he’s become universally adored. This process accelerated when he was tearfully reunited on-screen with Mr Pigden, the teacher Wright called “the first positive male figure in my life”. Wrighty brings a fan’s passion and a frisson of spontaneity which livens up the dullest of matches.

Regular appearances on Radio 4, 6 Music and BBC Four led to her own BBC Two series, The Secret Genius of Modern Life. Fry made a moving, maths-heavy documentary about her recovery from cervical cancer and was resident number-cruncher on Channel 4’s election coverage.

Osman’s mega-selling Thursday Murder Club novels (the starry Netflix adaptation drops next month) and his pleasingly gossipy podcast with our ownMarina Hyde, The Rest Is Entertainment, have only made him more admired.Jane McDonald‘Your camp auntie’ … Jan McDonaldNobody can carry a Channel 5 cruising series or lux travelogue like the Wakefield Whitney. All glitter, gags and good time glamour, she’s like your camp auntie. The leather-lunged singer’s appearances on Celebrity Gogglebox, alongside her makeup artist and best pal Sue, have only boosted her appeal. The unpretentious duo guzzle goblets of rosé and cackle away like the ultimate huns. While watching Bridgerton, McDonald cheerfully admitted that she lost her own virginity in the back of a parked Vauxhall van, not noticing that someone was siphoning off its petrol.

I admire its cosmic grandeur and sublime poetry but balk at its structural unwieldiness and dramatic implausibility: like Coleridge, I find the spectacle of Gloucester’s suffering “unendurable” and there is something gratuitously cruel about Edgar’s refusal to reveal his identity to his father. I’ve never regretted omitting it from my bookThe 101 Greatest Playsyet I still remember a shocked head of the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford greeting me with the words: “I hear you’ve dropped Lear.”Whatever my personal doubts, the play has a mythic quality that has appealed to dramatists, composers and film-makers including our own Peter Brook, the Russian Grigori Kozintsev and the JapaneseAkira Kurosawawhose Ran is enjoying a rerelease to mark its 40th anniversary. Seeing Ran again after all this time was an overwhelming experience. It would be absurd to say it is better than Lear but it addresses many of the problems I have with Shakespeare’s play.The Gloucester subplot is excised and the opening scene makes total sense. Kurosawa sets the action in a 16th-century feudal Japan where Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai), a warrior-chief, divides his kingdom among his three sons, with the eldest first in rank. Where Shakespeare’s Cordelia – whom the critic James Agate once dubbed “gormless” – precipitates a crisis by her obdurate silence, Kurosawa has the youngest son, Subaro (Daisuke Ryu), raise perfectly rational objections to his father’s scheme. He foresees that it will breed chaos (one of the meanings of the Japanese word “Ran”) for which he is promptly banished.Kurosawa’s greatest innovation is in the character of Hidetora himself. Shakespeare’s Lear is despotic and wilful but he is also a man “more sinned against than sinning”. Hidetora, however, is guilty of barbaric cruelties for which he comes to pay a hideous price. One of the most moving scenes is Hidetora’s encounter with his Buddhist daughter-in-law and her blind brother, whose eyes Hidetora himself had gouged out after murdering his father. The meeting takes place in a hovel where we are thankfully spared Poor Tom’s wild capering: instead we see a 70-year-old warrior coming face to-face, quite literally, with the consequences of his brutal actions and afflicted by a shame and remorse that propel him towards madness.Part of the brilliance of Kurosawa’s film is the way it incorporates Shakespearean motifs while expressing its own philosophy. You see this in the poetic final image where the blind brother, abandoned during the climactic battles, is seen tapping his way inexorably to the edge of a bleak precipice only to stop at the last second. This solitary figure seen against a darkening sky clearly expresses Kurosawa’s view of the human condition. We are all poised on the edge of an abyss – for Kurosawa it was the prospect of nuclear proliferation, today it would be climate disaster – into which, if we are fortunate, we do not finally plunge.View image in fullscreenA magnet for other artists … Vivian Tierney (Regan), Monte Jaffe (Lear), Phyllis Cannan (Goneril) in Lear by Aribert Reimann at the London Coliseum in 1989.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianIt is a measure of Shakespeare’s power that he stimulates other artists. Edward Bond’s play Lear, first seen at London’s Royal Court in 1971 and all too rarely since, is not unlike Kurosawa’s film in that it shows a society descending into chaos under the influence of an arbitrary ruler. Where Kurosawa’s Hidetora is accompanied to the last by his Fool, Bond’s Lear is shadowed by the ghost of a boy who once sheltered him. Bond also shows, even more explicitly, the Goya-like horrors of civil war and has powerful scenes that consciously echo Shakespeare. At one point Bond’s Lear bends over the beautiful dead body of his cruel daughter, Fontinelle, and asks in bewilderment “Where is the beast? The blood is still as a lake”, which reminds us of Shakespeare’s “Then let them anatomize Regan, see what breeds about her heart”.But while Bond’s play merits revival, its final gesture seems inadequate. Shakespeare ends with a tribute to human endurance, Kurosawa with a glimmer of salvation. Bond’s play ends with Lear taking a shovel to destroy the protective wall he has built around his kingdom and being killed in the process. Bond argued that his play came to a positive conclusion in that “I make the king accept moral responsibility for his actions” but I miss the verbal poetry of Shakespeare and the visual resonance of Kurosawa in Bond’s final image.Intriguingly, King Lear has also attracted countless composers. Giuseppe Verdi (“It is a sublime subject that I adore”) was fascinated by its father-daughter relationship. Benjamin Britten contemplated a Lear opera in the late 1940s, worked on an outline with Peter Pears and left behind a Penguin edition full of annotations. And, of the extant Lear operas, one by the German composer, Aribert Reimann, had a vigorous production at the London Coliseum in 1989. Andrew Clements wrote in Opera magazine that “the score can register nothing between violent excess on the one hand and numbed desolation on the other”, but my faded memory is of a work that had a brutal percussive power and bypassed modern attempts, in the wake of Peter Brook’s1962 stage production, to justify Goneril and Regan. If nothing else, the opera proved that Shakespeare’s play, craggy, monumental and flawed as it may be, has proved a magnet for other artists. It has also, in Kurosawa’s Ran, yielded one unquestioned masterpiece.Ran is in cinemas now. A four-disc collector’s edition is released by StudioCanal on 21 July.Explore more on these topicsTheatreKing LearAkira KurosawaEdward BondWilliam ShakespearecommentShareReuse this content"

They include allegations, denied by Wallace, of groping one co-worker and having pulled his trousers down in front of a second.The new allegations come just days before the publication of a report on separate claims made last year. It led toMasterChefproduction company Banijay commissioning a report on Wallace, overseen by the law firm Lewis Silkin.The new claims were made as Wallace admitted using inappropriate language but claimed to have been cleared of “the most serious and sensational accusations made against me”.In a statement on social media, the former BBC presenter said he had now been diagnosed with autism. He said while his neurodiversity was discussed across “countless seasons of MasterChef”, he was given no protection.Wallace repeatedly attacked the BBC in a furious Instagram post.“I will not go quietly,” Wallace wrote. “I will not be cancelled for convenience. I was tried by media and hung out to dry well before the facts were established. The full story of this incredible injustice must be told and it is very much a matter of public interest.”BBC News previously said it had heard allegations of inappropriate sexual comments and inappropriate behaviour by 13 people who had worked with Wallace across a 17-year period.The presenter first stepped away from his role on MasterChef nine months ago, after the BBC received complaints about his conduct. Among his accusers is the presenter Kirsty Wark, who was a Celebrity MasterChef contestant in 2011. She has alleged Wallace told “sexualised” jokes during filming.In his new five-page statement, Wallace said he had opted to speak out before the Silkin report – a “decision I do not take lightly”.“But after 21 years of loyal service to the BBC, I cannot sit in silence while my reputation is further damaged to protect others,” he said. “The Silkin report exonerates me of all the serious allegations which made headlines last year and finds me primarily guilty of inappropriate language between 2005 and 2018.“I recognise that some of my humour and language, at times, was inappropriate. For that, I apologise without reservation. But I was never the caricature now being sold for clicks.”He claimed he had been driven to “go public” because BBC News was “intending to platform legally unsafe accusations”. He accused the broadcaster of “no longer providing balanced and impartial public service journalism”.Wallace accused MasterChef’s makers of turning on him, despite his personality once being regarded as a crucial part of the show. He said they had also failed to protect him, despite his likely neurodiversity.“I was hired by the BBC and MasterChef as the cheeky greengrocer. A real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all,” he said. “For over two decades, that authenticity was part of the brand. Now, in a sanitised world, that same personality is seen as a problem.“My neurodiversity, now formally diagnosed as autism, was suspected and discussed by colleagues across countless seasons of MasterChef.“Yet nothing was done to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over 20 years. That failure is now being quietly buried.”The BBC reported that the majority of new allegations were about claimed inappropriate comments. However, it said 11 women accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour such as groping and touching. Wallace has denied the allegations.Among the new allegations were claims that Wallace took his trousers down in front of a woman in a dressing room, which she described as “disgusting and predatory”. She worked on MasterChef between 2011 and 2013. At the time, it was produced by Shine, a company now owned by Banijay.She claimed to have reported what had happened, but said she was told by staff who were more senior: “You’re over 16. You’re not being ‘Jimmy Saviled’.”A participant on Saturday Kitchen claimed that during a 2002 dinner before filming, Wallace put his hand on her groin, saying: “Do you like that?” The BBC also reported that a 19-year-old MasterChef worker had tried to complain in 2022 about Wallace’s comments about her body.A BBC spokesperson said: “Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.”Banijay is not commenting on the report until it is officially published.The BBC has already accepted a series of recommendations from an independent culture review, designed to tackle unacceptable behaviour by powerful figures.Explore more on these topicsGregg WallaceBBCMasterChefnewsShareReuse this content"

Circa 1953.Illustration: Estate of John le CarréHis annotated manuscripts will show the extent to which he revised his novels repeatedly. In a draft for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, he described Smiley as “small, podgy and at best middle-aged”, scribbling an insertion: “His legs were short, his gait anything but agile.”Le Carré worked as a diplomat and a secret agent for MI5 and MI6 before his name was passed to the Russians by the traitor Kim Philby, who inspired the Soviet mole who infiltrated the highest ranks of the Secret Intelligence Service in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.While le Carré elevated the spy novel to high art, creating a gritty antithesis to Ian Fleming’s glamorous James Bond, the exhibition will primarily portray him as a writer who had worked as a spy – as he saw himself – rather than as a spy who became a writer.It will show how he gathered information, plotted stories and developed iconic characters such as Smiley and his counterpart Karla, the wily KGB spymaster. The archival papers reveal intricate timelines of plots.The exhibition’s title plays on the term “tradecraft” that he used to describe the techniques of espionage, but which the curators said “might also be applied to his own skilled craft as a writer and social commentator”.Private letters to be shown include a handwritten note that reveals his discomfort with public speculation about his spying career before it was actually confirmed. “Why do people want me to have views about spying? If I wrote about love, or cowboys, even sex, people would take it that this was my interest and therefore I made up stories about it,” he wrote.View image in fullscreenA portrait of David Cornwell taken by his son.Photograph: Stephen CornwellThere is also a letter in which the actor Alec Guinness doubted his suitability to play Smiley in the first television adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy because he was “not really rotund and double-chinned”. Le Carré persuaded him to take on one of his most memorable roles.The exhibition is co-curated by le Carré’s collaborator and longstanding friend Prof Federico Varese and Dr Jessica Douthwaite, of the Bodleian libraries, with the support of le Carré’s family.Further reflecting le Carré’s rigorous approach to research, it will explore his close collaboration with intelligence operators, corporate whistleblowers and humanitarians and his dedication to exposing corruption, such as unethical practices in the pharmaceutical industry.Varese, an Oxford professor of criminology whose books include The Russia Mafia, was among friends to whom le Carré would send early drafts of his novels. “He was very open to suggestions,” Varese said.Having studied the archive’s contents, he said he had been surprised by the extent of le Carré’s research. “He was like an academic. He would go to the places he would be writing about and do fieldwork like an anthropologist or a sociologist. He would read extensively, interview people in the field, take notes – and then write it up as fiction. He would do it for all the novels, which is quite extraordinary.”In staging the exhibition, he wants to “pay homage to a person I admire very much”.John le Carré: Tradecraft opens at the Westonlibrary, Bodleianlibraries, on 1 October, running until 6 April 2026. An accompanying book, Tradecraft: Writers on John le Carré, will be released byBodleian Library Publishing.Explore more on these topicsJohn le CarréThrillersFictionExhibitionsOxfordEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The 1990s threw up some random highlights – Jeeves and Wooster, the ubiquitous Mr Bean – but the next decade was something of a sitcom wasteland until Derren Litten’s outrageously funny Benidorm pitched up. That was followed a mere six years later by Plebs (essentially: if The Inbetweeners were Romans) and job centre-based comedy The Job Lot, whose title’s feel of this-pun-dictated-the-entire-premise still causes me to break out in a cold sweat. Yet despite these shows being the broadcaster’s only notable contributions to the form this century, ITV comedy still feels like a distinctive subgenre, one defined by old-school story beats and all the edge of a bouncy ball.Into this decidedly unradical template struts Jordan Gray, the singer turned standup who in 2022 became the first transgender person to headline the London Palladium with her Edinburgh-award nominated hit showIs It A Bird?With her new sitcom, the 36-year-old provides the mainstream comedy mould with fresh fodder. We first encounter our hero, Liv, via a parody of one of those cheesy 00s razor adverts: a silky dressing gown is dropped; blades glide along already spotless shins and armpits – but then this classy babe begins shaving her face and urinating in the sink. The punchline? Her longsuffering housemate Tom (Thomas Gray) has been sitting on the toilet the whole time.From that point on, you suspect Transaction is honouring a sitcom style powered by an endless stream of silly, semi-predictable jokes and ludicrously contrived storylines in exchange for the chance to present a nuanced portrait of a transgender woman at a time when dehumanisation remains rife. Liv is charismatic and clever, but she is also lazy, workshy, irritating, jealous and selfish. These are all positives, by the way – anyone who thinks progressive representation in comedy involves nice characters being nice to each other all day long is sorely mistaken.Transaction’s major arc involves Tom’s employer, a supermarket called Pellocks, which has caused controversy by inadvertently plastering “lady boys get out” on a billboard. Obviously this isn’t remotely plausible, but such creaky plotting does give stressed-out, well-meaning boss Simon (Nick Frost) a reason to hire Liv – who he somehow knows is Tom’s flatmate – in an effort to quell the protest outside. Once she realises she can’t be fired (the optics would be terrible), Liv decides to be an awful employee. But she does disarm the indignant crowds with an irreverent speech. “When I told my dad I was becoming a woman,” she announces solemnly, “he said I could never pull it off. I said I’d probably get a doctor to do that bit, Father.”You could envisage a variation on this joke being told, wince-inducingly, by a blokey comic decades ago. Coming from Gray, it feels like snort-inducingly harmless fun. That said, walking the line between enlightened and unreconstructed humour is not always so straightforward. Liv’s other colleagues are conscientious Millie (the charming Francesca Mills), who has dwarfism, and “beefy Linda” (an impeccably deadpan Kayla Meikle), who is Black. When Liv declares that the trio resemble “the setup to a joke that would get you uninvited to Christmas dinner,” moments after delivering a duff quip about Millie’s height, it all starts to feel less bracingly modern.Yet there is something impressively sophisticated going on here, too. Liv refuses to pay Tom rent, claiming she’s saving up for “gender realignment” surgery. Tom is sceptical: “I thought you didn’t want a vagina? You said you were scared of a bee flying up in it.” Indeed, Liv is later horrified to discover Simon has started a fundraiser for said surgery. Transaction’s brashness doesn’t stop it discussing what has traditionally been one of the more delicate – and taboo – elements of the trans experience. Then again, Gray has long had something to say on this topic: her 2022 appearance on Channel 4’s Friday Night Live saw her play the piano with her penis, resulting in 1,500 Ofcom complaints.It’s part of a refreshing rebellion against the status quo offered by this show, but Transaction remains markedly retro overall: at its core, this is a broad comic caper about some unrealistically stupid people messing about in a supermarket. In later episodes, the narrative sprawls into generic workplace plotlines: crushes, rivalries, minor slapstick disasters. It’s a bit dull – not something you could ever say about Liv herself, whose humour is puerile but punchy and unexpected. Instead, I am left wondering what Gray might have made outside the confines of an old-fashioned sitcom on a channel that tries to crowd-please, but rarely manages to make history.Transaction is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyComedyTelevisionTransgenderreviewsShareReuse this content"

A masterpiece of folk horror, brimming with uncomfortable eeriness,The Wicker Manhas left a long and impressive legacy. There is more than a fighting chance this was scheduled to capitalise on the popularity of 28 Years Later.

But all this exists very close to far more troubling thoughts and feelings. A childhood fear of the dark has persisted into adulthood, and is linked to recurrent bouts of insomnia; her rational awareness of the dangers inherent in being a woman out of doors at night are augmented by a less easily definable anxiety at what the shadows might conceal; and darkness also functions as a painful and complicated metaphor for the frequently impenetrable world of her elderly father, who has frontal lobe dementia and often, the staff at his care home tell her, passes a “difficult” night.That last is a compact description, a kind of shorthand – easy to understand at surface level, but also vague; the nature of the difficulties, either for Muhammad Akbar or for the care home staff supporting him, is not revealed. His daughter’s book keeps returning to what happens under cover of darkness – what we fail to see, what we misinterpret, and what we allow to go unrecorded. For those who work at night, that will likely entail disturbed sleep patterns that, over time, have severe consequences for physical and mental health. Care workers, nightclub bouncers, transport staff, those in the hospitality industry, sex workers – all find themselves at risk of paying heavy penalties for their nocturnal lives.And yet if there is somethingunheimlichabout turning night into day, there is also significant potential for liberation and metamorphosis. Akbar’s narrative itself shifts from chronicling the negative impacts of sleep deprivation to the freedom of choosing to stay awake, as she recalls youthful late-night cinema trips with her sister Fauzia, whose life and premature death from undiagnosed tuberculosis Akbar described in her first book, Consumed, and the aimless night bus trips her brother, Tariq, took with his friends. They were each looking for escape, not merely from a home life that sometimes felt oppressive and unstable, but for anonymity, a chance to pass unnoticed amid crowds of strangers.That relationship with the night, and with the faintly transgressive sense of slipping into another realm, changes with context. The relaxed enjoyment that many women experienced as they took to the relatively unpeopled but more closely monitored open spaces of London during lockdown, for example, was radically changed whenSarah Everardwas abducted by a serving police officer on her lockdown walk home, and subsequently raped and killed; it is a terrible reminder that the real threat is not the ghouls or monsters of folklore, or the ghost of Jack the Ripper invoked on popular tours of Whitechapel, but “the very real hazard of murderously angry men”.Akbar also introduces us to the all-night light of Svalbard, and the exuberant singers, dancers and actors of Lahore’s after-hours theatre scene. But it is the book’s more abstract meditations that really capture the imagination. It is unsurprising that her love of sitting in an enclosed space watching players enact a drama is linked to the fantastical stories of djinns and dayaans that her parents used to tell. The night-time rambles that she still feels impelled to undertake mirror her father’s childhood walks around Shimla, excursions in which not only nostalgia but the trauma of emigration are embedded.The spectres that haunt our dreams and hypnagogic states are unreal, but they are also vivid manifestations of what troubles us, Akbar concludes. Acknowledging that is not a cure for the vulnerability that night ushers in, but it is a step towards allowing a little light into the darkness. This imaginative and empathetic book will probably not guide you to better sleep, but it will be a fine companion for the wakeful hours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The fence is secured with “Keep-Safes” – fingernails, Daughter’s first teeth, the umbilical cord that once joined them – to protect them from intruders. While their days are filled with chores, setting traps for rabbits and gathering firewood, every night they play a game they call “This-and-That”, in which they take it in turns to choose an activity – hair-brushing, dancing, copying – before saying their “sorrys and thank yous” in the bed they share.From the beginning of British author Rowe Irvin’s captivating debut novel, it is clear that Maya has created this life for herself and her daughter – who calls her mother “Myma” – as a refuge from the brutality of the world beyond the fence’s perimeter. Irvin’s tale switches between two narrative strands: present-day chapters narrated by Daughter, a naive, spirited girl who is as much woodland creature as she is person; and more distant sections detailing Maya’s rural upbringing with an alcoholic father and withdrawn mother, and the acts of male violence that led her to flee.Maya has taught Daughter only the words she needs for their existence, so although Daughter is 15, her language is childlike: “Sweat dries in the furry unders of my arms.” Later, Daughter is out in the woods: “Touch finger and thumb together now to make a circle for peering through. Move slow, pointing my seeing-hole at ground and tree and sky.” It’s a feat that Irvin maintains this playful, almost incantatory voice in all Daughter’s sections across these 300 pages.Maya tells Daughter that their rituals protect them against “Rotters”, people living beyond the fence, who are “empty on the inside … hollow”. If a Rotter were to intrude on their sanctuary, they would be eaten away like “gone-bad apples”. “Shudder with the thought of it,” Daughter thinks.But as the novel progresses, the manner in which Maya controls Daughter’s understanding of the world grows more frightening. When Daughter finds a glove in the woods – she thinks it is a “blue hand blanket”, and laughs at “the way the long fingers flap empty at the ends” – she takes it to show her mother, thinking it will make her laugh too. It doesn’t. “It came from a Rotter,” Maya says. “One must have got in during the dark and left it as a trick … You shouldn’t have touched it.” Later, she is warned against being too inquisitive when she meets Maya in the ash copse, a rope around her neck and a stump beneath her feet. Maya tells her: “If I step off my neck will snap and I’ll be dead … The questions you ask, she says then, they can do damage, Daughter”.Daughter only has more questions when she finds the Rotter who dropped the glove. The intruder, a man named Wyn, is the first human she has ever seen apart from Maya. Her mother rages against Wyn, until a strange force stops her killing him. Once Maya convinces Daughter she has “cut the Rot” from him, he is invited inside their dwelling, first roped-up and kept on the floor, and then given a seat at the table.More and more, Daughter questions Maya’s logic. How did Wyn get over the fence, with all their Keep-Safes? And why is it suddenly OK for them to be around a Rotter? Wyn’s outside perspective further reveals the extent to which the belief system they live by is simply Maya’s coping mechanism for personal trauma. We know she has created this world out of a desire to protect herself and her kin. But with her love, she has also been deceptive, sometimes cruel.In impish yet tender style, Irvin thoughtfully explores what it means for a mother to care for a daughter in a world where male violence is everywhere. Life Cycle of a Moth is the very best kind of fiction: with the book open, you feel utterly transported; once you close it, you see how cunningly it holds a mirror up to reality. I can’t wait to read whatever Irvin writes next.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That’s thanks in no small part to lead actor Toby Kebbell, who as ageing boxer and care-home worker Sal holds our attention with a loquacious naivety, despite having been around the block many times. Yakking his way in and out of various marital, family and felonious situations, Sal is a man fundamentally in negotiation with himself.Living in a trailer, Sal is first and foremost trying to salvage his relationship with his 14-year-old daughter Molly (Kíla Lord Cassidy), irritating his ex-wife Elaine (Elaine Cassidy) in the process. Despite his thickening waist, he’s still a force in the boxing ring; checking on his form one day is his childhood buddy and local gang leader Vince (Shia LaBeouf, with thick Irish brogue and a bleached top that causes one character to complain: “It’s hard to hear myself think over that fucking hairstyle.”) Vince asks Sal to referee the bare-knuckle boxing bouts he’s got going, but his Irish Traveller clientele won’t accept this local legend remaining a bystander.Scripted by Franklin, there’s a bagginess to Salvable as it traipses from Sal’s care work, his fumbling attempts to reconcile with Molly, and the criminal fringe; it hovers between ill-disciplined and authentic. But the performances tip it in favour of the latter: not just Kebbell’s, but also LaBeouf’s brisk grittiness, recalling his breakthrough role inNew York street drama A Guide to Recognising Your Saintsfrom 2006. The directors, meanwhile, are adept at using colour to emotionally tint Sal’s trip to nowhere: the forlorn shores and slate roofs of the unnamed Welsh coastal town are awash in cobalt blue, and a scene in which he bids farewell to one of his elderly patients is red-raw. Even if the skimpy detailing of Sal and Vince’s past leaves the finale verging on sentimentality, rather than fully exposing the self-inflicted wound it’s supposed to be, Salvable’s overall melancholic undertow is hard to resist.Salvable is available on digital platforms from 14 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBoxingShia LaBeoufreviewsShareReuse this content"

What’s coming next?Catherine BrayTue 8 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 09.56 EDTShareHere is a derivative but nicely put together sci-fi throwback, in which Inez Dahl Torhaug stars as Denise, a rebellious teenager in foster care whose father went missing in 1988. A dedicated ufologist for whom the truth was very much out there, Denise’s dad was trying to find aliens when he vanished. Alien abduction? Government cover up? Regular old disappeared-guy? When his old car falls from the sky into a local barn eight years later, Denise joins forces with her father’s friends at UFO-Sweden, including the likably nervous Lennart (Jesper Barkselius) plus assorted misfits, to investigate what leads they have, including the potential role of a shady-seeming organisation, the SMHI, AKA The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.You may gather from the names above that this is a Swedish film, and yet the dialogue is entirely in English. What gives? The unexpected twist is that the film is an early example of a technique that you can easily imagine becoming standard practice for streaming platforms hoping to reach multiple territories for minimal cost: AI-assisted dubbing. The original actors have re-recorded their lines and AI tech has been used to edit the visuals so that the lip movements from the original Swedish version match the new English dialogue. The technique is called “vlubbing” (visual + dubbing) and the target audience is seemingly the kind that won’t read subtitles or watch a traditional dub.The technique isn’t 100% perfect in every single frame, but it’s pretty close – if you didn’t know it had been applied, you probably wouldn’t clock it. But the ethics are murky. Will using the original actors be standard, or are we more likely to see famous voices taking over, as happens in animation? Or would it be too weird to hear Chris Pratt’s voice coming out of Jesper Barkselius’s face? What would it mean if and when documentaries start using it?In many ways this fairly nondescript film is the perfect vehicle for potentially dystopian tech: it’s under the radar, inauspicious and not likely to find itself widely watched. It’s in fact the film equivalent of the quiet suburban neighbourhood where an alien ship first lands in a flying saucer movie. At the moment vlubbing is under the radar, but this could be the start of an unstoppable invasion.Watch the Skies is in Showcase cinemas from 11 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsArtificial intelligence (AI)Drama filmsUFOsSwedenComputingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Or perhaps his target audience is really the gen X crowd that never outgrew its affection for 1980s fare such as Critters or Gremlins, cheap and cheesy schlock reliant on practical special effects. Luckily, the latter happens to be Kostanski’s speciality; he’s also worked as a prosthetic FX artist on bigger budget films such as Crimson Peak and the TV series Hannibal. All of that comes together for this daft comedy horror farrago, seemingly set in the 80s, about a nebbishy Canadian office worker called Conor (Conor Sweeney).Conor’s beige jumper alone bespeaks a man deeply risk averse and afraid of having fun, even when his marriage to Kristina (Kristy Wordsworth) is on the line. Stung by criticism from his pony-tailed boss (Adam Brooks) for one that his presentations on subdivisions lack “spice”, Conor calls a hotline advertising a nebulous but supposedly fun-enhancing service supplied by gremlin Frankie Freako (voiced by Matthew Kennedy). Frankie is effectively a puppet, less than a metre tall, who looks like someone dipped a Muppet in latex, covered it in caustic soda, and then ran a car over it a few times. The phone call enables him – and two less interesting, similarly ugly puppet creatures – to travel across dimensions to wreak havoc at Conor’s house, like the Cat in the Hat but without the feline charm or rhyme schemes, but way more fart jokes.At least Sweeney has good enough comic timing to make the thinly written dialogue sound vaguely amusing; he’s also adept at making his many reaction shots exaggerated just enough to tickle without descending into outright mugging. Elsewhere, the words “freak”, “freaky” and cognates from that root are used so often that a drinking game in which players down a shot each time they are uttered would trigger alcohol poisoning after 20 minutes or less.Frankie Freako is on digital platforms from 14 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

We once saw someone being chased with a machete at the back of the field by our school. In drama class, I remember a boy went into his bag to get his notebook out and a massive knife fell out. A boy in my brother’s year was stabbed over 10 times on a night out.”But despite the passing of more than two decades, Edmunds says not much has changed in the town – if anything, the rise of social media has made it worse. That’s why he’s brought his experiences to bear inThe Chaos That Has Been and Will No Doubt Return,a play about a stabbing at a house party that is based on true events.Now, to accompany the play’s tour, Edmunds and his Chalk Line theatre company are running a national outreach programme for knife crime intervention which they hope will reach more than 1,000 young people in the country, including in Bristol, London, Luton, Liverpool, Newcastle, Slough, Norwich, Exeter, Peterborough and Essex.“I wrote the play because I started reflecting on why a community might be surrounded by knife violence,” Edmunds says. “It’s an interrogation of the repression and suffocation in working-class communities like Luton, and the effect that has on young people. How when you have so much anger and nowhere to put it, and there are no schemes of protection for people, that can often breed violence.”View image in fullscreenAmaia Naima Aguinaga joins the other actors on stage. The play is designed to change the narrative and give hope.Photograph: PREdmunds worked with Beds Veru (the knife crime intervention unit in the Bedfordshire police) to develop the script with vulnerable young people in Luton. A section of the play is directly inspired by an “incredible” mother in Luton who lost her son to a stabbing – and later visited her son’s killer in jail to forgive him.“The worst thing about knife crime is it instils fear,” Edmunds says. “People carry knives because they want to protect themselves. But the play is trying to say that the moment you decide to carry a knife is the moment you are in danger. Because statistically, a person carrying a knife is actually more likely to be injured by it.”As part of the outreach programme, young people will be brought in to see the play in each town before workshopping the material with the help of a facilitator and a drama therapist. They will be asked to interrogate the themes of the play, like the moments the characters made the wrong decisions and the consequences of that.“Then we give them an opportunity to rewrite the ending. How do you prevent this from happening? We also have them improvise their way out of the situation.“It’s about empowering the young people, rather than lecturing them. It’s giving them a space to explore the events, so that if they ever experience something similar in real life, they can identify what’s happening and try to avoid it.”Knife-enabled crime in England and Waleshas risen by 80% over the past decade, and the number of teenagers that have been killed with a knife or a sharp objecthas gone up by 240%. In April, the Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, warned of a £450m funding gap andsaid rates of knife crime could risewithout more government backing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And so if I’m not out there on the streets, meeting these kids, trying to help them, then what am I doing really? I’m just making entertainment.”Edmunds’s play, co-directed by Vikesh Godhwani, ends with a note of hope. The character who is stabbed does not die, though their attacker is sent to prison and has an opportunity to express their remorse and wish that they had acted differently.“I didn’t want to perpetuate a story where this always ends tragically,” he says. “I think that story is really important to tell. That these people that kill are not necessarily people that are born this way. It comes from the environment you grow up in and the lack of support. But there is a world where this doesn’t have to happen.”The Chaos That Has Been and Will No Doubt Return is touringfrom 15 July to 27 November.Explore more on these topicsStageKnife crimeMetropolitan policeTheatreCrimeLutonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, Nintendo has seen fit to improve a heap of existing Nintendo Switch games on the shiny new system, both in the form of graphics-boosting free updates and more substantial paid reworks. The different options can be confusing, however, so here’s an explanation of how it all works.So what’s the difference when you play Switch games on Switch 2?Depending on how they were coded, some original Switch games simply run better on Switch 2 without any additional meddling from developers. Games with an uncapped frame rate – developers sometimes restrict this to help regulate performance – especially reap the benefits, especially if they chugged along on the original Switch. 2023’s brilliantBayonetta 3, for example, runs at 60fps on Switch 2, making it even more essential (though a resolution bump would be welcome, too). The Switch game thatconsumed more than 700 hours of my time, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, now loads into matches significantly faster.Animal Crossing: New Horizonsand Skyrim also see significantly reduced loading times, and the infamously sluggish Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity now runs at a locked, reliable frame rate.The ugly-as-sin Witcher 3 on Switch also benefits hugely, thanks to dynamic resolution scaling and uncapped frame rate, transforming this once blurry mess into something sharper, smoother and infinitely more playable. Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Arkham Knight and Wolfenstein 2 also see similarly improved resolution and performance.Which games have gotfree Switch 2 upgrades so far?Switch 2 owners now have the benefit of high dynamic range (HDR) support, as well as more TV-friendly resolutions (up to 4K). A wealth of beloved Nintendo-made Switch games have received free updates for Switch 2, helping them take advantage of the new hardware.First up, we have the smaller updates to less notable titles. In a bid to making multiplayer easier, there have been free updates to both Nintendo’s boardgame collectionClubhouseGamesandBig Brain Academy,adding the handy Gameshare feature – allowing you to play multiplayer with other people who don’t already own the game – as well as niche titles likeGameBuilder GarageandTamagotchi Plazagetting Joy-Con mouse support. Read on below for the more substantial free updates awaiting you on Switch 2.Pokémon Scarlet/VioletView image in fullscreenPaldea feels more lived-in on Switch 2 … Pokémon Scarlet.Photograph: NintendoOne of the most infamously poorly performing games on Switch was 2022’sPokémon Scarlet/Violet. While its free-form open world approach to questing impressed, terrible frame rate, ugly textures and an eye-strainingly inconsistent resolution tarnished the core experience. Thankfully, developer Game Freak has attempted to make things right on Switch 2. These games have seen a night and day improvement to frame rate, transforming barely moving windmills in the distance and slideshow-esque movement of hordes of Pokémon into the smooth motion you’d expect. The resolutions are noticeably higher too, with characters and Pokémon looking sharper, especially when you’re playing in handheld mode. Roaming the region’s vast locales on Switch 2, there are also more Pokémon scuttling around, making Paldea feel more lived-in. While there is sadly no HDR implantation and the original shonky texture work remains, the graphical and performance improvements are more than enough to make these Paldean adventures feel complete on Switch 2.Super Mario OdysseyNintendo has wisely opted to future-proof thebest 3D Mario yet made, doubling the game’s resolution to 1800p docked along with fully implemented HDR. Odyssey has always boasted impeccable art direction, and now Mario’s planet-hopping capers shine that bit brighter, the red dunes of the Sand Kingdom glistening in the distance and the roaring T rex’s fangs looking sharper than ever. The frame rate is now consistently higher, too, meaning that each jump and spin feels even snappier. Gameshare support has also been added, allowing a second player to hop in to join you as Cappy on a second Switch.The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Echoes of WisdomView image in fullscreenPolished performance … The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of WisdomPhotograph: NintendoWhile both of the cutesy Switch Zeldas always had their charms, one of them certainly wasn’t their performance. Stuttering and stalling worse than a 1970s car, the patchy frame rate often let down what was otherwise a charming experience. Good news for Switch 2 owners, then – Nintendo has polished both up dramatically. Now rendered in crisp 4K TV-friendly resolution, sporting full HDR support and yes – running at a solid 60fps – both of these Grezzo-developed Zeldas leap off the screen with new life. If, like me, you put down Echoes of Wisdom last year due to performance issues, now’s the time to experience both it and Link’s Awakening at their very best.NewSuper MarioBros UWhile last year’s Super Mario Wonder has undoubtedly stolen its thunder, Nintendo has opted to give the Wii U’s 2D Mario an extra bit of spit and polish on Switch 2 regardless. With improved resolutions, frame rates and – you guessed it – HDR implementation, this love-it-or-hate Mario sidescroller has never looked better.ARMSView image in fullscreenMore precise movement … ARMSPhotograph: NintendoRemember ARMS? The springy-limbed motion controlled fighting game that launched just after the original Switch? Much to everyone outside Nintendo’s surprise, it’s been shown some love eight years after release. Criminally underrated at the time, the motion-controlled melee now has more precise movement, enabling your blows to pummel their intended target with more subtle movements. Four-player local multiplayer now runs perfectly, a setup that would cause the original Switch to slow to a fun-ruining crawl. While its divisive controls mean it still won’t be for everyone, ARMS always featured wonderfully charming character designs, and now its endearingly cartoony world feels new again.Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s FuryAnother Wii U classic gets an upgrade: this multiplayer Mario magic has now sprinted and leapt its way on to a third Nintendo console. On Switch 2, 3D World benefits from an improved frame rate and the expected resolution bump, and Bowser’s Fury gets the same 4K-TV-worthy upgrades along with full HDR support.Captain Toad: Treasure TrackerAlso making its way on to its third Nintendo console in 11 years, this charming, slow-paced puzzle adventure now sparkles thanks to HDR implementation and a resolution bump in both docked and handheld modes. For those who want to bring a pal along for the ride, Treasure Tracker now also has GameShare support.Splatoon 3View image in fullscreenDesigner splatting … Splatoon 3Photograph: NintendoThe Shibuya-chic squidlings of Splatoon were originally born on Wii U, but Nintendo’s futuristic paintball shooter has evolved a lot since then. It has always been bright and colourful, but its streetwear cool was marred by the vaseline-esque blur of lower resolutions. No more: now rendered in full 4K on Switch 2,Splatoon 3’s ink-splatted dystopia shines with delightful detail. Whether you’re taking down bosses in the surprisingly excellent single-player campaign or splatting strangers in online Turf War matches, Splatoon’s slick character designs boast a new found richness. Splatoon 3 on Switch 2 feels like a whole new game – if you missed it the first time around, there’s never been a fresher way to play.What about the paid Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades?Unlike the free updates detailed above, Switch 2 Editions are old games that have been scrubbed up and resold, often packed with additional content. Nintendo charges anywhere from £7.99 to £16.99 to upgrade a Switch game to a Switch 2 edition, and players who don’t own the original game can also simply buy the Switch 2 Edition outright for £60-£70. Subscribers to Nintendo’s online service get some of these upgrades for free.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the KingdomView image in fullscreenFinally has the horsepower to shine … The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.Photograph: NintendoWhen it comes to all-time launch games, it’s hard to beat Breath of the Wild. Sensibly then, Nintendo hasn’t tried, simply opting to spruce up the best Zelda and its sequel instead. Some of the best open-world games ever made, these lovingly restored titles finally have the horsepower behind them to let their enchanting art style shine. Hyrule’s painterly plains pop with a new found richness. Areas where the Switch struggled like, Kokoro forest, no longer feel like sprinting through treacle, and high res textures along with 4K and HDR support highlight new details in areas that I’ve already explored for hours. Tears of the Kingdom especially benefits. HDR illuminates the murky darkness of the depths. Sky islands shine with a pleasing sunkissed warmth. There is also a new Zelda Notes app, which functions as part GPS, part ticklist, allowing you to track down whatever secrets you’ve yet to find in either game. Both editions are free with aNintendo SwitchOnline subscription, or you can upgrade from Switch 1 for £7.99 each.No Man’s SkyThe creation of Hello Games, No Man’s Sky launched to much controversy nine years ago, and has since gone on to become the interstellar exploration sim of gamer’s dreams. When it was ported to the original Switch in 2022, it was functional but not much to get excited about. On Switch 2 however, No Man’s Sky has had a radical overhaul, looking and playing like a brand-new game. Running at 1440p docked and 1080p in handheld, HDR helps the otherworldly colour palettes of each strange new planet and its inhabitants to ooze vividly. It runs flawlessly, too, immersing you fully in its melancholic sci-fi. The best part? Hello Games has opted to offer this Switch 2 Edition upgrade to Switch 1 players, gratis.FortniteView image in fullscreenA much-needed glow-up … Fortnite on Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: Epic GamesThe globe-conquering battle royale always felt a bit hampered on Nintendo’s ageing console, and now, developer Epic Games has given it a much-needed glow-up. Running at a silky smooth 60fps and rendered in far higher resolutions, Fortnite on Switch 2 also supports higher quality textures and vastly improved draw distances alongside the resolution bump – helping you to see distant objects and aim at other players more precisely. There is, of course, now GameChat support too, along with mouse controls for those looking to infuriate everyone else playing with analogue sticks on Switch.Super Mario Party Jamboree TV – coming 24JulyOne of the more substantial Switch 2 Edition upgrades comes in the form of Super Mario Party Jamboree TV. As well as your expected resolution bumps, this package adds a plethora of new ways to party. First up is the PlayStation EyeToy-esque Bowser Live mode, which has players flailing about to complete mini games via the Switch 2’s camera peripheral. Then there’s the titular Jamboree TV, which shows players’ faces on to the gamescreen alongside all-new microphone and camera-based experiences, alongside the brand new mouse-controlled Carnival Coaster mode. This upgrade will set owners of 2024’s Super Mario Party Jamboree back an additional £16.99.Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World – coming 28AugustTaking a leaf out of the book of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, this Switch 2 edition of Kirby and the Forgotten Land features an all-new story-led expansion. This all-new adventure sees our squishy hero attempting to save his friends from a newly crystallised world, as you leap, swallow and battle your way across new levels. Both Star-Crossed World and the original will also offer increased resolution and improved frame rates, with this Switch 2 Edition upgrade also costing £16.99.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo Switch 2Nintendo SwitchGame playNintendoAction gamesAdventure gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The unusually luminous light green leaves of the beech trees? “That’s due to the lack of magnesium in the chalky soil.” The 18 species of wild orchid that grow here? “That’s the high calcium content. You see? Everything is connected.”That’s a phrase my companion and I kept hearing at Møns Klint on the Danish island of Møn. This four-mile (6km) stretch of chalk cliffs and hills topped by a 700-hectare (1,730-acre) forest was fashioned by huge glaciers during the last ice age, creating a unique landscape. In 2026, a Unesco committee will decide whether Møns Klint (“the cliffs of Møn”) should be awarded world heritage site status, safeguarding it for future generations.Møns Klint mapUsing Interrail passes, we took the train from London to Vordingborg (Møn’s nearest railway station) via the Eurostar, with overnight breaks in Cologne going out and Odense, Denmark’s third-largest city, coming back. There’s an efficient bus service both from Vordingborg station to Møn (over an impressive bridge) and on the island itself but, for maximum flexibility, we hiredelectric bikesin Stege. About 12 miles from Møns Klint, Stege has been Møn’s main town since early medieval times. Home to impressive ancient ramparts and abijou museum, it’s a good place to stock up since most of the island’s shops are found on the winding high street.Our night-time guide walked us into the darkened forest and interpreted the cries of tawny owls and scampering noises in the undergrowthOne wind-and-battery-assisted pedal to Møns Klint later and Michael was taking us about 500 steps down to the beach, the scene of cliff collapses so immense that the spoil sometimes forms peninsulas sticking out a quarter of a mile into the sea. Besides being a cartographer’s nightmare, the slowly dissolving chalk also turns the water by the shore a milky white, giving it a distinctly Mediterranean flavour. Almost every stone we picked up was a 30m-year-old fossil of some sort – Michael identified squid, sea sponges, sea urchins and oysters.Another day we spent meandering along Klintekongens Rige, the longest of Møns Klint’s nine waymarked footpaths. The nine-mile circular trail sent us up and down and up and down through the forest; into the 18th-century “romantic gardens” of Liselund, where the bass-heavy croaking of glistening frogs contrasted with soprano peacocks; and down to a long stretch of beach for a mini adventure clambering over fallen trees and mounds of tumbled rock while the Baltic Sea lapped almost up to the cliff face.View image in fullscreenPaddleboarding with KesiaWhen the sun went down we met up withnight-time guide Susanne, who walked us into the darkened forest and interpreted the cries of tawny owls and scampering noises in the undergrowth (the owls’ potential dinner). The islands of Møn and Nyord form Scandinavia’s firstDark Sky Park, so we were able to gaze up at a panoply of stars while Susanne made us one of the tastiest gin and tonics we’d ever drunk, with mint from her garden and a wild rose syrup from petals she’d foraged that day.The next morning, we explored the area’smountain bike trailswith Uffe, a guide, like Michael, from theGeoCenter, the local interpretive museum (where an exhibition on biodiversity is appropriately called “Everything is connected”). Along the way, he pointed out splendid displays of lady orchids and a herd of goats whose grazing improves biodiversity. Then, having barely broken a sweat, we suddenly found ourselves out of the woods and atop Denmark’s eighth-highest peak. Aborrebjerg is a humble 143m high, but still provided us with panoramic views across Møn and the shimmering sea. Later, we took to the water on a paddleboarding tour from the village of Klintholm Havn with Kesia fromMøn Surf, appreciating the grandeur of the mighty chalk cliffs from another angle.We explored Møn’s mostly flat countryside on electric bikes. A cycle path runs parallel to the one main road, and the smaller roads were car-freeAt night, we slept in a modern and stylish apartment at the nearby Villa Huno – an eco-build with a living roof and a view over a peaceful lake. We strolled around it one evening, stumbling across a woodpecker guarding the remains of a medieval fort, before enjoying a tasty dinner in Koral, Villa Huno’s summer-only restaurant. After a couple of nights we switched to a well-appointed bell tent next door at Camp Møns Klint. Then, as a base for exploring the island of Møn further, we pedalled west to Ellevilde boutique hotel. New owners Kirstine and Kenneth recently moved down from Copenhagen, leaving their highly regarded Restaurant 56 Degrees. Kenneth’s small plates blew us away – imagine a Danish Ottolenghi – with many ingredients from the garden or neighbouring farms. The sweet pickled onion and rhubarb salad, and the wonderfully crisp herby flat breads that accompanied a gazpacho, will live long in the memory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A cycle path runs parallel to the island’s main road, and all the smaller roads we used were essentially car-free, which made for a very relaxing experience. We raced hares along hedges; marvelled at some wonderfully eccentric medieval frescos in Elmelunde church; bought ceramics from a friendly potter calledJacob; and stopped off at little flea markets in islanders’ front gardens.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s smallest museum is on the tiny island of Nyord.Photograph: Suzy DixonCrossing the wind-blown bridge on to the tiny island of Nyord (population 35), we watched lapwings at play and visitedDenmark’s smallest museum. Not much larger than a telephone kiosk, it is a former lookout shelter that tells the stories of those who guided boats through the perilous straits nearby.In Nyord’s only village, also Nyord, we dropped intoNoorbohandelenfor some rum mustard, one of the many flavoured varieties that are a local speciality. We admired their aesthetically satisfying shelves of bottles filled with all manner of colourful spirits made on the premises, before lunching alfresco at their cafe on a correspondingly colourful salad, as swallows tore joyfully about the sky above our heads.The trip was provided bysouthzealand-mon.com,with travelprovided byInterrail.

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 8 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 8 Jul 2025 18.51 EDTShareMy veggie burgers are so often underwhelming, or they simply fall apart. Where am I going wrong?Beth, Newark“Veggie burgers are often lacking in everything that’s good about food,” says Melissa Hemsley, author ofReal Healthy, and for her, that means texture, flavour and satisfaction. “They also tend not to have those key flavour highs – the fat, the salt – that you’re after from a homemade version.”For Lukas Volger, author ofVeggie Burgers Every Which Way, texture is by far the complaint he hears most often: “The patty is too moist, and glops out of the other side of the bun when you bite into it.” Veggie burgers often behave like this, Volger says, because vegetables contain water, so you’ll either need to cook the veg in advance or add something to the mix to soak it up, whether that’s breadcrumbs or grains. And remember, size isn’t everything: “I used to love the look of a thick, substantial burger,” Volger says, “but I’ve come to realise that they function much better on a bun when they’re thin and seared until crisp on each side in a hot pan,smash burger-style.” (Alternatively, bake in a moderate oven to “help them dry out a little” before grilling.) This will also help if you’ve ever fallen victim to burgers falling through those barbecue grates.Volger’s burger vision often starts by giving a vegetable “a point of view”, which is to say a flavour pairing: carrot with almond, say, sweet potato with sesame, or kale with ginger. He builds from there with spices, fresh herbs, a flavour bomb (think miso or harissa) or nut butter, plus “something to provide body”. For Hemsley, that might mean chickpea flour (“it’s cheap and naturally gluten-free), an egg (“that’s always good”), or beans or lentils, although the latter will need “bags of flavour” to keep the burgers from being boring. “That’s whyBold Beansare so good,” Hemsley adds, “because their beans have a lovely, salty brine.”On to the specifics, and Hemsley always flips out over a black bean and feta number: “It’s one of my favourite burgers ever, and I’d happily eat it instead of a meat one any day of the week.” Her patty also has onions and grated garlic in there, plus dried oregano or thyme, sun-dried tomatoes (“for juiciness, flavour and salt”), and jalapeños (“for the brininess and hit of chilli”). “I usually add an egg, too, to up the protein. I hate to be that person who talks about protein, but I do think it helps keep you sated.” As a bonus, these burgers freeze well, too, and Hemsley often turns the base mix into meatballs to eat with tomato sauce and couscous or rice.Volger, meanwhile, is “very into”a grated halloumi burger, for which the cheese is stirred into softened onions with garlic and harissa, then combined with beaten egg, panko breadcrumbs, minced herbs (parsley, coriander, mint, dill) and cornflour. “My next plan is to make a red lentil and sweet potato Thai red curry burger,” Hemsley says, “so hold the front page.” She’s planning on serving thatwith a coriander, mint and coconut chutney, which is a good lesson never, ever to forget the importance of your burger accoutrements. As Volger puts it: “A slice of cheese and a mess of burger condiments can salvage most veggie burgers.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Food styling assistant: Georgia Rudd.SoupJosé Pizarro’s recipe for courgette and almond gazpachoAn authentic alternative gazpacho with rustic appeal, a powerful flavour mix – and not a tomato in sightJosé PizarroTue 8 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareGazpacho has been part of Spanish kitchens for centuries. Long before tomatoes arrived from the Americas, it was made with bread, garlic, olive oil and almonds, which have always been part of our food culture. It began as field food, crushed by hand in mortars and eaten by workers under the sun with nothing but stale bread and whatever else they had to hand alongside. No blenders, no chill time, just instinct and hunger. This version, with courgette and basil, goes back to that idea: take what’s around you and make something good out of it. Simple roots, but full of life.Courgette and almond gazpachoPrep5 minSteep10 min+Cook10 minChill1 hr+Serves4-62 medium courgettes½ cucumberSea salt and black pepper80g stale white bread75ml whole milk100g toasted marcona almonds1 garlic clove, peeled2 tsp sherry vinegar1 handful basil leaves, plus extra to garnishExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishCoarsely grate the courgettes and cucumber into a large bowl, sprinkle with sea salt, then tip into a sieve, set it over the bowl and leave to steep for a good 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, break up the bread into a medium bowl, add the milk and leave to soak.Squeeze out any excess liquid from the salted courgette and cucumber mix, then tip them into a blender. Add the soaked bread and any milk it hasn’t soaked up, then add the almonds, garlic, vinegar and 500ml cold water. Blitz smooth, then taste to check the seasoning – you shouldn’t need any extra salt, but a touch of ground black pepper may be in order. Add the basil leaves and blitz again.Pour the soup into a large jug or bowl, then cover and chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Once chilled, check the consistency of the soup – if you feel it’s a bit too thick, add up to 200ml more cold water, to loosen.Ladle into bowls, top with a good drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a grind or two of black pepper, finish with a scattering of extra basil leaves and serve.Explore more on these topicsSoupSpanish food and drinkFoodSummer food and drinkVegetablesVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
